<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you can see this message in settings. For example, a third-party antivirus can also control some of the setting in a computer. An organization might also be the reason why, especially if there's a main computer that's managing
 yours. However, can you provide the answers to these questions for us to isolate your concern:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the message started to show show up?</li><li>Were there any changes made on your computer (e.g., updates, software installation)?</li><li>Which version of Windows 10 are you using (e.g., Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Creators Update)?</li><li>Have you tried the steps on the link that was provided by Xylee Del on April 26, 2017? If yes, what is the result?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<h3> matteo cabassi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot write files from the PC to an SD card on my camera via USB</h2>
                    <p>I have (another) odd issue which occurs only after the upgrade from Win7 to Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was initially affected by the issue described in </p>
<span>
<span>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-wont-access-memory-card-on-nikon-d90/07618b82-7bae-4ae3-a0c3-cef886142dbe, but this has been resolved by a patch available via Windows Update. Now the problem is the following:</p>
<p>I am able to download all pictures from the SD card located in my camera and connected via USB cable to my PC,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">and I am also able to delete the files, </span>
<strong>BUT</strong> I am no longer able to write anything from my PC to the SD card. I am not able to create a new folder, or to copy a file. This was possible in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I remove the SD from the camera, and put it on the card reader of my wifi printer, I have exactly the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to search for similar problems, but was unable to find this one, for which the very odd thing is that, as I wrote above, it is possible to remove files, but not to copy new ones!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help, thank you!</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Won&#39;t connect to internet or factory reset</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My surface pro 3 will not connect to the internet. It picks up my wifi but says no internet access--although all my other devices can connect. I did troubleshooting on it and it said there was an issue with an access port that couldn't be resolved. I then
 tried to factory reset it and it won't allow that either. Any suggestions before I just dump it? Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for raising your concern.</span><span>Regarding the issue that you have if the Surface device will not connect to the WIFI&nbsp;and other device in the house work fine on same network. It’s&nbsp;most likely the Network driver is
 not working properly or this is already a network drop issue on the Surface device.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p><span><span>I would like to know when this issue happen?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would like to know did you find any error message like 0x....&nbsp; when you try to connect to your WIFI?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would like to know if the Time and date is same with your time zone. If not please correct the time and date.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would like to know if you already try to refresh your network driver under device manager.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p><span><span>By the way, when you refresh the Network driver please do this steps.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p><span><span>To refresh the Surface network driver, we need to go to Device Manager. Go to the desktop, tap and hold on the start icon for 2 to 3 seconds release and you will see a list. Tap on device manager. On Device Manager you will see lists of drivers
 installed and connected with the Surface. From the driver list you will see "network adapters". Tap or click on the arrow beside that and check the dropdown list and then right click on Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-N Network controller . Click on uninstall but
 don't click on the box to delete. Restart the Surface after.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p><span><span>Once your Surface is back to the desktop screen, try to connect again to your network, and check if all working good now. Once you connect to the WIFI can also run our Surface diagnostic tools

<p>
<span>
</span></p><p><span><span>Regarding the issue that you cannot reset back to factory default its most likely cause by the image save on the Surface device is corrupted. May I know what error message did get when you try to reset the Surface device.
 Is the Surface device asking for a bit locker key? If the Surface device asking for a bit locker key. you can open a any browser then type

<div>(with a different Windows computer if yours is not working properly)&nbsp; </div>
<div>and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick</div>

<div>Give the volume a name like surfboot.</div>
<div>Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>

<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the</div>

    <title>Computer not recognizing Projector after installing Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnmusila  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer not recognizing Projector after installing Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently upgraded from Windows 7 ultimate to Windows 10. Initially I did not have a problem with my Epson vs230 projector, it was working well, plug and play. But after the upgrade, it seems some of the drivers, such as those of the Epson vs230 were deleted,
 or they were incompatible with Windows 10. Is there a way to get my projector working? Because even the computer doesn't seem to recognize the device, or see it as a device that needs to be added. Am using a HP Pavilion Entertainment PC Laptop. Any assistance
 will be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Marvella,<br />
<br />
This concern can occur if a Windows High Contrast theme is applied to the machine or you recently change the screen resolution. There are ways on how to remove the High Contrast theme, right click the desktop background and go to Personalize. Select a theme
 that does not contain <strong>High Contrast</strong> in the title.<br />
<br />
You can also change the color of the app by Selecting the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>button, then select<span>
</span><strong>Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span> </span><strong>Personalization</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<strong>Colors</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>to choose your Windows palette—or let Windows do the work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have Windows pull an accent color from your background, choose from a list of accent colors, or select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Custom color<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>to fine-tune your own personal hue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmsegceporticoprodassets.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f28681_en_4" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After you've selected an accent color, decide where you want to see it show up and whether it looks better in a dark or light setting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmsegceporticoprodassets.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f28682_en_3" /></p>

            <p>There is no explicit limit for length. But try not to overwhelm Movie Maker with too many clips. It's more about complexity rather than length.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find you are getting a project that looks too complex (lots of clips, lots of trims/splits, etc.) then try breaking the movie into several projects. I'd choose something like a 15 minute limit per project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end, you can render each of those as separate movies and then create a final new project where you join them together into a complete longer movie.</p>

<p>I found 1 Windows driver here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_support_downloads.asp?id=632&amp;os=w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_support_downloads.asp?id=632&amp;os=w</a>&nbsp;. Its for Windows XP, so you'll have to run it in compatibility mode for XP, but that will hopefully work for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>Hi bavarianx5,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can change the size or resolution of a digital picture by changing:<br />
1. The number of pixels.<br />
2. The file size.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To resize the picture, try these steps.<br />
1. Open Windows Photo Gallery by clicking the Start button, clicking All Programs, and then clicking Windows Photo Gallery.
<br />
2. Click the picture that you want to send in e‑mail. <br />
To e‑mail more than one picture, hold down the CTRL key while you click the other pictures you want.<br />
3. On the toolbar, click e‑mail.<br />
4. In the Attach Pictures and Files dialog box, select a picture size from the Picture size list, and then click Attach.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows will automatically resize the picture and attach it to an e‑mail message.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For more information see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/What-if-my-picture-is-too-large-to-send-in-e-mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What if my picture is too large to send in e‑mail?</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reduce the number of pixels so that a picture can be sent to another person in an e‑mail message, see

    <title>Very Perplexing Issues Connecting to XBL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unknownmonkey26  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very Perplexing Issues Connecting to XBL</h2>
                    
<p>I have been attempting to connect my xbox 360 to XBL, but have been unsuccessful thus far.&nbsp; I am hoping that I am not reposting another thread.&nbsp; I did a brief search/scan, and was not able to find anything that completely matched my situation, but it wasn't
 the most thourough search.&nbsp; So if there is another thread out there, be sure to link me to it. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, the situation that I get is my 360 will connect to my home network, and will connect to the internet, but it won't connect completly to XBL.&nbsp; The first time I attempt to connect after turning on my machine is the NAT warning.&nbsp; I then check my settings,
 and everything checks out the way that support.xbox.com suggests, and then I restart the test.&nbsp; It then loses the connection completely, referring me to check with my ISP.&nbsp; (It still connects to the home network and internet, but not XBL)&nbsp; I have followed
 suggestions both from the machine itself, and the support.xbox.com page, but neither has gotten me any results.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked with my ISP, and they assure me that they have nothing on their end, and cannot see anything that would prevent me from connecting.&nbsp; They told me to verify that I've already got the appropriate ports opened an enabled, and they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another detail that is worth noting, to get my machine to even connect to the internet, I had to manually assin the IP address on the machine, as well as the DNS address.&nbsp; The xbox wouldn't do it automatically on its own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that I've got the situation described properly.&nbsp; Below I'll explain the setup of my network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use a wireless broadband service, so there is a sattelite dish like receiver on the roof.&nbsp; It essentially works as the modem.&nbsp; It is then connected to a Linksys Phone Adapter w/Router (model number: SPA 102).&nbsp; I use the same company to do phone service.&nbsp;
 After going to that, the next step is a&nbsp; Belkin Wireless N1 router.&nbsp; (Model number R5D8231-4 v.3000).&nbsp; I have one computer upstairs wired directly to the router.&nbsp; I have another computer that links up to the router Wirelessly, and that is the computer I do
 most stuff on, including typing this page.&nbsp; Both computers run Windows 7 &amp; work fine with the internet, and have great connection speeds.&nbsp; No problems at all.&nbsp; I connect the Xbox 360 to the network wirelessly, using WPA2-Psk encryption.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully that all makes sense, and I have enough details.&nbsp; I can certainly get any more info that is needed.</p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have recently bought a new Laptop with Windows 8 and I have a problem with special characters. Since I write in different languages, I have my keyboard set to Spanish and insert all special characters with Alt + the ASCII code. But for some reason, that
 is not working now (I've tried on different programs, such as Word, Google Chrome, Adobe InDesign etc.).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I get this to work??</div>

</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for any answers.</div>

            I'll leave the answer as to what keys to use to the experts, but in the meanwhile you have Character Map which you can use.&nbsp; It's found in Accessories/System Tools or on the Start Screen simply type Character Map and you'll see it pop-up above.

<h2>            The pipe state is invalid.</h2>
                    I tried accessing my network this AM and couldn't.&nbsp; In the past I've solved this by a System Restore.&nbsp; This time it wouldn't work and gave me a message:<br />
<br />
"C:\Windows|System3rstrvi.exe"&nbsp; "The pipe state is invalid".&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have a Belarc analysys program that makes a read out of the hardware and software and notes any Security fixes needed.&nbsp; There are six on this computer and when I tried to download from Microsoft the resonse is:<br />
<br />
"The website has encountered a problem and cannot display the page you are trying to view. The options provided below might help you solve the problem."<br />
<br />
I have the OneCare service from Microsoft&nbsp;and it reads that it is up to date.&nbsp; So other than reinstalling the OS I am perplexed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?&nbsp;

            Hi gb120050,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />
<br />
It look like there's not an easy fix for this problem since it is&nbsp;somewhat general.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms837754.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms837754.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Is the application failed is "C:\Windows\System32\rstrui.exe"? I need you to confirm this with us.&nbsp; Rstrui.exe is Windows System Restore files.&nbsp; This might be why you are unable to perform System Restore to repair the problem.<br />
You might want to try locating the file on your system, Right Click, Select Properties.&nbsp; Click on Previous Version tab.&nbsp; Choose a date before the problem happened and say Ok to restore it back to that day.<br />
Perform System Restore again after revert the file back to previous version to see if it work.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Let us know if this work out for you,

<h2>            Windows Update Error 8007370B in Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    Hi&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am getting the above error when using Windows Update and am also unable to install updates for other software like Adobe Reader, Flash or Java. &nbsp;I have tried the Fix It tool, and the System Update Readiness Tool, to no effect. &nbsp;I suspect it may be to
 do with a virus as there was one on the computer a while ago but the problem actually started when I uninstalled some bits of free trial software that the computer came with, possibly including an antivirus trial. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I suspect the answer may be similar to here:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_update/error-code-8007370b-and-8007371c/a80cc923-1fd5-47f5-a79d-bcc7cc17f684</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and a system format is required, however that is a different version of Windows, so am unsure if this information still applies.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks for reading</div>

            <p>Your computer is an Acer Aspire 5738. Is it the original 5738 or a variant? The BIOS predates those listed for the original 5738 so it suggests it is an extremely early model. The Windows 7 operating system has not been updated to SP1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problems lies with the Windows Modules Installer. The best solution is likely to be to reinstall the operating system and rebuild your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you acquire the computer new? Do you have data files on the computer you wish to retain?</p>

            <p>Sure. You can create a desktop shortcut with the following target:</p>
<p>
</p><p>explorer shell:desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can even implement it in the right-click menu. So when you right-click the desktop you get the "Explore here" option. Here is the REG file for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\DesktopBackground\Shell\&amp;Explore]</strong><br />
<strong>@="Explore Here"</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\DesktopBackground\Shell\&amp;Explore\command]</strong><br />
<strong>@="explorer.exe shell:desktop"</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the above contents (the lines in bold letters) to Notepad, and save with .REG extension.</p>
<p>Double-click the file to run it.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never mind. &nbsp;I solved my problem after discovering&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/surface-wont-turn-on-or-wake-from-sleep?os=windows-10; the two-button trick, lucky for me that I own a Surface Pro 3.</p>

    <title>Disappearing Tiles, Windows 8 Detected a Problem... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disappearing Tiles, Windows 8 Detected a Problem...</h2>
                    <p>Last week I decided to install the available updates in Windows Update after turning off automatic updates.&nbsp; Windows 8 has been running okay lately where it has not had many crashes and errors.&nbsp; The updates installed in Windows 8 Pro and now Windows 8 runs
 unstable and keeps showing the Windows has detected a problem and the only option available is to restart Windows.&nbsp; After several restarts of Windows 8, eventually Windows 8 will run for a while until it shows another problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Windows 8 Pro does run, the Modern UI Start Menu shows NO TILES.&nbsp; If I press the Windows Key to toggle to the Desktop mode, the Tiles quickly flash on the system.&nbsp; I cannot get any of the Start Menu tiles to show.&nbsp; Restarting Windows 8 does not fix
 this problem.&nbsp; Luckily in Windows 8 Desktop mode I created a shortcut to the "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs" path to have a Start Programs toolbar to access the installed programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in Windows 8 Modern UI when I press Windows Key + Q for the search, the search never finds anything that I enter in for the criteria.&nbsp; I tried searching for installed programs and other files, etc., nothing ever shows for the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Control Panel &gt; Windows Defender, I updated Defender and ran a full scan on the system.&nbsp; No infections were found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have searched using Google and Bing for a variety of keywords or phrases that may provide some insight to these problems, nothing was found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know if I call either Microsoft or ASUS Support, they will tell me to run a Refresh or Reset in Windows 8.&nbsp; I have already used these two options to reinstall Windows 8 on this laptop numerous times in the past two months.&nbsp; I practically cannot use this
 new laptop with Windows 8 Pro on it as for the continuing and ongoing Windows 8 problems.&nbsp; Wireless network connectivity issues continue to occur and with these other problems, I have really not used this new laptop for doing my daily tasks.&nbsp; I have another
 laptop running Linux Mint 14.1 and I am doing more on that Linux system than Windows 8, and Linux also runs the few Windows programs I need to run.&nbsp; It seems Linux Mint is coming my primary operating system, however, I need to use Windows as I normally do
 more daily tasks in Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help on these problems would be appreciated.&nbsp; Please do not provide canned responses and ridiculous suggestions (in e-mail) that do not apply to these problems.&nbsp; I do not read those messages that "I am from ... " some support center "... and I fully
 understand your problem ..." where the rest of the e-mail has absolutely nothing to do with the problem(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />

            <p>After talking to Microsoft Support and ASUS Support, which the ASUS Support rep was very clueless as he kept telling me to click on the START button in the lower left corner, the end result is to run a Windows 8 Reset to see if the Tiles on the Start menu
 come back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Support also suggested installing a fresh retail copy of Windows 8 as the manufacturer's pre-installed version may be flawed.&nbsp; Well, of the operating system flawed, that would be Microsoft's fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all of these years of using Microsoft products, which I started back on MS-DOS 1.0 to date, the support from Microsoft is ultimately the worst ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note to Microsoft Support reps that have some logic in thinking... you cannot use any screen as&nbsp;a touch screen.&nbsp; Not ALL laptops are touch screen.&nbsp; Disconnecting the wireless mouse does not automatically enable a touch screen.&nbsp; The laptop that I have is
 NOT a touch screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I am very frustrated and I am extremely aggravated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I at least expect to either find a solution to the problem or provide logical possible solutions or workarounds for these problems.&nbsp; To always suggest to run a Windows 8 Refresh or Reset to get Windows 8 back to the factory installation is NOT A SOLUTION!&nbsp;
 Eventually you will or may run back to the same problem.&nbsp; I guess Microsoft Support does not see this idiotic circle of solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To keep sanity for now, I will continue to do my normal and daily tasks on my second laptop running Linux Mint 14.1.&nbsp; I will continue to try to fix these problems in Windows 8.&nbsp; For the past two months, I have been unable to do update or program my web sites
 in .NET through Visual Studio 2012, unable to really do my normal daily tasks that I used to do all the time in Windows 7 without all these headaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe Steve Balmer at Microsoft should get his head of the sand and&nbsp;actually see what garbage they are producing to the general public&nbsp;(such as THEIR CUSTOMERS).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder so many companies and individuals are scared to buy a new computer with Windows
 8.&nbsp; They are wanting to keep Windows XP or Windows 7 running on their existing computers.</p>

            <p>To fix this and other problems in Windows 8, I ran a Windows 8 Reset.&nbsp; I have ran a Windows 8 Reset many times already and it is getting tiresome on rebuilding a partially built system.&nbsp; I have not been able to use Windows 8 still like I did Windows 7 from
 when I bought this laptop.&nbsp; The hardware is good, the operating system is the problem.</p>

            <p>FWIW and to no surprise, a Windows 8 Reset corrected this problem.&nbsp; Now I need to go back through installing the programs and to update Windows 8 once again.&nbsp; This event is becoming a regular regiment with Windows 8.</p>

            I still have faith in Microsoft..I mean I bought Windows 8 Pro, bought a Windows Phone 8, and am going to purchase a Windows Surface Pro when it is released. I mean there's a quick bug with my messaging program with WP8, but its brand new so its expected
 to not be perfect.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Windows 8...was going extremely well until I did some Windows Updates one day and then I rebooted and then all of a sudden, upon reboot my Windows Tiles freeze after 5 seconds, and upon refreshing them, they freeze again. My Explorer.exe tends to freeze
 with this too, and my my that's inconvenient. Lol. I bought Start8 to have the Start menu back in the meantime. I mean I love Windows 8...and I understand that issues happen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But then there's Microsoft Support.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm perfectly fine with dealing with some of the bugs I experience with my Microsoft devices. But when I get the same generic useless answers from support each and every time I ask a question, it makes me shake with anger. I'm in customer service - at
 Roadside. But at least we are human with our customers and actually find answers and find solutions for them. GAH!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I like my devices. And Microsoft. And everyone else.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just not Microsoft Support. They bloody well&nbsp;irritate the flak out of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<p>Microsoft historically has some problems with newly released operating systems, however, Windows 8 ranks to one of the worst releases like Windows Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the problems is the Secure Boot enabled in the UEFI with Windows&nbsp;8 running on the laptop already and based on research, you cannot easily install Windows 7, or even Linux, in another partition on the same hard drive.&nbsp; I do run Linux on another laptop
 to avoid the Secure Boot problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are trying to find a workaround or solution to a problem in Windows 8, it seems calling Microsoft Support is totally useless. I have given on even calling Microsoft any longer as the Support seems inept on Windows 8. This has made me think that
 if Microsoft cannot provide decent support, why&nbsp;use it all the time.&nbsp; With Linux, I always find useful and knowledgeable support in forums. Linux support in message forums is far better than Microsoft's.&nbsp; I am not saying that these Microsoft Answer forums
 are bad, you do get those canned written support responses that are useless. Beyond those, you can find solutions and workarounds in these forums.</p>

            Windows 8 is a wonderful operating system, albeit the system glitches that have occurred. I love the Windows Tiles, and I do hope I can actually use them sooner than later. I have been looking for answers here in the forums..and others are experiencing
 similar issues, however there haven't been any real fixes from Microsoft aside from their generic responses. The users have more fixes than that of Microsoft Support.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am a Producer for a Machinema Series and I have plenty of programs that I use, and over 1 TB of data files on my hard drive. My external can only carry 1TB, so transporting all of them isn't just an option. Resetting my computer is not an option, so
 I am really hoping that Microsoft can fix this soon!</div>

            <p>FWIW, Microsoft solutions are likely be the next Windows release.&nbsp; I have heard that Windows 8 development at Microsoft has ceased, there are no plans for any service packs, and Microsoft is trying to get Windows Blue (or whatever it may be called) released
 mid this year.&nbsp; This is why I have been more reliant on using Linux for daily tasks.&nbsp; I have used Linux over the past two decades.&nbsp; The use has been on and off throughout the years, and never really used it as a primary OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; With Microsoft's release of Windows
 8, this is making Linux look so much better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Linux system so far has not been restarted from initial installation and updates along with retaining a good stable wireless connection to the network.&nbsp; Windows 8 on the other hand continues to experience wireless connection issues among other problems.&nbsp;
 Windows 7 is much better than Windows 8 and it would be good to install Windows 7 on this laptop.&nbsp; However, there are Windows 7 drivers that are not available for this laptop where Windows 7 would run.&nbsp; I still have a Windows 7 laptop that runs good and haven't
 had a crash or program lock or crash.&nbsp; This frequently occur in Windows 8.&nbsp; I also have had several updates from Windows Update crash Windows 8 causing me to run a Windows&nbsp;8 Refresh or Reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sure hope you keep your data backed up if you have the data on the same partition as Windows 8.&nbsp; Seems like you do run Windows 8 Refreshes and Resets frequently, this is the normal responses I hear people talking about from support centers and through
 my experiences as well.</p>

            I'm curious to see what Windows Blue is going to be. I've heard plenty of rumours but what will actually be makes me curious.
<div><br />
As for my Windows 8 issue, I was on my computer today and I just noticed my Windows Tiles are working again. I..don't know what I did to make them work again. I haven't restarted my computer or used it for that matter for a good week or so. I'm rather confused.
 Haha I don't want to restart it at all, because I don't want to have that issue again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know what you mean about the issues with Windows 8. I'm still satisfied with Windows 8 regardless..its a new idea and the modern UI is neat. The issues should have been dealt with before releasing the software, and they need a new team of support members,
 but I am still satisfied, albeit the glitches.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>If the Windows 8 Tiles disappear again, I may just install Windows 8 <a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Classic Shell</a>, which is free, to get a Start menu back in Windows 8.&nbsp; I would not rely on Windows 8 for anything important yet as it seems unstable when compared to the stableness of Windows 7.&nbsp; I do not even like the Modern UI (formerly known as Metro)
 for a desktop environment.&nbsp; The Modern UI is for a tablet and it should be use for a tablet.</p>
