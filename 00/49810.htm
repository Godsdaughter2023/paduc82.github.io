            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I have not fixed my computer as yet</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated my computer via ASUS, all updates are complete</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you sent me refers me to windows 10 as windows 8 is not what is installed..it then taken me to the whole list of options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded also reimage to repair faults etc...with no difference..this cost me £20 !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I read another comment from the community with the same problem.&nbsp; They were advised to uninstall all Universal Serial Bus Controllers - which I have done and restarted computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no success</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me nuts </p>

<p>Hi pottsydeep,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>What is your computer model/brand?</p>
<p>Is this issue preventing connectivity?</p>
<p>What happened when you tried to update the driver as per Syeds instructions?</p>
<p>I suggest getting an updated driver form the manufacturer.</p>

            <p>Hi Zoe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the process to disable BIOS memory option...Its just to make a answer your question...Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>First You need to Go to BIOS setting...</strong></p>
 as your system first starts to boot up. This screen can flash by very quickly, so be ready to quickly scan your eyes over the screen in order to find the correct key to press to enter into your system's BIOS. If you miss it, simply manually restart your computer
 by hitting the restart button on your computer. This is usually the smaller of two buttons located on the front of your computer.]</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Then Follow this image to disable...</p>

This one was related to your storport.sys driver.&nbsp; Please run verifier to find out what.<br />
<br />
In addition to the SCSI Port driver, Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and later versions provide Storport (<em>storport.sys</em>), a storage port driver that is especially suitable for use with high-performance buses, such as fibre channel buses, and RAID adapters.

<p>Hey Tom,</p>
<p>The easiest way to send your snip is to go to Windows Live SkyDrive (free online file storage from Microsoft) at<a href="http://skydrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://skydrive.live.com</a>&nbsp;and upload the picture to your Public folder. &nbsp;After it's there, go to the picture
 you uploaded and then send us the URL of the page so we can take a look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you do, however, I have something to add. &nbsp;Since the picture is located in your Program Files, I'd say it's probably important not to modify them. For example, the one above is related to your Gateway system software. &nbsp;However, these shouldn't be
 showing up in your Pictures library. &nbsp;We can resolve that easily:</p>
<p>1 - Click Start, then choose Pictures on the right side.</p>
<p>2 - Near the top of the folder that opens, look for a link that says something like "Includes 3 locations". &nbsp;Click that link.3</p>
<p>3 - In the box that opens, remove any non-picture folders that are there, such as Program Files folders. &nbsp;Then click OK. &nbsp;Don't worry, this doesn't erase or delete anything: it just determines where the Pictures library looks to find pictures to display
 for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does that resolve it for ya? &nbsp;Let us know and thanks,<br />
Shawn</p>

<h2>            Phantom moving touch screen</h2>
                    Is the phantom touch screen on my Surface pro 4 the result of a software glitch? I ended up disabling the touch screen after doing every conceivable thing short of reinstalling Windows. 10.

<p>That would do nothing. I literally had to disable the drivers to the touch screen, so essentially I have no ability to use touch ot the pen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I enable the drivers, the touch screen goes haywire, opening apps, closing apps, &nbsp;movements as though a finger is pressibg the screen, circles appearing all over the screen -- madness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling the drivers and reinstalling them and virtually everything except reinstalling my operating system; sonething I do not want to do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an HP Spectre X-2. It works fine. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 is a joke. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>New Skype for Windows 10 is terrible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sergejonnaert  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Skype for Windows 10 is terrible</h2>
                    <p>I've been a Skype user since it first hit the market. The Microsoft 'absorption' hasn't done it any favors. The latest Windows 10 embedded desktop release is absolutely horrendous.... Who manages that team?<br />
<br />
- First of all it doesn't at all adhere to Microsoft's UX standards. It is all over the place. There is no logic to where to find functions and definitely not intuitive.</p>
<p>- It does not automatically open when windows start and there is no settings where you can enable it? Really?</p>
<p>- It does not retain audio selection when switching back and forth from a headset to a built-in audio. I have to reconfigure every morning and do an audio test to make sure I can actually make alls.</p>
<p>- Cannot always hear a ring when dialing.</p>
<p>- After you dial a phone number, you would expect the dial pad to stay live so that you can immediately go through voice prompts. Now you need three clicks just to get to the dial pad, starting with an obscure more button on the bottom.</p>
<p>- The annoying feedback every couple of calls is still there... How many customer need to complain about this before it is removed? You want to monitor call quality, put a 'quality' button so that people only give feedback when it is actually necessary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, I totally agree.&nbsp; The is terrible and I now have to see about moving away from skype.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS, how can this have happened?&nbsp; I've used skype from when it first came out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i had to move&nbsp; back to a previous version but it seems to be hanging in windows 10 x64.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Cattle in a box, no choices, eat whatever we give you and shut up. We are humans not cattle. Treat us like a CUSTOMER. Definitely not intuitive, no Options, Settings, Zecho/Sound Test, can’t hear a ring when dialing, annoying feedback message (Should have
 do not display option). What happened to Recent button, Show contacts online only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Give us back the stick shift version, you keep the “New Skype for Windows 10” for all dodo’s in MS.<br />
Don’t try to fix something that works.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I would like to add that for Windows 10 users, the conversations are no longer removable.</p>
<p>I have both the old version and the new version running and the old version has a button in tools/privacy called Remove history. This works.</p>
<p>Then I switch to the new version and voila'! all my conversations are still there.</p>
<p>Normally i try to do my best to patiently get used to software changes but this time it is really a total mess.</p>
<p>I also tried searching for:&nbsp; %appdata%\Skype</p>
<p>then i clicked on the folder with my user name</p>
<p>finally, right clicking on the path field on top will give you the option to Delete History. Still no success .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found also that Skype declares that removing conversations is not supported in the new version for Windows 10 users, while it is available for Mac, Android, Web and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you guys in MS please at least tell us when it will be implemented?</p>
<p>If I have confidential info that is unlawfully read because I cannot delete it, who can i sue? Microsoft?</p>

            I absolutely agree, the skype for Win10 is a complete disaster. I am using the previous version and it works fine, nothing wrong with it. Can you please stop asking me to try the Win10 version? I don't want it. Skype has always been fine, but MS buys it
 and completely destroys it.

            <p>Faxing is a telephony technology.&nbsp; In other words, you must have a fax modem in the PC connected to a telephone line, or a telephone line connected to the phone jack in your AIO printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are commercial services that can fax (using email attachments) thorough the Internet.&nbsp; For example see efax.com</p>

            <p>You can't.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Faxing from windows requires a fax modem and an analog telephone line.&nbsp; You (probably)have neither.&nbsp; Your Xfinity modem is not a fax modem; it is a cable modem.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Click Start and type "Device Manager" (without quotes) into the Search box and press Enter.<br />
</p>
<p>Do you have a category for "modems" (see below)?<br />

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your printer, assuming it is an "all in one" including fax capability, has the fax modem but what do you have it connected to?&nbsp; For best results, it should be connected to a plain old analog telephone line, although Comcast claims that "most" fax equipment
 is "compatible" with Xfinity Voice.</p>

    <title>My &#40;and your&#41; Honest Opinion of GoW&#58; Judgement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quanfreeman  say:</h3>
<h2>            My &#40;and your&#41; Honest Opinion of GoW&#58; Judgement</h2>
                    
<p>I apologize ahead of time for people who saw this in another thread, but, man! This has become the argument of the century, and I felt that my previous post deserved it's own thread. I'd like to hear more from the community. Here's what I posted earlier:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a person who went out and bought the limited editions for all 3 GoW games, I would say that I'm a fan of the series. I bought it Tuesday afternoon and took Wednesday off, played for about 6 hours and ran through the Judgement Campaign. My honest opinion,
 which I will try and give as objectively as possible, is that it's a better-than-average game. Here's what People Can Fly dropped the ball on:</p>
<p>1. They packaged what could have been a good year's worth of DLC for GoW3 into Judgement. Everthing from the game modes, MP maps and campaign missions, could have been periodic DLC for GoW3. This game as DLC for Gears 3 would have been disgustingly awesome,
 but as a prequel stand-alone game, it's just too short and shallow to justify the $60 price tag (I guess this is why there was no limited edition of Judgement: There would've been riots)</p>
<p>2. I understand that People Can Fly probably wanted to put their own stamp on the game, and make it more fast-paced, but they completely missed the ball on what made Gears unique. This game was not made to be a run-and-gun type of game. Not a huge fan of
 Cliff B., but paraphrasing his intro in Gears of War 1, he said that the idea for Gears came from playing paintball. To get the player to feel that rush of adrenaline and make them think twice about strafing around characters like 1st person shooters. As a
 result, the Gears gameplay always had an underpinning of strategy, in both the campaign and MP modes. I rarely felt the need to HAVE to take cover in Judgement until the last boss. Part of this reason is that most of the Horde just bum-rushed you during the
 whole game, like they didn't need to take cover (What is that about?).</p>
<p>3. One of the things that kept me coming back to the GoW series was the story. I got so immersed in the story that when Dom died in GoW3, I teared up a little bit (don't lie and say you didn't either). In previous installments of GoW, the game just flowed,
 and the story along with it. Judgement obliterated that. My first reaction when I played Judgement and going from one declassified skull cog to the next, I said to myself, 'This feels like playing Lost Planet, then playing Lost Planet 2.' Every portion of
 the game was segmented, taking away from the story. Don't get me wrong, you can skip the declassified missions and play straight through, but what's the fun in that, where the character unlocks and goodies are tied to the stars you receive from de-class missions?</p>
<p>4. The emphasis on making the game faster and multplayer gaming took it's toll on the weapons. When I first played GoW, I hated having to use the D-pad to switch weapons, after about a half an hour in, it was the only way to implement it. The controls felt
 right; D-pad to switch weapons, LB to see where your squad was, Y-Button for event looks. How many of you, the first time playing Judgment pressed the LB to see where your squad/objectives were and almost blew yourselves up when you tossed a grenade? Now with
 the dedicated LB-grenade button, it takes some getting used to, to say the least, especially when you're trying to plant a grenade as a proximity mine. The other thing is; Where is my Snub pistol? Why'd they only allow you to carry two weapons? How much fun
 was it to use someone as a meatshield, whip out your Boltok and dome a couple enemies? You can still do that, but you must use the weapon you're carrying; if you happen to have a Snub or a Boltok, then you're in luck. Otherwise, you're using whatever other
 weapon you're carrying. Plus, I always felt that by always having a pistol, no matter what, you can get out of any situation if you run out of ammo for your other weapons. Well, that's gone.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other things that I can nitpick regarding this game, but it's not really worth the extra keystrokes. Overall, the game isn't terrible. It's slightly above average. But People Can Fly's focus on Multiplayer effectively wiped out the
 identity of the game; sure it feels like Gears for the most part, in terms of character controls, but it doesn't FEEL like Gears. Baird's really serious, Cole is eerily quiet (another "What?" moment), and the other members of Kilo are interesting, but never
 fleshed out.</p>
<p>Not, bad, but not worth $60.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had so much fun on the demo, but the full game is just "eh". I'm about halfway through the campaign and I've had a lot of fun so far. I love prizeboxes, and there are some really nice skins to buy or get from the prieboxes. My main problem is with the
 multiplayer. I was really looking forward to the multiplayer, and I got a vibe from the demo that maybe people wouldn't turn the Gnasher into the supreme weapon again, but no, it's still the only weapon in the online arsenal. Seriously, I can't stand getting
 killed by the Gnasher constantly. I want some nice Lancer firefights, or some close-quarters Retro battles. Something other than melee-Gnasher. And Frags, the only 'nades people run with, I hate them. It's almost as if every time somebody throws one they are
 guaranteed a kill. I'm already sick and tired of it. I'm enjoying OverRun more than anything besides campaign. I have problems with that too, though. Last night, I got into a match on the Locust, and 3/5 of the COG side were Soldiers, spamming the Booshka
 at one of the entrances. If that becomes the new tactic, I don't think I'll have play Judgment much longer. I'm happy with the controls, it does give it a *slightly* faster pace (to me at least). I'm gonna give it a few weeks though. I'd really like to see
 if Execution is as fun as it used to be (if you haven't heard, it comes it a free DLC with two maps on April 2nd). And honestly, I agree with what you said, "They packaged what could have been a good year's worth of DLC for GoW3 into Judgement. Everything
 from the game modes, MP maps and campaign missions, could have been periodic DLC for GoW3", but I have a theory: Gears 3's amount of players has most likely shrunk by a lot within the past months, releasing it as a standalone game made them more money, and
 increased the number of players. Now, I can't say how many people will be playing in a month, but my guess is not a lot.</p>
<p>One last gripe: Survival. Why? Why replace Horde with this? I'm not so disappointed that Horde isn't in it, I'm disappointed that they think something as fun and replayable as Horde should be replaced by a slightly modified version of OverRun. It wouldn't
 be as bad if they hadn't of made OverRun available to play with bots. If I had to rate this on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 6.5. It's definitely the worst Gears so far in my opinion, but not the worst game I've played.
</p>
<p>I'm going to give it several more chances until I make my final decision of keeping it or not.</p>

<p>Fair critiques. The only thing about this being DLC is they took out too many things (active reload damage, DBNO in multi, executions, 2 main guns to start with, etc.) for that to fly. I don't like the trend of shooters all moving to a COD style of game.
 Halo did it in a big way. Gears took a few steps in that direction too. Let's face it, the grenade choices amount to a loadout (damage, healing, radar). For the life of me, I don't know why it isn't COG v Locust in multi? It's tougher to see the enemy, and
 even worse to hear the enemy approach. Locust and COG sounded different. Now everybody sounds the same (like COD).</p>

<p>RIGamer and Walrus, I completely agree with you guys! They really humped the bunk when they made these unwarranted changes. I was never big on the COD-type of gameplay (Even though I LOVED Call of Duty 2), but when they kept bringing a new one out every
 year, I got tired of it, but I do know of the "perks" and "loadout" gameplay of COD. Didn't like it. GoW's &nbsp;gameplay was something that was really unique and fresh when it came to shooters. Quite honestly, I mainly played Multiplayer for Horde mode for your
 reasons; everyone uses the Gnasher. All. The. Time. But not only did they keep the Gnasher the same, but they gave the Sawed-Off Shotgun a bigger aiming reticle, slightly further blast distance, TWO blasts before you had to reload AND a faster reload time.
 That's not good.</p>

<p>You bring up an interesting point Dissident. I never played the Beta version of GoW3, so I have nothing to compare the final product to. Same with GoW:J. I have to say one thing though; I could deal with some of the changes to Judgement if the story mode
 wasn't so stop-and-go. If they had done something different with the declassified missions, I would have been a little more supportive of the game. For instance; If you beat the game the first time around, give the players an option to turn on declassification
 missions on their second run-through. Or maybe hide the declassification missions like they do the COG tags, giving people a reason to play through and enjoy the story, then increase your chances of unlocking more goodies. Maybe I'm a little slow, but can
 someone explain to me what Gib kills are?</p>

<p>Having only played the demo of Gears of War Judgement. It's really fun and the new controller layout with moving weapon changes to the (Y) button takes some effort to adjust to. With all the changes that were made in Gears of War Judgement. It seems like
 Epic were trying for a more arcade style of game play with this Gears of War video game than with 1, 2, or 3.</p>
<p>I have played and I'm a huge fan all 3 Gears of War video games. In my opinion since the story in "Gears of War Judgement" takes place before the main story line of Gears 1, 2 and 3 the changes in game play really don't ruin the Gears of War franchise. When

<p>I have played Overrun almost exclusively, and love it. I finished the first 3 mission and now on Coles testimony in the campaign. I like the campaign game play a lot, but the store is meh. Love declassified and breech shot, but missing having a pistol and
 2 other weapons. I really enjoy this version of gears and don't get hung up on the negatives. I wish there was more maps for MP but DLC will take care is that. I will be playing this for a while that is for sure.</p>

<p>my only problems are that like th OP said it feels and plays like a DLC rather than a full bodied campaign.</p>
<p>the SP is short and reminds me of raams shadow dlc.</p>
<p>i hate that they took out horde cause that what me and my friends played the most on gears3.</p>
<p>minor issues and changes like controller layout change &nbsp;dont really bother me but i wouldv'e loved if they</p>
<p>kept the old layout. i think i'll just jump on gears 3 for my horde fix.</p>

<p>After going through both campaigns, playing all of the multiplayer modes and playing Survival and actually beating the game. I absolutely loved the campaigns they were amazingly fun and well thought out and had such a great feel to them. As for the multiplayer
 eh im not a fan of it but its still fun with friends. While 4 game modes and only 4 maps for each its kind of lame but then again there were so many maps last game I rarely got to play alot of my favorites. Survival mode is ALOT of fun and I could replay it
 all day. Overall the game is fun with friends, a great addition to the series (so far the most impressive and one of the best games Ive played in awhile imo). I give this game a 9/10

 but nothing has downloaded, when I click on purchase again I get the message that I already own the export pack and it should &nbsp;available in the my apps and game centre. When i go to my games and apps there is nothing there waiting to be download or that has
 already been downloaded. I have paid for the export pack but have no idea how I am supposed to download the songs, can anyone help? I have restarted the console and game a few times and this has not done anything.</span></p>

<p>Hi Vickyreid12,</p>
<p>Have you checked the in game store front? </p>
<p>Load up Rock Band 4, to go the Music Store ("Get More Songs") and then scroll down to "Exports". They should show up as purchased. Select the game and download them. You may have to reload your Song Cache in the Options Menu before items appear correctly
 in the Music Store.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>The 120hz is a "motion blur" feature of the TV, not an input refresh rate allowance.&nbsp; Your TV will only accept up to a 1080p 60hz signal, as shown in the TV's manual on page 48.&nbsp; You will need to set your output back to 60hz for the TV to accept the signal.</p>

<h3> bklepac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer sharing Windows 10 and Windows XP</h2>
                    <p>Recently upgraded 2 Windows 7 Professional machines to Windows 10. &nbsp;Both of these computers have USB printers hooked up to them and they were shared over our network and XP machines could print just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrade, I reshared the printers, password sharing is off, firewall is off, file and print sharing is on. &nbsp;In printer properties under security Everyone has all check boxes checked. &nbsp;I even tried the file sharing trick of adding 'Network' to the permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the printers from my XP machines, but when I try to connect it asks me for username and password and when I type in administrator username and password it tells me "the credentials supplied are not sufficient to access this printer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening the same on two different Windows XP Pro computers trying to connect to two different Windows 10 printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File sharing works just fine, does not ask for password, printers should be the same. &nbsp;What gives?</p>

            This answer is not helpful. &nbsp;As you read above, I have setup the sharing, essentially outlining the steps in the posted link. &nbsp;The same printers were working properly with Windows 7. &nbsp;This is a Windows 10 issue. &nbsp;Password sharing is turned off, doesn't
 ask me for a password for files, but it does for printers and gives me an error. &nbsp;Looking for a work around.

<p>File sharing is working fine among Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 10. Printer sharing is working fine between Windows 7 and Windows 10, but it does not wokr with Windows XP, it must be a Windows 10 issue, please advice on workaround solution.</p>

            I have a similar problem.&nbsp; I have a virtual XP machine running under Hyper-V, originally on a Windows 8.1 machine.&nbsp; File and printer sharing with the host machine all worked fine.&nbsp; After upgrading to Windows 10, file sharing with the host is still working,
 but I can't add any printers in the virtual XP machine.&nbsp; I get the same "credentials supplied were insufficient" message when I use the 'Add printer' wizard.&nbsp; A workaround for this would be much appreciated.<br />

            <p>1) I also noticed in Advanced Sharing settings, besides authenticated users using file &amp; print sharing, you can also set up "Guest" sharing. On a MacBook, to share my LaserJet 3015 with guest turned off, I had to authenticate with a user on the Windows 10.
 If you turn on Guest file &amp; print sharing, you might be able to bypass that prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps - * press Windows icon and search for Advance Sharing.</p>
<p>* Under public, turn sharing on</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d22e17b-d80a-4005-96a1-2da8788c1dd0" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>* If you don't want to share publically, you'll have to enter a login and password that you can hopefully save on the client machine<br />
</p>
<p>2) When you enter in your password for credentials, are you using the name of the computer you are connecting to explicitly? for example, if the windows 10 machine is called win10bill, you use win10bill\administrator and password as your login? it is worth
 a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) You could also try setting your Administrator password on both Win10 and WinXP as the same... &nbsp;</p>

            All of the above has been set and tried. &nbsp;The admin login is the same for both machines. &nbsp;I have also tried it on another two different machines where its different. &nbsp;I have also made sure the permissions under advanced sharing for the printer had Everyone
 all check marks done and after that didn't work I added 'Network' which was a Windows 7 work around for different things a while back with no luck. &nbsp;Its been a while since I have messed with this. &nbsp;I will try reinstalling the printer again and report back
 as I have had a Windows 10 update in the mean time.

<h2>            TCP&#47;IPv4 Obtain DNS automatically</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my router configured to use the opendns dns servers, and everything works fine except for my desktop PC running Vista SP3.</p>
<p>I have my router configured to issue IP addresses based on MAC addresses so I have the TCP/IPv4 set to obtain IP address and DNS automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is the desktop PC keeps resetting itself and entering an addresses in the DNS server box. How can I clear these adresses and force it to keep the automatic setting.</p>
<p>I don't really want to put in the openDNS servers in case I decide to revert back to my ISP servers. I'd rather keep it automatic and make the changes on the router.</p>
<p>It's getting very frustrating having to keep resetting it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Go to Start / Control Panel / Internet Options / Connections / select the connection and click Settings.&nbsp; Click on Properties and go to Networking and select TCP/IPv4.&nbsp; Under TCP/IPv4 select Properties and make sure the first page says Obtain DNS Server
 Address automatically.&nbsp; Click on Advanced and click on DNS.&nbsp; Make sure the only two boxes checked are Append Primary and Connection Specific DNS Suffixes and Append parent suffixes of the primary DNS suffix - NOtHING ELSE.&nbsp; Click OK and save this.&nbsp; That should
 resolve the problem.&nbsp; But I suspect you've already done this (probably many times) so let's move on to something else.</p>
<p>The only other option I can think of is to reset the TCP/IP stack which may get rid of the incorrect addresses and start it up fresh with the correct settings.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:<a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/mattcampbell/archive/2007/09/30/Resetting-your-whole-IP-stack-in-Vista.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://geekswithblogs.net/mattcampbell/archive/2007/09/30/Resetting-your-whole-IP-stack-in-Vista.aspx</a>.&nbsp;
 I don't know if this will help, but if you're having troubles with TCP/IP, this is one way many people use to resolve them.&nbsp; You will then need to resetup the TCP/IP settings and then you can see if this did the trick.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>In Device Manager, Microsoft Tun Miniport Adapter #2 has a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark. "Device cannot start (code 10). The driver update attempt tells me that I have the most up todate driver. I am trying to get the computer clean so i can

<p><span>Hi Dennis,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of uninstalling and re-installing the drivers, you can try updating the drivers.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The Code 10 error code is generated when Device Manager has insufficient information or the error that is bubbled up by the device drivers is not
 recognized by Device Manager. Additionally, this error may occur when one of the drivers that the device needs does not start. If many drivers are being used by a particular device, it can be difficult to determine the one that failed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps from the link given below which would help you to fix this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> To update the device drivers</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Description of Code 10-related errors that Device Manager generates in Windows-based computers</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, you can try the steps mentioned below to see if this helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> To disable IPv6</span></p>
<p><span>Try uninstalling IPv6 on all interfaces, removing any IPv6 virtual adapters, and resetting the TCP/IP stack.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>To
 remove IPv6, go into the properties for each network adapter and either uncheck the box next to the protocol "Internet Protocol version 6 (TCP/IPv6), that will disable it, or select it and click uninstall, which will remove it off the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Then
 go into device manager and remove any 4to6 adapters, miniport adapters, or tunnel adapters.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>TCP –<em>Transfer Control Protocol</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>IP –<em>Internet Protocol</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> You should do this for each network connection. Also,
 disabling IPv6 will disable homegroup if your computer is on a homegroup. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, you may refer the following KB articles:</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>How to disable certain Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) components in Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server
 2008</span></em></strong></p>
