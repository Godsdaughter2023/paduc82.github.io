    <title>Should I quit using Norton antivirus to utilize the microsoft defender - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> triciawhite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should I quit using Norton antivirus to utilize the microsoft defender in Windows 10 upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded to windows 10 and trying out Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; So far so good but I have some security questions.&nbsp; I currently have Norton antivirus I have used for many years and quite frankly put it on my computer with 8.1 because windows defender
 was not catching the viruses.&nbsp; Norton is due to expire in a few days and my review on the internet indicates Microsoft defender should be sufficient with Microsoft edge.&nbsp; Is this true?&nbsp; I have noticed I keep getting pop ups from Norton indicating that Edge
 does not allow plug ins so Norton cannot protect the browser and I should use Internet Explorer or Firefox, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously I downloaded the new programs to utilize them.&nbsp; I have searched for Defender on my computer and I get a window that just indicates
 it is not on due to my 3rd party antivirus.&nbsp; Makes sense, but I disabled all of Norton and it did not come on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is was Microsoft defender and the associated protection programs put on with Windows 10 or not?</p>
<p>If I try to quit Norton again, should I uninstall it completely and how do I get the Microsoft defender program on my computer and on?</p>
<p>Is there another 3rd party program Microsoft feels is excellent for using windows 10 and Edge?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help and I hope someone responds soon prior to my antivirus expiring.&nbsp;

            <p>Symantec (the developers of Norton-branded software) has said that Norton security software won't provide complete protection until Microsoft Edge supports extensions, and that's not due to arrive until early 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you like Norton software, hang around their user forums to see what Symantec is offering for Windows 10. Otherwise you should choose a different third-party anti-malware product that is fully compatible with Windows 210.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender provides only a basic degree of protection; almost any third party product is more effective.</p>

            <p><strong>Do not rely on Windows defender for you're virus protection !&nbsp; It isn't very good and Always scores pretty low in virus detection and removal. Make sure you always use a third party one. I myself use Kaspersky Internet security which is excellent
 !!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as Windows Defender not turning on it won't unless you Completely remove every single trace of Norton or any other Antivirus right off you're PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender is on Windows 10 but does not show an icon by default.&nbsp;Go into you're C: drive directory and Program files (Not program files x86), open the Windows defender folder and look for the file named "MSASCui", right click and Send to desktop then
 rename it Windows Defender.<br />

<h2>            How many times can I reinstall windows 8 pro one the same PC with a physical copy&#63;</h2>
                    I plan to purchase a physical copy of Windows 8 Pro. I know that I'm gonna reinstall a lot using the disc and will most likely use system restore a lot since I'm a heavy themes modder. So my question is: how many times can you reinstall windows with the
 same copy and can you deactivate the key if you want to switch PC?

<p>How to reinstall Windows 8</p>
</span>
<p>You have a couple options:</p>
<p>If you would like to reinstall Windows 8, which means removing apps and personal files and settings, you can use reset and refresh. This is equivalent to a clean install.</p>
<p>To do it, do the following:</p>
<p>· Press <b>Windows key + i</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar (If you are using a touchscreen: Touch the right edge of your screen and swipe your finger to the left)</p>
<p>· Click <b>Settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>Change PC settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>General</b> in the left column</p>
<p>· Under <b>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</b>, click <b>Get started</b></p>
<p>Then follow the instructions that will be provided on the screen to reinstall Windows on your PC.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If you create a installation DVD or Bootable thumbdrive, you can use that to reinstall Windows. First, you will need to reinstall the qualifying license, then start the upgrade again to Windows 8. Qualifying license means you will either need to reinstall
 Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>A workaround for this situation is to create a system image of Windows 8 just after you have upgraded. So if your drive does crash, you can simply restore the image on a new hard disk or restore the image on the same drive if you just want to reinstall Windos
 8.</p>
<p>See the following for instructions about how to create a system image of your Windows 8 installation:</p>

<p>(references Windows 7, but the same principles apply to Windows 8).</p>

            Unfortunately - I re-installed Windows 8 after it started crashing repeatedly. &nbsp;Now it tells me I can't use my product key because it was already used once. &nbsp;I've paid for the product and have nothing to show for it.

<h2>            Bootcamp Windows 10 update Version 1809 for x64 system &#40;KB4476976&#41;&#58; Laptop Keyboard Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Issue: Laptop keyboard stopped working after Windows 10 software update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Macbook Pro Bootcamp Windows 10 </p>
<p>2019-01 Cumulative Updated for Windows 10 Version 1809 for x64 system (KB4476976)</p>
<p>Date of install: 1/27/19</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other updates:</p>
<p>2019-01 Cumulative Update for .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.7.2 for Windows 10 Version 1809 for x64 (KB4481031)</p>
<p>2019-01 Cumulative Update for .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.7.2 for Windows 10 Version 1809 for x64 (KB4480056)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello - any help would be appreciated. During the installation process of the updates an error occurred after restart, but the computer rebooted and made it to the login screen. The keyboard stopped working, but was able to use the on-screen keyboard to
 log in. I reviewed the software update, and the system seemed to communicate that the update had installed fine. Rebooted, but the laptop keyboard still not working. Tried to uninstall/reinstall/update the keyboard driver - keyboard still not working. Tried
 to uninstall the recent update, and then reinstall the update. Keyboard still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently typing this out on the laptop on the MacOS - so it's fine on that side. Keyboard not working on the windows side. Hoping there's an approach that won't require a reinstall of the OS. Any advise?</p>

            Hi GJ08_R,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />Source - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17417/windows-mouse-touchpad-keyboard-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17417/...</a>
<br />
<br />There are two other actions which you can undertake. You can try them one by one and check after each.
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>No luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keyboard troubleshooter comes back with no detection of any issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>System restore did not bring functionality back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled all updates from the date of the keyboard and trackpad falling out, but that didnt seem to fix the issues either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

</p><p>I did a upgrade to Windows 10 Pro from a genuine Windows 8.1 key via the get&nbsp;windows 10 app.&nbsp; Anyway it download and installed fine (even though it took all day to do due to a very slow internet connection)&nbsp; I checked and it said windows had activated though
 I seem to have the generic windows 10 Pro key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to do a complete clean install so I downloaded the setup via the media creation tool and reinstalled it via that, skipping license keys etc during installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now from doing this clean install method I can not activate windows anymore it says activation server&nbsp;has blocked key etc.&nbsp; Key also seems to be the generic key still.</p>

    <title>Jumplist sometimes extremely slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anders edvin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Jumplist sometimes extremely slow</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new laptop with Windows 10 recently. </p>
<p>Only after a few days, the jump lists started to get extremely slow. </p>
<p>But they behave that way just for a while, then they work as they should again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When slow, it takes several minutes for the jump list to appear. It is extremely annoying. Especially e.g. when I have opened a remote desktop and want to open another one via the jumplist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had exactly the same problem with my old Windows 7 PC and assumed that I would get rid of that problem,
<span>changing&nbsp;</span>both PC and OS, but no.</p>
<span>changing&nbsp;</span>both PC and OS, but no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want the standard answers to this problem:</p>
<p>- Disable Aero</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Clear the (Explorer) Cache for Jump lists</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- etc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It is definitely something else. I mean, how would the jump list cache get full after only a week? And why does the jump list get slow only sometimes and then suddenly works just fine again?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So please, give me an answer that takes this into consideration.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Startup issues after update on the computer. Windows 10 is becoming unresponsive at startup screen.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 update locks laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows 10 laptop doesn't start up anymore. It freezes at the startup screen where the dots are circling. &nbsp;After installing windows 10 always have to disble and enble my netwotk adapter to get my wifi working again. Even after half a year this still not
 solved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I swiched my headphones to another usb port a couple of times, as this is also not working properly after installing windows 10. I noticed that new device drivers where installed. Then it became unresponsive and I restarted my laptop. The black screen
 between the startup screens didn't want to disappear. After waiting 10 &nbsp;minutes i shut my computer down again by using ctrl alt del &nbsp;shut down. After starting up again it stuck at the welcome screen. After 10 minutes or more the next start up stops at the
 circling do</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting with the poer button simply jumps back to that screen. When i put a lan cable in the laptop the modem router doesn't recognize it. I suspect thst windows is trying to automatically update but doesn't have an internet connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Recently it upgraded automatically to the windows 10 update, which also took an hour. I am waiting two hours now and there is no disk activity I am very unhappy with the latest update strategy and Ihope that i hope that someone from Microsoft can help me
 m &nbsp;this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>......</p>
<p>Update on this issue. </p>
<p>After two hours writing I decided to take out the battery and hope for the best. Luckily everything started up. I looked in the Event Log and I could see that there were problems with the Microsoft Passport service. No updates were installed. As said before
 I really dislike this new update strategy of Microsoft. I have no possibility to stop updates or install them whenever I want to. Updates can be downloaded or installed at any time now. The uncertainty about if something is downloading and causing an unresponsive
 system is worse than the actual download. I really don't like this. Hopefully this update strategy is restored to the old system where the user had more control.
</p>
<p>

<p>Yes, I truly MISS the days of getting an entire game all in one, without DLC or silly spinoffs. &nbsp;When i see the addition of multiplayer, or spinoff games such as this, I see extra missions, planets, armor, guns, and story that Bioware omitted from the actual
 game to put on future DLC and/or on this "ME game for IPad". &nbsp;I'm not talking about "100% Galactic Readiness", I'm talking about content that could of easily of been on ME3 to make this IPad game.</p>

<p>Lol. /doublefacepalm <br />
<br />
I can see the future that BioWare is wanting to take the Mass Effect franchise, I'm just glad that I will be paying zero attention to it after Mass Effect 3 releases and I'm completely done with that.<br />
<br />
"Oh sweet!? It's another option to get the best possible complete ending by just pew pewing these bad guys and collecting some intelligence, and wallah I now have the best outcome that took me little to no time in comparison to those who grinded out the actual
 story of the trilogy and actually had an understanding of what Mass Effect actually was about!<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><em>L337!!!</em></strong></span>"<br />
<br />
Ok so that was somewhat extreme and I personally really don't care how some people will ultimately decide to go about finishing up Mass Effect 3 or how they play, that's totally up to them.<br />
<br />
I just find it laughable looking at the Marketing approach of Mass Effect 3 and every single new "gimmick" or tool to garner even more shady profits outside of the base game that seems to be coming up every single week. You need an excel spreadsheet to keep
 track of all the extra non-sense.<br />
<br />
I mean hell just look at the <em>sweet</em> <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/xbox-360/accessories/xbox-360-slim-limited-collectors-edition-mass-effect-3-vault/99076" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox 360 Slim Vault</a>, which the PS3 has one as well. Is that really worth $89 to what is essentially a slap on encasing that it looks as if a very terrible artist rendered and just sent out for production?&nbsp; Not really.&nbsp; Like I said, bravo BioWare Marketing,
 but in this case bravo doesn't mean outstanding work, it means what the hell were you thinking with half of these ideas.<br />
<br />
I get the job of the Marketing team, they need to do everything they can to get their brand out there and get people to pay attention to this "big" release, but sometimes and most of the time, quality is better than quantity. Enough with the obvious ploys and
 shady practices.&nbsp; We all know that will never change at this point because that's just how the industry works now, but it's a bit ridiculous how much "added" content is being spewed out on top of the base game before it even releases in which others have diligently
 said is obviously content withheld just to make that extra profit. There's no denying that so don't even try.</p>

<p>@cryptic (big post dont want to clog forum)</p>
<p>there are Justin Bieber singing toothbrushes, trading cards and dress up dolls (working at a nation wide retailer exposes you to these horros), ME3's marketing is no where near out of control
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>but one thing I do want to know is what exactly are they doing that is shady? selling ios apps? there are other games that do the same, day one dlc? there's been day one dlc for forever. Im seriously not seeing any of these problems that everyone else seems
 to talk vaguely about. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>in a semi bad analogy they sell cars but at the same time they release parts that are better than stock (a lot from the manufacturer) for a couple hundred bucks per bolt on yet how am I getting any less of a car because these added parts (that aren't necassary)
 aren't included with the car?</p>

<p>Hey</p>
<p>I bought a 4000 Microsoft point and when i used the code the microsoft point changed to dollars and then i go to the xbox live site to see my region and mine is UK then the dollars changed to £ and after that i see my money are £0 .</p>

<p>Hi The Hulk KSA,</p>
<p>There its no way to recover it. Here the reason/Link</p>
<p>If you’re moving to another country or region, you might have to change the region associated with your Xbox LIVE account. You can do this by going to the Account migration page (sign-in required). When you change the region of your Xbox LIVE account, some
 things are unaffected, like your profile.<strong> Other things are potentially affected, such as:</strong></p>
<p>•Memberships and subscriptions<br />
•Licensed digital content (like games, video, and music) that you’ve already bought
<br />
•Services you get through your Xbox console <br />
•<strong>Funds in your Microsoft Account</strong></p>

<p>Hey Hulk, there is no issue really.<br />
As previously posted, it's just that the website hasn't been updated yet to the new system, and doesn't show your balance at all.<br />
You can either go to the commerce website, or when you opt to try purchasing something it will bring up the screen with the balance on your console.<br />
At the moment purchases can not be made from the website.</p>

<p>MS POINTS HAS BEEN RETIRED, the points you have on your account or a code you redeemed will be converted into local currency, The next time you initiate a purchase or redeem a Microsoft Points card or code on your console with your Microsoft account, we’ll
 add to your account an amount of currency equal to or greater than the Marketplace value of your Microsoft Points, and your Microsoft Points will be retired.</p>

<p>Have you tried going online to view your Microsoft billing account without using your Xbox. I've had something similar happen and in order to release my funds I had to re-enter and save my billing address online. Shortly there after my funds aka rewards
 points/$$$ were made available and I was able to use my balance on my Xbox to make purchases.</p>

<h2>            Windows Spotlight stuck on the same image</h2>
                    <p>My Windows Spotlight has been stuck on the same image for a few weeks now. To debug, I first deleted all from:</p>
<p>AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\Settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to run this command:</p>
<p>Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager -allusers | foreach {Add-AppxPackage -register "$($_.InstallLocation)\appxmanifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode}</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, got this error:</p>
<p>ERROR_INSTALL_<br />
REGISTRATION_FAILURE<br />
0x80073CF6 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The package can't be registered.<br />
Check the AppXDeployment-Server event log for more info.</p>

            Hello, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />You could use this fix from the tenforum to reset &amp; re-register Spotlight: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset-re-register-windows-spotlight-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset...</a>
<br />There’s a bug with Spotlight since the Fall update, if you choose ‘not a fan’ it resets the background to the default photo so you have to run this fix again.

</p><p>When your system locks, does the clock always show up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have noticed with spotlight</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I never had any interests in using windows spotlight as my lock-screen, so I never put any thought into it's functionality. It doesn't work. Plain and simple. Besides the fact that spotlight does not appear to exist, this too happens...<br />
</p>
<p>After I...</p>
<ol>
<li>select "picture" from the drop down menu.</li><li>select an image to use as background.</li></ol>
<p>The next time I select "Windows Spotlight" all that happens is, "Picture" will be displayed in the drop down menu, and the thumbnails below change. The mountain lake with the backpack in the foreground replaces one of the thumbs. After clicking on a thumb,
 they revert back to how they were before attempting to select "spotlight". If I do nothing except select "Windows Spotlight" a second time, "Windows Spotlight" will be selected in the drop down menu. However, I have yet to see what Spotlight actually does.
 I've heard tails of an "I like this" button. I have yet to see it do anything.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have yet to see it work. It only shows that one image.</p>

<h2>            After update to Windows 10 Home &#40;64&#41; ver 1809 Local PC no longer appears in Network folder...</h2>
                    ...after reboot unless the netcfg /d command is ran prior to rebooting.<br />
<br />
I thought I had seen the last of this problem a couple updates ago, but now it has reared its ugly head again.<br />
<br />
I don't know what Microsoft had done this time, but what ever it is they need to fix it (I suspect SMB v1 and SMB v2/3 are somehow involved). What ever is going on I have to assume that some memory location or some flag is not resetting on reboot and that confuses
 windows unless the netcfg /d command is ran prior to reboot (It's my understanding this command resets almost everything network wise to default and then Windows rebuilds everything on restart).

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now open <strong>Control Panel

    <title>Disabling the irritating windows 10 update icon in taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling the irritating windows 10 update icon in taskbar</h2>
                    <p>I want to disable the windows 10 update icon in the task bar that keeps popping up a box saying to reserve my copy of windows 10. I am using windows 7 and do not wish to upgrade presently. I am aware that it may be possible to disable it by uninstalling
 and then hiding a certain update. However I did this previously and a new update came in and it reappeared again. I see no point in battling the upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to suggest to microsoft to put a right click menu option on the windows 10 upgrade icon, to disable upgrade reminder messages and possibly also to hide the windows 10 upgrade icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would end a lot of irritation from these continuous upgrade messages that I really don't need to see, I am aware that there is a windows 10, there is no point in reminding me because I already know about it from the first time I saw it not the further
 many times each day it seems to pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I am worried about the windows 10 comment that is says it has more ads targeted to you in windows 10. I don't want any ads. Why would I ever upgrade if I don't have to yet, just to get ads distracting me that I don't want? I'd rather wait and pay later
 when I upgrade one day, in order to avoid the ads.</p>

            <p>Dear Microsoft, as an IT person taking care of hundreds of PC and Notebooks it is of my&nbsp;concern&nbsp;to be pushed&nbsp;into the upgrade to Windows 10. We have to constantly ask all the&nbsp;users on the existing Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 platforms&nbsp;to not run the upgrade to Windows
 10. Most of the users do not understand how to do&nbsp;a upgrade, they do not have the time, do not have the internet bandwidth or internet at all. This is for us IT specialists such a time consuming task to do all the updates and now we have to worry about the
 Windows 10 upgrade as well. Even going to the&nbsp;registry&nbsp;and removing all the Get Windows&nbsp;10 (X ) subroutines it comes back after a week or so.&nbsp;Why can't this update just be removed or disabled&nbsp;? Surly we should have a choice what software to run on our computers
 and not to be pushed into updates that are totally not needed or relevant to&nbsp;our users. What is the point&nbsp;and who at Microsoft decided that all the perfectly working operating systems should be upgraded to Windows 10. This worries me a lot not to have a choice
 with software we paid for.&nbsp;There is no&nbsp;Icon telling you to upgrade your Office 2013 to the latest updates, it stays the users choice at all times. Microsoft please remove this GWX update icon&nbsp;or give us a choice&nbsp;to remove the irritating Icon from the Task
 Bar.</p>

    <title>Achievements not unlocking or Tracking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glov3zy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Achievements not unlocking or Tracking</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>REF NUMBER -&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having an issue unlocking achievements. I fulfill the criteria for an achievement yet there is no pop. After being passed around here, there and everywhere by Xbox Customer support, I am posting in here hoping for support. I am always met by the response
 of 'wait', after waiting sufficient time (5days) I decided to call again and go through the rigmarole of deleting account, booting from a USB, unlocking achievements on other games and now finally restoring the system to factory settings and re-downloading
 all of the games and add ons I have purchased, I am absolutely fed up! I have now been waiting around a week. It is beyond a joke now, for a £429 investment (+ around that in games and add ons), I at least expect the console to let me play video games and
 unlock the achievements (the reason for my purchase of a new console).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have unlocked around 6 achievements in Wolfenstein the new order, a bunch in COD:GHOSTS and 1 in each of; Outlast, Worms and Trials. I also have around 3 games that I have bought and am ready to play in the 3 week window of my summer that I can devote
 to play games which has now been ruined by the complete lack of support and help afforded to me by the Xbox team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My profile seems to be the issue, not the console itself. The man on the phone at Xbox support said that I hadn't been online for around a week, at that point (2days ago) and now, I am online on my xbox unable + unwilling to get my teeth stuck into the plethora
 of games at my disposal.</p>
<p>Please, please, please help me sort this out. It is a real kick in the teeth for someone that has championed microsoft and xbox for years and am beginning to feel disillusioned and regretting my choice of next-gen console (can't believe it has driven me
 to question this!).</p>

<p>Matt</p>

            <p>Hey there, Glov3zy! I am sincerely sorry to see that your achievements aren't popping for some games. I can assure you that we are still working on it. I have bubbled up your information to the right team. Once I have some more information, I will post it up here.<br /><br />If you could, can you post up the exact achievements that you are seeing at 100% but don't have the achievements for and the time/date that you unlocked them on, I would really appreciate it. Then I can send that information off, too.<br /><br />Again, incredibly sorry to see that you've been affected by this. We really do appreciate your patience with us while we're working this out! :)</p>

<p>Hiya :)</p>
<p>After restoring my console to factory settings, it has enabled me to unlock achievements again. It has not however, awarded me the gamerscore for the achievements I completed whilst I was experiencing this issue.
</p>
<p>I me the criteria for a few achievements (none are displaying as 100% complete as many of them are for doing 1 thing and the tracking system was not working when I unlocked them).
</p>
<p>Trials Fusion - Silver Spoon Squirrels achievement </p>
<p>Wolfenstein the New Order - Wyatt Saved, Endurance II, Grenade pouch ++, Bullseye, Rocket Magazine + and Sentinel achievements</p>
<p>Worms Battlegrounds - Prod Off and Untouchable</p>
<p>Zoo Tycoon - Close to the Animals</p>
<p>Cod GHOSTS - A bunch of secret achievements relating to the Aliens game type </p>
<p>Hope this helps and thank you for actually addressing my issue, was beginning to lose faith.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for the quick reply! I am wondering if you are able to try any of those again. When we had the service alert up, the achievements that were showing as 0% were showing as a certain percentage before the alert went up. Since yours is mostly for something that was previously at 0%, but you tried earning while the service alert was on the site, I'd like to see if we can try to get those again.<br /><br />I do understand the annoyance that it is to have me say to try them again (and I feel bad for asking). I get really frustrated when I have to try things over and over. I just want to make sure that it either pops for you or at least shows at 100% before I pass this little bit of information up.</p>

<p>I just killed Diablo in Diablo III Ultimate Evil Edition and didn't unlock the Prime Evil achievement for killing him. Stuck on 100% and locked. Got the achievement for completing all quests in act IV - which includes killing Diablo. Ridiculous.</p>
<p>This issue with achievements not unlocking is becoming a serious embarrassment for Microsoft. The issue was supposed to be fixed by the start of August but still exists. I seriously hope heads are soon going to roll in the department responsible for this.</p>
<p>I mean, what is going on? It's out of proportions. I recently learned that people who bought an Xbox One after the August update was released couldn't play any disc games on it. And shortly after people weren't able to download what they had just purchased
 and paid for in the store. And then there's this infuriating ongoing achievements issue. Makes me just want to pack up the Xbox One and return to proper gaming on the 360.</p>
<p>"The power of the Xbox One" ... Please, don't insult us. This console is just one big embarrassing and pathetic mistake.</p>

<p>Hi there, I've been having problems unlocking achievements on the Xbox One since last week and thought that they were fixed. However, when I looked at my Skylanders Swap Force achievements today it says I'm at 99% even though all the achievements are unlocked.
 I was wondering if there was anything I could do to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello, unfortunately I need to add myself to this list as well. In Lego Hobbit the achievement for completing the game at 100% did not unlock. Also during game play some achievements did not appear on the screen that I earned them but looking back on my
 overall achievements found them unlocked. Any help in this matter is appreciated.

<p>I'm having the same issue, except with the "It's a trap" achievement on Titanfall for XBox One. &nbsp;I've completed it multiple times and it shows as completed but it won't unlock. &nbsp;I haven't had issues with other achievements not unlocking, just this one. &nbsp;I've
 tried hard resetting my console, unplugging it for a few minutes, recovering my gamertag on another console and meeting the achievement requirements again and the achievement still won't unlock. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated, thanks.</p>

<h2>            I cannot delete a Skype Related file.</h2>
                    I recently tried to log into Skype on my computer, and all that happened was I got the Disc I/O Error.
<div>As a test, I tried to log into a different account, and it worked fine, but I tried to log into my account afterwards, and the same problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I went into the Skype folder in AppData -&gt; Roaming and tried to delete all of the files inside it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything deleted, EXCEPT for a folder which was called what my Skype login name is called. I clicked on it, and deleted everything inside it, and everything went EXCEPT a file called "main" (Type: DB File)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to log into my Skype account but I think I will not be able to unless I can get this file/folder off my PC, any suggestions and ideas are appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If it helps, my PC is an Alienware X51</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thanks.</div>

            <div>Run ATF-Cleaner and CCcleaner, free sharewares available on internet for download, in your system for broken registry links , clearing cache and temporary internet files etc.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can download Ccleaner a freeware&nbsp;registry&nbsp;cleaning software either from filehippo.com and then install it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Run Cclean and let it scan all the registry related issues. It shall scan all incomplete and unistalled&nbsp;programs. Once&nbsp;scanning&nbsp;completed then apply fixes and hopefully it shall solve your problem. Thanks</div>

            <p>Under no circumstances use a Registry Cleaner on your Operating System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They may do more harm than any good they claim to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how&nbsp;I advise about using CCleaner:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Free CCleaner Program:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Under NO condition use the Registry cleaning Option in CCleaner</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
