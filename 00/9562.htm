<p>hi patrickgilbert</p>
<p>no, the in-place hold feature is not related to the retention period of the emails that you can recover in the exchange online server.</p>
<p>as i mentioned above, by default, the emails stay 30 days in deleted item, 14 days in recover deleted item, and 14 days in the purge folder. if you extend the retention period of the recover deleted items to 30 days, the emails can be recovered within 74
 days (deleted item stay 30 days + recover deleted item 30 days + purge folder 14 days) at most.</p>
<p>if the in-place hold feature is available, when you are using ediscovery search to get the emails back, you can “hold indefinitely” or “specify number of days to hold items relative to their received date” in the exchange online server. the content of the
 results can be retained in exchange online server until the hold expires.<br />

<h2>            Sent emails being deleted</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emails in my Sent folder keep disappearing. This was happening before outlook.com existed. I signed up for Hotmail.com in 2001. The most recent email in my sent folder is from 2007 though I have never deleted anything from the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted this question a few years back and have yet to get a satisfactory answer. I did everything they said in this post and the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/email/large-gaps-of-missing-emails-in-my-hotmail-sent/92dcfc03-fd0e-440a-a242-404f85f647bb</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no rules set up to delete mails or otherwise. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I change my password regularly so I don't think my account is compromised. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have "Save all sent messages in the Sent Items folder" option selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I keep losing sent emails as time goes on?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned, emails from the sent folder of Outlook.com keep disappearing. Let us know the answers of the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Are you using any browser to access the emails or you are accessing the emails through any email&nbsp;client?<br />
2.&nbsp;Which device you use to access your Outlook.com emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a limit storing sent emails in sent folder, this might be one of the reason as suggested by one of our moderator in your previous question, “When you use the email recovery feature and the emails were not restored, the messages that you were looking
 for are already beyond retrieval because it's possible that emails were already purged from our system”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide us the information’s required for further assistance. &nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Debarshi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>1.&nbsp;Are you using any browser to access the emails or you are accessing the emails through any email&nbsp;client?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Throughout the years, I have used browers (IE, Firefox, Chrome) and Outlook client. there was a point I was using POP3 many years ago but I stopped that close to a decade ago. So that would not account for the majority of the missing emails.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><em>2.&nbsp;Which device you use to access your Outlook.com emails?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I have only ever used desktops or laptops to access emails. I don't use a tablet or phone for email.</li></ul>
<p>You mention that there is a limit to storing sent emails in the folder. What it the limit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, just to be clear, I have never actively deleted any of these emails. This has happened without any action taken on my part. At this point, I believe the emails are gone. My main concern is determining why the emails continue to be deleted and how
 I can prevent it from happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>No, they are not there. While I do use an email client at home, at work I log onto outlook.com. In both places, the emails are gone. This was true when I was logging into hotmail.com as well.

<h2>            Battery problem with N73...</h2>
                    Hello Friends, I purchased an N73 last month. Using it mostly for music and photos. The problem is that the battery gets discharged pretty fast. With a full battery, I find that it gets fully dead within 2 days. I am told that it should work more than
 that and would like to know if this is the case with other users also. Bluetooth, infrared are all switched off, but no change. Should I be contacting Nokia for a checkup? Pls let me know.

            Working with photos and listening to music a lot will drain the battery much more quickly. According to the specifications, you will get 12.6 hours of music playback from a full battery.

            Ok try this:<br />
<br />
Leave the phone till it's totally dead (when it switch off by itself) when all the battery is gone.<br />
<br />
Then charge it from there and don't turn on the phone, till you have a full charge then you have a full charged phone.<br />
<br />
You may think this is stupid but if you do this a couple of times it streches battery life and then you don't have to charge it for long

            Try to turn off:<br />
<br />
3G(Dual Mode) - Set your network setting to GSM. Since it will save as much 20-40% of battery life.<br />
<br />
Screensaver-It'll just waste the juice.<br />
<br />
Check if theres an open application.<br />
<br />
Try to Enable :<br />
<br />
Power Saver Mode<br />
Sleep Mode<br />
__________________________________________________________<br />
Set your brightness settings to middle part,just make sure that you can see it even on dark places.This will also save the battery for about 10-20% even on a heavy use.<br />
(It can affect your vision,so make sure that theres enough brightness/light to work with.)<br />
<br />
HEEEYYY!!!

If the battery had got discharged during music playback and camera operations, I would not have had any issues. But the problem is that even with no applications running, a fully charged battery gets wiped out completely. Pls let know if you have some suggestions.

            Hello,<br />
I found that most of the battery was being used by some applications that were still active. A functionality similar to the Windows Task Manager is available on the N73 also which you can access by pressing the vertical button on the left hand side (above the
 pencil icon) for a long time. This will show all the applications that are open "by mistake". Select them and close them. Next time you close any application, keep checking this to ensure that there are no open applications.<br />
<br />
I have found that after doing this, the battery life has increased dramatically. I now listen to music for 3-4 days, play games and the battery holds good.<br />
<br />
All the best<br />
<br />
<br />

</p><p>In the second submission I provided screenshots as well as an explanation of it being detected as a PUA but was completely brushed off:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/submission/017acc37-248f-4373-8703-df8eb09b9171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/submission/017acc37-248f-4373-8703-df8eb09b9171</a></p>
<p>As you can see in this second submission, whoever on the Windows Defender team that looked at this submission cannot read and thought I was submitting an inquiry for a new detection - it clearly says "Incorrect detection" in my submission. This is beginning
 to turn into a waste of my time and patience, I am asking if someone competent can help look into this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<strong>Mike</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since PUA(Potentially Unwanted Application) protection feature allows Windows Defender to detect and block certain apps that are not categorized as threats, but they increase the chances of your device being infected with malware or it may affect your device's
 performance. That might be the reason why the PUA protection feature detects the software.&nbsp;In the case that the feature blocks an application you know that can be trusted, you may follow these steps to allow the app:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the start menu, type Window Defender security center and press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>On the pop-up window, select <strong>Virus and threat protection</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Threat history</strong> option.</li><li>Under <em>Quarantined threats</em>, select the <strong>file</strong>, and click&nbsp;<strong>Restore</strong> button.</li></ol>
<p><em>Note: You can also click the <strong>Remove </strong>button to get rid of the unwanted app and other infected files.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the steps above, it will restores the app to its original location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for you to post back. </p>

<p>The true reason you're unlikely to receive a response to your request is that it was submitted anonymously, while; "<a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2015/11/25/shields-up-on-potentially-unwanted-applications-in-your-enterprise/?source=mmpc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The

<p>
</p><p>Since the PUA protection is only supported for the use of enterprise customers and an anonymous submission can't be identified with the representative of such an organization, the assumption is that you are simply an unsupported consumer or&nbsp;other user who's
 enabled PUA protection using a method that also isn't supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The detection screenshot you provided indicates the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=PUA%3aWin32%2fInstallCore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 the precise reason for the detection might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point the submission responses are trying to make is that there is simply no malware detection being made for this item, not that it isn't included in the detections related to PUA, since that's not something that anyone other than a registered&nbsp;enterprise

<p>
</p><p>You quite simply won't receive the response you'd like to get without the proper credentials, since there's no reason for Microsoft to waste their time or effort on anyone else.&nbsp; Microsoft doesn't support the PUA protection feature for other than enterprise

<p>
</p><p>So you're saying that because I am not an Enterprise customer - it won't be acknowledged as a false positive because I'm not important enough to inquire about PUAs. I would argue that the type of detection, PUA or otherwise, if false should be acknowledged
 and corrected regardless of who reports it. The point of any submission system such as this one is to improve the product or service - it shouldn't matter from whom or where the report comes from. Restrictions like this only serve to be anti-consumer in the
 end, regardless if it is an Enterprise customer or regular customer.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm saying that if you register as a consumer, the only testing likely to be done is that for detection as malware, since the PUA protection isn't supported for consumers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can argue as you wish, but the systems in place won't typically perform in the way you prefer, but rather as they are designed, with consumer submissions limited to malware detections.&nbsp; Regardless of what is written in the text of the submission, I wouldn't
 expect anything different, especially since I suspect that most of these submissions are processed automatically by an AI engine rather than a human.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround offered by Justine might allow you to bypass these systems and push your request through via feedback, since that's an exception system designed for exactly that purpose.&nbsp;Of course, that assumes the Defender team will process such a request
 brought in from the side by a consumer, but this has a better possibility of success than continuing to submit the file directly&nbsp;as an anonymous consumer.</p>

<h2>            Transfer files from PC to Windows Mobile 7 Phone</h2>
                    How do you transfer files from a&nbsp;PC hardrive onto a Windows Phone 7? For example, how do you transfer a Word document from a PC so that it is placed on the phone and available for editing. Also how&nbsp;do you download programs.&nbsp;With Windows 6 phones you could
 drag and drop on the PC through anctivesync.&nbsp;I used book reading programs etc which I was able to install directly on my Windows 6 phone. How do you do that given that you can't see the WIndows 7 phone on the PC? I understand the Marketplace is for apps downloads.
 What about stuff that you want to download outside of the marketplace? &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi ja.mr,</p>
<p>The first and option is to email the files to yourself. Once you download the files as attachments, you can open them in their respective Office 2010 apps, and then choose the "Save As" command from the bottom menu in order to save the files to your Office
 Hub. <br />
&nbsp; <br />
The next way is to save your documents on SkyDrive as part of your Windows Live account. The Windows Phone 7 Office Hub does not currently support syncing with SkyDrive directly, however if you browse to your SkyDrive folder using Internet Explorer on Windows
 Phone 7 (while in "mobile" view mode), you'll be able to download the files to your device and subsequently "Save As" into the Office Hub just like you would if you emailed them to yourself. Unfortunately there's no way to save the files back to SkyDrive.</p>
<p>The third way to get Office documents into Windows Phone 7 is actually via OneNote 2010. On the desktop, OneNote 2010 supports attaching documents to OneNote pages. So if you're working on a project and some of your notes reference a specific document, you
 can just attach that document to your OneNote page. Now if you've got your OneNote notebook syncing with SkyDrive… and also syncing with Windows Phone 7, then those attached documents will show up as icons in OneNote Mobile on Windows Phone 7.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Unfortunately, as with all of these methods, document attachments in OneNote are read-only. So while you will be able to open documents attached to OneNote pages, you won't be able to save them back into OneNote (which does sync with SkyDrive).</p>
<p>In all of these cases, if you want to make edits to any of the Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files, you'll have to "Save as" into the Office Hub where they'll remain until you email them to someone else.</p>
<p>You can find further information in this link</p>

    <title>Putting two 8.5x11 pages on a 17x11 page in MS Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwoodbury  say:</h3>
<h2>            Putting two 8.5x11 pages on a 17x11 page in MS Word</h2>
                    I am trying to make a booklet. I have all my pages in a word document on 8.5x11 pages but would like to be able to put two of those pages on one 17x11 page. I have seen the options for printing as a booklet from MS Word and pdf files but I want to send
 this to an outside printer that does not give that option. So I want to sort the pages manually so the first page has pages 32 and 1, the second has 2 and 3, etc. I've tried changing the page size to 17x11 and using the page setup option where you select 2
 pages per sheet. This just shows two separate 8.5x11 pages and if I give that to the printer, there is no indication that two pages should be on one side of a 17x11. Assuming that I need to send the printer a file with the pages exactly as they should look
 printed, is there a way that I can do this?

            <p>Although "2 pages per sheet" as you have used it would print the pages 2-up, in your case the correct solution is to use the "Book fold" setting, which will order the pages in the correct order automatically. When the book is complete, print it to PDF and
 give the PDF to the printer. Or you can output the Letter pages directly to PDF and let the printer handle imposition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that by "outside printer" you mean a person or company, don't think that you have to provide the pages in booklet form. Most printers are quite capable of making up the pages as needed (it helps, of course, if they are numbered), but they will be
 able to tell from your file the required order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although Word displays "2 pages per sheet" or "Book fold" as separate pages, they do print 2-up. For more, see

<p>I'm just a bit uncomfortable with the fact that this company that I'm looking at has a near non existent return policy for errors and no option for printing in booklet form. There is an additional note box which may be where I put that information. Thanks

<h2>            Power Query - Data imported not matching Source</h2>
                    <p>Hello - I'm having an issue that I can seem to figure out.&nbsp; I'm using Power Query to import data from various files.&nbsp; Some of the data after importing and even in the Preview is not matching the source data.&nbsp; The source data is coming from Excel files.&nbsp;
 A lot of the source data cells are formulas.</p>
<p>Any thoughts as to why it would not import the visible calculated data in the source?&nbsp; Thanks</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;bryantmik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the trouble it has caused. I tested some queries and I cannot get the same behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some suggestions you can try first:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Save the Excel file as CSV and see if the value of 5/11/19 in<strong> TotCO WF $ Sls</strong> column is correct in the CSV file. This way we can know whether the issue is related to the source workbook.</p>
<p>2. Copy all the data from the source workbook and paste them into a blank new one see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the image you shared, I think the issue probably lies on the Source Workbook. The
<strong>Sales $ Hardkey</strong> column and the&nbsp;<strong>TotCO WF $ Sls</strong> has same value(Almost all of them) except for the
<strong>5/11/19</strong> row. Can you check the how does it calculate the <strong>
$41</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<h2>            You may not use references to external worksheets or workbooks for data validation criteria.</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to create a drop down list using data validation in Excel 2003 using cells from another workbook following the instructions in Help.&nbsp; However, when I put the name reference into the Allow field, I get the error: "You may not use references to
 external worksheets or workbooks for data validation criteria."</p>
<p>I checked the KB and found Article 211548 that deals with the error; however, the workaround describes validation of a number and not a list.&nbsp; I can get validation using data from an external workbook to work&nbsp;with a non-list type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could create a form/macro to do the validation using a combo-box; but, it certainly seems like I should be able to&nbsp;do this with a data validation drop down list&nbsp;using data from another workbook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Create a name with a formula that refers to the other workbook:</p>
<p>MyList =[file2.xls]Sheet1!$A$1:$A$7</p>
<p>and use the name in your data validation list:</p>
<p>=MyList</p>
<p>But make sure the second workbook is open, otherwise the data validation list did not work.</p>

Any solutions and fixed? </p>

</p><p>Also, it keeps saying Catalyst Control Center is not working.</p>

<h2>            How to open shared group calendar on all devices</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>In relation to my previous thread (https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/158/p/440532/1125668#1125668)...</p>

<p>We would like to be able to open and edit the shared group calendar on iPhone and Android devices as well. How can we do that?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Lord,</p>
<p>To access the shared calendar on mobile devices, we recommend you use OWA for iPhone or OWA for Android.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Since OWA for iPhone or OWA for Android will sync with OWA, after adding the shared calendar in
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OWA</a>, you can access it on OWA for iPhone or OWA for Android too.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

            <p>Not sure about that PI - SBB but what I can tell you that the forums are a great place for support and when a device does reach its "end of life", there is always support here for issues.&nbsp; That is what this community is all about - users helping users!</p>
<p>If history has anything to do with it, I would expect that updates to a device generally stop when a new OS appears ALTHOUGH I have seen devices that were old get the updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Excel - Fill cells based on matched value in array from another worksheet</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm attempting to populate a column in sheet1 with names from sheet2 column B based on matching a value within an array of cells in sheet2 (f2:i45) and returning the cell value from sheet2 column B of the same row the data was found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example...</p>
<p>The value in cell C5 exists on sheet2 in the given range, however it evaluates to #N/A (maybe because they're not ordered?). &nbsp;So, because it stops there I don't get to see if it will return the correct value from the B1:B545 range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=INDEX(sheet2!$B$1:$B$545,MATCH(C5, sheet2!$F$2:$I$545,0))</p>

<h2>            Error 0x80246017 on update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>i've seen many treads about it, but it quickly end in a streak of "me too", and contributions get lost in the flood.</p>
<p>So i'm opening this one and <strong>i'd ask to anyone facing the same issue to NOT post for a "me too" or that kind of comments. PLEASE keep it clean.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the error happens when i try to update. I'm on build 10074, and I have this error since 10122 was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i can tell about my computer:</p>
<p>-Installed windows 10 on top of unactivated windows 8. </p>
<p>-Start menu and cortana are broken since 10074 was released.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong>I can NOT enter my password in UAC on another account (it says wrong password while i'm 100% sure it's the right one.) I can't log into another session either, password incorrect (can log in guest tho)</p>
<p>-registry looks like that&nbsp;http://puu.sh/i7kK7/7ca25be70f.png. I tried to delete stuffs, and it never made a difference
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">(only once, only deleted thresholdOptedin and the update started for a few % and then stopped with same error)</span></p>
<p>-I tried to fix windows update (with tools and manually deleting the downloads folder)</p>
<p>-I tried reset</p>
<p>-I currently use 1 SSD (system) and 1 HDD(2 parts, one with win8 system)</p>
<p>-tried the "rundll32.exe pnpclean.dll,RunDLL_PnpClean /DRIVERS /MAXCLEAN" and other commands with no result.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">-tried :</p>

<p>
</p><p>I probably forgot a few things but don't hesitate to ask, i'll provide any information that can help. My best lead is with the unactivated windows 8 as basis or the UAC bug... but i don't know how to investigate that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE do not reply if you don't bring anything to the topic. thank you.</p>

<p>Just did everything on the list, no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing that gave some error are the regsvr32 comands, some of them gave that kind of error&nbsp;http://puu.sh/i7BfD/ca648c56eb.png (had like 8 errors from the list.)</p>
<p>and "Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak" returned a denied access error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the problems are still here.<br />
Edit: that's new. After doing all that i ran those commands</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability" /v "BranchName" /d "fbl_impressive" /t REG_SZ /f</span><br />

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">to set the register value to what they are supposed to be (if i'm not mistaken? can you tell me if they are correct?)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Since I did that, windows update asks me for admin rights like 5 times in a row whenever i click advanced options. However, still the same error code.</span></p>

            <p>That is a known bug from build 10120. That is stated in the known <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/05/29/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-10130-for-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Gariel Aul</a>. The reason-you upgraded from another Windows installation &amp; there was a bug in licensing.</p>
<p>Your only choice is to stay in the Slow Ring or perform a clean install of build 10174 &amp; after that opt for the Fast Ring.<br />

            On a second thought, since your license is already attached to your MS account, if you choose to perform a clean install, you might need to create a second MS account. Another option is to find a download link with the 10130 ISO and perform a clean install
 with it.

            Yes, you will have to create one, if you install build 10147 and try to update to 10130. It seems though, despite some bugs (serious in nature, but seemingly affecting only a small part of users), that 10130 will be pushed to the Slow Ring, so an official
 ISO would be available. In that case you can use your current account.

<h3> trevor jones &#40;support&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does O365 Business Premium now include in-place archiving accessible from Outlook and not just OWA&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The subject is pretty self explanatory. Basically I need archiving accessible from the Outlook client not just OWA. Currently we have an Exchange Enterprise E3 plan but don't really need unlimited archiving, 50GB mailbox and 50GB online archive would be
 fine, but would want to be able to access from Outlook and not just OWA. Is it now possible with Business Premium's Outlook client?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any info would be much appreciated, it doesn't seem clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trevor</p>

<p>Hi Trevor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office 365 online archive ( it is also called archive mailbox in office 365) feature are available in the several office 365 for business subscriptions, like Office 365 Business Premium, Office 365 Business Essentials etc. For more information, you can
 refer to the article ( Exchange Online limits) I shared above &gt; Mailbox storage limits &gt; &nbsp; Archive mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, if the online archive is available in your own office 365 for business plan,&nbsp; you can try to involve your admin to help you enable the archive mailbox for your own office 365 mailbox, after that you would be able to access it in the outlook client
 or on the web app.<span>&nbsp; </span>For more information, please refer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Enable archive mailboxes in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other concern, please feel free to let me know, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

<p>Yes, HDD (look here:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive</a> ) is PC's primary data storage which contains (Windows) operating system, user applications and
 user data files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is good idea to copy all your own data (normally stored in C:\Users\UserName) to external USB-stick or external HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More effective way is to create full backup of whole HDD using some free 3rd party backup / image software like Macrium Reflect or EaseUS ToDo Backup (search by name). They have also good instructions on their Web pages.</p>

            &nbsp;I strongly agree with Pauli O.&nbsp; I've been using both the backup programs he mentions for several years, and never had a problem with either one.&nbsp; Anything with moving parts can and will fail eventually so if you don't want to lose your data and have to
 reinstall Windows, by all means make backups.

                    <p>The facebook app is no way near android/iOS version, missing lot of features. Such as, no reply comment, can't edit a post, can't see any files in a group, very poor stickers, can't create a photo album, no feeling etc etc. I am quite surprised why the developer
 isn't looking after this issue? I wish i could get a satisfactory answer.<br />

            <p>Let's hope this all changes&nbsp;with Windows 10 mobile. As MS will be releasing windows bridges for Android and iOS&nbsp;(Tool to re-use Android/iOS app code to make a Windows app with very less changes), Facebook and other developers may consider releasing a ported
 app on par with other platform features.</p>

            WMDC is meant to be used with Vista, Outlook and a Windows Mobile device.&nbsp; The Samsung Propel is not a Windows Mobile device so you cannot sync it with your PC using WMDC.
