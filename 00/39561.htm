<h2>            Unable to open Dropbox file sent to me</h2>
                    <p>I received a file in my yahoo.ca email box. The file shows that it is shared by Dropbox. When I click the button to open the file, my Gmail account shows up. Why does my Dropbox did not open to receive this file?</p>
<p>I downloaded the file, but none of the application listed by Microsoft allows me to open the file.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Account acting weird....</h2>
                    
<p>Not sure what to make of this. &nbsp; Today my usual gamertag wouldnt let me in, but another profile was allowed to sign in and play. &nbsp;I checked my e-mail first to see if I'd had any strange updates, and then found that 5600 xbox points had been purchased (no
 one in the house bought points). &nbsp; I checked my online bill, and then discovered the points had been refunded. &nbsp; Ok, but the profile issue is still unsolved. &nbsp;I've sent a message to the xbox people and haven't heard back yet. &nbsp;They probably busy, and I figured
 I'd see if anyone else had seen anything like this.</p>

<h2>            how to boot from an external hard drive</h2>
                    I want to use an external hard drive to boot first from my laptop running win 7. I did go into Bios setting and change which hard drive to boot first. After doing so and rebooted. The laptop gets stuck on the &nbsp;run F2 setup &nbsp;or hit tab type screen which
 is a gray screen then it just stays there.I have 2 hard drives that I have tried and both are the same. I &nbsp;was told I need to reinstall the bootloader. Can anyone help me out? I need to make recovery disks from these drives. They did work in my laptops. &nbsp;I
 have to take the whole laptop apart to replace these hard drives because they are under the keyboard. I really do not want to do this. Can anyone help me out? I do not know about the bootloader at all. I have even tried searching it on my other laptop and
 it did not find it. help

    <title>Games still playable if delisted&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Games still playable if delisted&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is something I've been wondering and trying to work out. I've read that&nbsp;<em>Need For Speed: Most Wanted (2005)</em> was apparently on the backwards compatibility list, but isn't anymore. For me, this is a game I&nbsp;really want to play again and I&nbsp;don't want to spend extra money on a 360. My main question though, is if a delisted game is still playable via a digital copy of the game. Anybody happen to know? (This is to be completely sure on this, because I'm still getting used to backwards compatibility.)</p>

<p>Renewals occur on the anniversary of the initial purchase. Payments are pushed through 3 days in advance to avoid billing issues that would break your subscription. If you purchased the subscription on May 2, 2018 at 1:00 AM in the morning, the monthly minutes
 would refresh at ~1:00 AM in the morning on June 2, 2018. If the initial purchase was made at 11:00 PM at night, it would renew at 11:00 PM at night. Renewing minutes any later or earlier, violates your monthly cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot recall when you made the initial purchase, it will more than likely renew by the end of the day in your time zone/GMT (11:59 PM) June 2, 2018.</p>

                    Hi guys, I have the 4gb Xbox and went out and got the official 320gb hard drive to expand the storage. But when I took it out the box and fitted it into the designated slot my Xbox is not showing it. I have fitted it, it clicked.. And even removed it and

<span>Hi Dreamy. Sorry to hear about your troubles, lets see if I can be of some assistance.</span>
<span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../hard-drive</a></span>
<span>That's the official Xbox Support page on the Hard Drive not being detected.</span>
<span>If your Xbox 360 console doesn't detect an attached hard drive, try the following:</span>
<span>Turn your console off and then on again.</span>
<span>Make sure that your hard drive is installed correctly by removing and adding your hard drive back again.</span>
<span>If you have another hard drive, try it with your console.</span>
<span>Replace your hard drive. You can order a replacement Xbox 360 Hard Drive from the Xbox Online Service Center.</span>
<span>Note Console registration is required to replace a hard drive under warranty.</span>
<span>If these steps don’t resolve the problem, repair your console (sign in with your Microsoft account, if prompted).</span>
<span>Was the Hard Drive new? Do you have your receipt?</span>
<span>There is a very small chance that the Hard Drive might be corrupt if the above trouble shooting doesn't work, in which case, I'd take the HDD back and exchange it for a brand new one.</span>
<span>Hope this helps.</span>
<span>Regards,</span>
<span>Cryptic</span>

<h2>            Cannot change drive in file history windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I seem unable to change the external drive that file history is meant to use.&nbsp; I changed the drive volume name and size slightly, however I get the following errors:</p>
<p>1. It keeps showing the previous external drive details, with "unknown error" below it</p>
<p>2. When I try to select another drive, I get an error message box stating "we can't copy files to this location.&nbsp; your current File History drive is disconnected.&nbsp; Reconnect the drive and try again".&nbsp; If I press "run now", it again asks that I reconnect
 the drive, and will copy files to a hard drive...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned back on Windows Search as was suggested as a possible fix, that has not got things working again...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is critical.&nbsp; I need some manner of backup.&nbsp; Please help ASAP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I had this problem yesterday but I think it was because of the confusing message File History puts up.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>(Apologies if this is all vague but it's from memory)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I changed my mind about what I was doing with File History and changed something about the drive. When I did that I got a message...something about detecting a previous version of file History and did I want to use it Yes/No. I kept on clicking "Yes" thinking
 it was detecting the started backup on the drive and thinking it was asking me if I wanted to continue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When in fact what it was saying was it knew I had previously started and it wanted the old drive. So every time I connected and clicked "Yes", it wanted the "old drive" and all it could see was a drive that was new to it. When I finally on the 5th try
 clicked "No" it worked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>“we can't copy files to this location.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your current File History drive is disconnected.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reconnect the drive and try again”&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think I read that as meaning "we can't copy files to this location [because there's something wrong with the drive you're pointing to]" when actually it was saying it can't find your old drive and you asked us to get files from it.</div>

            <blockquote>
<p>Thanks! I guess the TL;DR version is "to change your file history drive you need to discard the current temp files."</p>
</blockquote>
Exactly :)
<div><br />
<div>It's the bad wording in the messages.</div>
<div><br />
<div>the first message (which I can only&nbsp;vaguely&nbsp;remember so can't quote exactly) that gives you the impression you can continue
<i>something </i>but doesn't make clear that to so will need the "old drive" configured the way the "old drive" was.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then the next message is just confusing:</div>
<div><b>“we can't copy files to this location.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your current File History drive is disconnected.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reconnect the drive and try again”&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>sounds like&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>“we can't copy files to this location.</b> [because there's a problem with the new location]</div>
<div><b>Your current File History drive is disconnected.</b> [the new location is disconnected]</div>
<div><b>Reconnect the drive and try again</b> [reconnect your new location and try again]”&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When it should be reworded to say something along the lines of (in more formal language):</div>
<div><br />
<div>"You asked us to continue...give us the drive you were previously using...or if it's no longer available, click here to start from scratch"</div>
<div><br />
<div>(I know that's all the opposite of tldr but I'm trying again to put into words what I think was happening).</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Xbox app on Android phone signs me out of Xbox Live on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Ever since the most recent update on my Android phone for the Xbox app, I will be"signed in elsewhere" on my Xbox One if I so much as start the app on my phone. This is incredibly annoying as I often use the app for various things that I don't regularly
 do on my Xbox One, such as pasting admin commands for Ark: Survival Evolved.</p>
<p>When I am "signed in elsewhere" it of course rips me from everything that is happening on my Xbox One, making the app not only useless, but a complete hindrance. This NEVER happened before the new Xbox app. I have tried the forums here, and even google searches
 for the past month, and it seems as though I am the only person with this issue?</p>
<p>Please help or offer any advice you can. Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hey there GCS RyGuy!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the trouble you're having with signing in and out of Xbox Live when your Xbox App device connects. Are you currently part of the Xbox One Update Preview by chance? If so let's get you over on the Xbox One Update Preview Forums so that the right team is aware of your trouble. While this issue is happening when your Android device signs in, it's still worth reaching out to the preview team about.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> robotech_master  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 with nVidia graphics card repeatedly crashing, requiring system restore to restart</h2>
                    This is related to the issue I had at http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/windows-10-keeps-crashing-to-requiring-system/2950a301-7406-41b3-bbed-c44896f98bd7 but since the current version of the issue is more complicated,
 I'm starting fresh.<br />
<br />
I am running 64-bit Windows 10 Build 10240 on my desktop PC. I have an nVidia GeForce GTX 560 video card. Device Manager says my video driver is 10.18.13.5362. I use this to run my primary monitor. I also run a secondary monitor on the Intel HD Graphics card,
 driver 10.18.10.4252, that is built into my motherboard.<br />
<br />
When I leave my computer unattended for a long period of time, the screen freezes up, and nothing I can do on the mouse or keyboard elicits a response. If I leave it unattended for a REALLY long time, I come back to find both my screens are blank, same response.<br />
<br />
Either way, when I turn my computer off and try to restart, I get the swirling windows activity notification, then a completely blank screen on my primary monitor (on the nVidia card), and my second monitor (the Intel) shows no signal. Nothing I can do will
 make the computer do anything. If I power down and reboot again, I get the same response. I have to reboot a third time for Windows to launch its automatic repair, then I have to use "System Restore" to restore the computer to its most recent restore point
 to get it to boot up again.<br />
<br />
I had this problem a few weeks ago in a prior version of Windows, but was able to get it to stop by going into the power settings and setting Windows to "never" sleep or disable the display at all. After I did that, the problem completely stopped happening,
 which leads me to believe it was caused by Windows deactivating the display and it refusing to come back on again.<br />
<br />
However, when I upgraded to the most recent version of Windows, the problem started happening again. If I leave the computer alone for several minutes, it freezes up and I have to restart three times and do a restore to the last restore point. I am puzzled
 as to why this is happening, because the power settings are still set to never sleep or disable the display.<br />
<br />
Is there anything else I should try to get it to stop? It's really annoying. I might try reverting to the previous version of Windows, but wanted to see if there was anything less extreme I might try first.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue could also be related to the
<strong><span>Display drivers and other updates</span></strong>. I want to inform you that&nbsp;updates will be released by Microsoft. So, I would suggest you to keep checking your Windows updates not only important one
 but optional too. If any available try to install them and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First try to install all of the&nbsp;Windows updates available and if issue persists, try to update the Display drivers by following the steps provided in the article mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How
 to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists, then install the drivers for Windows 8/8.1 from the manufacturer's website in compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</span></strong><br />

            <p>I made sure Windows was completely updated, went to the nVidia site, and downloaded the latest version of their drivers. First, I decided I'd try v355.60 for Windows 10. I installed it, and it installed without problems. However, I still had the same behavior
 where if I left the computer alone for a few seconds, it would freeze up and require three restarts and a System Restore to get back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried completely uninstalling the nVidia drivers and installing the Windows 8 version, but when I got there, even when I ran it in compatibility mode as per your instructions, the installer said it wasn't compatible with this version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other advice?<br />

            In my case I discovered that the windows 10 upgrade had installed the 3D drivers when this is not supported on my graphics card<br />
http://www.ghacks.net/2012/12/26/make-sure-you-only-install-nvidia-drivers-you-need/<br />
I removed the two 3D drivers applications and this has significantly improved things, ie I have not had a single crash or freeze in two days.

<h2>            Can I replace a Pirated Windows 10 Home with a Genuine Windows 10 Home&#47;Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I bought this computer of a friend which I believe was a pirated copy of Windows 10 home that had been activated somehow, I then upgraded the computer swapping out the motherboard, GPU and CPU, because of the Motherboard coming out, it needed to activated
 again, naturally I couldn't. So I activated using the MSToolKit and it worked fine and all. But I want to buy a legit copy now. How do I do the full process of replacing this pirated copy?
</p>

            Hi Ryan. your only option is to clean install Windows 10 Home, and purchase a licence for that to make your Windows Legit
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />During the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC'
<br />
<br />Then when Windows 10 is installed, go to the Settings App - Update and Security - Activation.
<br />
<br />From there, you can go to the Store and purchase a Licence . . .

            Hi,
<br />to be fully legal you need to buy Windows 10 box or ESD from Microsoft store, remove current installation and make a full clean install of purchased Windows.
<br />Please note, you may not use Media Creation Tool before you buy a license.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc6a7357-69d3-4f15-85c5-2ef539f7179a?upload=true" />

    <title>What kind of e-mail accounts are NOT web based&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajes97  say:</h3>
<h2>            What kind of e-mail accounts are NOT web based&#63;</h2>
                    A lot of web sites offer an option to contact them via e-mail. When I click on their link to e-mail them, a box pops up saying there is no e-mail associated with this program and I have to create an association in the default programs control panel. When
 I go to that panel, there is no option to use a specific e-mail program. There is a generic option to use your current e-mail program as a default, but that does not work. I mainly use Yahoo as my e-mail client, but some tech guy said web based e-mail won't
 work. What other types of e-mail will work? When I had Vista and earlier versions, when you went to a site and clicked on their link to e-mail them, you automatically had Outlook open up. Now I just get that pain in the butt box that opens up like I described
 before. Can anybody help out there? I run Windows 7 Home Premium.

            <div>All e-mail accounts are Web based. The difference is what you use to fetch 
your mail. A program like Outlook or Windows Mail is an e-mail client and that 
is what your error message is looking for. Yahoo is Webmail and in most 
circumstances, Webmail cannot be made default. This is a workaround that might 
work for you.</div>

            <p>The free upgrade does not have the option to&nbsp;switch architectures, so the architecture will remain the same. If you want to switch architectures, you will have to download the Window 10&nbsp;.ISO file in the appropriate architecture (32 or 64 bit)&nbsp;and perform
 a custom install. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Which edition of Windows 10 will be installed?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The edition of Windows 10 installed will be based on the logical edition of Windows installed,
<em>ie. Windows 8 Core (Single Language) will be upgraded to Windows 10 Home, Windows 7 Professional will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.</em></li></ul>
<p>The free upgrade does not have the option to&nbsp;switch architectures, so the architecture will remain the same. If you want to switch architectures, you will have to download the Window 10&nbsp;.ISO file in the appropriate architecture (32 or 64 bit)&nbsp;and do a custom

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, emails, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords,
 custom dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>

</p><p>You can also download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

<h2>            Problem App creates too many handles, crashes PC, how do I find out why, and stop it&#63;</h2>
                    We have a problem application that creates too many handles( roughly 3000 every 2 seconds), but it only does it with certain PC's that have a conexant on board sound, how do I find out more information on why the handles are consumed at such a rate?(winxpsp3,
 dell optiplex 390)<br />
Application uses a wrapper.exe, and seems to use a lot of Flash/Shockwave/Java. (Active Teach software range by Pearson).<br />
The SYSTEM process handles seem to be created as the registry is constantly being queried for non existant registry keys(relating to the sound card).<br />
The conexant sound card drivers were installed as a local administrator, and updating the BIOS &amp; PC drivers has not yet had any effect.<br />
<br />
Once the handle count starts getting into the Millions, the PC grinds to a halt/crashes(usually takes less than 30 mins!)!<br />
<br />
Any Help, suggestions gratefully accepted,<br />
Many Thanks,<br />
Dave.<br />

            Hi Marge,<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes to your computer after which the issue started?<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span>Code 43 implies that Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems.</span><span>
</span><span>One of the drivers controlling the device notified the operating system that the device failed in some manner.</span>
<br />
</p>
<br />
I'd suggest you follow these steps and check if they help.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span>Let's first open the&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</span></a> to run the automated troubleshooting services.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span>If the troubleshooter does not fix the issue, let’s u</span><span>se Device Manager to disable and re-enable
<strong>all</strong> the USB controllers. This lets the controllers recover the USB port from its unresponsive condition. The USB controllers represent the USB ports in Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<strong>I'd suggest you uninstall and reinstall USB controllers.<br />
</strong>
<p>a.&nbsp;Disconnect all USB devices except keyboard and mouse.<br />
b.&nbsp;Click on start button.<br />
c.&nbsp;Type "devmgmt.msc" and press enter.<br />
d.&nbsp;In the device manager scroll down to the USB Controllers.<br />
e.&nbsp;Right click each one, one-at-a-time, and click Uninstall.<br />
f.&nbsp;Restart your computer now, each USB port will be reinstalled</p>

                    <p>hi I am using Lenovo edge 2 laptop windows 10 preinstalled. After putting the laptop in sleep mode, when I try to wake up the laptop, the laptop starts (as the back light of keypad gets on) but the screen remains in off mode. If this happens than I force
 stop the laptop and than restart the laptop. Except this there is no problem with my lappy.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand from the description that the laptop display does not wake up from sleep and you have to restart the computer to make it run. We will assist you to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may arise due to change in power settings or due to driver corruptions. We will assist you to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As an initial troubleshooting step, </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I suggest you to run the Power troubleshooter and check if it helps.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1. Type <strong>troubleshooting</strong> in the search bar.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>2. Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3. Select <strong>View</strong> <strong>all</strong> on the top left corner.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>4. Click on <strong>Power</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>5. Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>4. In the uninstall dialog, make sure you select the option to delete the driver package from the system. This causes the driver package installed earlier to be deleted.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>5. In the Action menu of Device manager, select “Scan for Hardware changes” option. This will cause the device driver to be reinstalled. Once the driver is installed, close all windows and restart the computer.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;

<p>Live Streaming to YouTube is somewhat more difficult than to say; Twitch because YouTube doesn't fully support livestreaming yet.</p>
<p>For Twitch you'll need a device such as a Roxio GameCap HD PRO which have inputs for both Component and HDMI and support up to 1080p.</p>
<p>These can be had from around £80/$130.</p>
<p>With these you can also use it to convert Component to HDMI, though some HDMI-exclusives, (such as 3D-features in games), will still be dependent on the source.</p>
<p>You'll also need a spare HDMI or Component cable, which will set you back no more than £5/$8.</p>

<p>I Stream using a Hauppauge HD PVR 2 Gaming Edition. You have to hook it up to a computer and Xbox and it streams the Xbox video and audio to my Laptop and second Screen with a Loop-through feature. The downside is that there is about a 2 second lag on the
 recording so I cannot vouch for it's live-streaming. As for recording it's fully customisable from everything from resolution to audio decoders if you're tech-savy enough. This piece of kit will cost £120est. and will come with everything you need to record.
 It also comes with its own editing software as well as additional pieces of software</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t access a partition on another drive. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> branden wallace  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t access a partition on another drive.</h2>
                    I can't access one of the three partitions on my second hard drive. It is visible that there is a partition there, but I can not assign it a drive letter or path. I do not want to reformat the partition. It is an encrypted partition with truecrypt, everything
 worked fine until I switch to my new hard drive. When I try to assign a drive letter it says: (The operation failed to complete because the Disk Management console view is not up-to-date. Refresh the view by using the refresh task. If the problem persist close
 the Disk Management console, then restart Disk Management or restart the computer.) I have really important information on that partition that I need to retrieve, hence the reason why it is encrypted.

            Hi, <br />
Please tell us, what is the make and model of the computer. I am thinking perhaps you need to visit the manufacturer's website and update all the recommended drivers. I don't know if it is an actual driver causing this issue, but updating the BIOS could help
 out tremendously. So when you start to browse the available drivers for you specific make and model, pay special attention and make sure you get the latest BIOS update.
<br />

            It is a custom build. The motherboard is a ASUS M4A79XTD EVO with BIOS version 2102, which is the latest. I tried using a program called partition manager to copy and move another partition on that drive so I could reinstall Windows 7. The hard drive would
 not let me install windows to it afterwards. So I ended up buying a second hard drive just figuring the other needed reformatted and I also wanted a second drive. After installing windows to the new hard drive I could access all of the information that was
 on the old hard drive except my 100GB encrypted partition that I used a program called TrueCrypt to create. Everything worked perfectly fine for months and never had any problems with accessing it until I used partition magic and it messed up the partitions.
 The old Hard drive is a Western Digital Caviar Blue WD10EALS.
