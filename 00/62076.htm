<h2>            Fan Q&#38;amp&#59;A</h2>
                    
<p><a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?/topic/1207390-skyrim-fan-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?/topic/1207390-skyrim-fan-interview/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key points:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Further denial to confirm or deny Vampires/Werewolves (Y U NO TALK TODD?!?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Cuirass and Greaves = one and the same now. However, there is a ton of armor sets to counter the loss of, yet another, item slot. So at least there's compensation this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Loot and Quest Rewards have different scaling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Todd gives BS reasons for why they refuse to add in spears, medium armor, mark/recall, and levitation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- <u>You can get married and have your spouse live in your home.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Dragon armor is back</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Magic items are recharged by soul items (again). For the Enchant skill, you learn how to use enchantments by breaking down items that have the enchantment you want (Ex: You want to learn how to enchant a sword with fire damage on strike, so you find an
 item that does fire damage on strike and "break it down" in order to use that enchantment in your own items)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Companions have perks that make them unique (ala New Vegas)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- No morality system. Your actions matter and are pointed out by NPCs, but you do not have a stat in your menu that says something like "Very Evil".</p>

<p>I'm really not sure how I feel about the fact you can get married... It seems awfully Fabley (Not that I dislike Fable, but I also don't dislike Peggle yet don't think Skyrim should be taking cues from it).</p>
<p>Reducing the armour to less pieces is a bit sucky.</p>

<p>You don't know that. If the NPCs are anything like the ones in Oblivion marriage is going to be just as bland and boring as it is in Fable.</p>

<p>I have an inkling that "romancing" an NPC will consist of just playing the speechcraft mini-game until you reach a certain disposition.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the blandness, look at Oblivion, how many of the NPC had true character? I can't think of even one, I doubt that they went though each and every NPC in Skyrim and fixed that. And if I recall with the companions, they said that they are going for more
 variety and options than than Fallout 3 but with less detail and depth. </p>

<p>If any of you are willing to answer, what is your opinion on the development of Skyrim so far? Some of you keep up with the news better than me, so I'm just curious as to whether your optimistic or pessimistic about it being top notch. Especially those of
 you who are long time fans and have seen better than Oblivion.</p>

<p>It is a dangerous path. Just as New Vegas was.</p>
<p>New Vegas took the gameplay of FO3 and improved it, but the story and level scaling went down a much more classic path similar to the older games. I honestly think New Vegas is leaps and bounds ahead of FO3 in almost every respect imho, but you'll see a
 lot of people whine and complain about it and go on and on about how much better FO3 was. Obsidian tried to make the game appeal to the newer "fanbase" (I use the term lightly) as well as the people who had been playing the series since the original. It overall
 seemed to not fare well with the newer fanbase.</p>
<p>Skyrim looks like it's trying to keep the Oblivion kids (read: people who had never played an RPG before and thought Oblivion was the pinnacle of humanity or something) happy while still trying to pull back in the veterans who hated Oblivion. It's doing
 a decent job so far.</p>
<p>It really just feels like they're <i>trying</i> their best to appeal to everyone, but if you follow BGSF at all you probably know it's not working so well. They've cut a lot of things (crossbows, spears, medium armor, levitation, mark and recall, skills,
 attributes, the list goes on and on), but if you can turn into a Werewolf again and the Dwemer ruins are as creative and fun as they were at times in Morrowind, I'll defiantly enjoy Skyrim 100x more than I did Oblivion. The rest of the game looks good but
 it's still in development so it's all in the air right now.</p>
<p>That's how I feel.</p>

<p>I am having such a problem as well. The conventional signs for arrow, call log, back, more, settings don't show and in their place it shows me emojies... I have tried installing Skype, Skype for Business and Skype lite and unistalled and reinstalled them
 several times. The problem stills remains. My android version is 7.0 on Huawei Honor 8 (FRD-L02). And i am using the skype version 8.17.0.4 updated as of March 5, 2018. I am attaching a picture as support for my complaints.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 File Explorer Search Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frankieb_13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer Search Problems</h2>
                    <p>I can no longer find files I am looking for using Windows 10 File Explorer Search.&nbsp; The search never actually completes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am in the Explorer and enter a term in the Search box "Search DATA (D:)', it will find a folder or a file that contains that term, but won't find any files with that name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folder called 'Melbourne Holiday'</li><li>File called 'Melbourne Plan'</li><li>Excel File called 'Budget' with content that includes 'Melbourne Savings'</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Search using the term 'Melbourne' - the results will find the folder and the Excel File called 'Budget' but not the file called 'Melbourne Plan'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked this out will all the different file types - no pictures, word, excel, pdf, weblinks, anything can be searched for by their file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In saying the above the search has never actually completed.&nbsp; Folders or files containing the term pretty much display instantly, then the green search progress bar appears and slowly makes it's way across the top of the window.&nbsp; It takes around 5-10 minutes
 to get to 99.5% and then stays there forever - I have left it overnight and the search has still not completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When there is only an item with the file name that matches the search criteria it says "working on it".</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Problem Solving I have Tried</strong></span><br />

<p>Yes - as described above under troubleshooting above - the wizard found no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer updated itself to the Fall Creators Update - which was corrupted my wifi, security software and other apps.&nbsp; After fixing all the problems that update caused I deleted and rebuilt the index again and now it seems to be working.</p>

<p>Can't help you at the moment but having killed several times like that l, try keeping 1 skeleton alive and summon benhart to help you get most of the aggro. Get yourself a gyrm greatshield to block 100% of her fire attack and don't bother blocking her scythe
 just dodge it</p>

<p>Can't agree more with you and the other 2 dlc are absolutely gorgeous, challenging and easily have 10+ hours of gameplay each. They also add a little wink to dark souls 1 regarding the dlc, if you're into the lore of the games you'll like it</p>

                    <p>Many moons ago I decided to download windows 10, I didnt like it and reverted to windows 7. &nbsp;I got this at the bottom right hand corner of my screen, &nbsp;'This copy of windows is not genuine' build 7601. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked on this site and found that all I had to do was, go to start, type cmd, making sure its in the administration, then I type SLMGR -REARM - but all I got was a dialogue box appear stating 'the maximum number of rearms has been exceeded, &nbsp;you must
 reinstall the OS before trying to rearm again'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I dont know what the OS is, and how come it says I've rearmed too many times when I havent?</p>

            We have tried the simple troubleshooting steps.
<br />Now it is up to you to do the repair upgrade.
<br />Link provided on how to do that.

            1. Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + I to open Settings.
<br />Click Accounts and select Sign-In options.
<br />Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />2. Modify Group Policy Settings
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />3. Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.

    <title>Easier way to use Windows 10 backup &#40;&#34;file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> berndbausch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Easier way to use Windows 10 backup &#40;&#34;file history&#34;&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 backup allows me to add and exclude folders from the list of locations that I want to back up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can only add or exclude one folder at a time. This is a time-consuming and very painful process. Furthermore, it's error-prone - I can easily forget adding/excluding folders; I don't get a good list of all the backed-up locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have only used the Settings dialog. Perhaps I am doing it wrongly. Is there a way to just select all the folders I want, and deselect those I don't want, in one go? This is how I use the old Windows 7 backup. A command-line solution would be fine.</p>

            Hi Bernd,<br />
<br />
File History will automatically back up files from folders it considers important, but you can customize exactly which folders and files to back up. To teach you on how to easily back up files using File History, you may follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Click the <strong>Start </strong><strong>button</strong>.<br />
2. Click the <strong>Settings </strong><strong>button</strong>. (It looks like a gear and is located in the bottom-left corner of the Start menu.)<br />
3. Click <strong>Update </strong><strong>&amp; </strong><strong>security</strong>.<br />
4. Click <strong>Backup</strong>.<br />
5. Click <strong>More </strong><strong>options</strong>.<br />
6. Click <strong>Add </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>folder</strong>.<br />
7. Click a <strong>folder </strong>you want to back up.<br />
8. Click <strong>Choose </strong><strong>this </strong><strong>folder</strong>.<br />
<br />
• If you add the wrong folder or simply want to remove a folder from the backup list, perform the following two steps.<br />
<br />
9. Click a <strong>folder </strong>in the <strong>Back </strong><strong>up </strong>
<strong>these </strong><strong>folders </strong>list.<br />
10. Click <strong>Remove</strong>.<br />
<br />
Get back to us if need further help.

<p>Thanks much, but I was able to get that far. For the future, I suggest you read questions before you answer them. It saves your time and the time of the person who asks that question.</p>
<p><br />
Two quotes from my question:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
<em>However, I can only add or exclude one folder at a time.</em></p>
<p><br />
and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><br />
<em>Is there a way to just select all the folders I want, and deselect those I don't want, in one go?</em></p>
<p><br />
Note the last three words of the second quote - "in one go".</p>
<p><br />
Unfortunately, the folders that Windows considers important are not quite the same folders that I consider important. Let's assume that I need to exclude ten folders, and add ten other folders. To do that, I have to go through the same UI twenty times, an extremely
 tedious process. While I would like to try the Windows 10 backup solution, this is a showstopper. Thus, I am asking for a more efficient user interface to accomplish what I need.</p>

<p>Yes, I need further help. Perhaps you should try out your solutions before you post them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is true that in a normal Explorer window, I can select several folders using the Control key, or a contiguous list of folders with the Shift key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not so, unfortunately, when adding folders to a backup, or excluding them from it. Only a single folder can be selected.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I know that there are other backup programs. I also know that Windows 10 contains the Windows 7 backup program, which allows selecting and deselecting several folders at once. Perhaps that is the reason why Microsoft brought it back after eliminating it
 from Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is in the business of creating a fully featured desktop. Backup is as essential as Networking. All I need is a basic backup. I read that the new Windows 10 backup is integrated in Explorer and allows me&nbsp;to go back to an earlier version of a file
 with a simple right&nbsp;click. This would be a very useful feature for me, but so far, I can't use Windows 10 backup because its setup is to incredibly difficult.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why Microsoft puts so much effort into removing a useful feature.</p>

            If Epson scan does not see the scanner it dies.<br />
<p><br />
You can install the drivers by going into the device manager and using<br />
the update drivers method. Choose to update drivers and point to<br />
the CD or Folder where you have the drivers located.<br />
<br />
This should get your drivers installed. This however does not<br />
guarantee that epson scan will be able to see your scanner<br />
and function correctly.<br />
<br />
The easiest way to get the the software running is to install <br />
the VM as well as XP mode if you have that option.<br />
<br />
The download that Epson supplies on their website shows that the <br />
setup.exe file for Epson Scan was last updated in 2008. <br />
They have not changed the software to deal with issues that<br />
they will run into with Vista and 7.<br />
<br />
You can test your scanner by using MS Paint which does not <br />
utilize Epson scan. Menu - From Scanner or Camera.<br />
If this menu item is not grayed out, then Paint sees the <br />
scanner or camera installed. It can acquire images from <br />
the scanner without the need to use Epson Scan.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it appears that most programs like Photoshop, <br />
try to use Epson Scan.<br />
<br />
The problem with Epson Scan is it's USB Connection.<br />
For whatever reason, the USB port protocal that is<br />
built into Epson Scan fails in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
If you have an 80x11b wireless network router, <br />
you can configure Epson Scan to use the wireless<br />
network connection.<br />
<br />
After I configured my Workforce 610 to connect<br />
to the wireless network, and then configured<br />
Epson Scan to use that connection,<br />
Epson Scan was able to connect to the Scanner<br />
and run properly.<br />
<br />
If the Wireless network protocal is disabled,<br />
Epson Scan will stop working.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this is not a Windows 7 issue,<br />
it is a third party program "Epson Scan" issue.<br />
<br />
My guess is that Epson Scan is looking for the<br />
scanner's USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regards to this forum:</p>
<p>This is the worst forum program that I have ever used.</p>
<p>It is clear that the programmer never used it and never</p>
bothered to test it.
<p>connection improperly.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 2 stuck on Windows 10 v1511 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blackrosemd1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 stuck on Windows 10 v1511</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a Surface Pro 2 and it seems to only be functional on Windows 10 build 1511. There are a couple of issues here. The first one is that Windows Update doesn't even offer me the upgrade to build 1607. I've tried running the Windows Update
 troubleshooter and it always says that "Windows Update components must be repaired" and then shows that it repairs them. However, if I run it again, I get the same response and repairs. This is after a full clean install of build 1511.<br />
<br />
The second issue comes into play if I attempt to upgrade or clean install build 1607. Upgrades from 1511 always tend to hang at 1%, 19%, 23% or later. A clean install of 1607 tends to work, but Windows Explorer tends to freeze every couple of minutes, resulting
 in needing to hard reset the tablet. I'm wondering if anyone has any idea why that might be happening.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long question, but I really love this SP2 and just want it to be both updated AND fully operational instead of either/or.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Brian</p>

            Windows Update won't offer the 1607 update to everyone until November. &nbsp;During this time, they are slowly "greenlighting" which computers can be offerred the update based on their own internal and external testing, so that they know which groups will work
 well. &nbsp;So I'd standby and wait until they've identified the issue and you can proceed normally.

            Thanks for the info. I've seen other Surface Pro 2 users using 1607 with no issues. Guess I'll just wait for it to hit Windows Update and hope that the freezing issues don't occur again once it does.

            There is no adware or spyware. The freezing issues occur on a fresh, clean install of 1607 with no programs installed aside from what comes with W10.

            <p>It's not the end-all, be-all solution (it's basically impossible to talk in absolutes when there are billions of users and infinite combinations of drivers, chipsets, software, registry tweaks, personal settings, and more...) even two seemingly identical
 SP2's may have entire different processors inside as they change out hardware suppliers overtime even in the same model line. &nbsp;On the freezing, I'd also mention we've regularly observed Surfaces (and other vendor PCs) that hang on those percentages for up
 to 12 hours before continuing on just fine by themselves. &nbsp;But either way, if you haven't been actually offered the update, I'd hold off until you are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also just want to mention that after install, I like to leave the computer set to "do not sleep when plugged in" and give it several hours to finish all the extra junk it has to do. Windows 7 only post-install task was the indexer, but Windows 10 has a dozen
 services that all run (Microsoft calls them "deferred tasks") that take many hours to finish, during which they kill the CPU and make the entire system run like junk.&nbsp; I tell most people to give it overnight, and posted more details why here:

            Yeah, I think that's what I'll do. Considering it's functioning perfectly on 1511, I can definitely hold off until the update is offered via WU. Thanks again.

            So in a remarkable timing coincidence, the "feature update to windows 10 version 1607" showed up for me in Windows Update this morning. Windows Update got it downloaded, prepared to install updates and then rebooted.<br />
<br />
It's now been sitting at "Working on updates. 13% Don't turn off your PC. This will take a while." for about 3 hours now. Should I just let it run for 12 hours and hope it completes? Should I be concerned about screen burn in?

            <p>You shouldn't be concerned about screen burn if your display was manufactured in the last 10 years really. &nbsp;I did just get off a call with Microsoft talking about known issues with the update and we discussed this very issue. &nbsp;I'd just let it stay for at
 least that long before trying to kill it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They did say that if the direct install doesn't complete, the suggestion is to create your own media and install it from a USB stick directly. But I would just wait and see how it progresses.</p>

            Well, I hope I'm not jinxing myself here, but I seem to have finally got the Anniversary Update working.<br />
<br />
I let the upgrade run overnight and it was still stuck at 13% this morning, so I turned off the tablet, turned it back on and rolled back to 1511. I then used diskpart to format a USB drive to bootable fat32 and dragged the files from the 1607 ISO onto it.
 I then booted from it and clean installed 1607.<br />
<br />
After booting up, I manually installed the cumulative update from August 31st (<span>KB3176938), which took
 a while, as the tablet kept freezing anywhere between 30 seconds and two minutes after boot up. Once I got that installed and rebooted, I went in and manually installed all the hardware drivers I could with the zip file that I downloaded from the Surface website
 (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Download Surface Pro 2 from Microsoft">Here</a>). After doing all that, I've only had one freeze, on the lock screen after the tablet had gone
 to sleep and been woken up. Other than that, it's working great.</span>

<h2>            How do I divide the screen resolution from windows&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Hello everyone, I bought an ultrawide monitor with a resolution of 3840x1080 and I would like to share the screen resolution. I would like to have two 1920x1080 resolutions.</div>
<div>Just like having two physical, separate monitors.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The monitor is bought from Samsung (CHG90) and they told me that this change may be, but you have to talk to Windows (Microsoft). Those with whom we talked did not know what to say, so I ask you if you know how to fix it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks</div>

            Hi Irimescu, 
<br />what you want to do with it, if were able to split the monitor?
<br />do you want to duplicate the desktop and show everything twice?
<br />if you extend the desktop, it will be like you hadn't split it.
<br />
<br />you could use the snap feature to make the active window fill half the screen.
<br />first make sure that you are in desktop mode settings -&gt; system -&gt; tablet mode
<br />under "when I sign in" choose "use desktop mode"
<br />under "when this device automatically switches tablet mode on or off" choose " don't ask and don't switch"
<br />
<br />settings -&gt; system -&gt; multi-tasking turn on snap windows
<br />when you drag a window to the edge of the screen it will snap to the edge, filling half the monitor.
<br />
<br />if I have missed the point please let me know what you are trying to achieve.
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We still can't identify what could be the possible causes of this issue. For us to&nbsp;gain a better grasp of your concern, we need to gather the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this the first time you experience this error? If yes, have you made any recent changes to your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Does it happen to a specific domain name or to all of the domain names you're trying to ping?</li><li>Is it an internal or a public domain?</li><li>Can you also share with us the error messages you get?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we recommend performing a network reset.&nbsp;It helps to remove any network adapters you have installed and the settings for them.&nbsp;<span>After your PC restarts, any network adapters are reinstalled, and the settings
 for them are set to the defaults. You can visit this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to know more details about it. Just look for
<strong>Use network reset to reinstall network devices</strong> section.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 - Access denied on external hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buffy-marie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 -  Access denied on external hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 different hard drives, a 1Tb, a 2Tb and a 4Tb hard drive. I have just moved from a Mac of faithful service for 10 years. Before leaving the Mac, I backed up all of my data. Initially on FAT32 formatted hard drives, as that was all the Mac would
 allow, and then on hard drives formatted on Windows machines, with the NTFS file system. I can plug the hard drives into&nbsp;<em>any</em> other computer, and the data is still there, just where I left it. However, as soon as I plug it into my new Windows machine,
 I get the error message : Access Denied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been through the process of trying to regain access privileges, from going through the security tabs and trying to enable access on the current users on the hard drive, through to adding an administrator user to give me access. No joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried re-formatting the hard drives, figuring maybe the format is not compatible (unlikely, they work on any other computer, ranging from Windows 7 through to a different machine running Windows 10). I get temporary access, insofar as I have full
 access until I unplug the hard drive (after properly ejecting it - I have been using a Mac for 10 years, and boy, do Macs get grumpy if you don't eject properly!). As soon as I plug the hard drive back in, I get the access denied error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Command Prompt / powershell option of "takeown" - still no joy. I keep getting an error message, and the power shell hangs, and doesn't complete the task - even after 10 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message is not for individual files, but for the <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">entire</span></strong> hard drive. I can't even get into the root of the hard drive in the folder system to see what is going on. I have
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>absolutely no access.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any other ideas, or thoughts on how I can wrest control and access for these drives&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">back</span> from the system.</p>

<br />
<br />"Hi - so i have the same machine and problem. figured it had to be security related because a memory stick works. long story short... the culprit is HP Client Security app.
<br />
<br />open it, then goto device permissions down the bottom.
<br />
<br />then edit the removable media section. note the admin and standard user tabs.
<br />
<br />mine now works and to be honest its a cool feature when you finally know what the intent is."
<br />
<br />Figured that might be helpful. Good luck and let me know!

            this reply is for both palcouk and sudarshan bhatt... yes i am trying to do this because of a specific problem. i have been having troubles with spikes in cpu usage. not just for short periods of time, but pretty much the whole time i am on my laptop unless
 i start it and then do nothing but stare at it.&nbsp; i have tried to find ways to fix the problem with out having to buy new components or hardware or a new computer all together.&nbsp; but that has proven very difficult.&nbsp; i do understand that removing files from a
 computer could cause it to be unstable. but i also understand that when you buy a computer that is ready to go straight out of the box there is alot of stuff on it that is added and not always wanted by the person who buys it.&nbsp; with every computer i have gotten
 when you first start it up the desktop is always cluttered with shortcuts and trial versions of this and that.&nbsp; i do not have anything installed on my laptop right now that wasn't already here with the exeptions of windows updates, microsoft silverlight, active
 x updates, java udates, emachine updates that run on the first start up, and&nbsp; a couple of anti virus and malware scans i got from microsoft.com that were recomended when i installed microsoft security essentials.&nbsp; i am just trying to do more recommended steps
 to help lower the cpu usage by my laptop (example... uninstall any unwanted programs that are installed that i do not want or use.)&nbsp; i have come to the conclusion that i will not be able to fix my problem and the end answer is always the same... "go buy a
 new computer".&nbsp; i appreciate your input and everything i have researched and all the answers i have gotten to my question have been very helpful.&nbsp; i have learned to do many things that i did not know or feel comfortable doing before my first question on these
 help sites.&nbsp; i believe the actuall problem is the quality of my cpu and amount of RAM, and there is nothing i can do that will significantly improve the preformance with out upgrading both and possibly other things on my laptop which would lead me to spend
 just as much money and alot more time then it would take to just buy a better laptop that can handle and support the few things i am trying to do with it.<br />

<p>i would like to try and help with your problem , becouse it is not that difficult&nbsp; to clean out&nbsp; the unnessisary stuff .</p>
<p>sutch as : if you installed microsoft security essentials and it is updated&nbsp; . it is very good&nbsp; and&nbsp; your computer will load faster and use less memmory.&nbsp; if you have norton or mcafee as trialware ,they have a long history of problems, and are unneccisarey.</p>
<p>if you have third party tune up utilities, i would suggest you tern them off .windows 7 can and does maintane itself with very little help. and they are unneccisarey.</p>
<p>if you want to go farther on your clean up there are things that can be done to make it run smoother and faster.</p>

            Hello jjs1145 
<br />
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />What adds are you referring to ?
<br />
<br />Remove ads in Notifications
<br />The Creators Update brought with it a great many new features, but also managed to sneak it some more “suggestions”. These particular suggestions alert you to new Windows features, and prompt you to set them up.
<br />To stop these specific suggestions, go back into Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications, and turn “Show me the Windows welcome experience after updates and occasionally when I sign in to highlight what’s new and suggested” to “Off”.
<br />
<br />Remove ads in the Start Menu
<br />In a sneaky attempt to disguise ads, Windows 10 will show you “Suggested apps” in your start menu. These are often paid apps, and take up valuable space in your start menu.
<br />To disable them, go into your Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Start and change “Occasionally showing suggestions in Start” to “Off”.
