<h2>            My MATSHITA DVD-RAM UJ8E2Q DVD&#47;CD ROM Stopped working when I Upgraded My Operating System from 8.1 to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My DVD/CD ROM was working just fine while I had Windows 8.1, But Stopped working, and wasn't even seen in Device Manager until I chose to show Hidden Devices. I've tried updating the Driver with no success. There isn't even a yellow&nbsp;Exclamation Mark to show
 that the Device has issues. When I look at the Properties for the MATSHITA DVD-RAM UJ8E2Q DVD/CD ROM It explains in the General Tab that Currently this Hardware Device is not Connected to the Computer. (Code 45)</p>
<p>I already looked into the Microsoft Community for Ideas or Fixes for Code 45, But All of the examples of Devices that Received Code 45 were a Mouse,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Controller, and a Cellphone, and&nbsp;the Issues&nbsp;were resolved by Unplugging the Devices and Plugging them back
 in. My DVD/CD ROM was never&nbsp;Unplugged, hence Plugging It back in was not an Option.</p>
<p>If Any-One in the Microsoft Community could suggest a way to Reconnect My MATSHITA DVD-RAM UJ8E2Q DVD/CD ROM and Afford Me the luxury of Once again being able to use My DVD/CD ROM, I would be Forever Grateful.</p>

<h2>            Router settings&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm sure that this has been asked before, but there are too many posts to read. I have a Linksys Cisco router (WRT160Nv2) and I am having issues getting the settings correct for Live play and lagging ( I am hard wired not wireless). I am able to get connected
 to my Live account, but have issues connecting to COD Live. Here is the port range forwarding settings that I am using. I have not made any changes to single port forwarding, DMZ, port range triggering. If anyone has any suggestions... send em. I welcome all
 answers. thanx.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One&#58; &#34;Home took to long to start&#34;</h2>
                    <p>My Xbox one will not turn on, every time I try to turn it on it resets then goes to the green screen with the logo. After about a minute of that it just goes to a black screen with an occasional pop up saying&nbsp;"Home took to long to start",&nbsp;"Guide&nbsp;took to long to start" or&nbsp;"Cortona took to long to start". Sometimes it goes to the home screen after 15 minutes of waiting but then the screen is frozen and I can't control anything. Been doing this for 3 days and I have tried everything that is supposed to fix this.</p>

<p>However, I recently moved across country and since setting up my&nbsp;PC again,&nbsp;the&nbsp;scanner stopped working&nbsp;because the following error comes up:</p>
<p>"Failed to start the Control Center. The required registry information is missing. Please reinstall the Multi-Function Suite (CC3-001-00001901)"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I uninstalled the suite already&nbsp;on my system in order to re-install it, and I now get:</p>
<p>"There is not enough free disk space to install. Brother MFL-Pro Suite requires at least 44MB of free hard disk space."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 116 GB of free space on my C drive where all is installed, so this doesn't make sense to me, but&nbsp;now I can't do anything on my&nbsp;printer because the suite is currently uninstalled. How do I solve this problem? Any tips and advice would be most appreciated.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 refuses to exit tablet mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenbwilliams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 refuses to exit tablet mode</h2>
                    Windows has inexplicably started operating only in tablet mode on a new Dell XPS desktop PC. &nbsp;I have turned off tablet mode, changed the notifications so that the PC should not even ask to change to tablet mode and rebooted multiple times. &nbsp;While in this
 aberrant tablet mode, in the upper left hand corner of the screen there are 3 choices: &nbsp;Start, Pinned tiles and all apps. &nbsp;The Start menu choice is grayed while the other two choices function. &nbsp;The Start menu in the lower left hand corner does not bring up
 the standard Windows 10 live tiles. &nbsp;I am at a loss as to how to proceed.

<p><span>-Disabling IPV 6</span></p>
<p><span>-Disabling "allow pc to turn off this device"</span></p>
<p><span>-A variety of drivers for 3 different network adapters (I can only use wi-fi)</span></p>
<p><span>-2 Different routers&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-My other pc also with win 10 gives the same error</span></p>
<p><span>-Tried to flush the DNS did nothing</span></p>
<p><span>-Sfc /scannow found nothing&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-Formatting did not solve the problem</span></p>
<p><span>-Android devices don't have connection problems&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-My Isp said everything was well on their end</span></p>
<p><span>-Disabling firewall/anti-virus had no effect</span></p>
<p><span>-The error happens even in safe mode</span></p>
<p><span>-Tried different security settings on the router</span></p>
<p><span>-Set router and pc on the same channel</span></p>

    <title>Email not syncing in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuartbatchelor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email not syncing in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to use the in built mail and calender apps on windows 10 to manage my gmail emails and calender. When I open the mail app I am greeted with the message Not synced yet. &nbsp;When I add my gmail account I am told that that account already exists! But
 when I go into settings/manage accounts there are no accounts associated with the app. When I add it I am told it already exists! again! I can't delete it because there's no accounts shown to delete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly the pane pinned to my task bar shows that I have mail (the open envelope icon with a number next to it) but when I open the app it's just an empty window and "not synced yet."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck in a loop. This used to work on the old version of windows but not on Win10. Also the last Win 10 upgrade killed my laptop (had boot volume missing error on boot up) and had to resort to a recovery disk to un-brick my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So how do I get my gmail and calender to sync with Win10 ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your mail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have un-installed the app and reinstalled from the store as advised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open mail I am now prompted to set up an account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately when I select Google and enter my gmail account details I still get the message that email is already set up for that account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it isn't and I still don't have the mail app working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your latest mail on the 30th January.</p>

</p><p>I have read the thread and completed the actions. Unfortunately I still cannot get my mail app (or my calendar) to work.</p>

    <title>Cannot set up an ad hoc network on my laptops in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot set up an ad hoc network on my laptops in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acerlaptop that was running vista and two other Acer laptops running Windows 7 starter. I was able to set up an ad hoc network with no problem. When I updgraded all three to 7 home premium I cannot. I get the message waiting for users on all three.
 I've turned on network discovery, file sharing, everything the troubleshooting guides tell me to. No luck. If I plug my router in the network I set up on that will work. But it's inconvienent to use the router in my house. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Be sure&nbsp; to check with Acer Support, their on-line documentation, and drivers. Manually check
<br />
for updates to all the network drivers o all the computers - both NIC (wired) and WiFi (wireless).<br />
See driver update methods below.<br />
<br />

These should help AFTER the driver updates.<br />

<br />
=========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>Try actually updating your drivers :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually using the methods&nbsp;<br />
below is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are<br />
found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions.<br />
(The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Windows<br />
7&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

            Your first action should be to contact Magellan support and ask whether their Drivers &amp; Software are compatible with W8.

            Here's what I did to get mine to work in Win8 (it works fine in W7) -- you need some knowledge or practice using virtual machine's and Linux from here on...
<div><br />
<div>1. Started Magellan's "VantagePoint" software</div>
<div>2. Plug in the GC and connect. Windows will connect but the drive will keep saying "insert media" and your VantagePoint likely will not see the device. This is because I believe it is actually a serial device with a USB adapter built in and however it
 is written is too different from W7 to W8, it's weird sometimes it will open sometimes not. If VantagePoint DOES open it (rarely) it may do a download of latest firmware. Walk through that and chances are it won't make a difference anyway. Continue to...</div>
<div>3. Download the free VMWARE Player from vmware.com then download XUbuntu linux OS.</div>
<div>4. Follow steps to install xubuntu in the vmware Player virtual machine software.</div>
<div>5. after installation is done, "play" Xubuntu, plug in your Magellan watch it magically be available as a USB drive!</div>
<div>6. Download your Pocket Queries from geocaching.com, unzip them from the xubuntu "My Downloads" directory, click on the usb symbol for "compass" (your magellan gc), open the Geocache folder and paste them in!</div>
<div><br />
<div>upload your logs directly to the Geocaching site or if you are like me you use your smartphone for doing the logs and the Magellan for the finding.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is actually a LOT easier than it looks and it doesn't harm your computer because it runs inside your Windows 8 operating system. If you upgraded from Windows 7 you could also use W7 in the virtual machine instead but that takes a LOT more resources
 than it does to run xubuntu (takes even more than W8 does actually). Windows 8 on a modern computer running at least a Dual Core processor handles virtual machines very well thanks to the capabilities built into the new AMD and Intel CPU's.</div>

            <p>Best way to solve this issue:&nbsp; Download Magellan communicator.&nbsp; It will not work yet but follow these steps</p>
Run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <span>Search</span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<span>Search</span>.)</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <span>run programs</span> in the search box.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span>, and then tap or click
<span>Next</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the program you want to fix. <br />
– Or –<br />
If you don't see the program in the list, select <span>Not Listed</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Next</span>, and then follow the instructions in the troubleshooter. (Search for Magellan communicator and select it)</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to do this twice because the first time you run it , it might uninstall it.&nbsp; The second time worked for me and it ended up using settings from vista service pack 2.&nbsp;(everything else&nbsp;stays the same)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope this helps you guys!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked with my Magellan explorist GC.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X Wifi issue &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>Over the last few days i have been having wifi issue.</p>
<p>My Xbox One X is set to full shutdown ( energy mode ) but when i boot it up ...it wont connect to the internet via wifi.</p>
<p>If i go into network settings then it sees my 2.4ghz band but not my 5ghz band .</p>
<p>I then have to connect to my 2.4ghz band which it will after a couple of attempts.</p>
<p>Then when shutdown and reboot ...it loses connection again ...and have to go into network and find it again.... tried both bands but still same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also i did noticed that a few times last week the xbox booted up , went part through startup ....but when got to xbox logo ..it shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since completely reset xbox , wipe all data ...tried downloading latest firmware to a usb stick and installed that ...still same.</p>
<p>Have noticed that the issue of powering off on its own has not happened since but still have wifi issue.</p>
<p>When i reset xbox to factory settings and go through setting it up ...wifi connects no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At moment the only way i have got it to work is to leave it in "instant on mode" ...but not tried leaving over night yet ...will find out later lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only thing that has been done to it is the thermal past was changed 2 weeks back but has been fine till basically saturday when wifi and shutdown issues appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wonder if there is any known fault with latest update ? or maybe just a faulty wifi board on my xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the xbox one x has had loads of wifi issues since release ...but mine has been fine ..till last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help most appreciated</p>

<p>I would first suggest changing your 2.4Ghz broadcast band to 20Mhz instead of "auto" or "20/40Mhz" as the Xboxes prefer 20Mhz. That could be a cause if it's on 40 or switching often because of other devices. This must be changed on your router settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the console shutting down during the startup, that could be a sign of a hardware failure - or just a corrupted dashboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try another router if you have one to make sure it's not the router that's causing this but the shutting down does point towards the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest looking at the following troubleshooting pages before you think about a repair:</p>

<p>thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried connecting to my phone via hotspot ...but still had issues .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if the shutting down was due to the wifi board ...as i heard it has the bluetooth or whatever it uses for the connection to the controllers and that might be why it shutsdown ....and leaves controller light flashing.</p>

<p>Hi Karl!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us for this issue. If you've already tried the solutions that have been provided to you by our awesome Ambassadors and are still having issues with wifi connection, then you may wish to try out a wired connection via Ethernet cable

troubleshooter for the Xbox One unexpectedly turning off</a>to see if it can help. This also begs the question of whether or not you've received any system error codes (they normally begin with an "E" followed by a number). If you do, or have start up problems
 with a message saying "Something went wrong", then you'll want to use our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/startup-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Maybe you could give us a description of your networking setup such as, is your console connected to your wireless router, or do do you use an additional device in between? For example an extender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post up the make and model of your wirless router and your modem as well (if this is not a single device).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How far apart from your cconsole is the wireless router located?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned "thermal past". Was your console, initially, suffering from heating problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other device that are able to, properly, connect to the 5 Ghz band, from the same location as where you have your console positioned?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last but not leased: Are you able to connect your console with an Ethernet cable?</p>

<p>thanks for the replys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Xbox is connected wirelessly to my home router which is about 15ft away ....and also have a ps4 wirelessly connected which never has a problem...and have tried rebooting router as it says on xbox network screen when wont connect.</p>
<p>My phone connects on the 5ghz band ....but have had problems with which ever band you select on xbox...when it powers down fully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed to " instant on mode " sunday , and when got home last night ...it was still connected to network , i also turned it off while having tea and came back to it , still no issue whats so ever.</p>
<p>Seems like if do full shutdown , it wont connect again.</p>
<p>I have had a couple of instances where if you leave console on for a few more minutes , then connects.</p>
<p>I have managed to get another Wifi board for the console to see if its that or not , simple swap and was cheap enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may try an ethernet cable if problem persists , just as a test and if that cures it i may try a ethernet to wifi adaptor where it send your ethernet output over wifi...and powers off usb port ...another cheap idea to try lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for console shutting down on startup ...after say 7 seconds .....thats not been an issue since ...plus never had an error code come up.</p>
<p>( funny as watched a video on youtube where someone was having same sort of issue with wifi and showed a work around ...and his did the same thing...shutdown on startup after about 7 seconds )</p>
<p>
</p><p>At moment console is running great , seems to run quieter now thermal paste has been changed ...and i can see why people change it out ( loads people changing it out by what seen on net ) ...mine was all dried up , like every video seen on youtube ....naff
 thermal paste by looks of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since changed out my ps4 thermal paste and that was still soft , so whta are microsoft playing at using naff paste ?</p>
<p>Guessing they want everyones console to overheat after a year and have to buy a new one lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed thermal paste as Red Dead Redemption 2 seems to be putting the console through it passes and making fan spin up lot more than normal....so thats when looked into the issue on net.</p>
<p>I have built a few pc's so know what im doing lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Karl</p>

<p>Hello Kar1os,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you attempted to&nbsp;reset the console to <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">factory defaults</a></strong> while keeping games and apps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Reset and keep my games &amp; apps</span></strong><span>. You should use this option as your primary choice when troubleshooting. It will reset the OS and delete all potentially corrupted data without deleting your
 games or apps. This will save you from downloading or reinstalling the large game files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: This will remove profiles, so be sure to keep all information for signing into any/all accounts.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this and let us know if this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>yes tried full factory reset as was watched a video on youtube where someone just tried a reset while keeping games and apps ...but did not work and they said to do a complete factory reset and wipe games and apps ....which i have done but was still the
 same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tested it again last night with "instant on mode " and still works fine , palyed online for about 3 hours without issues.</p>

<p>Hey there Dr. Buba! &nbsp;I would also suggest heading into the system memory and then delete all Happy Wars content you see in there, then
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clear the console cache</a> and give it another shot!</p>

<p>Doing that doesn't work. I already attempted it. As for downloading it under a new profile apparently it needs to be a gold membership, because the download option doesn't show up for the new profile I just created.</p>

Is the game still not working properly for you?<br />

<p>Hi try deleting the game from your hard drive and any non essential saves (if any) and download the game again</p>
<p>You could also try deleting any dlc as this has caused a couple of issues in the past, the content can be reinstalled when your game is up and running by viewing your purchase history.</p>
<p>Finally try the old favourite of clearing you cache as below:</p>
<p>support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</p>

<p>Says it needs to test my connection apparently it can't connect me to xbox live to download the update. The only problem is, I just got done playing a game and was going back to dashboard when the update hit.</p>
<p>I've tried resetting my modem/router. Tried direct connect from modem to xbox, cleared cache. Nothing seems to be working.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>One possible reason as to why you're encountering this issue is due to the <strong>Created</strong> status of the code. This happens when the store where you purchased the bundle didn't activate the code. To verify the code's status, we suggest that you contact our Xbox support team. They can also help activate the code. You may contact them through chat or request a call at your preferred date and time. Refer to this <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us#3:1:3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> for more information.</p><p><br /></p><p>Another way to activate the code is to get in touch with the store where you purchased it.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Let us know if there's anything else you want to clarify. We're here to clear things up.<br /></p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; The error goes back well over a month.&nbsp; I've made no changes I am aware of.&nbsp; I surf the web, work and play games.&nbsp; Nothing new has been added except a video card 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; Though the error seems to have existed before this.<br />
<br />
The error is in my "error log".&nbsp; It does not "come up", it is just in the logs.&nbsp; I am using the computer as normal as I always have :)&nbsp; I am here asking for help because it is an error/warning which is displayed in my eventlog too many times.&nbsp; I doubt it is
 a good thing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That is very helpful (Really).&nbsp; When I contact them what do you generally suggest I tell them?&nbsp; What makes you think it might be intel?&nbsp; I will contact them ASAP.&nbsp; But if you could give me a general idea of what I should contact them for or why this might
 be intel related - that will help!</p>

            Hi Electra,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Disk cleanup is a deprecated feature of Windows. Use Storage sense instead:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/100977-free-up-disk-space-now-storage-sense-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/100977-free...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can tell us the exact error of disk cleanup, we might be able to fix that.

            Hi Electra.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />How exactly has it failed?  Will it not open, opens but won't run, or fails while running?  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello Electra9,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />I suggest you to enable 'Storage sense' feature instead to automatically free up space on your system. Disk Cleanup tool is outdated and Microsoft recommends to use Storage Sense now.
<br />
<br />Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Right click Start Button or press Windows + X keys and select Settings.
<br />
<br />2. In the Settings app, navigate to System &gt; Storage.
<br />
<br />3. Moving on, under Storage, turn On Storage sense. 
<br />
<br />4. If you wish to clean your system now, on same window, under Free up space now, click Clean now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!       
        </p>

<h2>            party chat killed xbox community</h2>
                    
<p>ive had a 360 from near enough day one, played it online and met some great friends online who i ended up gaming with over the years. but then most of them stopped gaming so i had a friends list clean up, most my friends list is now local friends who basically
 just play COD. when i try to play an online game nobody is talking anymore like they use to. because there all on party chat. does anybody agree with me that party chat has killed the fun of online gaming?</p>

<p>I agree with Blessed, I too am a girl and sometimes the kids/guys on xbox live can be ***. Regardless party chat is fun when you don't want to play a game with your friends but still want to chat it up. It has also gotten rid off the "pre-teens, and teens"
 who can be so annoying yelling onto the damn mic (very irritating). Regardless it has hurt the online experience, I remember back in COD4 were me and my friends had so much fun hearing people get mad, or admire our team work with less kids and more players.
 That my friends was the good old Xbox days =(</p>

<p>I swear dudes on xbox r bigger a-holes now then b4 when I use to always chat with randoms. It was easier to make friends &amp; work together back then. Now everyone acts like they have something stuck up their *** lol &amp; I can't even find decent gamer chicks
 to game with cuz most r big flirts and have no respect for themselves. And any gamer I know in person plays ps3 or hardly plays at all so I'm stuck trying to make friends online and I keep coming across jerk offs. Wheres all the decent, cool gamers at? If
 anyone knows point me to that direction lol.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Gerry for that detailed response. I think I can do as you suggest.</p>
<p>However, I note that I just received the November security updates and among them is this interesting one:</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB3102810)</p>
<p>Help and Support: <br />
http://support.microsoft.com</p>
<p>Installing and searching for updates is slow and high CPU usage occurs in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2<br />
This article describes an update that contains some improvements for Windows Update Client in Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) or Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1. This update has a prerequisite.<br />
Issues that are fixed in this update<br />
Issue 1<br />
When you install updates by using System Center Configuration Manager, the installation takes a long time, and System Center Configuration Manager becomes overloaded.<br />
Issue 2<br />
The Svchost.exe process occupies 100 percent of CPU usage when you upgrade a Windows Update client to Windows 10.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>I definitely have NOT "upgraded" to Windows 10, and have no intention of doing so. But I had observed not only the high CPU usage, but also extremely slow search and download for Security Essentials. After installing the updates, I went to Task&nbsp;Manager and
 watched as the CPU usage dropped from 100% to 76,&nbsp; to 45, to 30, finally to 0%, then bounce around between 0 and 5%.</p>
<p>Coincidence? Possibly. I'll watch the usage closely.</p>
<p>Again, I do appreciate your suggestions.</p>
<p>Regards, Grandpa</p>
<p />

            Alas, after two days the same thing is happening. Is this perhaps related to the Windows 10 "upgrade" preparation files that have been installed?

<p>Thanks again, Gerry. As it happens, I had already hidden the&nbsp;two offending "updates." But I did act on&nbsp;your disk cleanup&nbsp;suggestions. We'll see if that helps. It seems that the CPU runs at 0% for a while and then, sometimes, inexplicably goes to 100%. My
 wife spends hours posting on Facebook and yells when she can't post fast enough. I have at times wondered if there are just too many posters from all over the world trying to post at the same time.</p>

<p>ElderK,</p>
<p>Your suggestion is much appreciated. As it happens, the offending laptop is currently showing 0% CPU usage. But the next time it goes way up, I will record the top five "users."</p>
<p>I note that I do not see a System Idle Process entry on any of three Windows 7 computers.</p>
<p>FWIW, the laptop at issue is a Toshiba Satellite and the AV is Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To see the System Idle Process in Task Manager you must check the box in the lower left corner that says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Show processes from all users</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you will be able to see the System Idle Process,&nbsp;click the CPU Colum header to sort from largest to smallest/smallest to largest and just watch it for a minute to see how it works.&nbsp; Flip over to the CPU Usage tab to see the percentage CPU, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to catch the afflicted system when it is running at 100% CPU for no apparent reason and figure out what Process is causing that to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime it would not hurt to download, update&nbsp;and&nbsp;scan you system will the free version if Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (MBAM) to see if there are any threats that MSE might have missed:</p>

            <p>Here's what I've found today, when the response time on Facebook is extremely slow:</p>
<p>iexplore.exe*32 is using 99% of CPU--and 46% of physical memory.</p>
<p>When I close IE, the CPU usage goes to 0%.</p>
<p>Perhaps not relevant: UAC Virtualization is using 707,668k memory.</p>
<p>Interestingly, looking at System Idle Process, I see CPU usage at--99%.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Also, in addition to iexplore.exe*32, there is an entry for iexplore.exe, using no CPU. Is that significant?</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are Surfaces a Failure for Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am on my 3rd warrantied Surface Pro 4. The first was RMA'd for an unknown reason (exchanged before I started at my company). The second because the touch surface went crazy to the point where it was unusable (among many, many other issues).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After receiving a brand new Surface Pro 4 in Oct, I almost immediately began having problems, so I decided to document them. Note that for some of the more serious issues, I've come here and other places for help. God bless them but the standard answer from
 MS drones is almost always either "Make sure you're fully updated" or basically to reinstall Windows (which I should not have to do - I have a home built PC running Windows 7 flawlessly since 2005).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this begs the question, have I just had bad luck with Surfaces, or are these machines a failure for Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the log I've been keeping:</p>

</p><p>I'm guessing that you are running Windows 10.&nbsp; Most of the problems you are documenting are problems with W10 generally, not just a tablet and specifically not a Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, did you originally have W8 on your machine?&nbsp; Maybe you would like using it better.&nbsp; Another option you might try is Remote Desktop Connection.&nbsp; I am using that with my Surface RT (W8.1) to my Surface 2 Pro (W10 FCU--WU won't give me W10 SCU which may
 be telling me something about support for SP2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, in that impressive list is there one particular problem that you find particularly irritating?&nbsp; Perhaps we could help you with better workarounds for some of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just had a look at some of your other threads.&nbsp; That made me realize that some of your problems are performance issues and this could be caused by malware.&nbsp; So, for checking and fixing that I can suggest you try MalwareBytes (free).</p>

<p>Thanks Robert.</p>
<p>This Surface Pro4 was supplied with W10 from the factory. Our IT vendor uses Webroot for malware protection, and since I've had issues since the day I was supplied with this replacement unit, I'd doubt it was a malware issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I agree somewhat - the combination of W10 + SurfacePro4 seems to be a perfect storm of MS custer-f-ery.</p>

            <div>SP4 never shipped with W8</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>He has a lot of dock related issues. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I honestly don't think many people want to use their Surface tablets as a RD</div>
<div>client to a different PC. That isn't real world. Especially in an office</div>
<div>situation where people are using their Surface with a dock and monitors. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't see that anyone ever asked if he is using a customized Enterprise</div>
<div>version of Windows or if he tried running without 3rd party AV programs and</div>
<div>especially if he tried without the dock. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But given the screen flickering/shaking bug and the dead SP4 typecover bug, and</div>
<div>the lack of real acknowledgement from Microsoft, I stopped recommending SP4's to</div>
<div>others over a year ago. Now that these are discontinued, even though I love MY</div>
<div>SP 2017, I am very cautious about recommending to others in light of the</div>
<div>complaints about pen and palm rejection and light bleed. I certainly can't</div>
<div>recommend the Surface Book 2 given the complaints about disappearing, unusable</div>
<div>NVidia GPU's and coil whine. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;So, did you originally have W8 on your machine? </div>

<p>&nbsp;Webroot for malware protection</p>

<p>
</p><p>In fact, that is the other side of malware.&nbsp; I see it with MalwareBytes Premium on my mother's HP and always at least disable that before trying to get a cumulative update.&nbsp; After all, it is trying to protect the OS that the update is trying to modify, so
 it is understandable that it would be seeing the update (or anything that managed to get updated by an update, such as its built-in browsers) as being suspected Trojan activity.&nbsp; A related thing that has always happened to me is finding that Hyper-V needs
 to be uninstalled before accepting a cumulative update.&nbsp; I don't know why but doing that certainly eliminates a bunch of really severe performance issues.&nbsp; Again, these are not just Surface issues but Windows 10 security or OS implementation issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW the specific thing that caught my attention from your other threads was a mention of Foxit.&nbsp; If it is the free version and if you aren't really careful about how you install that you will be given a bunch of unwanted extras under the covers which do
 cause performance problems.&nbsp; MalwareBytes calls such things PUPs.&nbsp; Other commonly used "free" software can have similar effects for the same reason.</p>

<p>At my previous company I had a desktop built by the IT dept running Win 10 and it never had an issue. So yes, I agree it there are software issues at play, but it is something with this Surface that seems to be causing particularly infuriating issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what Foxit is and I never mentioned it in my logs above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi Barb, thanks!</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro 64 bit 10.0, Build 16299.</p>
<p>I experience issues with it docked, undocked, and especially transitioning between the two. I have a dock at work and a dock at home and I experience similar issues at both places, so unless both docks are faulty, the common thread is this Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case anyone missed it, this is the 3rd replacement Surface Pro since the original was purchased sometime in 2017. The previous one was finally RMA'd after it had a whole host of issues, culminating in the touch screen failing. I wasn't here when the first
 one in the series was returned, so I'm not sure what the failure was with that one.</p>
