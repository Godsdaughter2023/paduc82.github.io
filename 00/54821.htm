<h2>            Microphone producing constant static&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I have a PC Windows 10, 64 bit which I recently got about a month or two ago. I have a headset which has a microphone that was working perfectly fine a few days or a week ago. Suddenly, the mic stops working and starts producing an obnoxious static
 sound which is constant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't detect my voice or anything other than the constant static. The Microphone listed in Sound, then recording is 'Realtek High Definition Audio'. Please help! I've tried everything to fix the problem but it's not working!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to uninstall and update the Realtek driver for it. I tried to reinstall the Microphone through Device Manager. I've tried to troubleshoot the Mic by troubleshooting the Recording Audio in 'Hardware and Sound' but it doesn't troubleshoot the static!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please HELP!</p>

            Hi John,<br />
<br />
We might be looking at a possible hardware issue. Updating the device driver usually, is a possible fix for this concern. If you have already updated, uninstalled, and reinstalled the device driver and the concern is still happening, we recommend getting in
 touch with the device manufacturer to better assist you with the issue.<br />
<br />
If you have other concerns, let us know.

<p>Yeah, I tried to uninstall and reinstall the Microphone Realtek High Definition Audio but still produces a static sound. I also tried the Microphone on my laptop (MacBook Air) and it works perfectly fine. I was able to talk with my friends and the laptop
 actually detects my voice...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I contact the&nbsp;manufacturer of the headset (Steel series)? Or do I contact Realtek?</p>

            If its working with a laptop, we might be looking at a compatibility issue. It's best to contact the headset manufacturer and inquire about it.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Skins are simply collections of one or more computer art files, organized by a text file, which tells Windows Media Player how to
 use these files to display a skin. You can use a variety of programs to modify existing art or create simple art of your own. For example, using the drawing tools and clip art supplied with Microsoft PowerPoint, you can create artwork by just dragging and
 dropping. Similarly, you do not need to be a programmer to create the text file used to define an individual skin.</span></p>
<p><span>The reason why you get the error message is because the skin file is not compatible with Windows media player 12.</span></p>
<p><span>Try downloading skins which are compatible with windows media player 12 and check if you still get the error message.</span></p>
<p><strong>Change how <span>Windows</span> Media Player looks using skins</strong></p>

    <title>Recover Microsoft Account tied to gamertag&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian hoyt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recover Microsoft Account tied to gamertag&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We created a gamer tag for my wife tied to an old @msn.com account of hers. Since we created it however we have never logged into or really used the Microsoft Account other than it being tied to gamertag. I would like to transfer the gamertag from our 360
 to Xbox One but can't without Microsoft Account access. We have tried the recover form but can't answer enough questions since the account is dead other than being used with Xbox. The recovery email is 3-4 jobs ago, the credit card is long since lost (we are
 talking like 6 years), we don't know any emails or contacts since it wasn't used for that. Is there any way to prove our ownership based upon access to gamertag? I would really like to keep this gamertag but I am running out of options to recover it. It works
 fine on 360 since we have it on the box but can't do anything else with it?</p>

<p>That process wants password for old account which we don't have. The account doesn't have email attached to it any longer (hasn't been used in too long) and as a result doesn't have the items they want for account recovery. It is my fault for forgetting
 password I know but it seems no way to recover it.</p>

            Hi Tanya
<br />
<br />TPM (Trusted Platform Management) basically refers to a chip on your motherboard, that enables disk encryption

<p>Hi. Thanks for responding. that was in my recently opened files, I also have several strange things I don't know what they are or what program or app or device these strange files belong to. can I post screen shots of some and see if maybe you can tell me
 what or where they come from? I know this seems strange, but there's a reason.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello, I have a problem with my computer that I wasn't able to find on the internet.</p>
<p>When I boot my pc I get a bunch of red text. This doesn't look like any RSOD (Red screen of death) That i've ever seen. I have virtually zero troubleshooting options. I can get into my boot menu, but when I select my hard drive, I get the Red text. When
 I boot in my optical drive with a Windows 8.1 64-bit Installation disc, No bootable device. I haven't downloaded any weird/questionable software that I know of. All I have at the moment, are steam games, minecraft, f.lux, and discord.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  StandaMAN_762,
<br />
<br />This looks like a hardware issue, though not your display . . .
<br />
<br />Unplug your System, then press and hold the power button for 30 seconds
<br />
<br />Boot into BIOS and click Restore Defaults
<br />
<br />Check the connection on your hard drive
<br />
<br />Make sure all the RAM modules are seated correctly
<br />
<br />Start your system
<br />
<br />If it does not boot into Windows, I would suggest bringing it to a repair shop

            Hi Standa, what you are seeing on the screen is a readout of your Processor Registers in assembler language . . .
<br />
<br />The x86 assembler language has had to change as the x86 processor architecture has changed from 8bit to 16bit to 32bit and now 64bi
<br />
<br />Since you can see that text on the screen - your screen is OK, as is your Power Unit
<br />
<br />Windows has not loaded, so it is a lower level issue
<br />
<br />Does your BIOS have a Diagnostics mode?

            My computer manufacturer is IBUYPOWER. I'm fairly sure I can access my boot menu because when I boot my pc I get a brief screen with a logo that says "2.2 TERABYTE" And right under that says "Press any key to enter the boot menu". But my only options are
 my Hard Disk and my Optical Drive - Would reinstalling windows work at this point? I'm not that worried on losing files.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Desktop.ini is a hidden, protected operating sytsem file, present in some folders, that stores information about folder customization.&nbsp; Since the desktop is a folder (C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\Desktop), it can contain this file.&nbsp; It's OK to delete the file.&nbsp;
 To prevent it from appearing, go to Control Panel &gt; Folder options and turn off viewing of hidden files and/or system files.

<p>1) get your child to try and log on outside the time limit</p>
<p>2) a prompt will appear stating that they cant use the PC because its outside their time limit BUT has 2 buttons. One says 'OK' the other says 'Allow more time'</p>
<p>3) click on the allow more time</p>
<p>4) put the admins password that controls the Microsoft Family Account</p>
<p>5) a drop down will appear with options of extra time, select one and away you go :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Loss of 1920 x 1080 resolution with version1803 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelford2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Loss of 1920 x 1080 resolution with version1803</h2>
                    <p>When Windows Update installed Version 1803 on two of my machines everything went along well until it got to actually opening Windows. I got a "Mode Not Supported. The resolution is not supported on this TV. Please change the resolution." on my Samsung display/TV.
 Under version 1709 I had no problem with having the resolution set at 1920 X 1080 pixels which is the native resolution for the Samsung display/TV. Since I could go nowhere once the error message appeared my only choice was to turn off my computer and restore
 version 1709.</p>
<p>On the computer that I don't use very often, I changed the resolution to 1024 X 768 and reinstalled version 1803. This time it was successfully installed but when I tried to change the resolution back to 1920 x 1080 that resolution was no longer an available
 choice. The highest resolution I could get was 1600 x 1200 which doesn't fit right on the screen. This machine is a Dell OptiPlex 760 with Intel Core2 Duo CPU E8400 @ 3.00GHz 2.99GHz and 4.00 GB RAM. The OS is Windows 10 Pro, Version 1803, installed 7/28/2018,
 OS build 17134.407. The graphics processor is Intel Q45/Q43 Express Chipset (Microsoft Corp. - WDDM 1.1). The driver that is now installed (which it says is the latest) is Intel 3/11/2013 8.15.10.2702.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't take note of what the driver was before I installed version 1803. I did go to the Dell website and downloaded the driver that it said had been installed on my machine but Windows won't allow me to install it as a replacement. I have
 looked at Windows update for any other drivers that might provide an answer. I have switched to the generic Windows graphics driver but that doesn't solve the problem either.</p>
<p>I have remained on version 1709 on my other machine that I use more often given that I had the same problem in trying to install version 1803. That machine has an Intel 82945G Express Chipset Family (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM1.0). The driver is Intel
 Date: 10/1/2012 8.15.10.2697. Again, I have no problem with displaying 1920 x 1080 under version 1709.</p>
<p>I have read some blogs that had a similar problem with other graphics processors. In some of those they had indicated that their problem went away after Microsoft updated the drivers for their machines. I have gone through several iterations of updates to
 release 1803 but so far there has been no update to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? (It is strange that a standard 1080p format becomes lost in an update that Microsoft touts as expanding visual arts.)</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To have better clarity on the issue, answer the below-listed questions and get back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Are you facing this issue on both of your computers when you install the Windows 10 1803 version?<br />
2) What is the make and model number of your another computer?<br />
3) What is the model number of the Samsung TV?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael, for your Dell OptiPlex 760, I see that this computer is not compatible with Windows 10 and here is the link which says the same:
<a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/in/en/inbsdt1/product-support/product/optiplex-760/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Support for OptiPlex 760</a>. You can go to this link and click on the drop-down list of Operating System and see that Windows 10 is not listed for your computer, so there are no graphics drivers available for your computer for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get&nbsp;a message Mode Not Supported. The resolution is not supported on this TV. Please change the resolution on your TV, then the Computer Monitor resolution is somehow set to a display resolution which is not supported by the monitor itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also need to reduce the video resolution of the PC to get a picture. Connect it to a monitor to change it. Check the ownerâ€™s manual of the TV to find the resolution supported by the input you are using. If your TV has HDMI, it will support higher
 resolution if you use a VGA to HDMI converter than a VGA to composite or component video converter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you got the help you needed by clicking Yes or No.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>1) When I first tried to install Version 1803 on both machines I received the "Mode Not Supported" message on my display. Since there is no way to directly set the resolution on my displays and no way to access my machine once the display was locked up I
 had to manually turn the machines off and then restore version 1709. On the Dell Optiplex 760 I tried again a couple of more times with the same result until I finally figured out that If I changed the resolution under version 1709 to 1024 x 768 that this
 was then compatible with the driver that Microsoft now decided was the latest for the Intel Q45/Q43 Express Chipset (Microsoft Corporation WDDM 1.1). Apparently Microsoft somehow determined that it was OK if they just deleted whatever driver Dell had installed
 for the graphics adapter and replaced it with one that had much more limited options for resolutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) My other machine is an emachines model W3650. I had upgraded it to Windows 10 on 11/27/2015 after Microsoft told me that I was eligible for and my machine was compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; I had some issues with Windows 10 but they gradually went away
 as updates were made. If I remember correctly I was able to install version 1803 at one point but I had a bunch of problems (including one where Microsoft decided that it was OK if it deleted a file that was required for Windows Live Mail to function correctly.)
 Because of these problems I restored back to version 1709 &amp; haven't tried to reinstall version 1803 - particularly since I am not finding an answer as to how I can get back to having 1920 x 1080 resolution on the Dell Optiplex 760.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) The display on the Dell Optiplex 760 is a Samsung Synchmaster P2570HD TV/Monitor. It's native resolution is 1920 x 1080.&nbsp; There is no way to set the resolution on the monitor other than through the driver on the graphics adapter. This display has been
 connected to the graphics adapter with a VGA cable both before and after the upgrade to Version 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I purchased the refurbished Dell Optiplex 760 with Windows 10 installed on it in November 2015. I have used it only lightly but have kept up with Windows Updates for it. I have had an idea that I would move most of my files on the emachines onto the Dell
 Optiplex since the emachines has limited cache and is slowing down.&nbsp; I understand that Windows 10 did not exist at the time that the Dell Optiplex was sold new but as with my emachines Microsoft has represented that upgrading to Windows 10 would be permitted
 and could become necessary when Microsoft pulls support for earlier releases of Windows. I had no problems with Windows 10 on the Dell Optiplex 760 through numerous updates until version 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the graphics driver that was installed on the Dell Optiplex 760 from the Dell website and attempted to install it to replace the driver that Microsoft installed. Unfortunately Microsoft in its great wisdom has determined that it will not
 allow me to replace the driver that it believes to be the one that I should have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is with Microsoft. In my house if you break something you should fix it or else pay whatever it takes to replace whatev er has been lost.</p>

<p>Well, I have now made things worse. I purchased a Radeon HD4350 Graphics card for $17 in the belief that this certainly must have support for 1920 x 1080 resolution since it has an HDMI port. (From what I can tell it does since what little I am able to display
 is at 1920 x 1080.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Immediately after I very carefully installed the card in the PCI-E slot in my Dell Optiplex 760 I get the following message: www. windows.com/stopcode "BAD SYSTEM CONFIG INFO" and indicates "D:\windows\system32\logfiles\srt\srttrail.txt".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system then tries to fix the problem but comes back indicating that it was unable to fix it and offering "Advanced Options" except that my mouse and keyboard are inoperable so my only option is to turn off the machine manually.&nbsp; I inserted the Windows
 10 Repair diskette that I created when I first got the machine and booted up with it. The first screen shows several keyboard layouts to chose from but again my mouse and keyboard are dysfunctional so I cannot select a keyboard option. (When I booted up with
 a Windows 7 repair diskette I was able to use the cursor to select my keyboard. It then showed that I had a Windows 10 installation on the hard drive but unfortunately Windows 7 repair isn't allowed to repair Windows10.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several iterations of the above frustration, I finally removed the hard drive from the Optiplex 760 and installed it&nbsp; in an enclosure that I can access via a USB on another computer. I'm not seeing any problem with accessing the hard drive this way
 so I'm not inclined to believe that the hard drive is bad. I am able to access the file that was referred to above (...\srttrail.txt") and here is what it contained.</p>

</p><p>I do not have a bootable copy of Windows 10 for this machine on any external medium. There was supposed to be a system image in a separate partition on the hard drive, I thought but I'm not seeing it when I look at the disk through the USB connection. Even
 if it were there I have no way to access it given that I am totally locked out of the Optiplex 760.&nbsp; I do have a recent backup of this machine on an external hard drive but I don't believe that I can access it on the Optiplex 760 as things stand right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a strong suspicion that Microsoft sabotaged my copy of Windows because the addition of the Radeon HD4350 graphics card caused a change to the configuration that Microsoft interpreted as being an attempt to use my copy of Windows on a different machine
 which would violate its licensing. I have had similar problems in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how to repair this problem.</p>

<p>Well, I have spent another couple of days on this with no resolution. I have found several threads about the "bootres.dll is corrupt" problem but none seem to have hit on any srefire solution to resolve the problem. The problem is quite widespread in version
 1803 and is a puzzle to a lot of folks who are way more informed about bootstrap operations than I am. It does seem like in many cases the problem arises after some sort of configuration change was made to the system (as was the case with my machine when I
 added in the Radeon HD43540 graphics card).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many of the suggestions from these threads but in most cases I'm unable to even open Windows in Safe Mode so I can't get past that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did do a backup to an external drive in July (it might be before I went to version 1803) so my only hope is that this will restore me to a point that Windows will boot up. I do not have any files on this machine that I need to save but it would help if
 I could retain the apps so I don't have to reload all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone at Microsoft that cares about this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plan on contacting my Senators and Representatives to suggest that as a virtual monopoly that Microsoft should be subjected to ongoing regulation similar to what existed for telephone companies in the past. Microsoft should be required to support its legacy
 Windows operating systems or else turn over any versions that it stops supporting into the public domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sick and tired of having to go through these "upgrades" again and again when I have no use for them. It is only the threat that there will be no support that drives this. But as I am finding there really is no support anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They should change there logo to Micro$oft.</p>

<p>Well, I exhausted all of the various remedies that I could find for the&nbsp;<span>"bootres.dll is corrupt" problem. In most cases I could not boot into Safe Mode so it was not possible to try them. Nothing worked to get out of
 the unsuccessful repair loop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Luckily, given that I had had to go back to version 1709 on my other machine I was smart enough back in July to create a restore point on an external drive before updating to version 1803. After creating a disk image
 backup of my hard drive using DiscWizard I was able to restore my system back to version 1709. Once the driver loaded for the new graphics card I had 1920 x 1080 resolution. (I haven't tried to connect to the VGA port on the integrated Intel graphics adapter
 to see if I also get 1920 x 1080 as I had back in July - probably won't given the problems I've already spent too much time on).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft needs to sort out where this problem is arising from and let customers know how they plan to fix it. It is occurring on newer systems that are still under warranty and on many different equipment configurations.
 It is a crippling problem, not just an annoyance.</span></p>

            That PC is probably too old for Windows 10. The Core 2 is from 2008 so your at around a decade old PC. Its really beyond much support for a new OS like Windows 10. I would have run Windows 7 until end of life Jan 2020 and then bought a new PC. Don't waste
 money trying to keep that one running and supporting a new OS.&nbsp;

<p>There may be additional requirements over time for updates, as well as requirements to turn on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications#primaryR5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">specific
 features</a>&nbsp;within the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system easily meets all of these requirements. It does not have UEFI firmware but so far there is nothing that I find published from Microsoft to say that Legacy Boot isn't workable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I buy a new computer in 2020 then I will be playing into their monopolistic game whereby Microsoft gets to collect once again for an installation of their operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent 34 years putting up with the monopoly that was IBM in the 1960's, 70's, and 80's. They just loved to come out with "new features" that would require expensive hardware upgrades. It took Amdahl and the Japanese to put an end to their vicious cycle.
 (Of course, IBM was so focused on selling hardware that they allowed Microsoft to establish a monopoly position in software.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, Apple is an alternative but they are like IBM in that you have to buy into their total integration (and if a hardware component ever fails it is usually very difficult to unsolder it and put in a new component.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless Google is going to expand Chrome to more devices the best cure would be to require Microsoft to put older versions of Windows into the public domain so that an independent company could pick up on support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no problem with Windows/XP or Windows 7 and would be perfectly happy to have continued using either of these but Microsoft dictated.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 update crashed my pc, need product key for Windows</h2>
                    I did a Windows 10 update and my pc would not turn on; kept getting error code. Since I never made a recovery disc, I purchased one from Dell. But now, it wants the Window product key which I don't have because Windows was pre-installed on my pc. &nbsp; Any
 suggestions on how to get the product key??

            Hi  Annette, 
<br />
<br />Are you booting from the Recovery Media you purchased from Dell to reinstall or fix Windows?
<br />
<br />If so when asked for a Product Key, you should see 'Skip this Step' at the bottom of that Window - do you not see that (if you are not booting from the Recovery Media, you cannot skip that step)

<br />
<br />On A Dell, please try this:
<br />
<br />Insert that Recovery Drive
<br />
<br />Start your PC, then on the Dell logo screen, repeatedly press F12 to go to the temporary boot menu
<br />
<br />From that Temporary Boot Menu ,choose the drive the Bootable Recovery drive is connected to . . .
<br />
<br />Does that then boot form that drive?

<h2>            Keyboard &#40;physical &#38; on-screen&#41; not working on log-in screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello together,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my keyboard stopped working on the login screen (no crashes etc, just on day in the morning).</p>
<p>Sadly I cant use the on-screen keyboard, because I will get an error message stating "Could not start the on-screen keyboard".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the keyboard works in BIOS, with the repair disk and in other systems (Linux).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working with Windows 10 Pro 64bit on a desktop-pc (don't know the build; repair-disk only outputs its own build).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a list of things I've already tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>used another keyboard</li><li>used another USB port</li><li>unplugged all other USB devices</li><li>started in safe mode (cmd from repair-disk, because I cant use the shift key)
<ul>
<li>this worked; however, the keyboard did not work here either</li></ul>
</li><li>system restore (repair-disk)
<ul>
<li>unfortunately i don't have a restore-point (i could swear i created one, but now it doesn't matter anyway)</li></ul>
</li><li>image recovery (repair-disk)
<ul>
<li>i don't have an image available</li></ul>
</li><li>start-up repair (repair-disk)<br />
<ul>
<li>error message "Start-up repair couldn't repair your PC"</li></ul>
</li><li>go back to previous build (repair-disk)
<ul>
<li>error message "We ran into a problem and won't be able to take you back to the previous build"</li></ul>
</li><li>remove password (cmd from repair-disk)
<ul>
<li>since I have linked my PC to the microsoft-account, this is not possible</li></ul>
</li><li>create user with no password (cmd from repair-disk)
<ul>
<li>not possible, because cmd from repair-disk is reduced/restricted</li></ul>
</li><li>force on-screen keyboard service to start ("sc config TabletInputService start= auto")
<ul>
<li>not possible, because cmd from repair-disk is reduced/restricted</li></ul>
</li><li>renamed system32\cmd.exe to system32\utilman.exe to get full access to cmd by clicking the little icon in the bottom right corner (this is possible from the repair-disk cmd)<br />
<ul>
<li>"full" cmd has started; however, the keyboard did not work here either</li></ul>
</li><li>renamed system32\osk.exe to system32\utilman.exe
<ul>
<li>nothing happend after clicking the little icon</li></ul>
</li><li>copying system32\osk.exe from another PC to my system32 (and restoring the original utilman.exe)
<ul>
<li>same error message as with my osk.exe</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since I would unfortunately lose my installed programms if I reset my system with the repair-disk, I wanted to avoid this
</span><span><span>sledgehammer approach for now.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So if anyone else has an idea/suggestion/solution, I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best regards</span></p>

<p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>It is a self-built system, which I have updated over the years.<br />
The last upgrade was a few years ago (2-3).
<ul>
<li>8GB Ram, GForce 970, 3,4GHz Quad-Core</li></ul>
</li><li>I am able to boot to safe-mode from repair-disk (see point 4 in my post), but unfortunately the keyboard doesn't work here either (I didn't express myself clearly enough in my post, sorry)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>"Integrated Peripherals" sounds like something you'd find mainly on laptops, but as already mentioned, it's a desktop PC.<br />
So it doesn't surprise me that I couldn't find such a (or similar) setting.<br />
All other settings related to USB are active (all USB ports are active and USB is loaded before the BIOS).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But your suggestion gave me the idea to look for an old PS/2 connector on my motherboard; unfortunately I don't have one.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since no key on the keyboard works, I can't press Alt-Tab either.<br />
When I start the Narrator with the mouse, nothing happens (no audio output or display).<br />
The magnifying glass and the high contrast work perfectly, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the OSK is really executed at startup (on another screen), you would have to change the start position via CMD. This is a bit beyond my capabilities (if at all possible before logging in).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CMD that I use can be launched from the repair-disk (here the keyboard works).</p>
<p>To start CMD (without disk) on the login-screen see point 12 in my first post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the touch keyboard: there is none (desktop PC, no touch monitor).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I had a thought that goes in a similar direction: What if Windows thinks it's a tablet (and boot like one) and then waits for a touch input or something?</p>
<p>Maybe there is a way to reboot Windows via CMD in (forced) desktop mode (even though I have very little hope that this is really the problem).</p>
<p>

            Using the magnifying glass to look off-screen is a nice idea; I'll test it when I get home.<br />
<br />
I wasn't aware that there was a touch keyboard program (taptip) and a "click" keyboard program (osk)...<br />
So I would have to try to prevent the (possible) start of the touch keyboard to start the OSK regularly (if that's really the problem).<br />
<br />
Since the keyboard doesn't work I can't use the Shift + Click on the Powerbutton method.<br />
Therefore I use the Repair-Disk to boot from there into Safe-Mode.

<p>
</p><p>The actual implementation is unclear to me.&nbsp; I know that tabtip.exe is involved and stays running after the TK UI is closed.&nbsp; It is really only having the TK UI closed that is what determines whether the OSK can be started (and vice versa).&nbsp; Try it and see
 for yourself.&nbsp; E.g. add the TK to your Taskbar and open it, then try opening the OSK (without using your real keyboard) or while the OSK is open try clicking on the TK button to see that it won't open then.</p>

<p>I have now moved both versions of the touch keyboard ("...\Program Files\...\TapTip.exe" &amp; "...\Program Files (x86)\...\TapTip32.exe") so that they cannot be executed at startup and (possibly) block the OSK.</p>
<ul>
<li>no success</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Then I replaced the utilman.exe with the touch keyboard (similar to point 13 of my first post) to force it to start and get some kind of input.</p>
<ul>
<li>no success</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Then I started the computer without keyboard and first tried the OSK and then plugged in the keyboard when I arrived on the login screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>no success</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>And last but not least I built my system hard disk into another computer to eliminate any possible hardware errors.</p>
<ul>
<li>same behavior as on the other computer</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>With the magnifying glass I couldn't see any signs of the OSK off-screen either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was it then.<br />
I have absolutely no more ideas/possibilities.<br />

I still hesitate to reset the system; but at some point the moment will come when waiting/trying takes more time than biting the bullet...</p>
