<h2>            Dell laptop camera not working</h2>
                    I just recently purchased a Dell laptop with Windows 10, and just recently discovered the camera will not work on any app. I tried following the help page for reasons the camera might not work, but it doesn't even show that there is one, even though there
 clearly is a camera on the top of the laptop. It won't show on device manager,&nbsp; I have the privacy settings updated to allow the camera to work on the camera app but it still is not working. Please help!!!!

            Hi Sofia.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you all possible fixes that are working for webcam problems.  If you need help performing any steps I am standing by to help.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Camera app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Camera &gt; Advanced Options.  
<br />
<br />Did you enable the Privacy setting to allow apps to use your webcam?  
<br /><a href="https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disable-camera-or-webcam-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disabl...</a>
<br /><a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-camera-and-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-...</a>
<br />
<br />Try also these steps from Microsoft for when webcam isn't working:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13753/windows-10-camera-does-not-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13753/...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the webcam driver from the Dell Support Downloads web page here for your Service Tag on sticker:  <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Products/?app=drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Produ...</a>.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />To locate the driver in Device Manager (accessed by right clicking the Start Button) choose the View tab &gt; Show Hidden Devices.
<br />
<br />Also compare all other drivers including Chipset, display, sound, etc to make sure you have the latest on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Webcam device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br /> 
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Your diagnostic file did not attach. &nbsp;You will need to upload that file to a file sharing or storage site like Onedrive. &nbsp;The primary cause of freezing of that nature, is your video drivers. &nbsp;Your more than likely have Intel-based video or more on that
 PC. &nbsp;Make sure you visit HP's or Intel's site and install the latest drivers. &nbsp;If continue to have issues, please provide that diagnostic as described.

<h2>            Skype Number</h2>
                    <p>I had a skype number 323-744-7736. It got expired and is no longer on the dashboard for renewal. I tried porting it with other providers and found that this number has not been issues to any one else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can get this number back through skype. I tried contacting skype support but what it does is take me through a series of irrelevant questions. I want to talk to a support person live or through phone call.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>trying to format my HDD for clean win 7 install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> imazlbk  say:</h3>
<h2>            trying to format my HDD for clean win 7 install</h2>
                    <p>I am trying ti format my HDD for a "clean" install of Win 7 and cannot get past the formatting attempt.&nbsp; I am getting the following error message when I try&nbsp;to format&nbsp;"Failed to format the selected partition. error: 0x8004242d"..&nbsp; I have tried to search
 the forum by the message and error code... nothing so far....&nbsp; I am afraid I will have to take it to the local computer repair shop and have them install the OS, which I didn;t want to do... Below are the step that "Andre" suggested I do, but I cannot get
 past step 4..</p>

<p>Booting from GPT is only supported for 64 bit editions of Windows 7 (and Vista) on UEFI based systems (UEFI
<font>–</font> Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).</p>
<p>If your computer does not support UEFI, delete all the hard drives partitions and create a new partition:</p>
<p>1. Boot from the Windows DVD </p>
<p>2. Click Install Now </p>
<p>3. At the setup screen, click Custom (Advanced)</p>
<p>4. Click Drive Options </p>
<p>5. Select the partition(s) you want to format</p>
<p>6. Click Format - this will delete EVERYTHING on that partition</p>
<p>7. Create a new partition and select a partition to install Windows on.</p>
<p>8. Continue with install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi lori<br />
<br />
Guess your setupdisk corrupt<br />
<br />
This problem may occur for one of the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>Windows is incompatible with a mass storage controller or a mass storage driver.
</li><li>A mass storage controller or a mass storage driver is outdated.</li><li>The hard disk on which you want to install Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows Server&nbsp; is a dynamic disk.
</li><li>A data cable in the computer is loose, or another hardware issue has occurred</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
If you are trying to perform a clean installation of Windows, you must provide the correct drivers for the hard disk controller. When you are prompted to select the disk on which to install Windows, you must also click to select the
<strong>Load Driver</strong> option. Windows Setup will guide you through the rest of the process<br />
<br />
Use the Diskpart.exe utility to clean the disk, and then run Windows Setup again
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To use the Diskpart.exe utility to clean the hard disk, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert the DVD into the DVD drive.</li><li>On the <strong>disk selection </strong>screen, press <span>
SHIFT+F10</span>. A <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window opens.</li><li>Type <span>diskpart</span>, and then press <span>
ENTER</span> to open the diskpart tool.</li><li>Type <span>list disk</span>, and then press ENTER. A list of available hard disks is displayed.
</li><li>Type <span>sel disk <var>number</var></span>, and then press
<span>ENTER</span>. <var>number</var> is the number of the hard disk that you want to clean. The hard disk is now selected.</li><li>Type <span>det disk</span>, and then press <span>
ENTER</span>. A list of partitions on the hard disk is displayed. Use this information to verify that the correct disk is selected.</li><li>Make sure that the disk does not contain required data, type <span>
clean all</span>, and then press ENTER to clean the disk. All the partitions and all the data on the disk is permanently removed.</li><li>Type <span>exit</span>, and then press <span>
ENTER</span> to close the diskpart tool.</li><li>Close the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window. </li><li>Click the <strong>Refresh</strong> button to update the <strong>
disk selection </strong>screen. This step lists the disk.</li><li>Run Windows Setup to perform a clean installation of Windows.</li></ol>

                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly since yesterday (probably after een update I guess), my Acer Travelmate laptop (Windows 8.1) won't connect to any Bluetooth device anymore. It worked as normal the day before..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still see the bluetooth devices, but when I want to pair, he keeps trying (no popup although anymore) and after 20 second, the error message

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It's definitely not the bluetooth speaker (works perfect on other devices, also the laptop won't connect to my mobile phone either,
 with the same error)</span></p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Windows Phone 8.1 games not showing in xbox live account </h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got a Nokia Lumia 925 with Windows 8.1 and the latest updates installed. I also have an Outlook.com email account registered with the phone. The phone is also shown as a device on my Microsoft account.</p>

<p>I have an xbox live account using the same outlook.com email address. I have the free version of xbox live.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My gamertag is exactly the same on my Windows Phone and my xbox account. So no issues there.</p>

<p>I've recently started to play games on my Windows Phone and so far have two games installed. They are: -</p>
<ul>
<li>Lara Croft Relic Run&nbsp; </li><li>Dredd vs. Zombies&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>The games play absolutely fine and they show up in the Games App on the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is they do not appear on my xbox live account. I was expecting the games to show in the My Games tab. Apart from my avatar and gamertag nothing else is on my xbox account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why do the games not show on the xbox live account?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it because I've only got the free version of xbox live?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or is it because Windows Phone 8.1 doesn't sync with xbox live accounts.</p>

<p>Can someone help?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>What can I do to make primary folders like Documents, Downloads, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kizzume fowler  say:</h3>
<h2>            What can I do to make primary folders like Documents, Downloads, Music, etc. properly show the contents quickly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Downloads is the worst folder for the bad behavior, but that's likely because I usually have quite a few files there.&nbsp; Sometimes I've had to wait as long as two minutes just to properly view the contents.&nbsp; It's all about waiting for the green progress bar.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I often find myself either downloading files multiple times, or going to the Downloads tab in Chrome, because in Chrome, I can select "Show In Folder" and it will instantly show me the file without having to wait for anything, but if I dare to go to the
 Downloads folder using Explorer/File Manager, I have to wait for the green progress bar to finish before I'm able to see the files in an order that makes any sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people refer to this as "the green progress bar of death", and I can understand why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything that can be done about this other than having fewer than 20 files in the folder?&nbsp; This behavior has been standard in Windows since Vista, though it did seem to get even slower under 7.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>XP never had this issue, the Mac doesn't have this issue, Linux doesn't have this issue, I can use a command prompt in Windows and instantly view the files that way (which is pretty antiquated if you ask me), but if I use Explorer to go to the folder, I
 have to wait for the green progress bar unless I'd been to that folder within the past hour or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's almost as if windows has to completely rebuild a database for all the thumbnails every time I go to the folder (or something, I really have no clue, I'm just grasping at straws trying to guess), and yet, it still doesn't properly show the thumbnails
 until I've had them on the screen for a few moments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> ncr general  say:</h3>
<h2>            Metal Gear Rising&#58; Revengeance, has pretty much been ruined</h2>
                    
<p>I've pretty much played every single Metal gear game making it by far my most favorite game franchise. Hideo Kojima really is the spirit behind its immense story and gameplay style.</p>
<p>In my opinion at the beginning of Rising's development it looked like yet another epic and exciting continuation of of the story and the franchise. but what really frustrates me is, why did Hideo hand the entire development of the game over to platinum games?
 since then everythings gone downhill fast.</p>
<p>1st: The game has turned into a devil may cry hack and slash button bash, which to be honest isn't what MGS fans are looking for.</p>
<p>2nd: The game isnt even part of the Metal Gear series anymore its just a spin off :(</p>
<p>3rd: Theres hardly a story to go along with it, which is practically one of MGS main selling points.</p>
<p>I reckon i would actually be happier if the project was kept cancelled back in 2010 instead of being re-announced and bought back to life by Platinum Games.</p>
<p>Your Opinions?</p>

<p>I think he has a huge boner for Raiden. &nbsp;He turned him into a break-dancing robot but he still isn't cool. &nbsp;Giving the worst character his own game? &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm sure it's just me. &nbsp;Everyone must like him.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If the same game had different characters and didn't coast off the metal Gear name I bet it would slip by without a lot of people knowing about it's existence.</p>

<p>Is Revengeance even a word? According to google Chrome spellchecker it's not.<br />

Also the reason companies do spin offs is often to experiment with different gameplay styles within an established universe.</p>

<p>Everybody knows its a spin off because the main character of the game is not Snake but Raiden. The hack and slash aspect of the game is something different yes but that's because its a different protagonist and I don't know about anything else because I
 didn't play the game yet. But I'm not going to give up on the series or make up my mind just yet. I'll come up with a final conclusion when I get my hands on the game.</p>

<p>Raiden was the main protagonist of MGS2, that doesnt make it a spin off, besides Rising was originally planned to be part of the series, taking place between MG2 and 4. If i wanted hack and slash ill go play dmc

<p>Since I havn't played a Metal Gear game since NES, I guess I'm not bothered by what happens story wise, since I don't know anyway. The game play I saw prior to the switch looked neat, and now that it has been handed off to Platinum they will likely get my
 money without me looking up a single video. Everything I have played by them has been phenomenal. So, although I may not be the norm, this is actually attracting me to the Metal Gear series.

<p>The change in style will attract new players to the franchise i have to admit, but for the existing mgs fans they sure do not like this change in the way the game is presented, like i said before Hideo was the spirit behind the game and with him gone it
 feels like there will be bit of a hole in the project. </p>

<p>What happens if you click Start &gt; Run and type the following in the Run box, followed by clicking OK:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shutdown -r -t 01&nbsp;&nbsp; [note: there is a space after the t and before the zero]</p>

            Hi LemP. Sorry for the lack of detail but when writing my question I am assuming you know things that I can see and of course that is impossible. When I click the Start button I get the same as I have always done and that is the Turn off Computer option
 and after that the Standby, Turn Off and Restart. The Standby and Restart Work fine but when clicking on the Shutdown button I get a blink as though something is about to happen but then nothing. I look at the processor light in case it is working on memorising
 something or some other function but that light is dark.&nbsp;I did some research in general on the net about this and found several people had the same problem and I downloaded and little program from where I can't remember but it starts with &nbsp;%windir%\system32\shutdown.exe
 -s -t 00 and it works fine. I would rather have Windonws do it for me though. I will have to get back to you on the Run experiment in case I lose what I am wrting to you now. I will post this and then try the Run
        </p>

<p>shutdown.exe, which is what I suggested you use and what you downloaded, is actually a tool built-in as part of Windows XP.&nbsp; It's not a third-party program.</p>
<p>The difference is that the -r (that I suggested) results in a restart while the -s (that was in the program that you downloaded) results in a shutdown.</p>
<p>At this point, I'm not sure why (a) nothing happened the first time you ran shutdown or (b) why things stalled after the restart the second time you tried it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing to check is whether there is a problem with a device driver or system service.&nbsp; Open Device Manager (right-click My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Hardware &gt; Device Manager) and see if there are any warning symbols showing (question marks or exclamation
 points).&nbsp; If so, please identify the devices in your response.</p>
<p>At one point, there was a problem with XP hanging while showing the "Saving your settings" message, but you didn't mention that you were seeing that message.&nbsp; In any event, that bug was supposedly fixed in Service Pack 1.&nbsp; What Service Pack do you have installed?</p>
<p>Here's another possible solution -- but it's unlikely to work for you: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q314101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q314101</a></p>
<p>Use the System Configuration tool (Start &gt; Run &gt;msconfig.exe &gt; OK) to determine if the shut down problem is caused by a conflict with some application or service that normally is running.&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310560/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310560/</a>
 Start with "Diagnostic Startup."&nbsp; If you can successfully shutdown the computer after it has started in Diagnostic Startup mode, narrow things down using "Selective Startup."&nbsp; You can pretty safely leave the boxes checked next to "Process System.ini" and "Process
 Win.ini" because these are legacy files and are rarely used unless you have some really old software running.</p>
<p>I suggest starting by disabling the "Startup items."&nbsp; If after disabling all the Startup items and rebooting you can shut down without a problem, you know that one of the Startup items is the cause.&nbsp; You'll have to find it by trial and error.&nbsp; The fastest
 way is to check half the items, reboot, and test; if things work OK, the problem item is in the other half.&nbsp; Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>If disabling all the Startup items doesn't fix things, go to the Services tab, click the box to Hide Microsoft services and then the Disable All button.&nbsp; If rebooting in this configuration works, narrow down the culprit in the same fashion as described for
 Startup items.&nbsp; If this doesn't help, you can UNcheck the Hide Microsoft services box and disable all of those as well.</p>
<p>If none of the above helps, I'm sorry, but I'm out of ideas.</p>

<p>Hi LemP thanks for this. For some reason I did not get a warning of your reply and I am glad that&nbsp;I decided to have a look in case there was progress.</p>
<p>First things first as they come in your suggestions. In device manager the only question mark is again the Other Devices Ethernet Controller which for some reason gave up the ghost a year ago. Instead of replacing it I got a wireless link.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;get no message saving your settings. The only indication that it has seen my instruction to shot down is a blink on the task bar as though something is going to happen but nothing does.</p>
<p>I have opened the msconfig and of course now any attempt now to shut down that is successful will lose this that i am typing as I go along so I will follow your advice from here and see what happens. Thanks</p>

<h2>            Issues with Other User Accounts on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>An administrator of the pc has set me up as a user. I have verified my email address and tried to log on and the computer goes from telling me 'welcome' to telling me 'signing out'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The administrator has tried inviting me to become a user and we have done the same thing and get the same response when trying to log on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have restarted the PC and are still unable to sign me in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating - cannot work out why this is happening or how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how we should go about adding me as a user who can actually log in?!</p>

            Hi jagdishbishnoi
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I am assuming you are able to get into your computer. If not, do let me know.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hi Jagdish, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Try to enter Safe Mode to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<h2>            Chess Titans for Windows 10</h2>
                    &nbsp;In earlier versions of Windows like Windows XP, Windows Vista and &nbsp;Windows 7, Chess Titans was found and I love it very much to play. After getting Windows 10 in my laptop, I miss Chess Titans a lot. I tried Chess games that are available in the store
 but that does match Chess Titans. So, can I get it back in Windows 10? Please help me get back Chess Titans in Windows 10 also.

<p>
</p><p>As chess programs go, Chess Titans plays very poorly. There are several better choices you might want to consider, especially Fritz and Rybka. Neither is free, but if you want to play against a strong opponent and learn from it, you might want to buy one
 or both of those.</p>

            You know the lead is fine because you have tested it with another camcorder and computer and it works?<br />
Device manager will only tell you that in theory the port should be working, it doesn't test for a physical problem with the port, so this might still be a problem.<br />
<br />
Try capturing with another programme, such as the already installed movie maker to see if that works.<br />
<br />
If not, then do the etsting of all the equipment on this apge to ensure it is all ok before we start making changes to the pc, as 90% of the time I find it is faulty equipment that is the problem.<br />

<br />
By looking at the dll file I see it has a mismatch in as much as the file altered date is a long time BEFORE the created date. I suspect a change of Mobo/CPU combined with a BIOS crash on the new Mobo may have something to do with it.<br />
<br />
Can this dll be replaced? if so where would be a SAFE place to download it.&nbsp; I am aware it is located in a couple of places.<br />
<br />
I have tried a restore, regrettably that point was not back far enough. I also tried creating a new administrator account, but neither attempt made any difference.
<br />
<br />
I have also tried sfc /scannow which threw up no problems.<br />

            For the two post I made with connection to this problem, it transpires that the Software suppliers records showed I had the product installed on more than one machine due to the hardware upgrades. It wasn't, and the bios catastrophe helped to recreate
 the problem, but once contacted, the software suppliers edited their records, and everything now works.<br />

</p><p>Many others, not just Surface owners, are having similar problems.&nbsp; I have a HP Stream 8 tablet and its battery life has gone way down since the Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp; I've tried the "remedies".&nbsp; None are the "magic bullet".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed Microsoft folks here tend to give canned answers that for the most part, don't work.&nbsp; I'm fairly sure our friends in Redmond know about this and (hopefully) are hard at work to make things better.&nbsp; Maybe the next update?&nbsp; Or the one after? ........</p>

            <p>I ran a test on mine when it had Windows 8.1 on it and on three tries, it got 6.5 hours (i3 model).</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10 and set at factory default settings, it now gets 5 hours and 43 minutes (tops).&nbsp; I also have a HP Stream "14" (Windows 10) laptop and battery life got cut down about 50 minutes compared to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, something is eating the power.&nbsp; For me, though, that is plenty of time for use.&nbsp; I do not live on the machine all day long so the reduced amount of time per charge doesn't really effect my use.</p>

            <p>I were able to watch 5 hours of consecutive video using netflix and still had some juice left with 8.1, around 20-30%. I can't watch 4h hours and the battery is almost gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yesterday I used my surface for web browsing for 2:25 minutes and that drained 52% of my battery with 30% brightness. Microsoft advertises that the surface pro 3 is capable of 9 hours of web browsing, I expected at least 6 to 7 hours. Windows 10 killed my
 battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My battery report says that since I did a clean installation, a full battery time would be 4:40 hours and I basically use my surface pro web browsing and takes class notes.&nbsp; I am extremely disappointed because the battery is not lasting the period of my
 classes.</p>

            <p>I am thinking that the Edge web browser is kicking in the graphics a little too much and is causing part of that drain.&nbsp; You can go to Program Files and you will find that Internet Explorer is still in the system and can use it.&nbsp; I have not ran it for a
 battery duration test and there might not be any improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a shame, but these tablets have never achieved the original 9 hours of use no matter which model you have of the Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having the tablet fail on you in class can be a disaster.&nbsp; I have the i3 model and knew it 'should' get better performance than the higher models and in some ways it does.&nbsp; Lately, the fan has been kicking in when the machine is idle and not running anything
 but the fan will also kick in almost instantly when I launch the Edge web browser and any Microsoft Office application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When that happens, I usually run the tablet for about 20 minutes and just plain shut it off.&nbsp; In general, it is becoming useless.&nbsp; I do take it with me "on the street" and have been connecting via a hotspot utility I have on my Android phone called "FoxFi"
 and even though, not spectacular, the Pro 3 connects with it with no problem.&nbsp; However, again, I usually only use it for about 20 minutes in that fashion as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, it is a good machine and I do like it but the updates are killing it.&nbsp; Right now, it is a 'test' machine and is now running two builds higher than the official release version of Built 10240 which is the final version all others are using.&nbsp; There
 is supposed to be another build on the horizon soon and will see if there are any improvements from it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So, Microsoft "could" be working on the power management system - unknown.</p>

            <p>Hello, I am in a desperate situation here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Surface Pro 3 with 128GB and 4GB of ram (it came with windows 10 installed) has a really low battery life. When I first opened it (about two weeks ago) I left my SP3 with the charger until it said 100% full. But, it said four and a half hour remaining.
 I didn't pay much attention to it at first since I thought it would just get better and I was busy trying out my new laptop so I just didn't worried about it. But now, I noticed that every time it charges to 100% battery, it was different every time
 I have left, which absolutely frustrating since Microsoft said it will have about nine hours of battery life- enough for the whole day. Well, the problem is that it is not enough for the whole day and my surface pro 3 only lasts for a few hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help since I rely on my surface a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> huskychan1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I exit an installation that is in progress&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I am downloading a program on my computer. It is slow, it hasn't moved at all. I went to the website to see if that was the problem, if the website needed to be up. It still doesn't work. I tried downloading something else to stop it, but it said only
 that one could be downloaded. So that did not work.It does not give me the option to close, I can't X or close out of it, and it wont finish. How do I close out&nbsp; of it? I Can't get rid of it at all, and I don't need it. I made a mistake of trying to download
 it in the first place. Basically, I am asking how to close the window when I have clicked every close button on the window possible. Please help. Thanks.

            Hi Piyush,
<br />
<br />No you are not infected, this is a bug in Windows, the function to eject removable drives is mounted on the rundll process
<br />
<br />Try plugging in a couple of external drives until you have an actual F drive, then eject that using that process and see if it clears this bug . . .

<h2>            System Locale is stuck in Japanese</h2>
                    I recently changed my Locale and system language to Japanese in order download something from Japan. I changed it back to English afterwards but for some reason when I check my system information the locale is still Japanese and nothing I do will change
 it. As far as I can tell the only impact that this has is that some pop-ups are in Japanese, although my computer seems to be running slower than normal but this might be unrelated. My machine is an MSI GE72 6QD Apache Pro, I can provide any additional information
 if necessary.

 i return to my desktop and still cant login and the same message appears, so i attempt to refresh my computer except now my administrator password is now not being accepted even though it has never changed and had worked perfectly before this last update.</p>
<p>I really am stressing due to all my files for college being on my computer</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you’re not able to log in to the computer, I will make sure to help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First you may check if there is any sign in option below the password and see if you get option to select the type of account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you don’t find any sign in option then, I suggest you to perform a system restore from Windows recovery environment.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you think an app or driver that you recently installed caused problems with your PC, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but
 it might remove recently installed apps and drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to perform system restore from Windows Recovery Environment:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on the <strong>Power icon</strong> on the bottom right corner.</span></li><li><span>Then <strong>press and hold Shift button</strong> on the keyboard and then choose option
<strong>Restart.</strong></span></li><li><span>This will take you to <strong>WinRE</strong> from here</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> and then </span>
</li><li><span>Click on <strong>Advanced option </strong></span></li><li><span>And select <strong>System Restore</strong></span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps and let us know the status of the issue we will be glad to help you.</span></p>

<h2>            VPN  via ICS &#40; internet connection sharing &#41;</h2>
                    Hi , when using ICS (internet connection sharing) which i have to use as i have a VPN software on laptop to connect to Xbox&nbsp;live via XB1 in a last ditch effort to avoid Ddos and host kicking etc, my speed on the shared device (xbox not the laptop goes
 incredibly slow) yet when i connect to vpn using no ICS&nbsp;on just my laptop its fine. its as if the ICS adaptor has additional protocols on it that either delegate more data for the&nbsp;laptop and less for the shared device. I wirelessly connect by wifi to my laptop,
 then via ipvanish using the network&nbsp;adaptor to xb1 via ethernet. Speeds are fine using wireless or wired, so the set up is fine until i introduce ICS

<p>Hi thanks fr the reply, but that link just directs me to a generic page for Xbox. The Xbox is no problem, its any device i share to from my laptop (win 7 pro) when using ICS on the relevant network adaptor.Please dont just send me around willy nilly, ive
 had enough of trying to get this fixed. This is a specific error ONLY happening when sharing my vpn (or regular internet) via ICS to route to any forwarding device. Even on the odd times it works fine (which it does ,so i know it can work), it will&nbsp; sometimes
 then display Upnp, double nat etc errors, which i might add have only appearedin the last few months and were never a problem before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h3> rachaelbriana  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I switch from back facing video camera to the front facing video camera from within a website or app on my Surface 2&#63;</h2>
                    I have been using my Surface 2 to record videos for my online learning class. Usually&nbsp;the screen brings up the foreword facing camera in order to record&nbsp;however this time it was facing backward. This is a problem because I often use the dual screen and
 need to see the time elapsed. I also cannot pre-record the video through the camera application because it's the wrong&nbsp;file type and&nbsp;won't upload to the website and often we do live streaming for class. How can I switch from back facing video camera to the
 front facing video camera from within a website?

</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us with this question regarding switching between cameras for streaming on a website. We're here to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which website are you using? Are there any options in the user interface to choose between different cameras? If you swipe from the right and choose
<strong>Settings</strong> when there, are there any options in the various categories at the top to switch between cameras? Furthermore, we assume that you are using Internet Explorer, as this is a Surface 2, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these questions, so that we may better assist you.</p>

            HI Jeffrey, 
<br />
<br />Do you have already have Windows 10 media built? 
<br />
<br />If so, Boot it to your laptop, then Get to a page where it shows you all your partitions, highlight and delete them all, until you have 1 unpartitioned drive, then click “next” and the install process will start.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this helps, we’ll try to figure this out!

            Hi Jeffrey, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />Chkdsk can take several hours - longer than 5 depending on the size of your hard drive, I have a 2Tb drive which can take over 24 hours to complete a scan &amp; yes it will will appear to stall at several points.
<br />If you wish to stop a chkdsk at every startup either allow it to complete or once logged in open cmd prompt/powershell with admin &amp; type/paste: fsutil dirty query C: &amp; click enter.

            Hmmm, 
<br />
<br />Instead of picking “new” just hit “next” down in the bottom right. See if the same error code comes up. If no dice... 
<br />
<br />Do you have another PC and free USB to use? I think we should create new media. I know it sounds crazy, but new media may work.

<br />The two links above are to the Windows 10 iso, and how to build the bootable usb.
<br />
<br />You could also use these apps I like to build the media:

            Hi  庆桐谭
<br />
<br />Right click your Start Button, choose Powershell (admin) 
<br />
<br />Copy and paste each of these commands one at a time into Powershell and hit Enter: 
<br />(let each command complete, before pasting the next one. If a command results in an error, continue with the next command) 
<br />
<br />reg delete “HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionTileDataModelMigrationTileStore” /va /f 
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “appxmetadataappxbundlemanifest.xml”)} 
<br />$bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname 
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage -packagetype main |? {-not ($bundlefamilies -contains $_.packagefamilyname)} |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “appxmanifest.xml”)}
<br />
<br />
<br />When that last command completes, close Powershell and restart (not shut down) your PC . . .
