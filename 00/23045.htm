<h2>            When printing, text-indent CSS causes indent in the middle paragraphs at the tops of pages.</h2>

<p>In the page above, the class "body-text" adds a 2-pica indent to each paragraph. This works fine until you try to print it. When you try to print it, the first line of each page is indented, whether it is at the start of a paragraph or in the middle of a
 paragraph. It prints fine in Firefox. Any ideas?</p>

<p><span><span>I’m not seeing the indent on the first line of the page when in the middle of a paragraph. Below is the image of the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; page of the website you linked

<p>CSS is meant to render zebpages, not quite to print them that way. I found some references about CS for printing that you might want to have a look at:</p>

                    Hi, i deleted my messages&nbsp; that i sent to&nbsp; one of my contacts and then deleted the conversation itself FROM Skype on my PC windows 10. Now i opened Skype on another android device and i found the conversation synchronized BUT i couldn't find the deleted
 messages. I read that it's impossible to recover those messages back . BUT they are stored for 30 days in the cloud. SO now i need your help how&nbsp; to do that .. i desperately need those messages .. thank you&nbsp;

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Yes, the last 30 days of your conversation
</span><span>are also stored in the cloud, so you can access it when you're signed in to Skype on any device. However, if you delete a message, it will be deleted on the other devices as well, since it will
 sync throughout Skype. Unfortunately, there’s no option to recover those deleted messages.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information helps.</span></span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Brandy,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To troubleshoot the issue, you can </span>try deleting the cache files of Internet Explorer with the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open Internet Explorer and Internet options.</span></li><li><span>In the General tab-&gt;Browsing history -&gt;click Delete.</span></li><li><span>Select the check-boxes-&gt;click Delete-&gt;click OK.</span></li></ol>
<p style="text-align: left"><span>Restart Internet Explorer and try to sign in to <a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://portal.office.com</a>, see if you are able to install Office now. If resetting the browser does not help, you may try InPrivate session of Internet Explorer to login.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open Internet Explorer-&gt;Safety.</span></li><li><span>Click InPrivate Browsing and try again in the new window.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If none of the above things help, you can try installing Office 2016/2013 from the link, which I have sent you in the private message. Please click

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            User Unable to access Public Folder Calendar in Office 365 Calendar</h2>
                    
<p>One of my users is having trouble adding a Public Folder Calendar in Office 365 Calendar. The user can right-click on Other calendars, select Open calendar, and then search for the calendar and add it. It will appear in the Other calendars section, but when
 the user opens it they receives the message Couldn't open calendar - A connection couldn't be made with the shared calendar. Remove the calendar and try to add it again, or ask the owner to share it again.</p>
<p><br />
The user appears to have the needed permission to access the calendar.</p>
<p><br />
Trouble shooting attempted:<br />
* Walked user through removing and re-adding the calendar<br />
* Checked permissions - previously they had reviewer permissions and was later given Publishing Editor permissions<br />
* Tried removing the user from permitted users for calendar and then re-added</p>
<p>Any idea what's wrong?</p>
<p>I've been told that users can not add calendars directly in OWA - that they must add them in the Outlook Client and then they will appear in OWA. Can anyone confirm this?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>hi billy,</p>
<p>according to the description, i assume that the user is trying adding his public folder calendar into his office 365 calendar in owa. am i right?</p>
<p>regarding “i've been told that users can not add calendars directly in owa - that they must add them in the outlook client and then they will appear in owa. can anyone confirm this?” yes, you are right, if someone tries opening his public folder calendar,
 he must add them in the outlook client, after that, the public folder will appear in owa automatically.</p>
<p>below are the detailed steps of how to add a public folder calendar in office 365 calendar:<br />
1.&nbsp;open outlook 2013 client,&nbsp;hold "ctrl+6" to open all folders.<br />
2.&nbsp;click<strong> public folders</strong>, right click <strong>all public folders</strong>, click
<strong>new folder</strong>. type in the name, select <strong>calendar items</strong> under “folder contains”, place the public folder calendar into the main calendar under “select where to place the folder”.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=66487a47-bd30-4362-8578-c2599d498e25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d66487a47-bd30-4362-8578-c2599d498e25" /></a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp;after that, the public folder calendar will appear both in outlook client and owa.</p>
<p>please let me know if anything is misunderstood.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
mouran</p>

<h2>            Spinning Wheel in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Outlook for Mac 2011 and the application has started to slowdown as I navigate/click folders throughout the application and as a result the spinning wheel appears each time.&nbsp; I have reloaded Office 2011 and applied the latest service pack.&nbsp;
 I am unable to identify where the issue lies, can anyone provide any guideance.&nbsp; The user is using pop and Exchange accounts within the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I addition, is it possible to create an archive of the inbox specifying a date range.&nbsp; If so how i this done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am new to this application and realised that the user's inbox is made up of the Exchange account and another folder called "On my computer".&nbsp; Is this folder the equivalent to the Windows PST email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help - I need to solve the problem with the spinning wheel</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            You should NOT connect the same account in two different email clients at the same time. Put one in offline mode. Gmail will throttle you if you connect too often. Gmail suggest checking every 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Outlook is set to active-sync with IMAP accounts. You might try editing in Accounts under the Advanced tab for your Gmail account to sync using a longer time setting than the default.<br />

</span>Check how much RAM is installed. It's possible you need to upgrade your memory.<span style="font-weight: bold">
</span>Look under the Apple in the Menu bar &gt; About this Mac.<span style="font-weight: bold">
</span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dianeross/5344524220/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">see image</a><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
I addition, is it possible to create an archive of the inbox specifying a date range.&nbsp; If so how i this done.<br />
<br />
</span>I think Exchange basics will solve most of your issues. If you need to archive any data you can create a smart folder using dates. Assign those messages a category you create the under File &gt; Export select to export by category and delete after exporting.<br />
Exchange Basics</span><br />
<br />
The Inbox syncs more frequently than any other and should be kept as clean as possible. (this is the number one cause of problems with sync). Do NOT make subfolders under the Inbox.<br />
<br />
Any folder with more than a few thousand messages is going to take some time to fully come down when you first sync your account. Due to the design of Outlook's sync engine (and how exchange works), you will see the 512 newest messages in a folder at the initial
 start of sync then the rest of the folder's contents will be back filled before you see any mail that arrives after this point. This is why it will look like you are not getting new mail when a folder is still going through initial sync. This is also further
 exacerbated by an Exchange issue where it gets unnecessary change events before the newer mail arrives. If you carefully watch the progress during the sync of a folder with greater than a couple thousand messages, you will see "Updating local..." a lot before
 the newer mail starts arriving (newer than the initial 512 that come down).<br />
<br />
Outlook checks the server for updates every minute, any folder that has updates will subsequently be synced. Since Outlook has a limit on how many folders can be synced at a time, there can be a queue of folders waiting. The Inbox does get high priority so
 it will generally sync before other folders that also need to sync.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</span>No! "On My Computer" folders are for storing POP messages and only exist on your computer and not on the server (exception if you select to "leave on server"&nbsp; for POP)<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
</span>Outlook Mac can only import a .pst file. That's all.<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />

            Contacted Microsoft support by phone yesterday. Their answer was that there is not an actual product key number to the product that i purchased and downloaded directly from Microsoft online, but that the product in question (Windows 10 Pro Edition) was
 linked to my e-mail. So if for some reason that i should have to re-install windows, i should select download from e-mail and product should re-install. I still feel that there should be a product key number.....

            Hi hannah2019,<br /><br />I’m an independent advisor here to help. <br /><br />You could use a variety of formulas and combinations. <br /><br />Nested IF statements and/or VLOOKUP would be able to do it. <br /><br />It’s depends on how much you need to match. Is it only Edmonton and Calgary, or are there many other cities in column I and you only want those  two cities?

<p>The simplest way to get an answer is if you create some dummy data and give use manually created examples of what you want as an end result . Then upload and share the file for us to look at and "play with".

<h2>            draw not working</h2>
                    Hi, I'm using word but can't use the drawing tools, when I open the tool bar all the tools are light rather than dark and nothing happens when I click on them. I've updated to the latest version and it is still the same, I tried in other documents but
 no access to the drawing tools in any document.

<p>An android phone would do the same thing if it was not accessing the same file.

I have a table with contents in ms-word 2003 and I want it in another format using mail merge option. I could not succeed in retaining the original text format (italics, superscript, subscript etc.,) in the merged document. Kindly suggest the method to retain
 the same.<br />

            If your data source is a Word document, you can <i>sometimes</i> retain <i>some</i> of the formatting from the data source by
<div>&nbsp;a. using Alt-F9 to display the merge field codes (e.g. so you see { MERGEFIELD myfield }</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. for each field where you want to retain formatting, change that to&nbsp;</div>
<div>{ REF myfield }</div>
<div>or possibly even just</div>
<div>{ myfield }</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you see "\*Mergeformat" in the field code, delete it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, that relies on a very old feature of Word (it's the way mailmerges were originally done, before the { MERGEFIELD field was introduced) and it is very much a case of "if it does what you want this time, fine, but don't expect it to do what you
 want next time" :-)</div>

    <title>Excel For MAC 15.37 Web Query Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dfischer71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel For MAC 15.37 Web Query Problem</h2>
                    <p>I have a number of web queries that I use to obtain stock prices using Excel "Data/Get External Data/Run Saved Query". &nbsp;It has been several months since I last ran them and had no problem at that time. &nbsp;However, now when I run any of them I can see a message
 in the cell on the spreadsheet that it is running. &nbsp;But, the message disappears and NO data is returned. &nbsp;It is just blank and there is no error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the query statement is still valid because I can copy it and go to Safari and enter it as a URL address and it takes me right to the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that has changed in my whole setup/system is that a few weeks ago I installed a new router. &nbsp;But, if it was blocking me somehow, then I would expect other problems. &nbsp;Everything else seems to work fine. &nbsp;My Excel works fine. &nbsp;My Safari and
 internet access works fine. &nbsp;I just can't get the queries to return data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the confirmation - so I went and look at the query I ran yesterday and actually found that I only included 1 stock. So something like this should be OK:</p>
<p><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ari" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ari</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While multiple stocks don't work, such as the one you provided:</p>
<p><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ari,bce,mdp,nmfc,txn,dri,eat,stag,codi,ohi,nly,vfstx,jps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ari,bce,mdp,nmfc,txn,dri,eat,stag,codi,ohi,nly,vfstx,jps</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then went and tested this on previous versions of Office 2016 for Mac, and can confirm the same behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, it seems like something has changed on Yahoo's end, not Office, as even old version of Office can't seem to run the query with multiple stocks anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the situation, I suggest you run the stock individually or follow Jim Gordon's advice in this thread instead:</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_mac/can-no-longer-get-stock-quotes-in-excel-2016-on/20a74032-28c7-4962-8904-61b171b726fb">Can no longer get stock quotes
 in Excel 2016 on Mac</a>.</p>

                    I have two Samsung Focuses.&nbsp; I use one and sync it to Exchange.&nbsp; My wife uses the other and syncs it to Hotmail.&nbsp; In both cases, old appointments (other than recurring appointments) do not seem to be available on the phones although they are there in Exchange/Live
 Calendar.&nbsp; Is there a way to configure WP7 to sync appointments in our calendars that are older than two or three weeks?

            Don't think so. I expect there was a conscious decision to limit the past appointments to a couple of weeks. That was one of the options in previous sync options, along with 'all'. Likely surveys indicated folks either weren't using the options, didn't
 understand them, or just used the default. In an effort to simplify the user experience, which unfortunately often leads to limiting options, and a desire to optimize storage use, I bet they picked a middle ground and made it the standard. Recurring appts
 are probably just in there once so don't take much space, forward or backward. Just my conjecture on why, but it doesn't appear there is an option. I guess if you really need to see past appointments in Live, you can always use IE directly. Not sure there
 is a good work around for Exchange. Exchange web access maybe?

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A quick question before we proceed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Mention the type of email accounts configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) or Exchange Server Account)?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to start Outlook in safe mode from the following&nbsp;steps mentioned below and then verify if Outlook is performing correctly or not:<br />
<br />
* Hold Windows key + R.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:<br />
Outlook /safe <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: There is space between Outlook and /.<br />
<br />
If Outlook works&nbsp;in&nbsp;safe&nbsp;mode as expected, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below to determine the problem causing add-in:<br />
<br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.</span></p>

            That is how a ListBox works... the highlighted line is an indicator to the user which item is currently selected. It also allows your program to reference the item via the ListIndex property. There is a way to do what you want (possibly dependent on where
 exactly you are running your code from) but then your user and your program will lose access to the selected item (unless you store that information in a global variable before hand). To remove the highlighting (and lose the reference to the selected item,
 just set the ListIndex property to -1 (minus one).

<p>This is probably not a function of Excel, but Windows.&nbsp; On your desktop, right-click, select "Properties".&nbsp; Then select the "Appearance" tab.&nbsp; Click on the "Advanced" button.&nbsp; From the "Item" drop-down list, select "Selected Items".&nbsp; See if the colors are
 blue and white.&nbsp; If they are, reset them to the default Windows colors.</p>

 took it to a Microsoft Store in Houston, TX and they could not help. They suggested I wait for a build update that might bring a fix. I also notice the reset occur mostly when battery level at near 25% and it will reset when a text, phone call, waking out

            <p>**** UPDATE # 2&nbsp; ****</p>
<p>
</p><p>Calvin, the Houston TX store employee may have it right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My new phone has been fully rebuilt and is once again exhibiting the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am either in receipt of a piece of hardware which has the same Bluetooth Module anomaly, which is statistically unlikely I presume (unless this fault is very prevalent), or the issue lies somewhere else, such as in the OS update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One clue to check on your phone:</p>
<p>Open the People App and then open Settings.</p>
<p>There will be a list of the MS Account(s) being used by the People App.</p>
<p>I have five MS Accounts, however the Primary Account, which links to all my other devices, never is at full&nbsp;brightness - it's always greyed out and "syncing" or "needs attention".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tap that account&nbsp;after it displays the "needs attention" message the error message expands to state the following (paraphrased):</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Having a problem syncing eas.outlook.com at the moment, try later.&nbsp; Error code 0x86000c0a".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searched that error code, but couldn't find a user-initiated solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have left the phone alone, connected to and in close proximity to my wireless modem, when it's "syncing" and come back to it in the morning, eight hours later,&nbsp;and it will still be "syncing" or will have the "needs attention" error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue needs to be resolved quickly - I can only have my phone reboot during so many business phone calls,&nbsp;or during so many meetings before it's a liability that will force me to prompt a change in OS and the alternatives are less than appealing.</p>

 the phone crashed. I hope this issue is addressed soon.

            <p>I have the exact same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Lumia 950 was delivered in February 2016 and was functional until a series of updates that started in late spring and ended in august.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worst of these updates was the second I seem to recall. After that update it has never worked again. It is horribly unstable. Constant reboot, on occasion it crashes when an incomming call arrives....locking up the ringtone and this can only be fixed
 by removing the battery....oh, and the constant reboot/crash/overheat behaviour has damaged the battery. It now cannot make it to lunchtime, unused with more than 60% battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reset, hard reset and rebuilt.</p>
<p>I have removed the sdcard</p>
<p>I have removed the phone from its flip cover (in case it was heat related)</p>
<p>I have uninstalled all apps pretty much except edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have disabled everything I can. (going into privacy and turning off the default "everything is always on and always using your battery" actually improved battery life to the point that the phone would make it to lunchtime at all!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still resets, it still crashes nothing I have done makes any difference to the performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As much as bad software I am starting to suspect bad memory. If microsoft cheaped out on ram and then wrote bad software which maxed out the write cycles in a few months this would explain the constant crashing and reboots...the phone crashes when it is
 trying to fetch data from a bad memory location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that changing a setting or similar is the most frequent cause of user induced reboots. (as is writing and sending a text message.)</p>
<p>Turn wifi on? crashes soon after</p>
<p>Turn wifi off? crashes soon after (like moments)</p>
<p>flight mode or any other similar setting....exact same as above and as a frequent flyer these are crashes i see very frequently.</p>
<p>write text message, send text message, close app...a few moments later the phone will crash and that message will never appear in the sms list...I have no idea if they get sent, but they certainly dont get saved on the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Edge browser will inevitably crash the phone. (imagine that? writing an OS where a misbehaving app can crash the whole system? I thought these guys wrote code for a living not a hobby!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, the number of things this phone does wrong outnumbers the things that it actually does. &nbsp;I certainly can't use it as a "smartphone" (I have turned everything off to try and make it stable and last longer than a couple of hours unplugged.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is by far and away the worst device I have ever used. (and I include ALL devices from desktop computers to mp3 players and TV's)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>SomethingBrite, that's a good summary of the activities which brings about a reboot on my phone as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're right about the overheating - sometimes my phone just goes black and is doing something in the background because it gets very, very hot and the battery level drops like a stone.&nbsp; It is completely unresponsive until I manually reboot it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft - you need to solve this issue and publish a patch soon.&nbsp; This is not a once a week issue.&nbsp; My phone has rebooted eight times today already, twice during important calls.&nbsp; I'm expecting that it'll reboot another three times before the day is out.&nbsp;
 I work constantly between the office and the job site, so almost all my business occurs from this phone&nbsp;and I can't keep using this device if it's going to keep doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This replacement phone is less than a week old and it's never been dropped.&nbsp; It was built from the ground up just days ago and I don't have any side-loaded apps or Insider programs going on.&nbsp; In fact, I have very few apps onboard as it's crashed before when&nbsp;I
 attempted to download anything.</p>

<p>Office for Mac now uses the same code base as Office for Windows. While that gives us greater feature parity, there base software is built for Microsoft Windows and has to be set up for the Mac each time it opens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the significant time hogs is Apple's sandboxing scheme. It requires a lot of different font handling. If you have a lot of fonts enabled, try turning off the fonts you don't need right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you re using Office on a 5400 rpm startup drive, that will also cause Office to load slowly. Even with a new SSD drive, it still takes longer to launch on a Mac than in Windows, though.</p>

<p>In theory, I suppose you could type the text in the body of the document (positioned with tabs or spaces) and set the picture's text wrapping to "behind text"; change the font color of the text if needed to make it legible. However, the positioning of the
 picture relative to the text will be difficult -- Word Online just doesn't give you proper tools for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For good results, if you can't use desktop Word and its additional features, modify the picture before you insert it in the document. Use a graphics program such as the free
<a href="http://www.irfanview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IrfanView</a> to add the text to the picture and resize it to the size you intend to use.&nbsp;Save it as a file (usually PNG format works best, but JPG is ok). Then insert that file in Word.</p>

    <title>How to create a medical comparison with data from two excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lord kilborn  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to create a medical comparison with data from two excel spreadsheets - what would you do&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My Dr. office uses a&nbsp;worksheet specific to our office that allows us to enter specific information from patients' questionnaires, physical findings, orthopedic and neurologic findings.&nbsp; Basing their performance against medical and functional normals, we
 assign them a score so both they and we can track how they progress (and hopefully improve) over time.</p>
<p>Several of you assisted in solving the last piece of the first puzzle and making the worksheet fully usable in our office.&nbsp; Now my next challenge is creating an easy-to-use way to compare old scores with new scores.</p>
<p>In my head, this involves&nbsp;designing an&nbsp;Excel spreadsheet that will allow me to pick the two files that are to be compared.&nbsp; Ideally, this comparison spreadsheet will pluck information from pre-determined areas in the other two files that are to be compared.&nbsp;
 I know that Excel allows you to bring in information&nbsp;from&nbsp;separate spreadsheets, so that when the values in one change, the values in the other will change as well.&nbsp; My questions are:</p>
<p>1) is what I am proposing above possible?</p>
<p>2) would it simply be easier to copy the data tab from one document and paste it into a new document... and if so, how would the comparison that I set up know where to grab the information from?</p>
<p>The people on here seem to be quite knowledgeable. How would you best go about setting up a system like I am describing above?&nbsp; Ideally, I want this system to be low-maintenance... we already spend a lot of time sifting through data, paperwork, and documentation,
 so we do not want to add a lot.</p>
<p>FYI, currently, when we gather the initial information from a patient, we enter all of it into one&nbsp;Excel template&nbsp;that is saved as an excel file (patient name, date) on our server.&nbsp; When we do a reassessment later, we will be entering that new (reassessment)
 information into the same template, and saving it using the same naming protocol, so the last/first name will be the same but the date will be different.&nbsp; So when I say above, "pluck information from pre-determined areas in the other two files that are to
 be compared", these are the two files that I am speaking of.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your help!</p>

<p>It is all possible, though I think it maybe better suited to a database program such as access. But that involves a big learning curve.</p>
<p>If you have specific questions and can give samples of data, then I can see no problem in setting up such a system. It is however difficult without more information to give a great deal of help. It would also help if you could let us know the kind of answers
 you would like. For example are you happy using VBA. Or would you prefer an all formula solution.</p>
<p>One question that does spring to mind is why keep different records for one patient could it not be done with different sheets within one workbook, which could also have the progress sheet included.</p>

<p>I am open to creating one workbook with different sheets.&nbsp; The only problem arises on subsequent analyses.&nbsp; Would I create a workbook with, say, 15-20 sheets in it for subsequent re-exams, or would there be a way of simply "copying" a sheet over at each
 re-exam?&nbsp; If I copied it, would it not piggy-back its findings on the back of the already-existing data?</p>
<p>I am open to the simplest solution possible.&nbsp; I am not a programmer (and am not all that familiar with Access), but I do have a good deal of experience with Excel... although I consider myself only able to figure out the simple and moderately complex types

<p>That is a prescription for a disaster.&nbsp; You might not want to read this but this approach to retaining data is fundamentally wrong.&nbsp; In the coming weeks, months, or years, you will have a disaster on your hands.</p>
<p>In addition, it is extremely unfriendly when it comes to doing any kind of data analysis or data mining.&nbsp; How have patient X scores evolved over the last 2 years?&nbsp; How does patient X's performance&nbsp;compare with other patients who started with a similar score?&nbsp;
 Are there any patterns among our patents -- by age? by gender? by marital status? by lifestyle? by job type?</p>
<p>How do you think large organizations store data?&nbsp; Take a bank like Citi, or Bank of America, or Chase.&nbsp; Do you think they have 1 Excel file per customer per account per day?</p>
<p>I would reconsider the entire approach.&nbsp; Use a system that is consistent with a relational database.&nbsp; Either use a real database system (MySQL is free) or use Access or even a single Excel workbook with separate worksheets (one for patient information, one
 for visit, one for each set of clinical tests).&nbsp; For an example see</p>

<p>To answer your question about types of data, let's keep it simple:&nbsp; Diastolic BP is an indicator of heart health.&nbsp; 90+ is considered hypertension and that is a negative indicator of health.</p>
<p>My equation for Diastolic BP is as follows (here is the train of information and formulas):</p>
<p>Data entry for all factors we consider is on one sheet currently titled "ALL DATA ENTRY".&nbsp; Data for D-BP is in B9.</p>
<p>I have a separate sheet entitled "Calculations- Do Not Change" that is usually protected from changes.&nbsp; The answer from All Data Entry is imported into E7 via "='ALL DATA ENTRY'!B9" (outer quotes not included in the formula of course).</p>
<p>The calculation I use to "grade" this is "=((100-((E7-70)*1.5))*0.01)" in F7.&nbsp; The calculation to cap the score at 110% maximum is "=IF(COUNT($F7),MIN($F7,1.1),"")" in G7.&nbsp; The calculation to move that result over to the "results" column and its conditionally
 formatted cell is "=G7" in K7.</p>
<p>The calculation used to transfer this grade over to a presentably-formatted results page for delivery to the patient is on a sheet titled "PRINT THIS PAGE"; the calculation is simply "='Calculations - Do Not Change'!K7" in B13.</p>
<p>I hope this is not too confusing.&nbsp; In creation of this tool, several things were mixed around and matched, and then we needed it in a presentable form for the patient to clearly understand what they were looking at.</p>
<p>There is another sheet involved that calculates a patient's perception of their physical and mental well-being entitled "SF-36 Calculations", but it has no bearing on the Diastolic BP calculation.</p>

You can create a template sheet so that in future new re-exams and you need to add the sheets, you can insert the templates, instead of copying with all the previous records. I agree with others that it will be better to maintain a record for 1 patient.</p>
<p>In terms of comparing data, what I normally have is that the first sheet will be called say "Overview" and the rest of the sheets are data information. In the Overview sheet,&nbsp;I will create all the formulas to compare information I need from other sheets
 (which can be dynamic such that when new data are entered, the results in the Overview sheets will be updated automatically, note that not all can be dynamic in nature). Or you can try VBA coding allowing you to have more flexibility.</p>

<p>I imagine you and your employer/client know what you are doing but...</p>
<p>I don't know what exactly these calculations are&nbsp;and I have not encountered this mapping in any discussion on the subject of BP.&nbsp; Just in case I was unaware of a new metric, I search google.&nbsp; The Mayo Clinic, the National Institutes of Health, and the American
 Heart Association all go by the table below.&nbsp; When I visit my physician for a checkup and get a report, the BP information consists of the Systolic and Diastolic numbers as well as what is considered normal.&nbsp; Bottom line: I've never come across&nbsp;a mention of
 rescaling or capping the BP at 1.1</p>

<p>I understand your misunderstanding (if that is possible).</p>
<p>These calculations are for internal use and tracking, and not part of a new standard.&nbsp; We are seeking simply to turn basic health indicators (such as Diastolic BP) into clearly understood grades that the average patient can look at and say "Holy *&amp;%#, I
 need to work on that!"</p>
<p>It is one thing to say "Sir, you have a diastolic BP of 100, which means you have stage 2 hypertension, and you need to take action or the consequences might be a heart attack or death."&nbsp; Not very inspiring, and definitely not likely to make a person jump
 up and take action for their health.</p>
<p>It is a totally different message&nbsp;(and more easily understood by patients) to say, "Sir, when it comes to your blood pressure, you are failing.&nbsp; You made a 55.&nbsp; If this were a school report card, you would have to repeat the class.&nbsp; As you can see from your
 grade, you clearly need to take action before this gets worse, because in this case, failing means a heart attack and possible death."</p>
<p>It makes the message easier for patients, most of whom have no medical education, to understand.</p>
<p>The best answer here would be to use Access, but I do not know if I have the expertise to do that.&nbsp; I am leaving Mehta's post there as the best proposed answer, and tomorrow I intend to check that link to see if it will be possible for me (with my limited
 Access knowledge) to design.</p>
<p>Aside from that, using one file for each patient makes much more sense than using multiple files for each patient (by date), but it makes data mining very difficult as Mehta pointed out.</p>
