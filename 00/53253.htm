<h2>            Pandigital Photo Frame 602-B is not working with laptop</h2>
                    <p>My Pandigital Photo Frame 602-B has pictures stored in the internal memory that I no longer have saved in other places and the hard copies cannot be located either. I want to copy or move these pictures
<strong>from</strong> the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">internal memory</span> on the photo frame
<strong>to</strong> my <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">laptop</span>. My computer acknowledges the photo frame but I have no driver for the photo frame on my laptop and have tried for several hours over the course of a week to get a driver for the photo
 frame so I can copy/move the pictures but I can't find anything anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Microsoft fixes and other fixes and nothing works. Pandigital no longer has a website. What can I do to get a driver so my laptop can talk to/work with my photo frame. I really don't want to give up on these pictures. They are the only copies
 I have.</p>
<p>

    <title>Bitlocker TPM&#43;PIN New Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> em0032  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bitlocker TPM&#43;PIN New Laptop</h2>
                    I recently purchased an HP ENVY x360 <a href="http://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-envy-x360-convertible-laptop-15z-touch-1za07av-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HP ENVY x360 15z</a><br />
<br />
First thing i did was install my SSD and install a fresh copy of windows 10 pro.<br />
<br />
The laptop does have a TPM listed in the BIOS and bitlocker seems to be working, however every time i turn on my computer it tells me the Pin is incorrect the first time i enter it. If i just push the enter key again without typing in the pin again it continues
 to boot normally. My concern is that perhaps the encryption is not working correctly.
<br />
<br />
This error is showing in the event logs<br />
<br />
Bootmgr failed to unseal VMK using the TPM 0x80280013<br />
<br />
<br />
HP was completely useless and wouldn't let me talk to a knowledgeable technician without paying even though i just bought the laptop. They claim that by installing a clean copy of windows i voided the software warranty.

            Hi  Elijah, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br />
<br />You need to talk to a Supervisor or Manager at HP though they probably can't help with this issue. As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. Especially during the warranty period.
<br />
<br />See if this helps (and it may not) :
<br />
<br />Start - Settings - Accounts - on left Sign-in options - on right under  Privacy - turn off this setting --&gt;  "Use my sign-in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update or restart"

            Unfortunately it was the supervisor who said i voided my software warranty. They refuse to help me further unless I pay them which i will not be doing. Any insight on this error would be helpful though. That setting is already on and i don't really feel
 is relevant to my situation.

            Well, that supervisor has a boss. HP, as all other OEM's, often recommends a Reset or Clean Install to resolve issues. Even contact Microsoft Legal. Be sure to get HP sales involved.  
<br />
<br />I would raise the issue in the HP forums as well.

    <title>Windows 10 Calendar App ICS sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeyhp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Calendar App ICS sync</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to sync up an external calendar so that it appears on my Windows Calendar app. I have done this via Outlook.com, where I have successfully been able to view the external calendar data, however, this isn't then syncing into my Windows Calendar
 App. I thought the app got all the data from Outlook.com in the first place, as all my other appointments in there are showing.
</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello, yes I have the same question. The instructions you provided are great for adding another account (with login user name and password), but do not work if you are simply trying to subscribe to a calendar using&nbsp;a calendar url (for example: https://www.google.com/calendar/ical..........basic.ics
 )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like Joey, I was able to subscribe to this url calendar on outlook.com, but it does not add to my windows 10 calendar app. Any thoughts on how you can subscribe to just a calendar using a calendar url in the windows 10 calendar app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Yup, I noticed the same thing.&nbsp; I wonder if Microsoft quietly fixed something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I agree... there should be a way to add subscribed calendars directly into the Windows 10 Calendar app.</p>

            <p>You cannot install Windows 7 on an external hard disk. If you all you need Windows 7 just to run a few applications, then you can get by with just setting aside 16 to 20 GBs of disk space.
</p>
<p>You should carefully consider if you need 32 or 64 bit, if all you need is to run Windows 7, then settle for just the 32 bit version which requires less resources.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Requirements:</p>
<p>* 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor</p>
<p>* 1 gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit)</p>
<p>* 16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit)</p>
<p>* DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver</p>

<p><strong>How to dual boot Windows 7 and Windows XP</strong></p>
<p><strong>Creating the partition</strong></p>
<p>If your system is capable, then you are good to go. Before we do that though, we need to set aside some disk space for Windows 7, because the partitioning tools in Windows XP are quite primitive, I personally use Easeus Partition Manager to setup the partition.
 It’s a free download and is very easy to use, in addition to being non-destructive.
</p>
<p>So, the first thing you need to do is download Easeus at the following link</p>
<p>Easeus Partition Master Home Edition - <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Easeus-Partition-Manager-Home-Edition/3000-2248_4-10863346.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Easeus-Partition-Manager-Home-Edition/3000-2248_4-10863346.html</a></p>
<p><br />
------------------------</p>
<p>Proceed to install Easeus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Next, follow the easy on screen instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, click Finish</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Go to main screen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the drive you want to resize in the partition window</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drag the knob until you have a desired amount of disk space to install Windows 7, then release it.</p>
<p>Click apply to apply the changes you just made. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Yes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Yes again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your computer will restart a few times and changes will be made to the partition layout, this process is hands free, so no interaction is required.
</p>
<p>Installing Windows&nbsp;7 </p>
<p>After the partition is created, you will be booted to the Windows XP desktop.&nbsp;Boot from the Windows 7 DVD.
</p>
<p>After inserting the Windows&nbsp;7 disc, restart your computer and boot from the DVD.</p>
<p>To learn how to change your BIOS options to boot from the DVD drive, the following tutorial:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://notebooks.com/2011/05/05/how-to-load-bios-and-change-boot-configuration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2011/05/05/how-to-load-bios-and-change-boot-configuration/</a></p>
<p><br />
Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows&nbsp;7 logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as your see the indicater, everything should be ok.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should now arrive at this screen, select your time and currency format then click Next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait while setup starts up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accept the End User License agreement and click Next</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Custom install Windows only (advanced)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the partition you created for it then click Next. You have the option of Formatting the drive and creating additional partition's if you wish. Click Drive Options.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait while Windows&nbsp;7 installs. Installation time can vary depending on the speed of your disk, processor and the amount of installed memory.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the installation is complete, click Restart now or wait on Windows&nbsp;7 to do it.

            Windows 7 is specifically designed not to be able to install on an external USB drive. But you can use an external eSATA hard drive to install Windows 7 on.<br />
<br />
You can buy Windows 7 here (or at a local store): <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You could also buy a larger (or second) internal hard drive and dual boot XP and Windows 7.<br />
Note: If you install Windows 7 on a different partition and dual boot with XP you need the Full version of Windows 7.

    <title>Constant BSODs when idle - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deadxwreckoning  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constant BSODs when idle - SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED&#47;code 0x1000007e&#47;ntoskrnl.exe</h2>
                    <p>So the last few days I have had several BSODs. They all seem to happen a few minutes after my PC has been idling; I'm not on it and it's not doing any tasks. The most recent one was caused by ntoskrnl.exe according to bluescreenview, bugcheck 0x1000007e,&nbsp;SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</p>
<p>
</p><p>They started happening after I updated my Nvidia display driver to the latest driver (397.64). It happened 3 times. I did some reading and read the new driver can cause kernel corruption when GPU tools like MSI Afterburner are used (which I use). Bluescreenview
 stated that the Nvidia driver (nvlddmkm.sys) caused the kernel to crash. I need MSI AB so I rolled back to the last driver I had before upgrading (391.35), yet I just got another BSOD today, two minutes after waking my PC from sleep. All I did was wake it;
 it sat idle and then crashed. Now Bluescreenview states that it's just the kernel that crashed, nothing about the Nvidia driver that I can see. I'm not sure what is going on here - the only thing that has changed on my system lately is the Nvidia driver, which
 as stated I rolled back and am still having issues. No other drivers or apps have been updated. I never get BSODs on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I tried viewing the .dmp in WinDbg but I have been receiving "wrong symbols" errors whenever I try to view these dumps. I'm not all too familiar with WinDbg but I'm pretty sure something isn't working right. Maybe someone else can check my dump and
 help me out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dump: http://www.mediafire.com/file/xcchg8y0uovp11w/052418-6781-01.dmp</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a custom built gaming PC.</p>
<p>System Specs:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro x64, version 1803</p>
<p>i7 4790k</p>
<p>Gigabyte G1.Sniper M5 motherboard</p>
<p>2x GTX 970 in SLI</p>
<p>16GB RAM @ 2133 MHz</p>
<p>Corsair RM850i PSU</p>
<p>120 GB Samsung 850 Evo (OS)</p>
<p>2x WD Black in RAID 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>To note: I upgraded to 1803 the day it released. I considered the fact that the new update may have been causing the issue, being that 1803 seems to be causing issues for a lot of people, but these BSODs have only been happening the last few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

            The symbol server is down which is making the dumps difficult to analyse. What I suggest as you said Nvidia is a cause of crash is to 
<br />Completely remove everything of Graphics driver using DDU and install somewhat older copy of the driver available.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />You can head to either the card manufacturer or device manufacturer to get the newest driver.
<br />Let us know if you require any assistance.

            Thanks for your reply. I should have mentioned that I did use DDU to wipe the driver and installed the old one I had before, and still had that BSOD today. However, it seems Nvidia just released a new driver today; I'm about to install it and see if anything
 changes. I hope the symbol server gets fixed here soon.

<p>What a great question - this is something that everyone should do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Begin by signing in to your router's administration console, which holds all your router's settings. Do this by entering your router's IP address into the address bar of any browser and pressing Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your router uses one of the handful of standard IP addresses assigned to consumer routers. You can easily find your router's IP address with a web search; just search for &lt;make and model of your router&gt; IP address. For example, my router's IP address is
 192.168.1.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll be brought to the sign-in screen for your router, where you'll need to enter your router's username and password. Routers' default usernames and passwords are posted on the web, which is why you need to change them. Just search for &lt;your make and
 model of router&gt; username and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the default username and password for my router were admin and admin. Real secure, huh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've entered your router's administration console, look through the screens - there will be lots of them! - until you find the screen that lets you change the admin console's username and password. Choose a long, complicated, un-guessable password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are in your router's admin console, if you're using a WiFi network in any way (even if only for your printer,) and if you haven't already done so, you should password-protect your WiFi network. Choose a different long, complicated, un-guessable
 password and make sure your network is secured with the WPA2-PSK method. <em>Note: Once you password-protect your network you need to enter that password to every device on the network.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't forget those passwords!</p>

            <p>No go. Tried your suggestions. In Windows 10 (at least on this machine) there is no compatibility tab in properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am surprised you mention keyboard and mouse drivers (both are working fine). The accelerometer issue seems to be under

 follow the driver update recommendations without any success. But using the windows key+ X open a new world to me when I realized that by using it was able to&nbsp;access the old style control panel. So, I did check&nbsp;the screen configuration and the check box for
 automatic screen rotation was uncheck. After check it and apply the changes, the screen magically recover that convenient feature of auto rotate. I hope this help.

<h2>            People I call can&#39;t hear me.</h2>
                    <p>I have Skype classic. On Wed, 11/28/17, all was working well. On 11/29 I called a friend the call connected. I could hear him. he couldn't hear me. Call test-I couldn't hear my recorded message. I have had my computer tuned up and recovery run through Geek
 Squad from Best Buy, I have uninstalled and reinstalled Skype classic, uninstalled and reinstalled realtek audio drivers. Nothing works. I can message-send/receive and hear others, but they still can't hear me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up another Skype account for my wife on her computer. I used the headset with microphone I use with my computer to do a call test and it worked. I heard my recorded message. My computer is an HP desktop and is about 4 1/2 yrs old. Everything else is
 working fine except this one aspect of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, at times when I'm on Skype a yellow message bar comes up in the lower left corner which says-no internet connection-it stays up for a couple of seconds and then goes away. I don't experience any internet problems when it comes up. I have no idea what
 to do next. Has anyone else had this problems, or something similar?</p>

<h3> just_another_guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue screen for BugCheck 0x00000133 - Windows 8 64 pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My Windows 8 system was stable for a few months but now has started to crash randomly… The event log is showing a “bugcheck” event with the following details:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was: 0x00000133 (0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000283, 0x0000000000000282, 0x0000000000000000).
 A dump was saved in: C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 020213-8502-01.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>Investigating it a little on the issue, the only information I was able to get was that a component has not responded for a certain time period (for 0x283 ticks) and Windows decided it was better to shutdown the system.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am suspecting either RAID HD, non-RAID HD or Video card since it tends to happen when watching Movies but is there someone able to help me to determine, with confidence, which component is causing the restarts? I have a few of these
 events, and it is starting to drive me crazy…</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have ran Prime 95 in torture mode for 20 hours with no problems (with settings to test CPU+Cache+all RAM chips).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>/David</p>

    <title>Windows occasionally crashes and computer occasionally freezes. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zedlander1000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows occasionally crashes and computer occasionally freezes.</h2>
                    I have no idea where to start with this issue. All I know is that my computer will rarely crash and restart itself and when I go to check the reliability report in the action center, the only information it gives me is that "Windows shut down unexpectedly".
 I don't get a blue screen or anything. I go about using my computer regularly, the computer will freeze, and then the screens will go black. The computer will then proceed to restart as if I pressed the restart button.<br />
<br />
Please help guide me so I can end up providing more information.

            Hi, Zedlander1000
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend you check these methods to repair any Windows problem.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow 
<br />

<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            I recommend reviewing the RAM Memory
<br />
<br />Using these steps requires you to restart your computer, so make sure to save any files you may have open and close any running applications before proceeding. Here goes:
<br />1.- Open Control Panel.
<br />2.- Click on System and Security.
<br />3.- Click on Administrative Tools.
<br />4.- Double-click the Windows Memory Diagnostic shortcut. A quick tip: Alternatively, you can also use the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut, type mdsched.exe, and click OK to launch the tool.
<br />5.- Click the Restart now and check problems option.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check your Hard Disk with chkdsk.
<br />
<br />1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and S key at the same time, then type cmd in the search box. 
<br />2) Right-click Command Prompt, then select Run as administrator. 
<br />3) Type chkdsk /f /r, then press Enter on your keyboard.  
<br />4) Press Y on your keyboard. 
<br />5) Press the Windows logo key and R at the same time, then type mdsched.exe. 
<br />6) Click Restart now and check for problems (recommended). Your PC will restart immediately. 
<br />7) Wait for the scans to finish.

            Memory diagnostic resulted in a message that said there were no issues found. Checkdisk didnt really result in anything so I am unsure of where the current issue stands. I would imagine this issue has not been fixed just yet.<br />

<p>When your computer is messed up, and you don't even know where to begin fixing it, I always recommend showing the computer to a professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From where we're sitting, we don't know anything more about your computer than the information you are able to provide. So if you really have no idea what happened or where to look - which is nothing to be embarrassed about - all you'll get here are generic
 instructions that waste your time without addressing your problem, and then you'll be told to repair or reinstall Windows. Which is exactly what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you can find someone who really knows their sh*t and have that person sit next to you, watch what they do and have them explain what went wrong, how to fix it, and how to prevent the same problem from coming back, now that's money well
 spent.</p>

            Hey, thank you for the response. I very much understand, and I will certainly look for a profession. I do know that reinstalling windows is a waste of time. It is a catch all response and it doesn't really help. Considering I just built this PC at the
 beginning of May and have been having the issue -- granted very rarely -- since I've built it, I highly doubt my windows is royally screwed and needs a reinstall.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the response.<br />

<p>Aha - so you built the computer. That's good to know!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you chose all the parts, is it safe to presume that all your hardware is supported on Windows 10? That eliminates hardware as a possible cause of your problem.</p>

            I didn't say that your parts needed to be compatible. What I said was that they needed to be
<em>supported</em>. That means the manufacturers are writing Windows 10 drivers for those parts.

                    <p>Anybody know how to fix this problem? The option is gone all together from networking. Windows Media Player is also gone. There is no "media feature&nbsp; pack" under control panel. This all mysteriously disappeared after a routine update over night.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found a solution to my problem; I hope this works for other users with the same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In the windows search bar in the taskbar, type "apps..." and open "apps &amp; features"</p>
<p>2. Manage optional features</p>
<p>3. Add a feature...</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the bottom of the list, I found windows media player. Once installed, media streaming returned, and the features pack was populated in the control panel (windows media player).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Hacked process</h2>
                    
<p>This account i am writing from was hacked back in September and i have yet to get the problems with my account fixed. I have been a Live subscriber since Halo 2 came out. The same account all along. Why is this such a difficult process? I am going to need
 special attention because unfortunately the day i found out my account was hacked was the day i went out and bought, and hooked up my new 360 Elite. I tried going through the process of transfering over my previous purchases, etc. However i could do this because
 everything was in portugeuse (was hacked from someone in Brasil). So anyways, i'm 3 months into this process, nothing has been done to help me. I can't play Live anymore and i can't get the all my data from my old 360. I called in last night to find out what
 the deal was. I was told that Xbox had been contacting the wrong email address, so i made a correction. Meanwhile when i got this investigation started i insisted on contacting me on my cell phone. Can someone here please help?</p>

<p>On a side note: I don't understand why you can't give us back our accounts, with all our saved game info, and just erase all our personal info. That way we could go in and re enter all our personal info, billing info, and new password. You need to find out
 a way to proceed with these investigations without effecting the customer so much.

<p>Obviously microsoft doesn't have enough people employed to help with the situation. &nbsp;They would rather have an army of people who are telling us that we were phished and that's why our accounts got hacked. &nbsp;All I know is this is the worst customer service
 I've ever encountered in my life. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Is there a lot of people that are getting hit with this? Here i was thinking that PS3 had it bad because they took down the entire network. Meanwhile the 360 was hacked, you hear nothing about it, and now i'm months without my account. I guess what i thought
 was a huge blunder of PS3 was them actually aggressively nipping the problem in the bud. I guess i don't understand why this is so hard to take care of.

<p>well for one</p>
<p>from what i'm reading your account was migrated</p>
<p>2nd if the link was still up</p>
<p>i'd show you what takes so long</p>
<p>when using the migration tool (was never meant for widespread use)</p>
<p>all your download licenses and billing info is corrupt and not usable as the tool forfeits all download licenses and changes your billing info</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so basically they have to rebuild your account line by line</p>
<p>you can insist on contact by cellphone however usually they don't contact you unless they have questions or the investigations is done</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when it is done you will receive a email with the password reset info</p>
<p>that is the only way to reset your password</p>
<p>as you are given a new windows live id for recovery</p>
<p>suggest you don't use the same one as before&nbsp;<strong>unless</strong> you completely change your password reset options</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you are saying. My account was hacked into and i was unaware. The only sign was that my Xbox Live menus were all in Portugeuse. Had i known there was hacking going on i would have acted immediately. Instead i just thought it was a bug i
 would fix whilst i was migrating my info. So now my account is hacked and my migrated info is sitting in neverneverland. This has been going on for
<strong>over three months.</strong></p>
<p>As far as contacting me by cell phone; i had an extensive conversation with customer service. They asked me my preferred contact method, and that was it. I even had to be specific on the best time to contact me. They stressed that i should answer my phone
 or problems would occur with the UA (they never called). They took an additional email address from me (because they couldn't use my main one associated with the account), and apparently they recorded the email info incorrectly. Who has more than one person
 email address anyways? I'm not sending this nonsense to my work email.</p>
<p>I don't wnat to turn this into a complaint fest. I like Xbox. They are just putting me in a very uncomfortable place and i don't feel like the process is being handled well. I don't usually require special attention. I just don't understand why something
 that should be pretty simple is not. I'm not sure why my account has to be frozen in order for them to track down mischief that happened in August/September.</p>
<p>I need some help from people at Xbox that are involved in these "UA's." The custmer service reps can only talk about so much.</p>

<p>If that's the case it should of never been put online here on Xbox.com</p>

<p>Can someone contact me about my account that has been down since September? I have received no email or phone call.</p>
<p>When this nonsense was happening to PS3 it was all over the news. I haven't seen any articles about this UA problem from IGN, etc. I think it would be a good idea for us effected to get the word out to the major gaming websites. It's christmas, big time
 of year for buying 360's. Meanwhile a lot of people are getting dumped on and the major gaming websites aren't talking about it. Media blackout? I'll send a few emails i guess. I have to imagine they are always looking for new articles.

            <p>Hey there Tug - I certainly can empathize. I looked into this for you, and while I don't have any new information, it does appear you were sent a Gold token to use on another account, correct? Did you receive that token? I know that's not exactly an ideal solution, but while the investigations team continues reviewing your account, you can still play on LIVE. I'm sorry I don't have any more information to offer beyond that. </p>

<p>I was not "sent" anything. Which concerns me because i feel like they still have my email messed up. I was given one over the phone but i'm not really interested in playing games under another account which won't actually transfer to my account. For example
 playing CoD online, building up my stats, and then throwing it all away when i get my account back. I would like a projected end to this debacle. If it is going to go on for another three months i'd rather start a new account.</p>
<p>I started this process back in early September and i have not received any responses from Xbox yet. The only communication has been from me calling them.

<p>no media blackout just plain old phishing which is old news</p>
<p>and if you think phishing is just collecting your login and password lol</p>
<p>phishing includes gathering information about you name address anything that can get an account details typically thru social sites or social engineering</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the media outlets have been reporting this for years</p>
<p>its not hacking its indentity theft</p>

<p>No, this was hacking. It was the Xbox customer service agent that said my account was "hacked."</p>
<p>ngocphi; you don't know what you are talking about and you are passing around info as if you do. I was not phished, and have never been phished, ever. Phishing requires me to be gullible enough to fall for. I take offense to such a notion. So beat it with
 your lol's.</p>
<p>If you are responding like this to other peoples complaints; stop. You obviously are not aware of the multiple (assuming phishing does happen) ways that peoples accounts are being comprimised.

            Hmm, fullscreen elements would be on top of the taskbar prior to the update, but currently, the taskbar is appearing on top of full-screen stuff (even games). I'd like for the taskbar to not be hidden but that it'd remain behind full-screen windowed games

<p><del>I am seeing the exact same thing on twp of my machines running Windows 10 Pro 1607. As an example, imagine that you have a browser window open (such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome). When you press F11, the browser enters Full Screen mode, and should
 hide all other elements behind it (including the Task Bar).</del></p>
<p>In turn, I now have resolved this on both machines, and yet, I do not fully know the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one machine, it was resolved by setting the Hangouts application in Chrome to not be "Always on Top".</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another machine, it was resolved by simply unpinning one of the applications from the taskbar. Pinning it to the taskbar again had no adverse effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If either of the above is applicable to yourself, can you try them and see if it works?</p>

            <p>Hello Midnight, I tried unpinning applications from taskbar. Didn't seem to solve the problem for me unfortunately ):&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to Chrome, I do not have Hangouts (unless it's already installed by default?) so I can't try that solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />

            <p>Hello everyone, contacted Microsoft Live support and the issue was resolved. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Funnily enough, we didn't do anything to resolve the issue, all I did was download Microsoft's remote access app and suddenly the problem didn't occur any more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Problem came back after rebooting the PC...</p>

            <p>The taskbar option "Always on top" and the ability to disable it, that was in windows versions through windows vista,&nbsp; was removed from windows in 7, 8, 8.1 and still has not been restored with windows 10.&nbsp; I personally have made more than request to have
 this functionality restored.&nbsp; I have an issue with the 'auto-hide'.&nbsp; When trying to select text in a document near the bottom of the screen, i have to fight with the taskbar always popping up, if I have the document in full screen mode.&nbsp; It makes it very difficult
 when doing graphic design work, or app development and wish that this option could be restored.</p>

<p>Hope whatever caused this is fixed soon though, I'd like to have hangouts on top, but not so on top that the taskbar goes over fullscreen games and programs.</p>

            <p>Hey Stormified,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Midnight's suggestion wasn't my solution but gave me good insight, I run a program called Siimple for my WiiMote, the application is set to always be on top and runs a windowed application, there's a good chance you have a background application or something
 running in your taskbar which has the "Always on top" option set causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Midnight for the guidance, didn't think a AOT command from another application could ever effect my Windows, then I remembered that I'm stupid enough to be using (beta'ing) Windows 10!</p>

            The latest driver for this photo printer was issued in June 2009 for Windows 7, and no new drivers are available, the only thing you could try is to install the drivers in Compatibility mode and with Admin priviledges, it may work.

                    <p>I have Windows 7 and recently used system restore.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several unwelcome issues came up after using&nbsp;system restore (which I had to use twice) &nbsp;which I have resolved or worked around, but there are still a few issues..&nbsp; One issue which I still have is that
 there is no sound when I receive email.&nbsp; My speakers are working fine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to the Control Panel, Hardware and Sound, Sound, Change system sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Sound Scheme section, the drop down has only one scheme:&nbsp; modified.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In the Program Events section, the only event listed is Explorer, with sub-events being fax error, fax sent, incoming call.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In searching for a solution, I found the instructions for using the System File Checker.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used it and no issues or problems were found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously something happened to the Sound Scheme and Program Events sections.&nbsp; I hope that someone can suggest a solution to my problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your message.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Concerning the reply regarding&nbsp;"Missing PDFMaker files" error, I attempted to view the Adobe video referenced in the link, received a message that I needed the latest version of Flash Player (which I thought I had), downloaded the latest version, installed
 it, and went back to try to view the video.&nbsp; I received the same notice about needing the latest version of Flash Player.</p>
<p>Adobe's instructions on finding the disabled items in Word are not correct for&nbsp;Word. 2010&nbsp; I finally found how to get to the disabled items section.&nbsp; After opening Word, go to File, then Options, then Add-Ins, go to the bottom of the screen to "Manage",
 choose "Disabled items" from the drop-down menu, and click "Go".&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having found how to get there, I discovered that the Adobe PDF Maker was not disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concerning the suggestion to do a repair or in-place install:&nbsp; The repair option does not seem appropriate since I would not be upgrading to Windows 7.&nbsp; I already have Windows 7.</p>
<p>It appears that I will have to reinstall Windows 7.&nbsp; </p>
