<h2>            Bluetooth Device Added, but &#34;Error Connecting to Headset&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have installed my Jam Transit Audio bluetooth headphones to my computer, but they cannot seem to connect. Whenever I click Control when I right click the device, or when I see the playback devices, they both label the device as "disconnected." No matter
 what I try (such as restarting my computer, uninstalling the device and reinstalling it, adding more drivers, etc.), the device fails to connect to my computer. Note that the bluetooth headphones can connect to my phone.</p>

</p><p>I have a HP Invent computer with Windows 7 Professional x64 operating system. Is there any way I can resolve this problem?</p>

<li>The model of my Bluetooth Headphones is HX-EP310</li><li>The only error message I get is "Error connecting to headset" (as in the screenshot in my previous post). There is no option to see further details.</li><li>Before this particular problem, I updated multiple drivers (as my headset had difficulty being added to the computer properly). These drivers were connected with the Device Functions of the headset (such as Audiosink, Headset, etc.).<br />
</li></ol>
<p>I tried both of the solutions before I made my post, and I still have these settings on my computer. However, the problem remains.</p>

</p><p>I suggest you to follow the steps below and see if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remove the Bluetooth drivers and reinstall them</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This issue could have occurred due to the incorrect drivers installed for the Bluetooth device. Follow the steps below to remove the device:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></li><li>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Ok.</strong></li><li>Right click on the <strong>Bluetooth device </strong>and select<strong> uninstall</strong></li><li>Restart the computer</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to download the Bluetooth drivers available from the manufacturerâ€™s website and reinstall them and see if it helps.</p>

<p>Do get back to us with the required information and we will be glad to assist you.</p>

</p>
<p>Upon going to the Device Manager, that category was not available, as seen in this screenshot:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59a7525e-114f-4543-8098-71369fc531fc" />I tried to uninstall the drivers for the headset (without deleting the driver software for the device) through the device's
 properties (and then moving to the Hardware tab, seeing the properties for a specific driver, and uninstalling it). I then restarted my computer, and the drivers automatically downloaded again. As with before, when I tried to reconnect my headset to my computer,
 the device failed to connect.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also tried your other suggestion of going to the manufacturer's website and downloading any drivers. I assume you mean the manufacturers of my headset. If so, there were not any drivers I could find on the site. (<a href="http://www.jamaudio.com/products/headphones/jam-transit-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This</a>
 is the website.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the issue.</p>

<p>I suggest you to remove the Bluetooth driver by removing the drivers from the Bluetooth drivers section of device manager.</p>

<p>By manufacturerâ€™s website I mean the manufacturer of the computer you are using. I suggest you to download the latest Bluetooth drivers available for your computer and then install it and check if the issue persists.</p>

 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for updating my Bluetooth driver, apparently, I have a later version of the Bluetooth drivers than what the official website offers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After following your advice, the headset still fails to connect.</p>

            <p>HI,</p>
<p>no particular picture. I think, this is 'particular' folder. I've noticed that in some folders it works and in some doesn't. I think, that since photo viewer lists all the files in a dir (to provide back and forth navigation), it may fail on some 'bad' file.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Since the issue is occurring with specific folder the files might be corrupted or there might be issue with file permission. First try coping the pictures files to another folder and check if you face similar issue. Also check if you have full permission
 to the folder if not try taking the ownership of the file and check:</span></p>

<p>I'm more interested in knowing what weapons are in the game tbh. Is there a post listing all of them? I hardly ever use the M1 in BC2, it's basically the M14 w/ a WWII skin and the recoil takes a while to get used to. I'm hoping they get rid of the XM series
 of guns, which to my knowledge were invented for the game. But yeah the veteran gun needs to be a utility weapon that every class could use efficiently, like the M1...</p>

            You are right.&nbsp; It allows you to enable access to let a friend or technician remotely access your computer and see your screen, with options to pass control of the mouse and keyboard to them also.&nbsp; You can either enable it, if this is something you might
 use, or leave it disabled until you need it.&nbsp; Since invitations you might send for this purpose (often in the form of a file you could email) are time-limited and need a password, it should be safe to have this on, but it is not necessary to leave on.

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check your SSD or Hard Disk HDD with chkdsk.
<br />1.- First, close all the programs and files that you have open.
<br />2.- Click with the right mouse button in the Windows Start menu and select Control Panel. Then choose the category System and security. On the next screen, look down Administrative Tools on the right and click on that option.
<br />3.- One of those tools is the Windows Memory Diagnostic. Double click on it to open it.
<br />4.- The diagnosis gives two options to choose from. See what each one does and click on the one  you prefer:
<br />
<br />     Restart now and check if there are problems. It is best to select in most cases. Make sure to close all programs as I have asked before. The PC will reboot on its own when choosing this option. Right after, the check also starts automatically.
<br />Then check the Hard Disk.
<br />1. Open an elevated Command Prompt (Press the Windows + X button at the same time, then choose Command Prompt (Admin))
<br />2. Type the following command, and replace the X with the drive letter you wish to scan: â€œCHKDSK X:
<br />3. Hit the enter key, Command Prompt will now start CHKDSK.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Thanks Philip for your prompt answer.<br />
But, bear in mind, that this is a clean install on a new hard disk. I haven't installed anything yet, so I can't&nbsp; perform 'chkdsk'.&nbsp;

            Ok I understand then you should create a USB to check the Ram Memory.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.memtest86.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.memtest86.com/</a>
<br />
<br />If after reviewing the Ram Memory, and you do not have any errors, you should re-create the Windows USB.

            All BIOS have the option to boot with a USB, you should try, your DVD may be damaged. I'll leave a link so you can create a USB to install Windows.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I used your link and made a bootable USB. So far so good. Set all the BIOS to 'removable dev' and now I am getting the&nbsp;notification:&nbsp;NTLDR is missing.&nbsp; This can mean a lot of things, but I can't repair it because it still is a clean install of Windows through
 the USB&nbsp;stick. Do you have a sollution? I am afraid it's getting from bad to worse.<br />

            It's quite strange, are you sure you followed all the steps to make the new installation? remember that it is a New Hard Disk and you have to format it before installing the operating system.

<br />Check these links, I hope it helps.

    <title>Microsoft Store Nightmare - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Store Nightmare</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center">In hopes that someone who is above 'grunt' status might see this and offer useful assistance, I am detailing my nightmarish ordeal with Microsoft customer service/support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently called the Microsoft store to inquire as to what type of windows 8 pro operating system install disk is required for a clean install onto a brand new system that has never had any prior version of windows installed. The gentleman was very nice,
 (albeit slightly hard to understand due to a thick accent of unknown origin) and informed me that the "Windows 8 Pro System-Builder Edition" was what I needed to complete such a clean install and that this particular version of Windows 8 pro could be purchased
 through the "Call Center Only". He told me that once I received my CD hard copy I would need to use Windows Update to upgrade to Windows 8.1 at no additional charge. I made it clear that this was ideal for my needs so the representative of Microsoft immediately
 guided me through several very easy steps and my $200.00 purchase was complete in no time at all. We then parted pleasantly as the call came to an end.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Perfect, right?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Uh...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">No.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After reviewing my order confirmation which had been sent to my email I discovered that, contrary to my request, I had been sent a
<strong>THIRTY-TWO BIT version</strong> of Windows 8 Pro System-Builder. In terms of computer years (as with dog years) such software is straight out of the 1920's. Why would anyone who clearly stated they were building a brand new system ever, ever ever, need
 a thirty-two bit version of windows 8? The entire concept is ludicrous. (Later it was revealed to me that the Microsoft Store was/is, in fact, out of stock of the Windows 8 Pro System-Builder Sixty-four Bit edition... Imagine that... but that's a story for
 later in this post)<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Okay, so no big deal. I'll just call back and have a kind Microsoft representative switch a little number (32) to a little number (64) and all will be right again in the universe.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Right?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Uh...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">No<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Apparently, once an order has been placed with the Microsoft Store it is immediately whisked away to a nearby galaxy where it becomes inaccessible to any employee of Microsoft (and possibly even to Superman and the Green Lantern). I realize my sarcasm is
 escalating steadily here, but I assure all you good readers (and hopefully someone above "grunt status at Microsoft) that I am merely attempting to illustrate absurdity by being absurd.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I immediately called the Microsoft Store back (within 20 minutes of completing my original order which had been thoroughly botched) where I was told in no uncertain terms that absolutely nothing could be done to amend my order because it was "already being
 processed" I asked why something so simple as a slight alteration from (32) to (64) was so far out of the capabilities of the Microsoft Store. I received the same answer, over and over, and was treated as if I were out of my mind to even imagine that stores
 actually revise orders and rectify mistakes that were clearly no fault but their own. It happens all the time, at many-a-store, Microsoft.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Having gotten no where with this representative of Microsoft, I asked to speak with a supervisor and after a short wait I was connected to another person who claimed to be a supervisor. This person and I went around in circles for nearly an hour before I
 was so brow-beaten that, in the end, I actually thanked him for doing nothing to rectify the fact that Microsoft was thoroughly bending me over for the ol' heave ho, although I did inquire if, after such treatment, they, at Microsoft, might provide me with
 a tube of Preparation-H to ease the pain (sarcasm again, I know). Before that sticky end, though, I was treated with near-contempt by this so-called supervisor until I informed him that, for quality purposes, I may be recording the conversation. His tune changed
 fast at that point but he still offered me zero solutions to, what I imagined to be, my very easily-rectified problem. Near the end of the conversation I imparted to this "supervisor" that I was aware that it was not he who wronged me and I apologised if it
 seemed as if I had been taking it out on him but that he was all I had. He finally offered what seemed at the time to be a useful suggestion. I was to call the next day during normal business hours when someone truly in charge would be present to try to cut
 through this red tape that should not exist and get my order revised. He even went so far as to offer the name of this district supervisor (or whatever) I should ask for...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Wishful thinking, I know.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I ended the call with high hopes that all would be well in the morning, as I had been told that the order would not even go through until at least 1:00 pm Eastern time and if I called early enough maybe this person (who shall remain unnamed here), with his
 infinite Microsoft powers, would be able to make the world sane again and amend my order.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This morning I called again. Let me add that all response times were very good and I spent little time on hold. I was connected to a Microsoft representative who, in my haste to impart my situation, I missed his name. This was unfortunate because he treated
 me like something extremely foul that he had just scraped off his shoe. <strong>
Utter contempt</strong> is all I can possibly describe his behavior toward me as, and that still does not do it justice. He was rude, crass, belligerent, nasty and spent most of the call trying to overpower me with his voice (just short of yelling at me). I
 was judged by this Lord of the Microsoft Peons to have called the incorrect number even though I had clearly called what is clearly labeled to be "<span>Microsoft Store Sales and Customer Support" on the Microsoft Sore Contact Web Page (apparently "one ring"
 does not rule them all). Allow me to backtrack slightly. As I began the call with this... person... I briefly explained to him that I was directed by the supervisor from the previous night to call this morning and ask for the manager of the entire store/floor/district/insert-designation-here.
 I dropped the name I had been given and asked if he would like me to tell him the reference numbers that I have been given so far. "No, I don't need no numbers" he said twice over the top of me. I almost began to believe that I had somehow gotten some wrong
 number and was being badgered deliberately. This could not have been the case, though, because when he finally did talk over me one last time he cut me off (on hold) with a "I'll transfer you to where you should have called in the first place". Several times
 during the call, as I began to realise the level of contempt I, the customer, was being treated with, I asked him to repeat his name. The first time he refused with a flat out "No" after that I asked him several more times and he answered each time with "I
 told you my name at the start of the call". "I realize that"</span> I stated, "but could you please repeat your name for my records?" again he repeated himself. It was futile so I stopped trying after several attempts, I couldn't have tried more if I wanted
 to though, because he cut me off and transferred me. He flat out refused to allow me to talk to any supervisor, he also claimed that the name I had been given did not exist and that there was no such person (that's fine, I can accept that there may be several
 locations for customer support and/or that I may have just been placated the previous night). The point of this entire paragraph is not about the original transgression by Microsoft of screwing up my order, but about the gross ineptitude of this particular
 employee's ability to treat a customer as a valued customer, and how poorly that has reflected on Microsoft as a whole. I should add that I was in high spirits at the start of this call because I truly hoped that all would turn out well. These hopes were dashed
 and my view of Microsoft has been forever sullied by this one poorly-chosen employee. I cannot impart how disappointed this has made me in Microsoft as a whole. If there were another viable option out there (and don't say 'crapple' or Linux because they don't
 compare, in my opinion) I would never use anything from Microsoft ever again.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Unfortunately, I am as stuck with Microsoft as I am stuck with the incorrect software they have condemned me to.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Sigh....<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After my beating by "He-who-must-not-be-named" and my subsequent cutoff/hangup/forced-transfer I was connected to another Microsoft representative who again informed me that.. of course... "...there was absolutely nothing he could do" As a consolation prize
 I was offered free overnight shipping when the sixty-four bit version is once again in stock and available. I had forgotten to mention in the previous paragraph that "He-who-must-not-be-named" had most-belligerently informed me that "We don't even have any
 copies of sixty-four bit!". I asked this current representative of Microsoft and he confirmed this to be true. I cannot help but surmise that this is why I was sold a thirty-two bit version without my consent, although all my instincts tell me that this is
 true I can't make such a claim with any certainty or proof.... but if it sounds like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck. This new representative of Microsoft gave me a third case number/reference number and instructed me to provide it
 at the time when I placed my new order. I later discovered that this individual had not even linked this new number with my order number or my other case numbers. More ineptitude on the part of Microsoft employees. The Representative of Microsoft also assured
 me that, the moment he was able to gain access, he would cancel my current order and refund my money. He could not, however, say with any certainty how long my funds would be tied up in this now-utter-disaster before being returned to me.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Imagine....<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">All of this could have been avoided with a simple ability to edit two tiny numbers in an order.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Sigh...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I would even have been willing to accept that I would have to endure waiting for a back-order until Win8Pro64SysBuilder came into stock.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In an act of utter desperation, I tried just ONE more time to call and possibly get someone who might find some way to help me. I was connected to a very polite, respectful and understanding (albeit helpless in the face of the evil Microsoft order-processing
 monster to halt the great machine and change one tiny number from [32] to [64]) Microsoft representative who answered every one of my questions succinctly and thoroughly. He took the time to explain to me exactly what actions he would be taking to resolve
 my issue. He also took the time to link all my previous inquiries via case numbers to my original case number. He kindly informed me that there was no other recourse than to go through the "return process", refund my money and begin again from there, at which
 time I could re-order the (64) bit version. He went above and beyond, offering to contact me by phone and email the moment any progress is made on the return process as well as the moment any (64) bit version becomes available. I appreciated everything he
 did for me and, given the chance, would like to pass on his name to those who can give him the recognition he deserves.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With that said, though, I still am thoroughly unsatisfied with even this very good Microsoft representative's total inability --through no fault of his own but by design-- to simply amend my order so that I can receive what I paid for. I feel like, after
 grabbing up my hard-earned cash, I have been imprisoned by Microsoft in a situation not of my own making and my funds confiscated for up to fifteen, that's FIFTEEN, business days.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Why?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Long heavy sigh...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To what end have I spent these last many minutes writing this entire post for all to see?
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At best, to hopefully find SOME one who might be able to cut through all this garbage and provide me with what I paid for: A fair product for a fair price delivered in a timely manner with a smile and a "thank you, sir".
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Microsoft, is that too much to ask?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At worst, to pass on this vital information to those who would think to buy from Microsoft in the future, that they may be better informed and choose some other alternative to avoid the horrors I've been subjected to, simply for wanting to spend my hard-earned
 money on a Microsoft product and receive what I paid for. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft, I direct your attention to Blackberry, Kmart, America Online, MySpace (I actually had to think for 2 minutes to even remember the name MySpace) and the wagon wheel. All of which either no longer exist, or are no longer the corporate giants they
 once were because they either could not adapt, were no longer viable, or simply lost... one.... small... customer... at... a... time... until they woke up one day and had none at all.<br />
</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, Microsoft would instead choose to have me awaken from this nightmare they have wrought upon me in the emerald city of fulfillment and customer satisfaction, please provide me with a link or some other way, in reply to this post, that
 I might contact someone who can actually fix all this in a timely and pleasant fashion. ....and I shall sing your praises from every mountaintop.<br />

            I found this thread while googling and this is my exact experience right now trying to cancel an order. Apparently 2 years later, Microsoft still has not cared enough to improve anything! Sigh.

<p>Hi there DPE Keese</p>
<p>
</p><p>A capture card should resolve that issue, It normally captures all in game chat as well as party chat, I think that is the only way to help you round that issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Update ( KB915597 ) refers to Windows Defender Definition Update.</p>
<p>After you had installed Windows 7 you probably installed a different Anti Virus Product such as AVG or Avast or other.</p>
<p>These AV products when installed turn off / disable Windows Defender which is normal so not to conflict with each other.</p>
<p>Therefore you may be seeing this Windows defender Definition Update as usually when you install Windows 7 it will Update Automatically after a period of time.</p>
<p>In between this time period you may have installed a different AV product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the case you could left click this ( KB915597 ) Win Defender Update and hide it.</p>

<p>When I run my connection check, it says I'm connected, but when I go home, it says "connect to Xbox LIVE." Netflix works fine, so I know I'm connected. I just bought Titanfall, and it won't let me connect to anything in-game.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Regarding this specific issue, did you try the following fix?</p>
<p>[quote user="Nightly Suicide"]</p>
<p>I have noticed this issue has been coming up a lot. This issue has happen to me too. Me and Daniel from Xbox Support (thanks btw) featured it out.</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>Pins are blank and the Store tab is Gone completely. Saying Having trouble connecting. There could be a problem with our servers.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Clear cache and clear Alternate MAC Address (Personally I think just clearing Alternate MAC Address would fix it, but it can't hurt to do both)</p>
<p><strong>How to clear cache</strong></p>
<p>Settings, Disc &amp; Blu-Ray, Persistent Storage, Clear persistent storage</p>

<p>I simply unplugged the power block and gave it a hard shutdown completely. It actually fixed everything, surprisingly.</p>
<p>I also understand Titanfall had some early issues, but they're now ironed out. Hope y'all are enjoying the game. Cheers.</p>

<h2>            NMS glitch </h2>
                    <p>Wasnâ€™t exactly sure where to report this issue. I thought that here would be appropriate. So I recently have been playing No Mans Sky, and I have ran into a glitch where my game crashes when I take off in my starship. It happens every time I try to load my save. If a staff member or other player has a solution or a place that I can post this where Iâ€™ll get a solution, please comment. Thanks :)</p>

<p>Aha! That's exactly what is <em>supposed</em> to happen. I'll explain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a computer is powered off it is, for all intents and purposes, off. However, there is a tiny amount of power remaining in the motherboard - it's called flea power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The flea power is needed by network administrators to wake a sleeping computer or to boot a powered off computer in order to perform maintenance on the computers in the network. Basically, the network administrator sends a special 'signal' through the network
 which instructs the motherboard to power up a sleeping or powered off computer. The 'flea power' is just enough for the motherboard to respond to the network administrator's signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer manufacturers obviously have no idea where their computers are going to end up, so this feature is enabled by default.&nbsp;If your computer is not part of a network, it doesn't need to have the feature. But there's no harm to leaving it enabled - nobody
 can use it to break into your computer - and the technicalities of disabling it are such that if you get it wrong you could do serious damage to your computer, even make it unbootable. So it's best to just leave it be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what about that light? It's a small LED on the motherboard and its purpose is to warn you to pull the power plug out of the wall socket before you open the case if you want to do work inside your computer. Otherwise you can get quite a shock.</p>

<p>Seems like I haven't explained this enough.</p>
<p>I have a gaming computer, it has lights on the front of the computer.</p>
<p>If I shutdown the computer, the monitor will turn off and the keyboard and mouse will turn off.</p>
<p>But the fan, and lights are still on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't happen all the time, and is quite rare.</p>
<p>This has also happened to me yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have to unplug the desktop and plug it back in for later use.</p>
<p>It will recover, and everything will work fine.</p>
<p>But it will not shutdown fully.</p>
<p>This also happens if I sleep the system. (but not always)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've heard it is because of the Intel(R) Management Engine driver, you either have to update the driver or roll down the driver, but I'm not sure if that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just in case, the&nbsp;Intel(R) Management Engine driver version is 11.0.0.1160.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This did help a little bit, thanks.</p>

            Think I'd download the the <a href="http://aka.ms/DownloadW10ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
windows 10 iso</a> for use on another computer and use Rufus program to put it onto usb thumb drive and boot off it and choose custom install. &nbsp; If it asks for a key try skipping that. &nbsp; &nbsp; If you're lucky it will have had windows 10 previously installed and
 it will activate once online, provided you have installed the same home, or pro, or whatever was on it at one time. &nbsp;&nbsp; If you cant get past the key page, you'll need to buy windows 10 .

<p>I've used the MCT to create install media on flash drives numerous times without issue.&nbsp; That's the way to start the process, then if there are issues you can go the Rufus route.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the files are located--optical disc or flash drive--has no effect on
 using DISM and other tools. <br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Camera Windows Hello Driver</h2>
                    <p>After a recent Windows Update, and with no other new software or changes, Windows Hello stopped working. I get a 'can't start the windows camera please use PIN' message when I start up, Sign-in options says "Windows Hello isn't available on this device."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issue I can find is that in Device Manager, System Devices, Surface Camera Windows Hello Properties - the Device status is "No drivers are installed for this device." but the Driver tab shows that 1.0.75.1 is installed. I have tried rolling back,
 changing to an older driver but nothing works. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I have the exact same problem.&nbsp; Everything is identical.&nbsp; I've tried rolling back drivers.&nbsp; Uninstalling the IR Camera and Windows hello drivers.&nbsp; The front camera by itself works find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also see a message that 'Windows Hello isn't available on this device'.</p>

            The only way that I finally got the camera working was to reinstall the operating system. I still had problems with Hello but made the group policy edits to enable biometrics and at several points have had to delete the Ngc folder but Hello is mostly working
 now. It still randomly tells me that I need to set a PIN before using Hello even though there is a PIN. My opinion is that I have to treat it like a Beta, it will sometimes give unusual results.

<p>Hello RegPSN,</p>
<p>No there is no specific folder for them.&nbsp; They are just within the system32 folder itself.&nbsp; You can try searching by that extension and from there checking out the names versus the screen savers you have installed.&nbsp; You might be able to use the process of
 elimination to remove the file.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Have you checked the Remove Programs list to make sure that the Screen Saver isnt listed?&nbsp; Did you use that to remove the progam?&nbsp; Did it come with its own uninstaller?&nbsp; If it is still in the list, that means that the .scr program is still listed in the
 C:\Windows\system32 folder where the screen savers are stored.&nbsp; If you know the exact name of the one your trying to remove you can find it in that folder and delete it manually.</p>
<p>*Note* Any modification or removal of file(s) in this folder can be detrimental to your system.&nbsp; Do not modify or remove any files you are not 100% sure about.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your device before encountering this issue?</li><li>Are you trying to play the game online or offline?</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, we recommend running the Windows apps troubleshooter provided on this

<p>
</p><p>Another solution you may perform is to check if there are updates available for the game. Refer to

<p>Miraculously, without any action on my part other than to start the app, both MS Jigsaw and MS Mahjong worked perfectly on my PC this afternoon.&nbsp; I have been checking MS Jigsaw everyday since the initial failure and everyday received the 0x803F8001 error
 message.&nbsp; Today MS Jigsaw worked so, having unloaded MS Mahjong, I went to the "Store" and downloaded and re-installed MS Mahjong.&nbsp; MS Mahjong also worked just fine after installation.&nbsp; In both cases the games continued to track and show my statistics as if
 nothing had every happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, since the problem has resolved itself, I am once again a happy casual gamer.&nbsp; Thanks for all the responses.&nbsp; Case closed!</p>

<h2>            Driver Conflict between Synaptics Touchpad and Microsoft wireless mouse</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install the driver for my Synaptics Touchpad (on an HP Pavilion dv6 running Windows 7). &nbsp;I use a Microsoft wireless mouse. &nbsp;I have installed the Synaptics driver (obtained from recovery of original drivers on machine), rebooted and tried to
 access settings through the Control Panel Mouse. &nbsp;When I first click on the Mouse there, I get an error message telling me there is a conflict between the other PS2 mouse device (i.e. my Microsoft Mouse) and the Touchpad driver. &nbsp;It tells me to uninstall Touchpad
 driver, then uninstall MS mouse driver, then reinstall Touchpad driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if I uninstall the mouse driver and reboot I have no pointing device (because Touchpad driver has not been reinstalled), and consequently can't navigate menus to reinstall touchpad driver so I'm stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with how to navigate this? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good day Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenge you're experiencing with the device driver might be due to driver incompatibility. If you have uninstalled the driver for the Microsoft wireless mouse, try to unplug the device from your laptop, restart your laptop,
 and then plug in the device again. This kind of devices are usually plug and play and it should automatically reinstall the driver once the system is restarted.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Not able to open a &#34;snip&#34; sent to self in Windows 10.  Using Windows Live Mail 2012 as email app</h2>
                    <p>Have used the "snipping tool" in Windows 7 for years.&nbsp; Worked perfectly.&nbsp; Built a new computer and loaded an OEM Windows 10.&nbsp; Had a few issues but most have been resolved.&nbsp; One issue remaining is using the "snipping tool" in&nbsp;Windows 10.&nbsp; After creating a
 "snip" you go to "File" up on top left of screen and select "Send To".&nbsp; Then select "Email Recipient (as attachment)".&nbsp; My Windows Live Mail comes up and I select addressees.&nbsp; One to my home email address (this computer) and one to my email address on my Ipad.&nbsp;
 The message goes through and comes in on incoming mail on both machines.&nbsp; The emails will open, however the "snip is not presented as an attachment that can be clicked on to open or save but is shown as part of the email message.&nbsp; The "snip" is an image about
 2 inches square&nbsp; (the original snip was much larger)&nbsp; It looks as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The View Album is the small image of the "snip".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" />
<td colspan="3">
<div style="margin-left: 10px">
<div><span style="color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 1)">Enter album name here</span></div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>VIEW SLIDE SHOW</td>
<td>DOWNLOAD ALL</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div style="color: rgba(110, 110, 110, 1)">This album has 1 photo and will be available on OneDrive until 9/19/2016.</div>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td />
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
As you see the snip is not an attachment to the email.&nbsp; When&nbsp;the image is clicked on, a window opens on screen and it says:
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You'll need a new app to open mid</p>
<p>Look for app in store</p>
<p>Always use this app.........then a grayed OK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have this problem and know of a solution?</p>

<p>The 'photo email' feature you've been using no longer works. The email may be sent, but the picture seems not to be uploaded to OneDrive, so the recipient will at best only have the thumbnail image in the message itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll either have to save the snips as PNG files and then send the pictures as attachments in the traditional way, in which case they will be at full size, or embed them in the message body where you can resize them and apply other&nbsp;effects. You'll find
 instructions - and a solution for cases where you want to send a lot of pictures - in this article:
