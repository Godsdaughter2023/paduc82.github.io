<h2>            Email Attachments sent in Microsoft Group do not show up in the documents folder in sharepoint</h2>
                    I recently created a new Group in outlook and added members from our organization and guests. How do I set it up so the attachments from emails to the group get saved in the document folder in SharePoint? I've tested a few emails with attachments and the
 folder named 'email attachment' on sharepoint is empty. if I go to the online outlook group, the attachments are shown there and I can click on 'save to group library' and then it shows up in SharePoint. How do I make&nbsp;this automated?&nbsp;Hope that makes sense!
 Please advise&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi CURIOUSJAZ,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting here.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It's a expect behavior to save the attachment in the SharePoint but not in the folder which stayed in the SharePoint. And when you save the attachment
 on the OWA via clicking<strong> Save to group library </strong>button, a folder named
<strong>Email attachment</strong> created automatically in the SharePoint&nbsp; to store the attachment. Also, attachment cannot be stored in the folder created with the same folder name manually. So, we recommend you using the OWA to save the attachment.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, it's not feasible to make it automatically. Given this situation, we suggest you submit your feedback to our related team via the link below:</span></p>

<h2>            How to stop a Hacker hijacking my hotmail accounts and identity</h2>
                    I had a Hotmail account for 20 years without trouble. A month ago a hacker hijacked my account and started sending out spam spoofing my ID. Community suggested I get a new account which I did but with 2 Step Verification to my smart phone. Fine for 3 weeks
 but now once again the Hacker has hijacked the new account. I have appealed for help to MS but they say it is impossible. Can someone on the community advise me because I am very worried that the hacker can now get into my MS Windows10 world and to my data.
 Help! This is a serious issue which threatens the integrity of all MS users. The Hacker has even hijacked an earlier Community account so I have had to create a new one just to address this question!!!!!

<h2>            How can you recover a hacked skype account with account recovery when you only used paypal</h2>
                    <p>I was hacked by a person using a russian email address. They logged in and changed the email address and the password and deleted my email. I have been denied 5 times by the account recovery system. It is not compatible with old skype accounts. I have all
 the required information for several screens. I am positive all my information is correct. When I get to the payment questions, account recovery wants credit card info for payment. I only used paypal. I connected the paypal account to my skype. I was a loyal
 skype customer. After I can't provide credit card info, the form ends. It does not ask additional questions. I am stuck.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the same email connected to my account for 11 years. How is it that a person can log in from a country i have never been to, change the email address without any confirmation or security check and steal the account, but Microsoft can recover the
 account to the original owner with the original email and information.&nbsp;<br />

</p><p>For additional information, here are some tips that might help improve your chances of successfully using the Account Recovery form to regain access to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer you previously used to access the account.
</li><li>Also it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.</li><li>Even if your original information has changed, be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally.</li><li>You don't need to fill out the whole form; just the fields that you know apply to your account. Note: While most responses will come within a few minutes, it can take up to 24 hours for a response to be received.</li></ul>

<p>It appears you have 2 separate problems.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>First is the invalid product key message.</p>
<p>Second is the constant configuration. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2010 is not managed through the MyAccount website so you have very limited (essentially none) options to validate your product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, both of your errors can be different symptoms of the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The configuration message happens when the registry is not setup for your specific version of Office. This can happen in 2 ways.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first is that you have multiple copies of Office installed.&nbsp; For example, most ne computers come with a "free trial" of Office 365 installed. Even if you don't use it, it is there.&nbsp; Then you installed your copy of Office 2010.&nbsp; Now, when ever you launch
 applications in the different versions, ie 2010 or 2016, during the application startup it checks to see if the registry is setup for it's version (ie 2010 for Outlook(?)) If it is not, then the configuration is triggered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other situation where the configuration message shows up is if Windows gets a little "stupid" and does not save the configuration information during Windows shutdown, so next time you restart, it is forced to "configure" again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets look at the first situation, because it can also cause the invalid product key message. When you have 2 versions that have not been activated installed, if you try to activate the second one, ie 2010 in your case, the system submits your product key
 to the not activated version with the earliest install date, ie 365.&nbsp; That automatically causes the invalid key message because a 2010 key will NEVER work for 2016/365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution for this problem is to uninstall one of the versions, in this case taht would be the factory trial of 365.&nbsp; Go to Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features.&nbsp; Scroll through the list of installed programs looking for more than one Office installation.&nbsp;
 If you find more than one, uninstall the other(s) AND then do an Office Repair of the remaining one, Office 2010 in your case.&nbsp; With a little luck it will already be activated, otherwise you will have to activate it one more time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had only one version of Office installed and are getting the configuration message it could be a situation where Windows is not giving itself the required "Access Rights" during the configuration process. That means when you close and Windows tries
 to save your configuration it fails, so next time you start Windows, you do NOT have the appropriate configuration in the registry, triggering the message again (and again, and again ....).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case on possible fix is to, restart windows, then start any Office application using "Run As Admin". Let the configuration finish. Close the application. Close Windows normally. Start Windows normally and start the Office application normally to
 confirm that the problem has been fixed.</p>

<p>This kb article, 2968890, was the start of the fix. Follow its instructions and get the file sent to you, the file they send will put msoffice into the state it needs not only to fix office but allow install of visio pro.</p>
<p>1. Removing office or clean installs of windows or office do not work.</p>
<p>2. It appears the problem is related to the update state of office itself and dependant upon when it was installed.</p>
<p>3. After deinstalling office, office then loses its activation status and repair wont work, neither will repair options. You may find yourself in this position after following the visio install error and the suggestions on how to install
 it.</p>

 install of visio pro.</p>
<p>5. you will need to associate visio with your ackgroun account and the ackgro way was to add a product in myoffice account, then itll ask for the visio pro key, once this is added it will allow visio 2013 pro to be downloaded.</p>
<p>6. Run visio pro and the activation will proceed normally.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Several people have made the point that it took more than one computer boots for this fix to take effect</p>
<p>I dare say even the standalone file from software4students or wherever you got your purchased version servers would then work and allow attachment to the myoffice account.</p>
<p><span>************* </span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>Here is anew piece of advice that may do the trick</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>I had the same problem and none of the fixes I tried worked.&nbsp; I ended up installing the product key manually using the OSPP.VBS script before running setup.&nbsp; This script should be installed as part of Office.</p>
<p>On 64BIT</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Do a Run as Administrator on Command Prompt</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Run the command cscript “C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15\OSPP.VBS” /inpkey:YourProductKey</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>3.&nbsp; Run Visio setup Good Luck &lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><span>************* </span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I was having this same issue and finally managed to get around it by doing the following:
</span></p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Navigate to&nbsp;C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If there is a folder called <strong>OFFICE15 </strong>or <strong>OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform</strong>&nbsp;rename that folder.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Navigate to&nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If there is a folder called&nbsp;<strong>OFFICE15&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform</strong>&nbsp;rename it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, try reinstalling.</p>

<p>this has nothing to do with Visio installation !&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was simply a "repair" install of MS Office professionalPlus and since then every time my system reboots I have to go thru the repair and re-activation process.</p>

<p>Ignore the visio part, just concentrate on the fix suggested for the error code (even though not all of the error code is identical).&nbsp; Different Office programs can have the same error / error code for the same underlying reason.

<p>Thank you for the confirmation that you do not have any other Office programs (not just bundles) installed.&nbsp; I hope you checked, rather than just assume.&nbsp; Even something as simple as an old "viewer" program for Office files can cause this problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the missing article.&nbsp; They come and go, it is impossible for us to keep up with the changes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point it seems to me that slightly more drastic measures are required.&nbsp; Try using the "Easy fix tool" in method 2 of this article (I checked, it is still there). It will uninstall ALL of Office, including registry entries and personalization files,
 like normal.dotm.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Hint: </strong>if you have customized your Word installation, like custom styles, make a backup copy of normal.dotm before running the script.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>before doing the uninstall make sure you have the 25 character "product key" needed for activation.</p>

<p>Can someone tell me why this box keeps popping up on the screen when I am doing anything on the internet? I don't think it is even from Microsoft and it is **** me off. How do I get rid of it? I think it is something MS is sending out for data collection

<p><br />
An increase from 23.78 to 25.00 is an increase of 1.22.&nbsp; 1.22 is 5.13% of 23.78; that is, 1.22 / 23.78 = .0513 (rounded).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A decrease from 25.00 to 23.78 is a decrease of 1.22.&nbsp; 1.22 is 4.88% of 25.00; that is, 1.22 / 25.00 = .0488.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's all to do with which number you are using as the basis of calculation.</p>

<p>Hi IrBlueSky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Currently, the Persian (Shamsi - Farsi) calendar for the Date Picker is not available. I tried to replicate the issue here on our end and I can only see the same options as you have. What you can see under
<strong>Date Picker Properties</strong> are the only available options that you can use. The good thing is, you can forward this as a feature request to our product team as a consideration for future Office Word release. If you think that the app needs some
 tweaking to make it more efficient, then we highly advise that you make a comment in our Feedback page. Our developers are collating suggestions for the improvement of your experience in using Office Word. Click this

<p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concerns, feel free to message us again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Tech support won&#39;t call back&#33;&#33; Even Level 2 supervisors&#33;  Can Not get my problem resolved&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>On 7/12, my 5<span>th&nbsp;</span>time calling Microsoft Help-desk&nbsp;because of constantly being disconnected after hours of being on hold, I got a another Level 2 Supervisor.&nbsp; There were tons of notes being this issue had begun on 6/21
 when my computer did an <strong>auto</strong> Windows 10 update.&nbsp; She said she promised she would review all notes and call me back later that night, which she didn’t and still haven’t heard from her. She had sent me a personal&nbsp;email I could reply to which
 i did today. &nbsp;Still haven't heard back from ANYBODY. &nbsp; I’m sick and tired of having to call back and not having my issues resolved which began only AFTER WINDOWS&nbsp;10 UPDATE!!! &nbsp;I'm&nbsp;so frustrated with promises of Level 3 tech calling me back with no results&nbsp;and
 knew the hours i would need to spend on the phone again. &nbsp;So i hadn't called for over a week, waiting to see if i would get a call back. &nbsp; &nbsp;I still haven't as of 7/13/2017!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On 6/29, Level 2 tech.&nbsp; He shared my computer and tried to fix many issues but was unsuccessful.&nbsp; When he noticed my
</span><em>“Contact-Lender”</em><span> &nbsp;iCloud folder size said “0” despite all contacts being in folder , he agreed their seemed to be glitches in my .OST file and would escalate to Level 3 tech and arranged a call back on Sunday, 7/1 between 1-3pm. (Check
 my case history notes).&nbsp; I never received a call back either on my home phone or cell.&nbsp; I did ask them to remove home phone but they still insist on calling me back on it.&nbsp; I have literally spent HOURS on the phone since 6/22/17 trying to get my problem resolved
 and have already paid $30 to have this problem resolved which it has NOT! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On 6/23/17, the second time calling about this new issue, After over 1 hour with level 1 tech support, &nbsp;I finally got transferred to Level 2 tech in Philippines.&nbsp; He refused to give me his “V- number” or badge ID and REFUSED to help me or even share
 my computer to see my issues.&nbsp; I kept asking him why and then he hung up on me!!! &nbsp;I actually had Apple Level 2 Tech Support on the phone as a conference call when this happened. She was appalled at your horrific Customer Service!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I requested to have Level 3 or higher from the <strong><em>US ONLY, </em>
</strong>&nbsp;call me to schedule a time to work on my computer Outlook Issues which has YET to happen:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>After first tech in U.S. worked on my computer, All the original contacts data .pst file that contains all my folders on my computer are still missing &nbsp;and can’t be found on my computer.&nbsp; This file was made from my last Microsoft incident in 2014.
 Currently, the only access I have to my folders is by adding the copied .pst file that Ryan made prior to working on my computer.</span></li><li><strong><span>Contact- Lenders folder in .OST size says “0”</span></strong><span> but all lender contacts in there.&nbsp;
</span><br />
<ol>
<li><strong><span>.OST Contacts Total Size</span></strong><span>= 101,769kb </span>
</li><li><strong><span>iCloud Contacts Total Size</span></strong><span>= </span><span>3095kb</span></li><li><span>Previous tech in Outlook opened folder and opened .OST folder.&nbsp; He copied and pasted
<strong>Contacts-lenders</strong> from copied .pst file and pasted into .OST file.&nbsp; I’m not sure if this may have something to do with why when Outlook syncs with iCLoud that I have 3890 contacts that are duplicated, triplicated and sometimes many more times?</span></li><li><span>Apple Level 2 tech that was on conference call can confirm the Outlook to iCloud syncing issues are with OUTLOOK and NOT with iCloud!</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Can’t rename default .OST Folder: “Contacts-This Computer” and change name BACK to “Contacts-.OST”.&nbsp; Previous tech is the one that changed name incorrectly to “This Computer”.&nbsp; Yet all subsequent techs insisted default name can’t be changed and yet
 it already had been once!</span></li><li><span>When trying to sync Outlook to iCloud, it had many folders with duplicated, triplicated and even many more contacts not only in.OST folder but also in trash, deleted and archived folders. But when I look into those folders, they are empty? &nbsp;After
 syncing, I had <strong>3890</strong> contacts compared to original <strong>1486</strong> I originally had!&nbsp;
<strong>So they are not correct in .OST file.</strong>&nbsp; The only way to correct all the Outlook .OST contacts, was to do a contact restore from iCloud.&nbsp; But then that corrupted some of my contacts in Outlook!!&nbsp; That may be the reason for all the multiple duplicated
 contacts and why # of contacts are incorrect in .OST file?&nbsp; </span></li><li><span>All Calendar “color categories” missing on appointments previously assigned.&nbsp; I was told I couldn’t back them up despite finding an article that said they can using macros</span><span>. There MUST be a better way to back up Calendar color categories!!!!&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>I manually saved and exported Calendar after I had restored my PC and all color categories were showing correctly in the iClouds Calendar.&nbsp; However, after techs imported other data folders to try to find missing Contact folders and exhausting all
 my restore points in iCloud, I manually had to re-assign all <em>Calendar Color Categories</em>, which was extremely time consuming!&nbsp; Luckily, they did sync as an
<em>“overlay”</em> in iCloud Calendar.&nbsp; That’s why when I do a contact restore in iCloud, the
<em>Calendar Color Categories</em> are restored.&nbsp; I don’t use my PC Calendar, so have NO appointments in that one.</span></li><li><span>“Categories” tab on ribbon is missing along with “Send/Receive” tab.&nbsp; I know how to manually add them, however, the categories are grayed out and won’t work. On 6/29, Level 2 tech observed that sometimes the categories tab on ribbon would show if
 I right clicked on an appointment first, but then would disappear when we closed same appointment.&nbsp;</span><br />
<ol>
<li><span>Since I did the restore back to 6/21/17, I’m now getting an annoying popup Window error message each time I try to close a contact that has .pdf files in the notes section that says:</span><br />
<ol>
<li><span>“These item contains attachments that are potentially unsafe”.&nbsp; I’ve found articles how to fix this in Registry Editor but don’t feel I should have to do this if my Outlook .OST file wasn’t corrupted!&nbsp; I wasn’t getting this message or had ANY OUTLOOK
 ISSUES PRIOR TO WINDOWS 10 UPDATE!</span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
</li><li><span>In contacts, I used to be able to just double click on email and new email window would open.&nbsp; Now the email address is no longer hyperlinked, despite me having OUTLOOK AS MY DEFAULT.&nbsp;
<strong>Online google shows this is due to new Windows 10 update!</strong></span></li><li><span>Why is it that anytime I speak to any level Microsoft tech, I’m told Microsoft has a new policy that they can’t give out their “V-“ number, badge ID or tell us what state they are in?&nbsp; When I call back, I find out previous tech didn’t leave any notes
 because they hung up or I got disconnected and they never call back and when I ask them who previous tech was to report them, I’m told there were no notes!&nbsp; I have absolutely no proof or emails of anyone I’ve spoken to.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Let me perfectly clear, that my Outlook was working perfectly prior to the INVOLUNTARY WINDOWS 10 UPDATE ON 6/22/17. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p>7/13= On phone with same Level2 tech that promised call back from Level 3 on 7/2 &nbsp;He apologized and needed more info so shared my computer. &nbsp;Not sure what he did or what happened, but noticed i had another .OST file on my computer and somehow lost all my
 contacts and color categories again!! &nbsp;He didn't know how to fix it. &nbsp;3 hours later we hung up and he promised Level 3 call back 7/15 between 8-11am. (24-48 hours). &nbsp;It took me another hour to finally get ontacts and re-enter all color categories but now missing
 many contacts!</p>

<p>It's 8/12 and I still have NOT gotten my case resolved opened 6/21 because Level 2 wont call me back!</p>
<p>I called U.S. Microsoft Corporate headquarters and spoke to operator. &nbsp;I begged her for help being I'm the hamster on the wheel when it comes to calling the Microsoft Answer Desk. &nbsp;She informed me that&nbsp;<strong>you can fax= 425-936-7329 &nbsp;ATT: Escalation (with
 your case #)</strong>&nbsp;and can also upload documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this and got email from escalation senior tech &nbsp;same evening and could reply with call back time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Level 3 did call me and claimed the previous level 2 tech i had been working with was still on my case conferring with Level 3 but my case was never completely escalated to Level 3. &nbsp;This didn't make any sense to me and he couldn't answer. &nbsp;He only said
 he would investigate previous Level 2 tech and who her supervisor was and would report back to me on next call back.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>FYI: ALL ICLOUD USERS WITH OUTLOOK 2013 PRO;</strong></span></p>
<p>I was able to isolate contacts getting corrupted when you sign out and back into iCloud Control Panel. Apple level 2 tech confirmed this was Outlook issue and NOT iCloud issue by isolating the incident by keeping Outlook closed and corrected all contacts.
 &nbsp;They remained corrected until several days later when we re-opened Outlook and they all duplicated and got corrupted again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Level 3 had me sign out and back into iCloud Control Panel, you see message at top saying Do you want to sync FROM Outlook TO iCloud". &nbsp;The iCLoud control panel is only a "window" that shows the contacts that are actually IN OUTLOOK. &nbsp;They are NOT stored
 in iCLoud. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some reason, Outlook created a Local folder in OUTLOOK ONLY, even though it was showing under iCloud contacts and added an additional 75 contacts which had duplicated work phone numbers (adding main number) and duplicated addresses. &nbsp;<strong>The Level
 3 tried to say this was an APPLE ISSUE!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I assured him it was NOT and that the Apple Level 2 tech said:</p>
<p><strong><em>"The purpose of their 3rd party software is to connect with multiple contacts and calendar databases and CORRECTLY import, interpret and interact with those databases. &nbsp;If the problem ONLY OCCURS when their software is involved, then they are
 responsible for resolving the issue with&nbsp;that interaction and Apples Database."</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>He said he would research this and discuss on our next call back. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep you posted!</p>

<p><span>425-936-7329 &nbsp;ATT: Escalation</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I had level 3 contact me. They said my case NEVER got escalated to Level 3 and previous Level 2 tech scheduled to call me back was still on case with level 3. He couldnt answer why she didnt call me back but promised he would research why my case was
 so badly mis- handled.....AGAIN!! &nbsp;He gave me new case #.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>He did fix my problem with duplicate emails but Outlook still did corrupt some contacts again when we opened it for first time by duplicating work phone # as another "MAIN" # and duplicated addresses. He saw this was a glitch with Outlook communicating
 with iCloud and would research and we scheduled call back time.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>You have only two choices;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Call back Microsoft answer desk and give level 1 your case # and name of level 2 you were working with.&nbsp; They can send an internal email to that person to call you.&nbsp; But rest assured.....that will NOT happen.&nbsp; So then your only option is to ask to be
 transferred to a level 2 tech and let them work with you or ask for their supervisor to send internal email to original level 2 tech.....WHICH WON'T HAPPEN!!</p>
<p>2. Send a fax with detailed info like dates, times, and names of techs you've dealt with to:</p>

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a wired issue with my new HP elitebook G4 (Windows 10Pro installed). For some unknown reason, my office applications were not able to open and they always struck at the "starting" after I install Office 2016 (office 365 uninstalled already). Did anyone
 have same issue before? How can I resolve this?</p>

            Hello,,,
I would backup my data in the Temp folder and then login with local admin account &gt; remove your profile &gt; create a new one! 
Try that and let me know.

More details:
Log in as different user (with admin privileges) than you want to delete.
Open Properties for Computer.
Advanced system settings (on the left side)
Settings for User Profiles (in the middle)
Select the profile you want to delete and click the delete button.

            Alright if you have tried to repair it using your local admin, ad account and your regular account and you are sure that office 365 has been removed and no traces left in the registry &gt; restarted &gt; re installed and still no results &gt; " you stated that it's happening with your local and ad account as well!  Hmmm
The last thing I would check is my office 365 license see if you Microsoft account is active! If it's active then you gonna have to reimage your laptop!

<h2>            OneNote toolbar is greyed out and can&#39;t do anything in that notebook on PC</h2>
                    <p>I used this notebook yesterday with no problem, but today I can't do anything in the notebook I need to edit. The toolbar is greyed out across the top. I have a laptop with version 17.7571.57651.0. &nbsp;I have two notebooks set up, and the other one still works.
 I have been getting the "can't sync because you've run out of storage" issue since that was reset - even though I deleted everything in my cloud account and it registers as empty. I only mention that in case it is part of the one of two notebooks unusable
 issue. I am working offline in both notebooks. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app is not a solution, since I would lose everything in the notebook I was unable to sync. Please advise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update. After posting this, I realized that it was not the whole notebook that was affected, just certain sections in each notebook. Still would like to know what is causing this and what to do about it. Thanks.</p>

    <title>Excel Formatting Issues &#40;Mac&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davepalmer_00000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Formatting Issues &#40;Mac&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I have a simple Excel Problem which i am struggling to solve It involves formatting data in columns - Briefly I import my bank transactions into a column list of 7 fields. &nbsp;I am using a Mac but sure the solution would be the same .<br />
<br />
I have these columns formatted in different ways i.e. centred text with the font light grey colour 1 &nbsp;as bold centred and some as a particular font and colour<br />
<br />
The &nbsp;next time i import the data from my text file to add to the columns i need to go and format the new cells again (The old ones stay formatted and any calculations remain its the font type things that don’t) ) is their any simple way of formatting the cells
 so the imported data takes the formatting without me having to repeat the process every time. ? (I Import to another spreadsheet then copy and paste the data across)<br />
<br />
and is their any way of capturing this formatting say like a style sheet so I can use it in another spreadsheet ? &nbsp;Hope someone can help - Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>David&nbsp;<br />

            Hi David ,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you would like to apply the format for the entire column for workbooks in Excel 2016 for Mac. Just as Phillip suggested, you can select the whole column and set format for it. In this case, when you select data from your text file,
 you can paste them with the option: Match Destination Formatting and apply the column format.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a33821c3-5905-4a99-a5a8-dcab26882a38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a33821c3-5905-4a99-a5a8-dcab26882a38" /></a><br />
<br />
Besides, if you would like to use the format from another worksheet, you can use the shortcut Command + Shift + C and Command + Shift + V&nbsp; to copy the formatting from the selection and paste it to another worksheet.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yoga

<p><em><strong>Backup</strong></em> all your contacts, calendar,songs, applications(everything you need)
<strong>Do not back up the phone settings(uncheck this from the list)</strong>&nbsp;via pc suite or nokia suite and then format the memory card first using the file manager application. Then go to and dial
<strong>*#7370#</strong> this will ask if you want to reset your phone contine with a yes. Your phone will restart and will be back to factory shipped condition. Be careful to make sure you have your<strong> backup</strong> done before resetting your phone.</p>

<p>Ya! you are ofcourse right but recently the upcomming phones has got this kind of problems. First I thought it must be RAM problem but now after so many tries I think there is some problem in OS coding, because S40 phones work osum but these s60 v5 has got
 some kind of coding which forces the phone to get switched off. Well I will rquest nokia corp. to release an update for s60 OS which will resolve this problem from roots.</p>
<p>Nokia I love you man but this thing is making us apart&nbsp;:smileyvery-happy:</p>

    <title>Configuring EXCEL spreadsheet for a men&#39;s golf association BLITZ - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dpmoopns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Configuring EXCEL spreadsheet for a men&#39;s golf association BLITZ format &#35;2</h2>
                    <p>I need another formula that take the individual's score on a hole, converts it to a STABLEFORD format (ex: DOUBLE BOGEY = 0 pts; BOGEY = 1 pt; PAR = 2 pts; BIRDIE = 3 pts; EAGLE = 4 pts; DOUBLE EAGLE = 8 pts).&nbsp; So if an individual shoots a "4" on a PAR 4
 hole, he would get "2 pts" for his team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the formula would have to identify the following(all within the same formula because the 3 or 4 team members could shoot different scores:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(PAR = required total number of strokes&nbsp;for that hole)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 2 below PAR = 4 pts</p>
<p>- 1 below PAR = 3 pts</p>
<p>EVEN PAR = 2 pts</p>
<p>+1 over PAR = 1 pt</p>
<p>+2 over PAR = 0 pts</p>
<p>
</p><p>EXAMPLE on spreadsheet:</p>
<p>
</p><p>TEAM #1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PAR (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TM PTS</p>

            <p>If you didn't already have a password you had to create one when you locked it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
To lock your phone and show a message
<ol>
<li>
<p>On your computer, go to windowsphone.com.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Point to the phone in the upper-right corner, and click <span>
Find My Phone</span>. If you're prompted, sign in with the same Microsoft account you used to sign in on your phone.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <span>Lock</span>, and then follow the instructions. If you don't already have a password set up on your phone, you'll need to enter one—you'll use it to unlock the phone if you get it back.
</p>
<div>
Note
<div>
<p>If we can't lock your phone right away, we'll offer to keep trying. We'll send you an email if we succeed.</p>
<div>
Tip
<div>
<p>You can also type a message to display on your phone's lock screen. Consider providing a phone number or an email address in the message, so someone who finds your phone can contact you.

<h2>            Mail Merge &#34;Rule&#34; on Word 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to use mail merge, using Word 2016 for Mac. &nbsp;I want to merge a field, but also want to change the information that it inputs. I want to change it from an abbreviation to the full spelling. &nbsp;I tried using the "if/then" rule, but can only see how
 to do that for one item. &nbsp;If I have more than one item I want to change to a full spelling, how would I do that? &nbsp;For example... if I have 4 status abbreviations (A,B,C ad D) and I want A= Alpha, B= Boy, C= Cat, D= Dog.. how can I accomplish that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<p>To do that, you could either use four separate fields, or three - or four - nested fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Separately:</p>
<p>{IF{MERGEFIELD Status}= "A" "Alpha"}{IF{MERGEFIELD Status}= "B" "Boy"}{IF{MERGEFIELD Status}= "C" "Cat"}{IF{MERGEFIELD Status}= "D" "Dog"}</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p>{IF«Status»= "A" "Alpha"}{IF«Status»= "B" "Boy"}{IF«Status»= "C" "Cat"}{IF«Status»= "D" "Dog"}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nested:</p>
<p>{IF{MERGEFIELD Status}= "A" "Alpha" {IF{MERGEFIELD Status}= "B" "Boy" {IF{MERGEFIELD Status}= "C" "Cat" {IF{MERGEFIELD Status}= "D" "Dog"}}}}</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p>{IF«Status»= "A" "Alpha" {IF«Status»= "B" "Boy" {IF«Status»= "C" "Cat" {IF«Status»= "D" "Dog"}}}}</p>
<p>alternatively:</p>
<p>{IF{MERGEFIELD Status}= "A" "Alpha" {IF{MERGEFIELD Status}= "B" "Boy" {IF{MERGEFIELD Status}= "C" "Cat" "Dog"}}}}</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p>{IF«Status»= "A" "Alpha" {IF«Status»= "B" "Boy" {IF«Status»= "C" "Cat"&nbsp;"Dog"}}}}</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The field brace pairs (i.e. '{ }') for the above examples are all created in the document itself, via Ctrl-F9 (Cmd-F9 on a Mac); you can't simply type them or copy &amp; paste them from this message. Nor is it practical to add them via
 any of the standard Word dialogues. Likewise, the chevrons (i.e. '« »') are part of the actual mergefields - which you can insert from the 'Insert Merge Field' dropdown (i.e. you can't type or copy &amp; paste them from this message, either). The spaces represented
 in the field constructions are all required.</p>

<h2>            Stuck on WIP 17735.1000 rs5</h2>
                    I can download 11741.1000 but it never installs. When I look in update history it shows a "requires a restart to finish installing". Reboot makes no difference. I had the same issue with 17738.1000 so it looks like I'm stuck at 17735 for now unless anyone
 has a solution?

<p>Do you have any 3rd party AV, etc.?</p>
<p>Also, does your Update History say that</p>
<p>a restart is required as the Original Poster</p>

<div>You are most likely pressing the "View" link, instead of "Download". If you don't see a "Download" option, and you are getting two "View" link, try to refresh the browser and the download link should appear.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi Khalid,</p>
<p>To clarify the situation, I’d like to confirm how you “block one particular users email ID” and if there is a related PowerShell cmdlet.<br />
Generally, we can use the PowerShell cmdlet <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff459250(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Search-AdminAuditLog</a> to search the administrator audit logs.<br />
For example, you can find all the administrator audit log entries that contain either the New-RoleGroup or the New-ManagementRoleAssignment cmdlet via the following cmdlet.<br />
Search-AdminAuditLog -Cmdlets New-RoleGroup, New-ManagementRoleAssignment<br />
Also, you can use the following cmdlet to export all the admin administrator audit log entries to a CSV file for checking.<br />
Search-AdminAuditLog | Export-Csv C:\logs.csv</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Franky</p>

<h2>            How to change browser from IE &#47; Edge to Google Chrome when using Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>When using Outlook 2013, I can't get Chrome to open as my default browser when I click on a link in an email. I have it set as my default browser but it doesn't open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I change it to Edge, it works fine. Has Microsoft changed it so you have to use Edge in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>My problem is with ALL emails. When I click on the link in the email, some dots move across the top of the email like it's going to the page but it never opens. It works fine with Edge but not at all with Chrome.</p>
<p>If Edge would allow me to use Dashlane for my passwords, I would just use it but Edge doesn't use extensions/plug-ins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Can't provide any words of wisdom since can't replicate the issue setting the browser default as noted previously and as described in the link provided by &lt;Prince MS&gt;. Having said that - have found Chrome to be temperamental at times (more times then I'd
 like as time passes) where it seems to fail asking if you want to "recover the pages" the next time it's opened. Can't speak to whether Dashlane contributes in any in this scenario since as mentioned, I use RoboForm. In 99.9% of the cases - URLs open fine
 from within Outlook.</p>
