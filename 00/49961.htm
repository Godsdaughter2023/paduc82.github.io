<p>if you cannot set hungary up as an xbox one region then you can't redeem it on the Xbox one</p>
<p>You must use the 360</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Not all Xbox live regions are Xbox one regions yet</p>
<p>Account region</p>
<p>Actual region and language and console region must matchmatch</p><p>As someone already posted he cannot select hungary as a language it's means it's not a Xbox one region</p><p>Xbox one languages are region independent but not Xbox 360 games and yes gears 3 is one of the few that check for language regions</p>

            <p>keep in mind hungary may not be an xbox one region</p><p>Also should be noted that if you previously used UK as your region. And only recently changed you may have to wait upto 90days for the region migration to complete</p><p>This isn't a thing meant to be last min it should always be your actual region</p>

            <p>I&nbsp;solved it by creating a new (hungarian, I guess) account, where I could redeem the games, and already installed them on my XBOX. Don't know what was wrong with my original account, but since it has no purchase or any other important thing (I got my XBOX now), I might use this new one.</p>

<h2>            STOP error 0x0000007E and  0x0000008E when booting the computer</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HELLO - I am seeking help from this desktop to fix my laptop. Laptop is a Dell Inspiron 6000, windows xp professional sp3 OS. A while back I noticed that my help &amp; support didn't work. Trying&nbsp;&nbsp;many recommendations I finally got help and support back.&nbsp;I believe
 I made a registry addition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Started having problems with&nbsp;Windows update, seemed to work fine however all updates downloaded, failed installation so I manually downloaded and installed&nbsp;the recommended list.&nbsp; As I researched this problem I decided to remove my AVG and install&nbsp;MSE.&nbsp;
 For a whole minute the performance of my laptop&nbsp;was top notch. I&nbsp;ran an update,&nbsp;all recommended updates downloaded and failed installation. It said my internet connection was not configured correctly &nbsp;however the optional updates downloaded and installed.&nbsp;
 Shut&nbsp;pc down&nbsp;for couple of days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When I fired it up it loaded to the desktop, mouse&nbsp;and keyboard work however computer doesn't respond. I have been trying to put it in safe mode with connections but&nbsp;get stop error: ***STOP: 0x0000007E(0xc0000005, 0xF7B67160, 0xF7BAD864, 0xF7BAD560)&nbsp;&nbsp; ***
 kdcom.dll - Address F7B67160 base at F7B66000, datestamp 4f8f0f42.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tryed many recommendations, last known configuration, system restore, sfc /scannow at command prompt, task manager, shut down&nbsp;not&nbsp;working. Now another stop error showed up on reboot.&nbsp; ***STOP: 0x0000008E(0xc0000005, 0xF749671D, 0xFAA9B90, 0x000000000)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 *** atapi.sys - Address F749671D base at F748c000, datestamp 4802539d.</p>
<p>no disks came with the laptop</p>
<p>I can load internet explorer however cannot go anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what do you think???????????</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Is any external keyboard and mouse connected to your computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to remove if any external device connected to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps to perform hardware clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Start</b>, click
<b>Run</b>, and then type <span><strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Expand and right click on Display adapter and select disable.</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the same steps for DVD/CD drive, Network adapter and Sound, videos and game controllers.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Windows should install the drivers required.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, refer the following link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283658</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may try to boot in Enable VGA mode. Refer the following article.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>You may check in BIOS(Basic Input Output System)if the CD/DVD drive is set as first priority in the boot sequence.If not, set CD/DVD drive as the first priority in BIOS and then try to boot into Recovery Console.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Modifying BIOS/ chipset incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/chipset can
 be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>Thereafter, you may try to run chkdsk from Recovery Console and check if you are able to boot to the desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>At the Recovery Console command prompt, types the following then press Enter:</span></p>
<p><span>chkdsk [/p] : [/r]</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> At first, try to run chkdsk /p &amp; check if it helps. Later, you may run chkdsk /r.</span></p>

            <p>Hi there, Thankyou for responding to my problems. At this time I have shut my computer down.&nbsp; The last thing I tryed to do was to remove my pictures and put them on cd so I wouldn't loose them.&nbsp; It did not work.&nbsp; I believe I have lost some essential startup
 and operation dlls, files, components or whatever because my computer has been infected. I am afraid to do anything because each time I do I loose more and more options. For ex. my CD Rom was working the other day.</p>
<p>I really don't know what to do or where to start</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may perform clean installation.
</span><span>You may follow the steps.</span>
</p>
<p><span>a. Insert the Windows XP CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive.<br />
b. At the Welcome to Setup page, press ENTER to continue.<br />
c. Press F8 to accept the Windows XP Licensing Agreement.<br />
d. If an existing Windows XP installation is detected, you will be prompted to repair it. At this point hit the ESC key (do not repair).<br />
e. The screen will now list all existing partitions and un-partitioned space for each hard disk. Use the cursor/arrow keys to choose where to create the new partition. Press D to delete an existing partition or press C to create a new partition in un-partitioned
 space.</span></p>
<p><span>If you press D to delete an existing partition, you must then press L (or press ENTER, and then press L if it is the System partition) to confirm that you want to delete
 that partition.</span></p>
<p><span>Repeat this process for each of the existing partitions that you want to move (or remove) in order to create your new partition. When all necessary partitions are deleted,
 you can then select the remaining un-partitioned space and then press C to create new partitions.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If you want to create a partition where at least one partition already exists,
 you must first delete the existing partition or partitions and then create the new partition. Type the size in megabytes (MB) that you want the new partition to be. Then press ENTER. Alternatively, you can just press ENTER to create the partition using all
 the available space (i.e. create the biggest possible partition).</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to install Windows XP, use the arrow keys to select the partition where you want to install Windows XP and then press ENTER.</span></p>

            Hello Mike,
<br />
<br />I'd like to know how your system is compromised so I can better help you. Usually, the best way to go on about this is, if you don't have many things that are important on your computer, you can try refreshing it using Microsoft's utility, download it here and run it when you get it: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10startfresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Please read the "Before you begin" section as it will be very clear about what you may lose with doing this. You could get a flash drive and put all your data in it, given it has enough capacity for them.
<br />
<br />When you're done with it, you should consider supplementing your existing protection (from Windows Defender) by getting third-party antimalware software like Malwarebytes.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.       
        </p>

            Hi Mike,
<br />
<br />Can you please explain this in more detail. What do you mean by your system has been compromised, what are you experiencing to make you believe that?

            no but trust me when say there's no question about it. I replying to this 2 and a half weeks later because I just found it. I have a lot of things I could show you, if your really interested. Someone or something has been accessing all my devices remotely
 since February, I'm just not knowledgeable enough to do anything about it.

            I've tried refreshing, clean installs, I've wiped hard drives with diskpart, with every setting in D-ban. Its just never gone. I've used Gmer, Frst, Hitman Pro, Root Repeal, Malware bytes, a lot more too, everytime I use Frst one of two things happen.
 1. i'll do the fixlist run fix and it will run forever If I let it. 2. No matter what is on the fixlist, Ive tried one single temp file to test it, 10 will crash and not be able to start and I have to reinstall. I install the 1803 build and its being rolled
 back somehow.&nbsp;<br />
Because I don't have the updates I should. If I go to Microsoft it asks me to install April update. windows update is active but I can't get any updates, every once in a while I'll successfully get so mundane update, but I suspect that its really just about
 the restart. I can use the windows reg repair from regsoft It used to be effective. Now I can fix the same 19 errors in local machine 500 hundred times, By the time I run it again same 19 errors. It's got hives just ready to load or something. You should see
 all the custom rules and custom triggers on my fire wall. It might seem crazy but it seems like If something is effective it just finds an exploit rendering it useless. I just don't know enough I don't have a problem with research, I just don't know where
 else to look. I have win 10 home so I had to run the batch file and move the group policy editor files from 64WOW to system 32 I did my best to make things as secure as I could, I was prompted to restart.....10 never started again, that 10 at least. any advice
 would be greatly appritiated. There is so much I could say, I could talk about this for hours, I've been living with this for six months nearly 6 months. Thank you for your response. I apologize but I just now found the email. I just showed up...lol that's
 what its like.&nbsp; I'll just add this so you know: 2 desktops 1. windows 10 2. windows 7 one laptop windows 7 [It had 10 installed for about 2 hours then crashed. I could never get 10 installed again. and about 5 android devices, oh I also have 4 have drives
 with write protection that I never put on them. I can install on them no matter I try I can not remove readonly.&nbsp; Attributes disk clear readonly. always fails to clear the attribute.&nbsp; Thanks for your time...

<p>I truly don't know, for the first couple of months I was convinced it was a virus. Some type of malware. Its important to mention that, when all this began I could barely navigate windows. When someone mentioned&nbsp; a possible problem with my registry, I didn't
 know what they were talking about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The first time anyone connected remotely was sometime in April, I got a paid membership to McAfee and I couldn't get it to install.&nbsp; Like I said before, I didn't know any better so I let him on.&nbsp; The tech used command prompt, showed me what at the time
 looked like a bunch of nonsense, and said I had a worm. I took his word for it, at this time I'm assuming that it is McAfee that I'm talking to. Long story short I agreed to pay $200 for the service, but the tried to renegotiate the price, I refused, and for
 four days everything was fine the only four days of peace I've had since February.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now remember that the issue predates this incident. Since then, Microsoft [the real Microsoft has been on once because of a mouse issue and windows up dates. That was around....probably the end of May. I still don't know very much, but I know what I
 should and shouldn't be able to do. That being said I'm sure that some of the issues I attribute to this or in fact simple bugs in windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; There are so undeniable facts however. I have two networks and a domain set up right now. I don't want to be a part of any groups let alone a domain. I can not create a new network. I can get to go to Network and sharing everything is fine, I click
 on set up a new network connection and its like the windows updates it goes on and on and nothing ever happens. I cant successfully reconfigure my router. I had to have my internet provider set up a new password. {It took them an hour just to get into the
 interface, they had to call me back. All the passwords for all my accounts have been changed at one time or another. One night all at one time seemingly. I've found charges on a couple different credit cards on I never use for online purchaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Its frustrating because, I do construction, I work an my own cars and my whole family's cars [for the most part anyway] I'm used to being able take something apart and figure it out. What makes it worse is I pretty sure that everything I need to resolve
 this is at my disposal, I just don't know enough. Also research is great I love to learn, but there is no substitute for experience. Again I thank you very much for your time and patients....</p>

<p>I'm pretty good with computers, but you certainly wouldn't want me on your job site. And the only thing I can do under the hood is change the windshield washer fluid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people are born with technical smarts. Not me. I had to learn. In the beginning I read a lot of books about computers at the Dick and Jane level. "See the mouse. Mouse. Mouse. Mouse." Then I graduated to the internet, where I was able to take advantage
 of a vast library of computer knowledge. It took a long time, but I'm glad I invested that time. I am no longer afraid of my computer. You can do that too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, I'm scared stiff of plumbing. I had to replace all the tank guts in the upstairs toilet. I did research for days. It took me almost 4 hours to get the job done, not counting emergency trips to Home Depot for tools I didn't have. But in
 the end, I did it. Everything worked properly! It can be that way for you with your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Show your computer to a professional (preferably one who needs new spark plugs.) Have the professional give your computer a thorough going over to make everything right. Then, don't touch anything. Run to the bookstore - wait, those don't exist any more
 - go to the online bookstore, buy Dick and Jane Learn PCs and start your education. I predict you'll do well.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller DeadZone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> v22 tyger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller DeadZone</h2>
                    <p>My normal Xbox Controller I have been using for years suddenly got a drift in the right anolog stick. I took it to my nearest repair shop they replaced the inner&nbsp;workings of the stick. I got it back about a week later and the deadzone on the stick has decreased like crazy. My guess is it’s at zero percent. Why am I complaining you ask. Well in FPS games shooting someone at long range. I just have to give up. I can’t barely move my stick over to hit anything. It’s a blessing and a curse. I’ve tried lowering my sensitivity doesn’t help. Any way to configure it back to the 15-20% deadzone that it was before? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The analog stick might need some silicone grease, since the inside of it gets clogged with powdered like plastic from the controller shell thumbstick hole and thumbsticks grinding each other. But you could have done it yourself without having someone soldering
 on new a one for you.&nbsp;Here is a video to show you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MoqW3PukDK0?version=3&amp;showinfo=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Replace the analog stick X or Y sensor without soldering">

<h2>            Windows Update Errors &#40;0x80246010, 0x8000ffff, 0x80070002&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm attempting to install windows updates. Windows Update Assistants always fails (with this error&nbsp;0x80070002) An whenever I check for updates now, it says this:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80e4b672-7615-42b6-bc3b-8481d94104fc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80e4b672-7615-42b6-bc3b-8481d94104fc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>the last one (not visible in the picture) is&nbsp;• Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool x64 - March 2018 (KB890830) - Error 0x80070002</p>
<p>Running troubleshooting doesn't work, stopping and restarting the services doesn't work, clearing out SoftwareDistribution doesn't work and nothing else I've tries works.</p>
<p>This is getting in my way sicne I can't update visual studio due to an error caused by my windows version (or rather, unfixable in my version) and Update Assistant appears every time I load my computer even if I uninstall it and I just want it to go away
 already. Thanks.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />Error 0x80070002 means that the download was not completed.
<br />
<br />Place the computer in clean boot and try again to install the build and see if it helps.
<br />
<br />To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.
<br />

<br />
<br />Note: Check the title “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” for reverting to normal mode.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards,

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Skype Insider web page, screen-share feature should be supported. However, I'm running Skype Linux 8.16.76.1 on Ubuntu 17.10 but I can't find any option to share screen. Camera works fine, and I can share files or location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any package/permissions necessary to enable screen-share?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,<br />

<p>Hello i have a Packard&nbsp;Bell&nbsp;EASYNOTE MZ35-V-060UK. I have had it since June 2007 and earlier this year it started all of a sudden to get really slow, i decided to do a system restore using packard bell system restore, it all worked fine and it said it had
 finished and would now restart, when it had restarted a message came up saying</p>
<p>"Windows could not complete the installation, to complete the installation restart the computer" It then gives you an option to press ENTER or ESC (to restart) so you press enter or restart and they both just restart the laptop and do the same thing!</p>
<p>What i am trying to do is to open packard bell recovey, which i was able to do last time by pressing F10 at start up but it&nbsp;wont work it comes up with a screen to edit boot options</p>
<p>I have also tried pressing F8 at start up and any of the options available take me straight back to the "Windows cannot complete the installation..." screen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!</p>
<p>Much apreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>In other words, you tried to restore the computer back to the factory settings using the Packard bell system recovery since your computer performance was not up to the mark.</p>
<p>At this point of time, I don’t think there is anything left other than a clean installation of Windows Vista. In order to perform clean installation, you need to get a Windows Vista Operating System Disc.</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to contact Packard Bell for further assistance on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Packard Bell Support<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.packardbell.com/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.packardbell.com/uk/</strong></a>
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Whenever you want to restore your computer back to the factory settings, please get assistance from your computer manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>For Your Information:</strong> You can also contact computer tech store to see if they can help you in backing up your data.</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful<br />

<h2>            Skype for Business disconnects when I connect At&#38;T Network client</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using skype for business for internal chat with colleagues. However, we use At&amp;t Network client to connect to office network from outside. When I connect to At&amp;t, skype for business automatically logs me off. As soon as I disconnect, I can login to
 skype. Clearly there is some conflict here. Any solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            Hi Akbar,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, apparently, the AT&amp;T network client blocks certain access to Skype for Business Online service. However, as we are not sure whether the client restrict connections by IPs or else, I suggest you turn to AT&amp;T support for further assistance.
 If it’s indeed IP-based restriction, here is an article about Skype for Business Online IP addresses which might be helpful to you.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2#BKMK_LYO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges (Skype for Business Online)</a><br />

Thanks,<br />

<p>
</p><p>At&amp;t network client is not designed to block any access or IPs. I think it is conflict of ports. May be they are using same port.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there way to change the port for skype for business?</p>

After checking the logs, I’d like to confirm if your organization has deployed ADFS. If you have no idea about this, you may check with your admin about it. Also, could you let me know whether Skype for Business works fine in your office (internal) network
 where At&amp;t network client is not required?<br />
<br />

<em>Walking Dead</em> creator Robert Kirkman gave a few more details about the forthcoming game.</p>
<p>"I can say that it will be <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/payday-the-heist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(224, 56, 0, 1)">Payday</span></a>-esque because [Starbreeze and Overkill] are currently doing Payday," Kirkman said (via
<a href="http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/14/8215901/overkills-the-walking-dead-will-be-like-pay-day-but-in-a-bigger-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(224, 56, 0, 1)">Polygon</span></a>). "But I'm told it will be in a bigger world than Payday currently encompasses. They are going to be learning a lot of stuff from Payday that they will be incorporating into the Walking Dead game. There will be
 announcements about the game very soon."</p>
<p>Kirkman also spoke about why Telltale's take on the <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-games-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(224, 56, 0, 1)">Walking Dead</span></a> franchise was so successful.</p>
<p>"The key I think, which is very important, is that we're not doing, 'Hey, it's Daryl Dixon running around shooting zombies, because you like Daryl Dixon.' Or 'It's Rick Grimes doing this because you like Rick Grimes.' We're telling our own stories and doing
 our own things almost as if they are original games."</p>

<p>Hmmm... I'm confused about the 'Payday-esque' comment. Do they mean it will be based around coop or that it will have the same look and feel? I'll keep an eye on this though as I do like overkill.</p>
<p>As a side note, I actually liked survival instinct, yeah it was a complete cash grab, but it had Daryl, zombies and a crossbow. That in itself ticked a lot of boxes for me, haha. Plus I rather enjoyed the feel, gameplay and even some of the levels.</p>

<div>The last time I installed it was on Windows&nbsp;Millennium Edition (I was young and dumb, don't judge me LOL). Is there a possibility that because it was made for 98 era systems that it's looking for the file in the wrong folder? I have reinstalled it a couple
 of times with no fix. I really do not want to download a registry fix program or anything like that. I know there's a lot of little things that keep newer systems from being backwards compatible with third party software and I understand if nothing can really
 be done. Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;</div>

            DRM issues are one of the main issues with older games on Win7, particularly 64bit.<br />
Old games with 16bit installers are the other main issue with 64bit Windows. <br />
<br />
The information in the link provided by <i>Mouneshwar</i>&nbsp; in the thread below may be relevant -<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-pictures/drmcliendll-is-missing-or-corrupt-while-updating/01748a22-32ec-4971-b538-1f8061d8a9b3http://">Windows Media DRM with pre-installed Win7</a><br />
<br />
Some workaround options ;<br />
- Don't install to the default location - Program Files (X86). Create a new folder in C:\ or<br />
install to another Partition or HDD. The&nbsp; Program Files (X86) folder is a protected folder<br />
and installing there can lead to permissions issues.<br />
- If you have not already, try the following Compatibility settings -<br />
<i>Install the game using compatibility for XP sp2</i> (set the compatibility option on the<br />
setup.exe&nbsp; on the disk before installing)<br />
<i>Disable Desktop Composition<br />
Disable Desktop Themes<br />
Run...as administrator<br />
</i>- Download the DRMClien.DLL&nbsp; and put it in the games install folder.<br />
- Use a noCD hack (They are safe - I use them on all my older games that require having<br />
the CD in the drive for the DRM check).<br />
<br />
<i>"I really do not want to download a registry fix program or anything like that."</i><br />
<br />
- Registry 'cleaner/fix' programs don't often help, but sometimes a registry entry for the<br />
particular game can be created, or edited manually. <br />
This is normally safe regarding the OS as the registry entry would only apply to that game.<br />
- There may be a fan site for the game with a fix. Some fan sites have new installers compatible
<br />
with 64bit OS's, and fixes for things such as colour problems.<br />
<br />
- For old DOS based games the following is a user interface that facilitates using DOS BOX (included)-&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <div>Thank you for the response! I got the game to start by uninstalling it from the C: drive and reinstalling on the D: drive, downloading the DRMClin.dll and the strmdll.dll for XP and putting them into the install file however it went through all of the
 little startup videos but crashed when it got to the point of the main menu coming up and gave me these codes:</div>

<div>Additional Information 4:<span>
</span>bbf53958556822bef0ac70bab37093f7</div>
<div><br />
<div>I downloaded VirtualBox but I need a copy of XP to get the VM working. For some reason Windows 7 won't let me force the game to run in compatibility mode for XP which is why I dowloaded the VM program. I didn't think that downloading the noCD hack would
 be needed as I'm assuming that's just for the DRM check, maybe I should anyway?</div>
<div><br />
Thank you again and I will keep this thread updated on how it worked.&nbsp;</div>

It's good you're getting some progress though. <br />
Yes, the noCD is not likely to benefit, If the game runs the FMV<br />
the CD check should have been done. <br />
<br />
<i>"Windows 7 won't let me force the game to run in compatibility mode for XP"</i><br />
<br />
Both with trying to set-up the CD to install using it, and using the games .exe after<br />
installing ?&nbsp; Win '98 no go either ?<br />

 the size of screen space wasted on the task bar&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>If anyone has the answer, it would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Or if anyone has access to the design team that can return this basic feature - it should just be a selection (do you want to see date - Yes/No/which format, do you want to see time - Yes/No/which
 format).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<br />i am sorry that is not possible, and I totally agree, it would be much better if the Date and Time were side by side
<br />
<br />Please open the Feedback Hub (Windows Key + F) and post this request there, that is the only way the Windows developers will see this, believe many before you have also requested the exact same thing . ..

 icons+time on the right, but the choice to use 1-2 cm of it (to display date) is not an option.&nbsp; Yes, I'll use the Feedback Hub. - Have a great day!</p>

<h2>            Cant download any &#34;new&#34; games with ultimate pass</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i have problems in Windows Store or new Xbox App(beta) with downloading the "new" introduced games, like Exodus, Wolfenstein II or Vampyr.&nbsp; Games like Ori, Gears 4 or updates works fine.</p>
<p>What i tried:</p>
<p>- Resetting Store</p>
<p>- Reinstall Store</p>
<p>- Networkstate Ok and connected</p>
<p>- Xbox app with admin</p>
<p>- Win update said its up to date, but i think its lying, because i didnt have the newest Version and it said im up to date. i installed manually Build 10.0.18362. Not sure why it says that.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; and more you can find on google with topics like store wont work/cant download apps or such</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i tried with Xbox app it says Errorcode&nbsp;<span>0x80040154</span></p>
<p>With Win Store i can choose my drive and click on install. Then there is an error like "try it again later. There is a an error on our site"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else got this?</p>

            Hi,  Patrick_LPM
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1) launch powershell 
<br />2) Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3) Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If the above does not work, execute these commands: Re-register the Store App 
<br />
<br />Open Start screen and press Windows + R keys on the keyboard. 
<br />
<br />Run the following in a Command Window (CMD) to re-register the Store App: 
<br />powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.XML 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

    <title>Cannot perform update to version 1709 of Windows. It says Nero must be - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vw53a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot perform update to version 1709 of Windows. It says Nero must be manually removed, but it isn&#39;t even there.</h2>
                    <p>Since version 1709 came available, I get notifications that updates cannot be installed. At some point it said that I should manually remove Nero - Burning Rom, as it was not compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>First of all, it is of course amazing that one cannot update the OS because some flimsy 3rd party program may not be working afterwards. It is like bringing your car to the garage with an engine problem but the garage stating
 that they cannot fix the problem because there is a grocery bag of another brand in the trunk.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>But let's not pay too much attention to that.</em></p>
<p>After trying to solve this problem, among others with help of other threads here, I figured I just had to leave it and wait for the bug fix from Microsoft or for the next version update. However, since a couple of days, the update start with visual pop-ups
 blocking the rest of my screen until I click "Hide".</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>(Note that I have a Dutch version of Windows, and the phrases posted are my translations. They may differ from the official US/UK versions of Windows. However, I think you will get the point.)</em></p>
<p>As I did not get much response in the other topics, I get the idea that everyone with the same problem needs to start their own question here. So, here I go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dutch version 1703 of Windows 10. The computer came originally with Windows 7, but it was legally upgraded soon after purchase, in the year where Microsoft granted upgrade free of cost. Note that in the original installation with Windows 7, there
 was no Nero Burning Rom installed and it has never been installed since. The current build number is 15063.936 - just showing that other updates work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have done:</p>
<ul>
<li>I ran <strong>sfc /scannow</strong>. It found no problems.</li><li>I ran <span><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></span>. It found no problems.</li><li>I searched the drive for files or folders with "Ahead" or "Nero" in the name. I only found "nero" in the file name "C:\Windows\appcompat\UA\appicon_nero.exe_b3a08d4adec09581.png"</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I searched the registry for mentions of "nero". It only came up with things where "nero" is just a part of the name, like in "JPGClea<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">nerO</span>ptimize" where it has nothing to do with Nero Burning Rom. I also searched
 the registry for mentions of "ahead", but it mainly came up with mentions of "TypeAhead" and "FlipAhead" which are part of normal Windows 10 and have nothing to do with Nero Burning Rom.<br />
</li><li>I uninstalled Ashampoo Burning Studio which was came with the computer. Maybe, just maybe, somehow Windows saw that as Nero. But it didn't fix the problem. And yes, I did restarts after that and cleaned the registry with CCleaner, just to make sure no traces
 of Ashampoo Burning Studio were left. To no avail.</li><li>I did click the button "Update now" on https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10, with the same result.</li><li>I did download and use the Media Creation Tool from that same page. Same result.</li><li>I did download the ISO-file as if I was going to use it for another computer (because the Media Creation Tool apparently deletes it after exiting because it cannot update due to Nero Burning Rom). I tried to use the ISO file with a bootable recovery USB-stick,
 but I couldn't use an ISO file with it that way. I uncompressed the ISO file to a directory using 7-Zip and ran setup.exe. It did, as I thought beforehand, exactly the same thing.</li><li>I did a lot of these things double, the second time running the program as an administrator. It made no difference.</li><li>It always ends with a Window saying (in Dutch) something like "Let's see what yet needs to be done. Check next points if you want to continue with the installation, and you want to keep your Windows-settings, personal files and -apps.<br />
Nero - Burning Rom&nbsp;&nbsp; Manually delete<br />
Remove this app now, because it is not compatible with Windows 10."</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Where does Windows get the idea from that Nero -Burning Rom is installed? If it does base this on a registry key, I will (temporarily) remove that key. If it is based on a file or directory, I will (temporarily) remove that. But please tell me how it comes
 to this conclusion, so I know what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or better yet, please fix this update, so it doesn't find non-existing software anymore. Or even better, fix the update so it doesn't search for, or halt at, software that may not be compatible with version 1709 of Windows 10 anymore. If you tell the user,
 that certain software will not be compatible after the upgrade anymore, that is somewhat okay, but completely halting the OS-update because of that&nbsp; ... that is soo ... I don't even have words for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or otherwise, please give me the option to continue the update with my acknowledgement that Nero might not be working afterwards. I don't care if Nero doesn't work properly anymore (because I know it isn't there and has never worked on this computer), I
 just want Windows to work properly as it did until this version 1709 came out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or give me an option to stop installing 1709 repeatedly. I am willing to wait for version 1803 or whatever comes next. I don't need 1709, 1703 was working great. I want a working computer. I can live without the new things 1709 might bring me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken 2 days vacation from work, due to a school holiday from my kids. It is now Saturday and I have wasted 2½ precious days. You can imagine how pissed I am at Microsoft. There is so much more I would like to say, but I am sitting on my fingers.
 I never was fond of the whole Windows-as-a-service concept, and this situation isn't helping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this. Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            No &#34;File&#34; menu available in Windows Live Mail&#59; not even a command taskbar</h2>
                    From a previous answer: "Then in WLM do File-Import-Messages-Outlook Express 6 and navigate to the folder you copies all the dbx files to." When I open Windows Live Mail, I don't have the typical command bar with choices or menus like "File," "Edit," "View,"
 etc. Where do I find the menu that will take me to the "Import" utility? Thanks.<br />

<h2>            wireless keyboard on another computer</h2>
                    my wireless keyboard just stopped working.&nbsp; I changed the batteries and rebooted and it still is not working. Could someone have clicked on a button to lock it?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which version of Windows operating system is installed in your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model number of the mouse/computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Replace your batteries in the keyboard. Fix problems with keystrokes being dropped by checking the range of your wireless keyboard. Slowly back away from the receiver as you type. You will
 notice a point where the keyboard doesn’t work as well. Normally, wireless keyboards will have a range of up to 6 feet. Some cheaper versions may only give you a 3 to 4 foot range to work with. Range is the first thing to check. However, you may have a more
 expensive wireless keyboard that sends its signal well up to thirty feet. If you are still having trouble with typing on a thirty foot range wireless keyboard, then you will need to look at other potential causes for failure.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Check for interference with a Bluetooth wireless keyboard. Determine the type of wireless signal your wireless keyboard uses. Are you using radio frequency or Bluetooth? The range for radio
 frequency is 27MHz, while the range for Bluetooth operates at 2.45GHz. If you use Bluetooth, then 802.11B/G wireless devices are unlikely to be the cause of interference. However, microwave ovens and cordless phones can cause problems for your Bluetooth wireless
 keyboard. The difference between the radio frequency and Bluetooth technology is that Bluetooth jumps from one frequency to another frequency. This is known as Frequency hopping. The benefit of frequency hopping is that Bluetooth avoids interferences by hopping
 from one frequency to another. Bluetooth can use one of seventy-nine channels. Problems with Bluetooth will generally result in a lag or delay in response to your keystrokes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Place the radio frequency receiver as close as possible to your wireless keyboard (If you are using radio frequency wireless keyboard). If you continue to have interference, try a Bluetooth
 device. Bluetooth generally has less interference from other devices. But if you must use your 27MHz keyboard, then you might benefit by reading the instructional manual for how to switch to another channel. Most 27MHz wireless keyboard/ mouse packages come
 with two channels for the keyboard and two channels for the mouse.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Install the software and drivers that came with your keyboard. Often a wireless keyboard will work without installing the software, but the software gives you added protection and keyboard
 functionality. Also make certain that your drivers are up to date. You can go to your wireless keyboard’s manufacturer’s web site to find out about driver updates for maximum performance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important</span></b><span>: Wireless keyboards tend to work poorer if you don't install the software that came with the keyboard. Although,
 however, most wireless keyboards will work without the software installed. Windows XP recognizes most new hardware the minute you plug something in to your computer. This is the same with wireless keyboards, because although the keyboard is wireless, you still
 need to plug in a receiver to your USB port on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the information is helpful.</span></p>
