                    <p>In the Windows 7 Screensaver, if I choose the 'Photos' option, it shows a lot of pictures that I can't find on the computer, despite browsing to the folder it appears to be pointing to.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Have you checked to show hidden files?&nbsp; I would suggst confirming this is set first, but if you are still unable to locate the picture I would open Windows Explorer and type in .jpg to see if you can locate this.&nbsp; I know this can take up time if you have
 hundreds of pictures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you go to the Screen Saver settings, you should be able to see from the Settings tab what location the pictures are comming from.</p>

    <title>Must reset LAN adapter after using Sleep or Hibernation mode. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bizwiz41  say:</h3>
<h2>            Must reset LAN adapter after using Sleep or Hibernation mode. </h2>
                    
<p>Hello All,<br />
This is my first time posting; please excuse any naive ignorance in my description of problem.<br />
<br />
My problem is: noticed "slow" email, and "upload" activity within the last week. Checked Internet coneection speed and found download was still high (30Mbps +/-), but download down to .25Mbps from 3.7Mbps. Problem does not exist on wireless connection, only
 Ethernet connection.<br />
<br />
Problem only occurs after computer (sony VAIO VGN-NR220E w/Vista OS) comes out of Sleep or Hibernation. A full shut down and reboot solves issue. I narrowed down problem to LAN adapter, and found I could correct problem by "reseting LAN adapter".<br />
<br />
I have tried everything I can think, or dare try. <br />
I have ensured Power Mgmt setting is unchecked for "Allow this device to wake computer:<br />
I have updated driver (Marvell Yukon 88E8039 PCI-E Fast Ethernet Controller),<br />
I have checked connection w/Comcast, all modem and line items are excellent,<br />
I have reset cable modem, wireless router, and connections,<br />
I have tried to "trick" adapter by unplugging, the plugging in again,<br />
I have checked all IP config settings, nothing has changed since before issue started,<br />
I have updated Vista w/ SP2,<br />
I have scanned Registry, do not see anything related to controller/LAN adapter<br />
<br />
I have researched this issue, and it seems that many have the issue of NO connection after Sleep/Hibernation, and that this is a Vista issue of not fully waking the adapter. My issue is slightly different in that I do get a connection, and still have a great
 download speed, but the upload speed almost disappears!<br />
<br />
As I said, I've learned a temp fix of resetting adapter, but this is a pain. It is also a pain to "shut down", and then wait for the long boot time.<br />
<br />
It sems there is no fix or patch out there for this issue (yet?). If anyone has insight, or a remedy, please help me! I am at my wits end over this issue. Not a major issue, but very inconvenient!<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.</p>

<br />
Sony often uses proprietary versions of some drivers so stick with the ones available at their site at
<br />
least at first. <br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For
<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,
<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

            First, thank you so much for the reply. Your list gives me some options to explore.<br />
<br />
I did update the controller driver, and I did have to manually "force it", as you mentioned. You were correct that the Device Manager kept telling me my driver was the "latest".<br />
<br />
My speculation is that this issue has root cause somewhere in Power Management. It justs seems that the LAN adapter is not "fully" awake from Sleep or Hibernation. I never had this problem until a week ago or so.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all the suggestions. I'll spend some time going through each one.<br />
<br />
I'll let you know if I find any success. However, at this point I'm wondering if an upgrade to Windows 07 is a more economical remedy in terms of time and money!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There is no way to know if you did an "Upgrade" to Win7 whether this issue would carry over or<br />
not. My best guess is that it would unless you did a complete fresh install with Win 7.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

            You're entirely correct on the upgrade question!<br />
<br />
But, interesting twist here, on this issue. A quick background,<br />
<br />
I went through many of your suggested steps, unfortunately no change.<br />
<br />
I restored the Power Management settings, hoping this would be the fix, but no change.<br />
<br />
So, I went into Device Manager, into Power Management and <strong>checked</strong> "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power". This has never been selected, basically I felt there was nothing to lose in trying.&nbsp; It seems to have worked!<br />
<br />
I put the computer to "Sleep", and after a while came back, went into my email (this is where the problem is felt, w/replying, attachments, etc.), and everthing worked as it should. I then checked the upload on a couple speed test sites, and the upload was
 back to its 3.5 -4.0 Mbps!!<br />
<br />
I'm hoping this "fix" sticks, and continues to work. Though I feel there is still a problem somewhere in the Power Management/Sleep Mode.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help. This has been a frustrating one.

            Glad you sorted it out. Often settings like those get corrupted so the cure is change them as if you planned<br />
to make the change permanent and then change them back to how you desire.<br />

            Thanks again SpiritX,<br />
<br />
But..perhaps I spoke too soon! <br />
<br />
I may not know a lot about computers and networking, but I do know about problem solving, and I may have done one of the big sins of problem solving. That being that a corrective action should not cause a bigger problem!<br />
<br />
The checking of "Allow the computer to turn off this device..." did work initially. I checked the box, went back, put the computer to sleep, woke it, then connected to the Internet. Upload speed was at normal.<br />
<br />
However, the second time I went into Sleep Mode, when I "awoke" it, NO connection at all! I tried everything, resetting, looking for IP address, etc. I finally went in, "unchecked", shut down, and completely rebooted my cable modem and router. The connection
 did come back, but this was a bit scary, and quickly approaching the same problem I've seen many post about in this, and other forums.<br />
<br />
So, I have tried to duplicate this situation; I've checked "Allow...turnoff...", went into Sleep Mode overnight, and started up again. Once again my connection is fine. I'm becoming more convinced this is a Power Management issue, with the LAN adapter not fully
 waking, but I cannot seem to understand what would have caused it to start. The only thing that has changed in my set up is I did do a cleaning of my computer, and removed some programs that I do not, or never used. It would not seem this should be a cause,
 but you never know. Perhaps I removed something that wants to look for an update upon start up, and the adapter is still "waiting" before it will send anything...I have no idea.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, enjoy the holiday weekend.

<p>Back again!<br />
<br />
I thought I may have had this issue corrected, but alas I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Now, the problem has expanded; "awaking" from Sleep, the computer tries to connect to the wireless adapter as well. The issue here is that I have the WLAN switch off!
<br />
<br />
My further attempts to correct this issue have been:<br />
&nbsp;1) Installed Sony VAIO Care program, have run and tried all suggested corrections.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;2) Have run DriverMax to check all drivers, currently going through slow process of installing all new drivers<br />
<br />
&nbsp;3) Have run Vista Performance tools, strangely getting alerts that certain "drivers" for display adapter, and Sony VAIO update may cause issues with computer going into, and coming out of sleep mode.<br />
<br />
Any ideas, suggestions, known solutions are more than welcome! Not sure where this problem will end...</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Much better to manually update drivers as eventually those automated ones make a mistake.<br />
<br />
And the best advice I can give is to go back to the troubleshooter in my 1st reply. Be sure and<br />
check the power settings in Device Manager for all major devices and again after updating them.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Could not connect to server. Please try again later.&#34;  while connecting to Origin account.</h2>
                    <p>Okay so here are the basics. Within the past week I downloaded Microsoft Office 2010 on my laptop (HP Pavilion 15.6 Touchsmart w Windows 8.1) as I read online that others w Windows 8.1 were able to and it was supposed to be compatible. Unfortunately, when
 I downloaded it my laptop would go to a blank screen after logging in to my account where only the mouse cursor was visible. I wasn't able to do anything except turn it on and off. So I finally reset my laptop, taking all my downloads off but leaving documents
 and pictures. Well, then I tried redownloading my Sims 3 game but when I had to log into the Origin account to finish installing my game it said "Could not connect to server. Please try&nbsp;again later." And also ever since then I haven't been able to connect
 to the hotspot on my phone. I also read someone on my laptop while doing scans that there was something with my port 80. Now I'm not sure whether all of these things could be caused by the same problem or what as I'm smart with computers but this is beyond
 my knowledge. I've already restored my laptop and done everything, including contacting Origin and Hp but no luck. No one seems to be able to figure it out so I'd really appreciate it if someone could please help me figure out what's wrong with my laptop.
 Also I just bought it two months ago so it's practically brand new.. and should not be having so many problems.</p>

            <p>1. I reset my computer so my Office 2010 got deleted and it was my last use of the product key so I am unable to use it. I wouldn't want to download it again even if I could.
</p>
<p>2. When I try to connect to a Hotspot it just says "Can't connect to Network" And then I try to troubleshoot it and I get this "website (wpad.gateway.2wire.net) is online but isn't responding. Detected to connection attempts.</p>

<p>These are all steps I've already taken as well. Although I haven't tried uninstalling and reinstalling the program since performing a clean boot so I will try that now.

<p><span><br />
If this doesn’t help, please contact Origin using the link provided in the previous thread.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
The issue with your Wi-Fi hotspot doesn’t appear to be a network related issue. The issue may be caused by your security program such as anti-virus or a Windows Firewall /Defender which might have conflicting settings as to not to perform certain tasks. I suggest
 that you temporary disable the anti-virus and firewall and check the result again. You would need to turn on the security programs again which you had disabled.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />

<h2>            Remove persistent IP address</h2>
                    I'm trying to delete an IP address that was set as "persistent" and it won't cooperate. Even when I installed Windows 7, the IP address is still persistent. I've followed instructions for clearing the IP register, deleting the route. I'm obviously doing
 something wrong. Can you help?

            Are the IP address and subnet mask 169.254.x.x and 255.255.0.0.?<br />
<br />
If so, that indicates that:<br />
<br />
1. The network connection is configured to obtain an IP address automatically.<br />
<br />
and:<br />
<br />
2. It can't communicate with a DHCP server to get an IP addrdess.<br />
<br />
In that case, Windows assigns itself an APIPA (Automatic Private IP Address) in the 169.254.x.x range.<br />
<br />
The problem could that the computer's network adapter is defective.&nbsp; It could be a bad cable, switch port, or router port.&nbsp; If you have a home router, something could be wrong with it.&nbsp; The router's DHCP server configuration could be bad.<br />

<h3> erleichda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 on HP TouchSmart IQ506 &#61; FAIL</h2>
                    We ran the upgrade assistant on our HP Touchsmart IQ506 and it showed that everything was good to go except for Bluetooth. We don't use the bluetooth so not a huge deal. I had pre-ordered a Windows 8 Box version and picked it up last night. Tried to upgrade
 with the 64 bit disk from inside Vista, that failed. Next, just rebooted using the install disk, that failed with&nbsp;<span>Error 0x80070570. Went into the BIOS and set the SATA from AHCI to IDE. This worked great! No more Error. It allowed the install to go all
 the way through and rebooted to the initial setup, name computer, WiFi etc... only it took 4-5 tries to get all the way through that because the PC screen would just go black and the computer would lock.</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>What it does is the keyboard locks and will not respond, caps lock etc do not work... but if you touch the touchscreen you can hear the feedback clicks like when you normally use the touchscreen in windows... but nothing happens. The machine is locked
 and has to be shutdown and rebooted.<br />
</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Tried reinstalling, formatting C drive etc. On one attempt, I actually made it all the way into Windows 8 and it was working... but a minute or two after when I was just looking in settings it went black and that was it... it hosed something because
 then the PC would boot to a giant emoticon of a frowny face with a message that Windows can't boot etc. It would reboot, attempt repair but say that it can not be repaired.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Tried turning off sound,&nbsp;</span><span>IEEE&nbsp;</span><em>1394 and LAN in BIOS but nothing provided a stable Windows. Tried installing the 32bit disk, same thing.</em></div>
<div><em><br />
</em></div>
<div><span>The whole time I was not too worried either because HP has a recovery partition and all I had to do was hit F11 when I got tired of trying to get Window 8 installed. Well, Windows 8 hosed that too... pressing F11 does nothing now. The partition is
 still there, but F11 is not able to access it.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Ordering the HP recovery disks from HP for $16 and downloading Ubuntu to use until the HP Vista recovery disks come.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Luckily this HP is just a general family use computer and all important data was backed up. So not a huge deal.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>If there is a simple solution, would love to hear it, but not holding my breathe.</div>
</div>

UPDATE: Fedora to the rescue!! Installed the latest Fedora and it found the HP Vista recovery partition and made it a bootable option in GRUB. I am loving Fedora for now, but if we want to go back to the original Vista, we can always boot back into the recovery
 partition now! Fedora just save me $16.... but I am still stuck with a $40 Windows 8 that is useless.</td>

<p><br />
c) Click on ‘Repair your computer’ and select ‘Troubleshoot’. </p>
<p><br />
d) Click on ‘Advanced options’ and select ‘Automatic Repair’ and select the operating system.</p>
<p>Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be happy to help.</p>

            <div>Sometimes after a full install, and it failed at trying to get the computer name, wifi etc... it would go into the automatic repair itself. That would run for a while and then gave a message that the repair failed and to do just what you suggested. The
 repair would never work. A couple times it would go into a boot-reboot loop, I would stop the machine and insert the install disk and try the repair as you suggested. It never worked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The best luck I had was just doing another fresh install and hoping I could get to the desktop before that black screen locked the machine up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The farthest I got was a full install, got networking going and was hoping there was a fix in the update... but on my way to the update section through settings, the OS was hosed by the black screen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is odd is that the OS just didn't lock up... it hosed the the whole OS and damaged critical files... after the lock up and a reboot you would not be able to get past the repair section.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The machine hardware is not damaged either, ran checks on the disk and other hardware and everything worked well in Vista and is now running perfectly with Fedora 17. So, at least we have it working for now and can go online and play music. But would love
 to get Windows 8 on this system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>if you need any more hardware details for this machine, let me know.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I really appreciate you taking the time to reply!</div>

            <p>IQ506 &amp; Windows 8, </p>
<p>After the release date&nbsp;I couldn't wait to install win8. After failing to get windows to install i finally have it running without issues. First&nbsp;few times trying to install it&nbsp;I was opting for fresh install and after getting the black empty non-responsive
 screen an then&nbsp;trying to do repairs and what not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now mind you&nbsp;I had just installed windows 7 on this machine (hdd &amp; dvd crapped out on the original) 2 days prior to installing 8 and had not gone through all of the drivers on hp website because they do not
 offer a complete driver package there. HP expects the customer to use a&nbsp;"factory image repair disk" to fresh install (an this machine was originally shipped with Vista (Ughh!) and a boat load of HP bloat). Anyways back to the issue at hand, so after failing
 at multiple attempts to install Win 8 I went back to just trying to get a solid reliable&nbsp;OS environment&nbsp;with Win 7.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I got all of the missing drivers&nbsp;I could get from HP and installed them according to the list in win 7 64 drivers and noticed that&nbsp;I had
 to have vista to upgrade the bios and gpu fw. So without doing the gpu FW and bios I then went to MS update an installed the other missing drivers and had no more yellow devices (missing drivers). But in windows System&nbsp;Info screen under touch it was only single
 touch and couldnt get the touch pack for win 7 to install. So after a lot more web searches and such I found a post about getting dual touch to work on the (IQ506)touch screen by going to NextWindow (<a href="http://www.nextwindow.com/nextwindow_support/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nextwindow.com/nextwindow_support/downloads.html</a>)&nbsp;and
 picking up the driver for windows 7. While searching&nbsp;I found the driver for windows 8 and decided to download it while&nbsp;I was there and just keep it incase the issue with the installation would be addressed by MS or HP. After Sucessfully running under 7 for
 a couple of weeks I decided to give it another shot (win8 install that is) And just opted for the Upgrade keep files and apps. To my enjoyment the install was uninterrupted (NO F8 +shift or other methods mentioned on other posts) and i booted into win 8 for
 the first time. After snooping around i noticed that the single touch driver came back so I went back to my driver folder and found the nextwindow win 8 driver I had downloaded earlier and installed it. Now i have the dual touch with Win 8 and haven't had
 a single issue yet. I cannot tell you if the issue was related to the touchscreen driver or GPU driver or just windows update changing issued drivers when performing an online assisted upgrade, but I did get it installed and did not experience the b(lack)sod
 that a lot of others are getting. If you are still trying to get win 8 on this pc maybe you should try what&nbsp;I did, it can't hurt and if it does still fail when you keep files and apps it just reverts to win 7 or wvr&nbsp;OS you had prior to the install.&nbsp;Good luck
 with this and btw win 8 on this machine or any touch pc is awesome!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 October Update &#34;Settings&#34; App Doesn&#39;t Open &#40;Crashes&#41;</h2>
                    Ever since the big October update I have been unable to open the settings app because it launches for a few seconds, then crashes. I cant uninstall the update as it doesn't appear in control panel. I can't system restore before the update. I have tried
 every solution I can find including cmd and powershell fixes but nothing works. Is this a known issue? Will it be fixed via an update? Is there anything I can do? I don't want to reinstall windows along with all of my programs. Thanks.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to confirm, did you run the reset.cmd as Administrator? If not, make sure you do by doing a right-click on the reset.cmd and clicking "Run as Administrator."<br />
<br />
Try to do the following to confirm that Command Prompt is checking the right folder (again, the subinacl.exe should be at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\" folder):</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Command Prompt</li><li>Copy and paste the following commands to Command Prompt:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>set ProgramFilesPath=%ProgramFiles(x86)%</li><li>cd "%ProgramFilesPath%\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\"</li><li>dir</li></ul>
<p>The last command will show you the files in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\" folder. Try to check the list if you can see subinacl.exe.<br />
<br />
If you can see subinacl.exe on the list, then let's modify the code for your reset.cmd and bypass the conditional statement for checking if the file exists.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb85707e-b6e2-4ff5-b042-82affc23e194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb85707e-b6e2-4ff5-b042-82affc23e194" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As shown above, we need to remove the part inside the red box from your reset.cmd. Then, replace it with the line "goto filesExist" to bypass the file checking (as we have already manually checked the existence of the said file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should look like this instead:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5809660d-c5c9-4255-b4e0-9200debcc683" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5809660d-c5c9-4255-b4e0-9200debcc683" /></a></p>
<p>Try to run the modified reset.cmd and see if it works. If ever you still encounter an error when running the command, then I suggest posting your query at our
<strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet forums</a></strong> for advanced technical assistance regarding your concern.</p>

    <title>Mouse focus relocating &#40;Not jumping erratically...&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael.wr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse focus relocating  &#40;Not jumping erratically...&#41;</h2>
                    My issue with mouse motion is NOT similar to many I've read so far, mine simply changes 'focus'.&nbsp; It does not click on anything, just changes position.&nbsp; The position it changes to is usually, though not always, the 'Task Bar'.&nbsp; It relocates to various
 icons located within the task bar.&nbsp; Occasionally it relocates to some other desktop icon.&nbsp; No other action is taken, and I still have control over it, I just have to reposition it and continue what I was doing.&nbsp; It does NOT jump around erratically, it appears
 to be very specific in it's reposition.&nbsp; A very few times, it relocated while I was moving a window, this causes the entire window to move, this action is very startling to see.
<br />
Any thoughts would be VERY helpful~!&nbsp; Thanks...<br />
~Michael

<h2>            Delay Windows 10 at Boot</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are testing some Windows 10 upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we would like to do is have Windows 10 delay it boot sequence for about 60 seconds. The reason is that the workstations has SSD's drives and it boot so quickly that when the user logs in, it does not map any GPO network drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set the delay boot time to 60 seconds in advanced system settings in Windows 10 and I have also set the delay boot options in VMware to 60 seconds also. The test Windows 10 machines are VM's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be looking to assign this through Group Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea of how this can be done or know of s script that can be assigned within Group Policy</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>I'm getting this error message ''error 0x8001071a'' when trying to turn on Windows Defender on Windows Vista.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you are using Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>
<p>It is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Using the two Programs at the same time can cause System conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not using one of the above AntiVirus Programs, this Information from
<strong><em>David O - Support Engineer</em></strong>&nbsp;shows you how to&nbsp;manually enable&nbsp;Windows Defende (<strong><em>disregard Uninstall Information; not possible in Vista</em></strong>):</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-security/how-do-i-manually-start-windows-defender-in-vista/dab845b2-9ba5-47f3-9518-c4c6781e7d5b">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-security/how-do-i-manually-start-windows-defender-in-vista/dab845b2-9ba5-47f3-9518-c4c6781e7d5b</a></p>
<p><span>"Go to Start, <strong>Control Panel</strong>, <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>,
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Services</strong>. Locate Windows Defender.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Right click and select <strong>Properties</strong> and ensure that the Start-Up Type is
<strong>Automatic. </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once changed, click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Exit and Restart your computer. Check back taking the same route to confirm Windows Defender has started"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>If you wish to have extra protection against&nbsp;Malware&nbsp;use the FREE version of Malwarebytes AntiMalware:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a></p>

<p>And to now&nbsp;change Startup Programs in Vista without using Defender, use either of these Methods:</p>

            <p>I think the question was not how to uninstall the app, but to how to completely remove it from the list of "your apps". Even after uninstalling an app that you no longer want there doesn't appear to be any way to forget about it forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes the "your apps" list not very useful when setting up a new PC, since it is full of free trial apps that you downloaded once and uninstalled instead of the apps you actually care about. It also makes it a sort of app history you can't ever delete.</p>

            <p>Perhaps both of you need to provide an example or two of the "apps" you each are referring to.</p>
<p>Reviewing my list of Apps, I see a long list of installed applications (standard desktop programs) from before the Windows 8 upgrade.&nbsp; That's to say, it's showing me in addition to the Windows Store apps, it is showing links to desktop applications as well.</p>

            <p>For example when I first set up my system I tried finding a good twitter and facebook app, so I've installed Tweetro, FlipToast, MetroTwit, and Trendz. They are all free so they all appear as "purchased" but not installed. After evaluating the apps and deciding
 which one I best served my needs, I&nbsp;uninstalled all but one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to make the others&nbsp;disappear from that history so when I set up a new PC I know which apps I actually care to restore, and not ones that I just evaluated for a few minutes and uninstalled.</p>

The best example would be to open the Microsoft Store app; then swipe from the top edge or right-click anywhere with a mouse, and select "Your Apps" on the green bar that appears.  In the dropdown box on the "Your apps" screen, if you select either "Apps not installed on this PC" or "All apps", then the list is polluted with apps that I just don't ever want and were uninstalled.. Yet there they are, forever? 



Because of this, if you ever wanted to temporarily uninstall an app; or if you are trying to sync apps between two computers, you have to wade through the list of **** to find the apps you actually care about.  This list of apps will grow to an unmanageable size as time goes on. 



I hope that better clarifies the issue.

            <p>OK.&nbsp; Good detail.</p>
<p>But I am in the Store app.&nbsp;&nbsp; and all I am interested in is what is actually on my system at this time.</p>
<p>In the Your Apps</p>
<p>I use the drop down list to select <strong>Apps installed on&nbsp; _ _ _(</strong>my pc)</p>
<p>and all I see are ones installed since my upgrade installation.&nbsp; 15 in all</p>
<p>the default standard&nbsp;ones.&nbsp; Starting with Bing and down to Weather.</p>

<p>All apps shows the same 15.</p>

            This basically means you haven't yet "purchased" an app from the store, then uninstalled it on your PC.&nbsp; When you do, your "All Apps" list and "Apps not installed on this PC" will be cluttered with the app you uninstalled; and I can't find a way to remove
 it for good.

            This is very annoying. I have some old demo apps from the W8 preview and I can't get rid of them. There's an old version of Cut the rope installed on 3/2/2012, that says "Not Available". Then there is also a Carmen Sandiego game installed on 3/4/2012 that
 won't run at all. When I go to the "Your Apps" screen, I only want apps that I might actually install, displayed. Even Apple lets you do this with iTunes. Or is Microsoft afraid that Apple will sue them for patent infringement?
<div><br />
<div>There needs to be another icon in addition to "Install" and "View Details" at the bottom of the "Your Apps" screen that allows you to delete the app, not just uninstall it.</div>

            I agree completely. &nbsp;My "your apps" list is slowly filling with apps I tried out, decided I did not like, and uninstalled. &nbsp;There needs to be a way of removing apps from this list. &nbsp;

            The best way to get to grips with file associations in Windows 7 is to go to Control Panel-&gt;Default Programs.

<p>Control Panel -&gt; Default Programs _. Set Associations only allows me to set the program that is opened by default for a given file type. It does not allow me to set or change the program that is opened when a second or third option is selected (e.g., Edit&nbsp;

<br />
http://www.creativelement.com/powertools/<br />
<br />
One of its many tools is a File Type Doctor that allows editing all the associations, as in XP and earlier/<br />
<br />
It's not necessary to enable its right-click menu; you can launch File Type Doctor one-time.

            Are you missing the old style "File Types" dialog that used to let you set this stuff? &nbsp;In Windows 7 (and Vista), you'd have to set it manually in the registry. &nbsp;But there's a small program that brings back your familiar functionality. &nbsp; I haven't used
 it myself, but it looks to be pretty awesome. &nbsp;Here's the link: &nbsp;<a href="http://types.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://types.sourceforge.net/</a>

            Thank you for your kind help. When I wrote the first time, I had already tried the basic steps your mentioned. :D I have been troubleshooting computers for friends and family for a long time, and I am a CCleaner fan (one of the first things I install in
 any computer!). Sadly, these had not solved the issue. <br />
<br />
I didn't run the Windows Repair tool. This is a work computer, and because my colleague uses it almost all the time, I didn't have enough time to fiddle with it. Anyway, it had a program called "Advanced Systemcare v.6" that someone had loaded. A scan with
 the program detected and repaired something which resolved the Windows Update fail issue.<br />
<br />
But I shall keep your advice in mind. During the next Patch Tuesday, should the updates fail again, I shall try the Windows Repair tool.
<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

            Did this happen by itself recently, a lot of users are reporting a problem like this . . .
<br />
<br />Your Display Driver might need rolling back . .. Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />First check your Resolution settings: 
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose 'Display Settings' 
<br />Is resolution set to the one marked Recommended 
<br />
<br />If that is not the problem: 
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand Display Devices 
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system

<p><span>but could no longer repair the corruption as it was extensive.

 from answers.microsoft.com and is not build 10.0.10568.0) </p>

<p><span>The following link </span>
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/7808-dism-repair-windows-10-image.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/7808-dism-repair-windows-10-image.html</span></a><span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>suggested that when a “<span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">Windows image becomes unserviceable, you can use the Deployment Imaging and Servicing Management (DISM) tool to update the files and correct the problem”.
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)"><span>Tenforums suggests using the following DISM statements</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)"><span>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)"><span>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)"><span>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</span></span></p>

<p><span>(Note that </span><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">/</span></em><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Online</span></span></em><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></em><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>means

 these three commands did not work as the source files could not be found (see below).</span></span></em></p>

<p>(above image from superuser.com again not build 10.0.10568.0)</p>

<p><span><span>The above shows the feedback from a failed attempt to restorehealth.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(It should be noted that this is not my image version).<span>&nbsp; </span>Error 0x800f081f
<span>means that a file needed by Windows Update is damaged or missing.<span>&nbsp;
<span>means that a file needed by Windows Update is damaged or missing.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>As restorehealth failed another source of the files are needed for the repair.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then downloaded Win10 (version 10.0.10568.0 ) from technet.com.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></span></a><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The downloaded file is an .iso image and as this is on a Windows 10 system that image can be easily mounted.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Right-click image and click mount.<span>&nbsp; </span>See below the DVD Drive F.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1106256a-9889-4f0d-bc78-ee55ba7b7c14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1106256a-9889-4f0d-bc78-ee55ba7b7c14" /></a></p>

<p><span>The files associated with Drive F are:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f495bb6-5300-40d4-9d7e-2c0ae17be817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f495bb6-5300-40d4-9d7e-2c0ae17be817" /></a></p>

<p><span>Open the file sources and scroll to find the Install.esd file copy this file and place in another folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had read that the ESD file could be used as a source so I tried the following:</span></p>

<p><span><span>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth /Source:ESD:F:\sources \Install.esd:1 / limitaccess where F is the drive letter.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The /limitaccess is used to stop DISM using Windows updates as a source for the files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, this did not work so I decided to convert the Install.esd to an Install.wim.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To convert the files several third parties software was tested.<span>&nbsp; </span>
These included ESDtoISO, Pismo File Mount Audit Package and WinReducerESWimConverter.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only the WinReducerESWimConverter from WinReducer.Net worked easily and converted the Install.esd to an Install.wim.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://www.winreducer.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>http://www.winreducer.net</span></span></a><span><span>Initially
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://www.winreducer.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>http://www.winreducer.net</span></span></a><span><span>Initially
 (see below) the three options are off and need to be clicked on and the install.esd is dragged to be in same folder.
</span></span></p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e67348f-7ee8-423d-8f94-52e813e29b13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e67348f-7ee8-423d-8f94-52e813e29b13" /></a></p>

<p><span><span>Once the Wim file was available I made a copy and pasted it in the C drive.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed90fc59-02d0-44c7-98a3-5ff027404b3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed90fc59-02d0-44c7-98a3-5ff027404b3f" /></a></p>

<p><span>Then I used:</span></p>

<p><span>Dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth /Source:WIM:C:\Install.wim:1 /limitaccess</span></p>

<p><span>The component store corruption was repaired.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To check the sfc /scannow was run and it was able to </span></p>

<p><span><span>repair the system files.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

            <p>This post is very much outdated, by&nbsp;almost a year now.&nbsp; As has been documented in hundreds of other places on the Internet, this&nbsp;utility (the DISM tool)
<em>does not</em> work on the current Windows 10 release known as the Creator's Update.&nbsp; The bug remains to this day and will continue to do so until Microsoft chooses to get off their behind and fix the problem so no, this&nbsp;dinosaur solution is a total bust.
 Sorry...</p>

            Is there any indication, from&nbsp;<em>anybody</em> (meaning you, Microsoft) out there as to when this is going to be addressed?&nbsp; There are 1000s if not millions of users who depend on this tool to verify the integrity of their core Windows installation files
 and to have the problem summarily ignored month after month is very poor customer service.&nbsp; Since the cause is known it can't be that big a deal for the coders there at Microsoft to fix it, right?&nbsp; Maybe more pressure from the Technical Community out here
 is what's called for...

<p>I have an external terabyte drive were all of my emails are stored in specific files, would this soft ware enable me to do this?</p>
<p>I would also like to save each email after reading it but it doesn't give me the option.</p>
<p>I wondered if I could revert back to the old email system??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>:)</p>

            <p>You don't need a backup program.&nbsp; The messages are stored under C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Packages\microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\Indexed\LiveComm</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can do a search in Explorer&nbsp;from there for *.eml to find the actual path to the messages.&nbsp; The attachments and images are stored separately from the actual messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use my free ceml program (<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/ceml/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/ceml/</a>) to read directories of eml files and the individual files themselves.</p>

<h2>            Skype name</h2>
                    I was given some random skype name which is a long list of numbers and letters. Honestly I've been trying to change it and have been turned around about 20 times. It's ridiculous and I want to just get rid of it completely but I need it for an interview
 and this is SERIOUSLY terrible.
