<h2>            My wifi device all of a sudden won&#39;t connect to the router</h2>
                    , but the wire will. It was working fine yesterday and today. all of a sudden no connection, won't connect. I tried to use the troubleshooter and it tries to connect, two other computers connect wireless but this one will not. I connect it to a Ethernet
 cable and it works fine. but when I try to use the wireless I get a error and the troubleshooter tells me to reboot the router then the routine spill. I actually downloaded the wifi driver and installed it again also used the Vaio updater to get the driver.
 &nbsp;went to this site as well&nbsp;http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-download.pl?upd_id=7353&amp;mdl=VGNAR670&nbsp;

            I actually found a setting in the Sony software that was keeping it from acquiring a IP address. I have resolved the issue by resetting the software with the accurate information. and I changed the wifi password so I could connect.

    <title>Upgrading from non-genuine win7 to genuine win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markt5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading from non-genuine win7 to genuine win 10</h2>
                    I unfortunately have an old system with non-genuine win7 on it.&nbsp; I just purchased a genuine win 10 to put onto that computer. Unfortunately I cannot get the Media Creation Tool to run past the "What do you want to do?" part. It runs for a short while and
 gives this error code: 0x80040154-0x90016. This happens regardless of whether I just want to upgrade now or make an ISO. Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>Ok. Now I've figured out the problem thanks to you guys. My windows defender will not allow the program access to download. Unfortunately my copy of win 7 has no access to it anymore. Can you help me out on that? The firewall itself is sill there but I cannot
 access it at all. It only shows up with the event logs. I can't even search for it or anything even remotely close. Thanks.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Incorrect Username and Password on Shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petercfr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Incorrect Username and Password on Shutdown</h2>
                    <p>Helping a friend with their PC.&nbsp; We can log into the PC no worries using their Microsoft account and all works fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we try to shutdown the PC the screen goes black for a bit&nbsp;and then comes up with "The user name or password is incorrect. Try again."&nbsp;
 When you click to sign in it sort of shows 2 accounts (see picture).&nbsp; However if you leave that sit and times out, when go back in it just goes to normal log-in screen with the one account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shutdown attempts from this screen do the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought there may be have been a local account in the background but tried looking at those options and can only ever find the one account with Microsoft account details&nbsp; When it puts NAME in the username I've changed that back to the Microsoft email details
 and it logs in fine,&nbsp;but get the same thing shutting down.&nbsp; It will also log in with&nbsp;NAME and the same password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried searching online and through forums but can only find issues with loggin in, or multiple users.&nbsp; Nothing with this issue on shutting down password / username issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also checked the power options and they seem fine, held the power button in to force shutdown and restarted and removed/replaced the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine will restart ok and do updates and restart, just won't shutdown properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have not created a reset password disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
Try running StartUp Repair from a Windows 10 boot disk or USB drive. <br />
That often will work when running from the recovery environment does <br />
not. You can try Option 5 here and run StartUp&nbsp;Repair to see if it helps. <br />
You would need to make a bootable USB or DVD using the Media Creation<br />
Tool.

</p>
<p><br />
You can make a Windows 10 Install disk and try to use it to repair the present<br />
installation. Do not try to do a clean install with it however because if the upgrade<br />
was not fully activated for a few days then the clean install will not activate.<br />
<br />
Make a Windows 10 Disk using the Media Creation Tool - select to install on<br />
another computer and the same version you have now. You can make a USB<br />
or DVD to boot with. Select Troubleshoot - Advanced Options&nbsp; - Automatic<br />
Repair.<br />
<br />
Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool - create media then<br />
boot with it - use method I outlined above.<br />

<p>Same issue here, except that the duplicated account has an ADMIN login default value (still named after me).</p>
<p>Once logged in with the MS account that silly duplicate account that try and fail to login by itself is gone.</p>
<p>Seriously, this is a mess. You'd think that login to your account would be basic feature for the OS. How could they screw that one ?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Barry Wang, Thank you for your interest in my problem. Fortunately I have been able to correct it. In the hope that the action I took to achieve this result could assist any one, I have listed
 the procedure</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>I used. My OS is Windows 10 pro. I Repaired both Visual Studio 2013 and 2015, no result, uninstalled VS’ 2013 then tested VS 2105 , no result,</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>reinstalled VS 2013, </span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>uninstalled 2015, tested
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>still no change. Reloaded VS 2015 still the same errors.</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Repaired</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Windows Phone 8.1 Emulators 2.50 GB and Windows Phone 8.1 Emulators – ENU 2.75GB, no result, uninstalled both WP Emulators, then reinstalled Windows Phone 8.1 Emulators – ENU 2.75GB. this install loaded the requested
 Emulator and a Windows Phone 8.1 Emulators – ENU 250GB even though I did not request the Emulator 2.50 GB. At the end of this reinstall I got a message that all had not been installed, but did not state which elements had not been loaded.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Then I uninstalled Windows Phone 8.1 Emulators – ENU 2.75GB leaving the 250GB in the system, still no good. I then repaired WP Emulator 205GB, I now have access to the emulators on both VS’s.

    <title>perfmon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chinmayn  say:</h3>
<h2>            perfmon</h2>
                    I am trying to write a performance dll for the perfmon. I have completed writing&nbsp; my dll. I have also created a new registry entry for my performance object. I have also checked whether the disable performance counter bit is set or not. In my case the
 disableperformancecounter value is 0 so no problem here. Both the DLL and the Perfmon are 32 bit. The DLL written by me is also getting loaded(Checked by using the process explorer). All the functions in the DLL (Openperformancedata, Collectperformance data)
 &nbsp; are getting called(Checked by using the DebugView). I have also tried to re-load the counter entries.
<br />
<br />
But the counter Object that I am providing through DLL is not getting displayed in the list of DLL. The DLL Code is same as the one on the MSDN website. So i think there is no problem with the code.<br />
<br />
Waiting for a reply.<br />
<br />
Thanks. <br />
<br />
Chinmay<br />

            Hi Ben.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Brink is actually a good game but it's not for everyone. It is best played by a group of people.</p>

<p>But I think Shadowrun is a better choice because it's very cheap and it's awesome. If you got some friends to work with you it's even better.</p>

<h2>            Copy and paste broken after update</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>After recently 2nd Feb 2017 doing a lot of windows updates for the first time in a long time, the copy and paste function does not work now.</p>
<p>And that's why I put off update because they always break things.</p>
<p>Cut and paste works fine.</p>
<p>Copy and paste works fine in say note pad but not on files in explorer.</p>
<p>Extracting doesn't work either.</p>
<p>I get the windows explorer stopped working message.</p>
<p>I do not want to restore to an earlier time for lengthy reasons.</p>
<p>I have read as much as I can and KB.. updates which sometimes get a mention are not present.</p>
<p>I have tired various things but none work.</p>
<p>Any way of telling which update did this or any way of fixing ?</p>
<p>Not a computer expert at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>
<p />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>What is your system make and model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the target destination for the paste operation an externally connected USB storage device or a locally installed hard drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you now or have you ever had any software from EgisTec installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some ideas about Explorer crashing during copy/paste operations that might help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e6a2532b-70b2-43f8-94ed-7d30cca20a08" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f36ebc6c-4ff4-40cb-ad92-92bb169053d1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, read this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you have an afflicted Explorer Shell Extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer Extensions make up the list/menu of things you see when you right click something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An afflicted Explorer Shell extension can cause Explorer to crash - especially when using copy/paste and/or drag/drop and often to/from an external USB attached drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several recent incidents involving Acer systems and MyWinLocker from EgisTec (which is already known to include some troublesome Explorer shell extensions) which may have come preinstalled on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if your system is not from Acer it may have MyWinLocker installed and since there have been many reports of it contributing to Explorer crashes it seems a good place to start looking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in your Installed Programs and find MyWinLocker or anything from EgisTec and you don't know what it is or why it is there consider just uninstalling it, rebooting and then see how things work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have determined that MyWinLocker or any other EgisTec programs are involved follow the general purpose instructions below so you will be able to see all the Explorer shell extensions and figure out which one is afflicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using The following program suggestion if you see any extensions from EgisTec, PSD Security Software, eDataSecurity, DragDropProtect (they will be some of the pink extensions) start with those first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of those things are present, continue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when Windows feels
 threatened by a program and Windows will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; Windows should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft (it may be way out on the right side of the screen) to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" and be marked
 in pink since they are not Microsoft extensions, something like this: </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b56d0870-f95a-4aa1-ad0b-faba078d69d3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and&nbsp; letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; windows explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your (right click) failure
 condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.</p>
<p><br />
One user reported that there was a need to restart Explorer after each adjustment so to do that press Ctrl-E from within ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!

            Hi Bala, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />If the app won't accept that you've allowed it in Settings, you could try resetting or repairing the app. Here are instructions to do so:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type "apps &amp; features".
<br />- Select Apps &amp; Features.
<br />- Find the Camera app in the list and select it.
<br />- Click Advanced Options
<br />- Click Reset.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, try the repair option in the same screen. Then try accessing the Camera again.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go, and if it doesn't work I'll see what else we can try! Thanks!

 screen although i know its there because i can click things on the game screen yet i cant see it. &nbsp;So i was looking around the game forums and found out that in order to solve this problem i should change my mouse pointer to the default one from windows. &nbsp;I
 have triyed for 2 days now without any luck. &nbsp;I have triyed this 2 guides posted here on this forum:</span>

</div>
<div>
None of them works. &nbsp;When i change my mouse pointer to the default one it doesnt change at all, the weird thing, is that when i restart the pc, in thoses few secs that it takes to the pc to actually restarts the mouse pointer changes to the default one, once
 it restarts it keeps showing as the default one for 2-5 secs but then it changes back again to the red mouse pointer i have right now...</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
So please if anyone could help me to change my mouse pointer to the default one i would really glad.</div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t turn off password protected sharing windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Here is the path I take to turn off password protected sharing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel -&gt; All Control Panel Items -&gt; Network and Sharing Center -&gt; Advanced Sharing Settings -&gt; Password Protected Sharing</p>
<p>
</p><p>I select the option to turn it off and click save. When I come back to the same setting, the option to turn ON is selected. What other setting(s) could be confusing my 64 Bit, Windows 10 computer and makes it reset it self every single time. Turning off
 the computer and restarting it did not work. The logged in user is set as an administrator and there isn't a guest account that could confuse it.</p>

<h3> minh634  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface pro 4 keyboard not working, no &#39;type cover filter device&#39; win10</h2>
                    <p>It just doesn't light up and the keys and tpad don't work.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When i plug it in and out it registers under 'bluetooth and other devices' as i'm doing it so i'm sure the keyboard works i think it just doesn't have the right drivers.
<br />
When I go onto device manager under keyboards, there's 2 HID keyboard device and no 'type cover filter device' that i'm seeing others have on the forums. there is also no 'unknown device' I've tried turning pc off and on, restarting using vol down+lock key,
 plugging it in and out, reinstalling windows, resetting pc (delete all apps but keep files), installing the drivers listed on the microsoft website (shame they don't have specific driver for type cover only to download). I've also contacted support and they've
 done a remote desktop which they tried most of the above and still no luck, they told me to trade it in but i'm almost sure that the type cover works just the driver. I can't say for certain though because i havent tried it with another surface yet so i dont
 know if it's my pc or the keyboard that has the problem. Please tell me a way to fix this. my warranty has also expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my winver is win10 1903 os build 18362.207 and i believe my latest win cumulative update was KB4501375</p>

<p>The dub glitch is only there 'cause some of the resources are quite limited (such as clay, gold diamond, etc) due to the size of the map and ultimately it has no incidence on the gameplay factor (except for diamond). So, i somewhat disagree with the "cheat"
 calling on the matter, specially if you decide to build something big. You still have to take the time to "dub" then build after all. I do agree that it isn't mined though.

<p>then if its there for that why is it not on the wiki? its a cheat and not part of the game,and im sure if anyone cheats here what stops them from useing cheats in other games &lt;battlefield ,cod ect&gt; &nbsp;you cheaters can use ant excuse you want to make you sleep
 at night but you still a cheater ,iv played the pc minecraft and to use "creative mode" you need to turn on cheats!!!</p>

<p>That's your opinion on the glitch but please, don't insult other gamers 'cause they use it to build big. It's part of the game, the devs are well aware of it, and they simply won't remove it so players like me can build bigger and more beautiful structures
 instead of making them of only cobblestone and wood. As a side note, some may use the "dub" at every sauce, while others like me only use it to create enough bricks and glowstone to embelish my creations that uses thousands of stacks of resources (i do mine,
 more than most, mind you). Every creation i made so far, whether on the PC or Xbox version, still took me endless hours to do. My last creation, a 120x100 blocks castle (8 stories high + a private housing on top) and landscape (pretty much impossible to do
 without using the "dub"), took me months to do. The "dub" merely helped me gather the ever so rare clay (believe me, you'll have a hard time finding some on the Xbox version) and glowstone, so other players can gather some too while in my world. I never use
 the glitch to accumulate easy resources or gold/diamond (except once, when we tried the "dub" for the first time). I gather most of my resources by hand, mining and digging (i don't use dynamite, even when removing whole mountains) 'cause it's also part of
 the game.</p>
<p>As far as Wikipedia goes, i hope you understand that the site (Wikipedia) doesn't hold every information out there (some information are missing while others are left out on purpose, whatever the purpose is).</p>

<p>For me, one of the biggest qualifier for seeing if a glitch is okay or not is if it's only use is to actively give only one person an easy advantage and it is stupidly easy to activate. This is kinda hard to quantify but item duplication I see it more as
 a time-saving thing, the person still has to actually make the craft in question and some people don't enjoy the mining part of Minecraft. If I cared enough to bother to learn it I would be okay using item duplication to really speed up the construction of
 my golden toilet. Then again, I think I might not because I think I would cheat myself out of part of the experience I want to enjoy.</p>
<p>Food for thought; what DOES qualify for a glitch?</p>

<p>In general, if there's a bug or glitch in the game it's not a "cheat," but it certainly can be considered "cheap." &nbsp;There's a difference.</p>
<p>If you actually modify the games code or do anything that violates the Xbox LIVE Terms of Use (which is, of course, a bannable offence), then that is cheating.</p>

<p>OK, the Duplication Glitch is a cheap glitch for users to use.</p>
<p>But I believe the only reason they have left it alone right now is because Minecraft 360 dosnt have a Creativity mode where you get infinit blocks and build the world the way you want. and honestly almost everyone wants to build big places quickly.</p>
<p>So until the update comes i believe the glitch will be left alone for a bit longer. but after the update i expect the glitch to be patched.</p>

<h3> isaacclarkesnl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recon Idea</h2>
                    
<p>I have an idea for recon:</p>
<p>What if they give the recon class a infrared laser designator for spotting purposes. Only other recons and vehicle operators can see the infrared laser and it can be used for targeting purposes. Say you're doing some recon and you see a tank or a building
 populated with multiple hostiles. Pull out your infrared laser and mark them. That way jets, tanks, and helicopters not in your squad can see that they're there. This can be balanced so people don't run around with lasers because
<i>enemy recons </i>can also see the lasers.</p>
<p>With the addition of jets, this can be an interesting team play factor. It can also boost the amount of recon the recons do, because we all know that class isn't used to it's full potential.</p>

<p>I know what your saying and I sadly have to agree. The recon kit is my favorite kit. It's the ultimate kit when used right, but 90% of the community uses it wrong, so I kinda want it out of BF3. Or maybe add an option to kick players again. Under the kick
 option have "useless sniper" and after a certain number of people vote to kick that player they are kicked from the game.</p>

<p>just eliminate 12x scopes, 'marksman headshot bonuses', and add a nice bright camp fire that pops up &nbsp;that puts out a smoke stream if the player doesn't move after 5 minutes.</p>

<p>I don't have a big problem with having too many snipers usually if I spam smoke in front of them and kill 'em twice they get the idea and change classes. Or I just let them keep killing me until they get booted.</p>

<p>[quote user="IsaacClarkeSNL"]</p>
<p>I have an idea for recon:</p>
<p>What if they give the recon class a infrared laser designator for spotting purposes. Only other recons and vehicle operators can see the infrared laser and it can be used for targeting purposes. Say you're doing some recon and you see a tank or a building
 populated with multiple hostiles. Pull out your infrared laser and mark them. That way jets, tanks, and helicopters not in your squad can see that they're there. This can be balanced so people don't run around with lasers because
<i>enemy recons </i>can also see the lasers.</p>
<p>With the addition of jets, this can be an interesting team play factor. It can also boost the amount of recon the recons do, because we all know that class isn't used to it's full potential.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">This would be an interesting addition instead of having them spam mortar rounds the whole game, And hopefully BF3 has full team chat, not limited to 3 others in your squad. That would improve communications on a team vastly.</span></p>

<p>But you do realize that in order to see the infrared laser beam, you would need night vision goggles right? Get rid of the mortars, 12x scope, marksman points. TBH I think camping by snipers is limited to the consoles but I could be wrong since I haven't
 really played BC2 on the PC since I was at a friends house. I can tell you from experience in BF2 (PC) is that there is rarely any camping by snipers because you an only see so far. I would post a video of how far you can see in BF2 but some mod might delete
 it like the last time I posted something about the choppers</p>

<h2>            Asus T100TA Keyboard keeps disconnecting</h2>
                    I have an ASUS T100TA and the keyboard keeps disconnecting depending on what movements I make with it.&nbsp;I don't want to have to replace it. There has to be some way to stabilise the keyboard so that it's in the right place for the keyboard to work or something!
 Can anyone please help because I can't use the touch screen and USB devices have been experiencing problems thanks to being forcefully ejected by the ROTTEN&nbsp;disconnecting keyboard!

<h2>            windows 10 is a piece of junk&#33; and they take away all your apps including office&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>We woke up to find our laptop hijacked due to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They do not keep your log in so you have to refresh just to get onto your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refreshing means they take away all the apps they do not like supposedly (this is from a 90 minute call to them on their disability line) as the apps may interfere with 10.&nbsp; They are full of rubbish!&nbsp; They took away adobe so we cant read emails and we cant
 reinstall it for some odd reason.&nbsp; They took away xnview that we need for our photos to sell online.&nbsp; They took away our Hoyle card games.&nbsp; They took away sketch up which we use for 3 d printing and the list goes on.&nbsp; The worse part though which we just relaise
 is they took away our office.&nbsp; We have a full version of office as we are mute.&nbsp; We use MS word to communicate and its gone.&nbsp; We use excel from the same full version to get into voter files and we are in the middle of 2 recall campaigns.&nbsp; Office now has to
 be reinstalled to use word and excel and that means finding the key code too which we don't know where it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is all we have discovered so far.&nbsp; They do not care to fix anything. They do not download what they stole from you.&nbsp; Its all on you and they do not tell you this ahead of time. They are also still figuring out the tech issues.&nbsp; You and everyone including
 the disabled community are their guinea pigs and they don't care how many problems they cause either!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The disability people are totally useless and this is not the first time either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest you all go to MAC.&nbsp; Maybe they care about people with diabilites who use their laptop to communicate because MS does not!&nbsp;10 by the way is worse then 8.1 and they have not fixed the nasty start up screen either.</p>

<p>As we have already stated and someone removed.&nbsp; We bought office with the laptop we currently use.&nbsp; MS decided to illegally remove it when they put in 10.&nbsp; Do you really think that's right?&nbsp; This is what we use to communicate and also excel due to voter
 files and its gone and if we don't find the old key code; we have lost our office and this is a very pricy program for someone who is low income</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have nothing useful to contribute to this discussion so that others know what 10 does to their laptop so they can decide for themselves if they want it; we suggest you post elsewhere and remove your post from here!</p>

Actually there is quite a bit of helpful information in his post. I don't know about you, but myself being low income, I save every product key and install disc for ALL applications and software I buy. &nbsp;Product keys I keep on a flash drive and handwritten in
 my desk. &nbsp;If you think ahead of time then you avoid issues. &nbsp;And unless your running Windows XP, then Microsoft Office has to be purchased minimum once a year. &nbsp;Just FYI.

    <title>SSD TRIM without AHCI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bphill561  say:</h3>
<h2>            SSD TRIM without AHCI</h2>
                    
<p>I am using a SSD (has TRIM supported firmware)&nbsp;with a 780i nforce board that does not support AHCI in the bios, and hence no TRIM support.&nbsp; I have read on other forums that people have gotten around this problem by changing the Storage controller drivers
 for the SATA controller (third party driver) to the microsoft "Standard Dual Channel PCI IDE Controller" driver (which also increases performance).&nbsp; When I try to do a manual driver update by selecting the options "Browse my computer for the driver software",
 "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer", and clicking off the show compatible hardware, I cannot find the generic driver I am looking for (some find it listed, others do not).&nbsp; I understand this is not the proper driver for the device and
 may not be recommended, but how can I manually change the driver.</p>
<p>If you have any other ideas on how to enable trim support without AHCI, that would be just as useful.</p>

Exact same problem. Using a intel 80gb x25-m sata solid state drive. I have a dell xps 600 system with a nvidia nforce4 sli intel edition mb. A11 bios. Windows currently "sees" ssd as a scsi device. Same with the 80gb raptor and other 250gb maxtor drive.

Same problem. Nvidia Nforce 520LE chipset motherboard. I guess lot of people around the world suffering because of this problem. Appreciate any solution otherwise should change Intel to OCZ :)

Hi Chris, thanks for your attention. You know I need fast and effective solution rather than some new threads creating LOL That is why I just bought new motherboard with apparent AHCI support. Now it's OK with my ssd. I do not believe Intel would make some
 efforts to solve the problem :(((
