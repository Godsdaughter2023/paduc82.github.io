    <title>OneNote 2016 Email Page feature fails with Outlook Store App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cie_  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2016 Email Page feature fails with Outlook Store App</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 10 64bits and I have activated the pre-installed Office Suite Store Apps : Word, Excel, Outlook (set as default mail client) and OneNote for Windows 10.&nbsp; All these apps work fine on their own.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to use OneNote for Windows 10 because the Email Page feature is very limited and doesn't work for me besides OneNote 2016 is much nicer and renders pages on email much better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've installed and activated OneNote 2016 32bit but when I use the Email Page feature it doesn't connect to my Outlook Store App. It fails with this standard error : 'OneNote couldn't send the email.&nbsp; This might be due to a network problem, an incorrectly
 configured default email program, or an Office installation problem.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some stage I had Outlook 2016 32 bit and Outlook Store App installed at the same time (took me a while to realise that they were different programs) and OneNote 2016 was able to render the page I wanted to email into Outlook 2016 fine but not with Outlook
 Store App.&nbsp; I tried changing the default mail client but that didn't help.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end I uninstalled Outlook 2016 cause it was having some problems with some VBA macros I have, regarding iCal files, in hope that once I uninstalled one version the other would work with OneNote 2016 thinking there could be some sort of conflict but
 having just Outlook Store App installed still has not fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stuck.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Outlook 2016 seems to connect ok with OneNote 2016 but it's failing to create iCal files with my VBA macros.</p>
<p>Outlook Store App has no problem with the iCal files but doesn't connect to OneNote 2016 to email pages.</p>
<p>OneNote for Windows email features is not good enough for me so I have to use OneNote 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a reason why OneNote 2016 cannot Send the page I want to email to Outlook Store App?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help I'm going mental here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>B.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes. They live in different worlds which cannot talk to each other, by design.</p>
<p>OneNote is part of the&nbsp;old legacy Win32 world (where old white men live ....).</p>
<p>The Outlook Store App is part of the new world of so called UWP apps.</p>
<p>Was this design clever ? I guess not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technically spoken OneNote only talks to <em>MAPI compliant applications</em>, like Outlook, Windows Live Mail or Thunderbird.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input Bernd.</p>
<p>That means that I will have to stick with Outlook 2016 and solve the other problem I have with iCal files since it's the only version that can talk to OneNote 2016.&nbsp; OneNote for Windows 10 is not good enough and still it would only send a copy of page to
 Windows Mail (in which the rendering of the email is awful) or Skype (what the hell?!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I find very annoying and senseless is the fact that if Outlook 2016 and Outlook Store App are soooo different, why is that they have the same looking icon?!&nbsp; This is utterly confusing to work out which one is which and which one you should use.&nbsp; This
 is not the case for OneNote 2016 and OneNote for Windows 10.&nbsp; These have clearly different looking icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, one more time I'll have to uninstall and install stuff in hope things work the way they are supposed to :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>B.</p>

<h2>            Restoring my phone from one MS account to another. Is it possible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a very old Microsoft account that I used to setup my Nokia Lumia 928.</p>
<p>I have been backing up my phone data to that account all along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now want to reset my phone so that I can use my main Microsoft account, the one associated with my Office365 subscription. (I want to abandon that old account.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: Will I be able to restore all my contacts and other data from my old Microsoft Account1 to my new Microsoft Account2 after resetting my phone?</p>

            <p>You can reset the phone and set it up using the 365 account.</p>
<p>You can't use the old restore data.</p>
<p>You can export your contacts from the old account to the 365 account at <a href="https://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://people.live.com</a>.</p>
<p>Export old account contacts to your PC - &nbsp;Sign in using the old account, manage at the top, export for outlook. This will download a csv file to your PC.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Import the contacts to 365 account. Sign in with the 365 account. Use Import in the middle of the page to import the csv file of your contacts&nbsp;to the 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can retrieve files from the old account OneDrive to the phone by adding another account to the onedrive app on the phone.</p>
<p>Any other data you want - connect phone to PC and get data you want before resetting it, documents, photos, videos or music.. Get any data before you reset the phone</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 insider preview problem with Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Just upgrade my Surface Pro 3 to Windows 10 Insider preview and face some problems.</p>
<p>First, Surface app crashes every time to try to launch it. Now I can't use it turn on/off the Windows button. Reinstalling from Store(Beta) doesn't fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the second problem happened after upgrading to 10130, pen top button now doesn't launch OneNote. One click does nothing, and double-click just take the screenshot and OneNote won't launch at all. The pen top button works fine on 10122 but it stop working
 after I upgrade to 10130.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And one last question, will the OneNote app update when it hit RTM? Current OneNote app is really worse than Windows 8.1 version when I use the pen. No radial menu, can't change ink and highlighter thickness, fewer ink colors. Please return these feature
 when you update&nbsp;the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I have a Surface Pro 3 - love the the hardware, onenote, pen and that is about it.&nbsp; If Apple released a product using a pen, I would jump the SP3 ship.&nbsp; Why? Because of troubleshooting answers like
<strong>Sfc /scannow</strong> solutions.&nbsp; Unless you are an extremely avid user of windows you would never think to do that!&nbsp; Windows 10 seems to be going in the right direction - but MS needs to make the OS invisible so troubleshooting is simple, in a GUI
 (not some step-by-step procedures of commands) and you shouldn't need a 3rd party repair tool (most are scams anyway).&nbsp; With a streamline product like the SP3 I want to work in a reliable environment without geeking out on the OS to fix an annoying issue.&nbsp;

Yes, if you moved the .one files manually to Skydrive (like Excel files).
<div><br />
<div>To be accessible by the Web App (and other clients) Onenote notebooks must have been created ON Skydrive or moved to Skydrive by using the
<b>Onenote desktop client </b>(reason: other format).</div>

<h2>            How to add a product or apps to microsoft&#63; i have a great idea. &#35;million_dollar</h2>
                    <br />
Be a Part of the Difference.<br />
my ideas are based and associated with change and upheaval.<br />
If this sounds like you …<br />
<br />
I would &nbsp;like to make a real, practical environmental and economic difference in this world through Microsoft.<br />
If You’re ready to plug microsoft's best feautures into to a regional, national or global network<br />
You’ve come to the right place for the long last difference that can change the meaning of life by technology.<br />
<br />
Today, We are here for scaling the great ideas,then why we don't think about to a new generation of internet?<br />
<br />
You, You,, and you ......Ah..!! Everyone could be the part of this change.&nbsp;<br />
iF you think technology makes our life easier then, it's true and applicable from start to the end of the life.<br />
<br />
Extract your life through technology, do what makes you worthful.<br />
Feel yourself (including everyone) to being on this earth for a reason.<br />
<br />
Your dream, your work, your feelings,your lifestyle, your business&nbsp;<br />
and even your last few days of your life can be so much easier and beautiful by products &amp; services of microsoft after by applying my ideas.<br />
<br />
SET THE WHOLE PROCESS of present products &amp; services AGAIN IN A brand-new WAY for people to find and join the microsoft.<br />
as i analyzed we should always try to save ENERGY,POWER,TIME &amp; MONEY.<br />
<br />
and we can do it easily with apple.<br />
<br />
AS example : we use bing search engine. it is a service by microsoft, by this product we save ENERGY,POWER,TIME &amp; MONEY.<br />
We should hit a kickstart toward the derivation of the future &amp; technology and we should have to believe in microsoft and their presence.<br />
<br />
I expect My idea will be retreated and supported by microsoft's experts.<br />
<br />
my idea is all about life toward live life easy and happily using appliances of technology.<br />

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>iTunes can be installed easily on Windows 10 preview builds. But there was a time when iTunes was not installing ( in my case it was not upgrading to a newer build ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then this problem disappeared. So I suggest you download iTunes again.</p>

<h2>            Right Click not working in Windows 10 for Excel 2010 only</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 upgraded from Windows 7. Office 2010 was already in Windows 7. Now, the right click for Excel 2010 and only Excel 2010 won't work. Not in the Start Menu, or in the task bar to access recent files. Right click on it and nothing happens.</p>
<p>So, I can't use the start menu to pin and unpin it. All other programs working fine with the right click, including Word 2010.</p>
<p>I created a shortcut on the desktop to excel.exe, and I can right click on that to unpin and pin it to the takbar. But I still can't access my recent files by right clicking.</p>
<p>It's been going on for a few weeks. Restarting explorer doesnt' work. Updating and restarting makes no difference.</p>

<p><span><span>To do that, close Excel. Let us type in ‘Run’ in the search bar next to start button, click on the 'run' icon that appears – in the 'Run window' type in Excel /safe and hit ok. (Note:
 There is a space between Excel and /).<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</span></p>
<p><span>Click the File tab. </span>

            Thanks for the reply, but the problem is not Excel. Excel works perfectly. It's the taskbar and start menu right click from Windows to get into Excel (via recent files) that isn't working.

    <title>Counting entries in access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jea1179  say:</h3>
<h2>            Counting entries in access</h2>
                    <p>I have set up a databse for our Chaplains and have been asked to modify it so that regardless of the number of services an inmate receives during the course of a month, he will only be counted once.&nbsp; Example: 11/1/12 he receives a Bible.&nbsp; 11/6/12 he receives
 spiritual counseling. 11/15/12 he receives something else.&nbsp; During the month he has received 3 items.&nbsp; What I want to be able to do is, even though he's received 3 services, I only want to count him once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What will be the best way to do this and how can I set up a report that reflects this data in a Fiscal Year style report?&nbsp; The unique identifier will be the inmate booking number but this data is not necessary in the report.&nbsp; I have created a crosstab query
 but the information in that query is misleading because an inmate that received a Bible, SC or something else will be counted in each of those categories defeating the purpose...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this makes some kind of sense to someone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for any help...&nbsp;</p>

That's exactly what the query I posted should do.&nbsp; It's a standard technique.&nbsp; Post back the details of the table structures you have, and the SQL of the query you've tried.<br />

<h2>            Asha 210 time not working</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, if got my asha 210 2 years ago and it worked pretty fine.</p>
<p>6 months ago i left for traveling and left my phone switched off back home.</p>
<p>when i came back i couldnt get it to proper running anymore.</p>
<p>it always asks me to set the date and time, as i do, but when i checked the time on it i realized it is not running, i mean the minures are not changing at all, so the time will always be wrong.</p>
<p>i made a software update and a factory reset and still the same problem.</p>
<p>some may say the time is not that important, but to open any internet requierd application, like facebook, whatsapp or browser it asks me to set the date and time first and when i do those programes fail to work with for example in the browser an error message
 that i may need to set date and time right,.</p>
<p>i also tried to set time on autmaically and that also didnt work, then there is simple no time at all.</p>
<p>what can i do ?</p>

<h2>            Syncing with Vista SP1</h2>
                    Is anyone else having problems syncing since the upgrade to Vista SP1? I have a Sprint Touch running WM6, and have never had problems syncing it with my desktop. Since I upgraded to SP1, with nothing changed on the phone, it takes up to 3 hours to sync
 and even then WMDC crashes about half the time. This is not for a new sync, which I understand can take some time. This is just syncing an occasional added appointment or phone number. And I never sync anything from WMP, so that's not the hangup either. Any
 ideas?<br />

            Everything is working great again - I uninstalled WMDC, did a full registry scan with Windows Live Safety Scanner, reinstalled WMDC and everything is now back to normal. There must have been some kind of registry glitch (and unfortunately there's no way
 to tell what it was) but this is a pretty painless fix, and would be worth a try if anyone else is having the same problems. Thanks everyone for your help! - sheureka

<h3> eschelar&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Atrocious connectivity</h2>
                    <p>I posted this earlier and got nothing useful. I can see many instances of "known issue, but fully resolved" on heartbeat.skype.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet here I am with dozens of messages unsent, all my contacts showing offline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm system administrator for dozens of computers in our company. For the past several weeks, we keep having connectivity problems. Skype keeps going into the "revolving arrows" connectivity state, then I am showing as "online", but&nbsp;all contacts show as offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've dealt with this so many times today. Nothing is working. Updating did not fix it - made it worse if anything... Uninstalling and re-installing helped after 10 minutes of waiting around, but appears to be a non-permanent solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running out of patience. The company owner is ready to move on as well. If we can find something better, we definitely will.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We will NOT accept this as pushing towards Skype for business. Why would we use Skype for business if you can't even keep us up and running with Regular Skype which has worked for a decade.</p>

<p>Seems like this issue has come to a head today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet, absolutely no evidence from anywhere that Skype is even aware there's a problem. There's no real support and there's nobody actually watching the forums. It's like there's a fire down at HQ and nobody's actually there, so nobody is there to ring the
 alarm bell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted this on FB and within 10 minutes, I've got 20 replies, people messaging me on LINE (yeah, LINE... ridiculous!) telling me that they are having the same problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
These are SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS HERE. So far, this is affecting dozens of computers here, at least another 200 computers in Taiwan, another 100 computers in India, 30 in GB, 20 more in Spain. Sustained issues lasting hours!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And none of them have any idea how to inform Skype effectively that there is a WIDESPREAD PROBLEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that's just what I've heard about in the last 10 minutes!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just one guy and yet in 20 minutes, I was able to determine that this is a sweeping problem that affects multiple countries and hundreds, probably thousands of computers. I've seen more than 10 threads reporting this exact same problem. Not one single
 response. There's one from almost two weeks ago that's untouched and people begging for a response. Nothing for more than 10 days. My own original thread is weeks old and has no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can Skype/Microsoft genuinely have not even a single person watching the forums for problems like this? How much does it actually take to get even one or two guys to watch their forums. I was able to go back and review 30-50 threads over the past two
 weeks in around 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made some "feedback" comments. Of course Skype won't give me extra weight because I'm a sysadmin making comments in behalf of 40+ computers over 3 different office locations, it just sees my feedback as a single instance.<br />
<br />
Ridiculous. Runaway train wreck.</p>

<p>Sorry I didn't check my work computer over the weekend.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you want in terms of screenshots. I described the behavior. The screenshot won't give you anymore information than that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem has been occurring for our company on many computers. Usually, it just shows everyone offline. This problem is not network related because other users nearby in the same network are not affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long delays before messages are sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, there are multiple times through the day where Skype gives "online notification spam". It thinks that it has been connected to the network just fine, but everyone else is offline, then suddenly, everyone goes online and it thinks it should
 notify the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is intermittent, so it's really difficult to know what exactly you need with a screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computers in our office are all Win7 64. Skype is up to date.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since there is no actual reason for anyone to use Skype for Business, I use regular Skype. I've been using Skype since its inception. Never needed "Skype for Business".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company maintains dozens of accounts, some of which pay for credit. Again, no need for Skype for Business. The only 2 people I've encountered that uses Skype for Business don't actually use it because for one of them, it didn't work at all and for the
 other, the person was just too stupid to handle account ID's and passwords. Not your fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem cleared itself for about a week with no further action from my part on this computer. Most of the users in our company also reported that it cleared up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Started happening again Friday afternoon last week around 1:30pm for me. Intermittent problems of messages getting "held" in "unsent" status during the middle of a conversation, sometimes upwards of 6 minutes. I had to have half of my conversation in FB
 messenger. Considering I harbour a great deal of hate towards FB messenger, it's really saying something that I turned to it as a superior option to Skype, which I have relied upon for many years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So whatever the problem is, my assessment earlier that this is a systemic problem related to some change in the Skype program that happened in the past few months is probably correct and your coders keep trying to fix it, but they don't actually know. At
 this point, you'd have to work pretty hard to convince me that this problem is related to the client program on this computer. Especially since virtually every computer in this office runs the same hardware/software/OS and I've only done a few meager adjustments
 to my system to solve this problem, with the exact same results of other computers which did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was my guess, it's probably related to the relatively newer "cloud based" structure of Skype chat history. It might even be related to "merged" or "trickle-down" code from the ill-advised "Skype for Business".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all honesty, my confidence in Skype as an organization is probably around 20% compared to over 90% from just 6 months ago. Every change that I've seen happen with Skype in the past 6 months has been a deterioration - right from the annoying UX changes
 in the app, to the idiotic "app version" for Win10 (which I uninstalled Day1 and have spent far too much time removing from other people's computers remotely because it doesn't work as well as the normal desktop version), to the insane removal of the local
 time for the end user which was displayed in a convenient place, then removed, then replaced, then removed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why or who is trying to destroy Skype, but they are doing a damn good job of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I don't particularly like Line, it is with great disappointment that Line is becoming commonplace here and I now have no choice but to support its presence on basically every computer in my network. It's not a replacement for Skype just yet,
 but with every step "forwards", Skype seems to just be pushing Line to a stronger and stronger position in the marketplace.</p>

<p>Hi Eschelar,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification. We understand that you’re using the normal Skype instead the Skype for Business. This thread was moved from the Skype category as the engineer thought you’re using Skype for Business.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better assist you, we have moved the threawd back to the Skype category.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Brook &nbsp;</p>

<p>Why would an engineer be wasting his time moving my thread around from one thread to another for absolutely no reason, with absolutely no potential to help the actual problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clearly stated in the original message that I am opposed to the very concept of Skype for Business. Why would anyone think this has anything to do with Skype for Business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a core lapse of functionality of the messenger system which has been unresolved for months. It is behaving better right now, but the problem still shows up intermittently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your engineers can't get basic functionality working, why do they have time to come here and do pointless things for no reason without reading or asking questions or engaging in conversation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this what is wrong with MS/Skype?</p>

<p>Same Problem here too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>﻿<span>I recently bought Nokia C2-01. My phone works well when i connect it to pc via bluetooth but when i connect it via usb cable it shows-" Nokia C2-01 connected in non compatible mode" even though i select PC suite mode in my device/phone. Windows recognises
 it as Portable device named- "NOKIA" when i connect it via usb.<br />
</span><span>I have windows 7 os installed and trying to connect this phone trough nokia ovi suite.. I think it's a big issue and Nokia should pay attention to it and provide solution to C2-01 users as soon as possible</span><font><span>..</span></font>﻿</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can interconnect my PC and phone with USB cable without any problem, however I am not able to paar the two devices by BT.</p>
<p>Every time I try to find the phone with the PC, Nokia PC Suit gives a code (of course I could change it, but it is not the question) and try to paar the phone.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the phone gives an other code (a six number long) and ask wether it is good on the other device.</p>
<p>So the codes not match each other, and I am not allowed on either devices to give the code given by the other...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think, there should be a trivial solution, but I can not find it since half an our yet...</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have a W8 based laptop, a Nokia C2-01 and Nokia PC Suit 7.1.180.94</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Please!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I have the exact same problem as mentioned above. The notebook I am trying to sync has &gt;25 sections, each with many individual pages. Some of the sections will sync, but most of them will not. On the sync status page it lists many of the sections with the
 error "OneNote cannot sync this notebook because the network is disconnected or the network location is not available. (Error code: 0xE4010645)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me this is an issue because I am trying to switch over to OneNote 2013, but if I can't get the sections to sync, then I can't get them into OneNote 2013. This notebook represents essentially notes from school that I need to reference every day, so I
 am quite stymied and do not want to risk losing them when OneNote 2010 is no longer compatible with my OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is another way to transfer the notebooks to OneNote 2013 I would be happy to hear it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sarah</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. The notebooks are not very large. Each one only being about 3 to 4 sections, they do however contain some PDF's and images. Other notebooks I have are syncing fine but tend to have 10-12 sections with only text and occasionally
 screen shots. I have recently reduced the size of a few of the problem notebooks in hopes that they will sync more easily, they still will not sync but the error message has changed to "We're sorry, something went wrong during sync. We'll try again later.
 (Error code: 0xE4020061)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion on this issue would be appreciated!</p>

            <p>Finally fix my error code 0xE401065.</p>
<p>I am using Onenote 2013 on my desktop, my Samsung note 4 and Surface Pro 2 without problem.</p>
<p>Bought a Surface Pro3 last month which comes with Onenote 2016. Keep giving me error and can't sync. Did many searches and here is what I did to make it work.</p>
<p>First I unistall the 2016 Onenote app (do a google search on how), then erase the onenote cache. Install a copy of Onenote 2010 (don't have 2013) That's still not enough to make it work. 2 of my pages has pictures and pdf which are 12 and 14 MB in size.
 I delete those 2 files and it Sync within 5 mins. I don't know the threshold of the file size though.</p>
<p>PS. Onenote 2016 sucks, doesn't has as many features as 2013 and 2010.</p>
<p>Hope this help</p>

<p>I learned the hard way that you cannot have one version at home and another somewhere else and expect them to sync. I have had continual problems with OneNote 2010, 2013, and 2016 on my Pro3.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the 2016 version sucking, I thought so too until I realized I needed the desktop version not the app version. I had to delete the app version and make sure it never popped up, then install the desktop version which works the same as 2013.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found that if you have Windows 10 on one computer and Windows 8.1 on another, they wont sync even if your OneNote is the same. I also found that Windows 10 does not work with OneNote 2013 (at least it didn't on mine) on a Surface Pro3. I have been
 told that I can upgrade to Windows 10 now that I have OneNote 2016 but I'm too scared.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I find all these problems out about 10 days before finals or one week into school starting which really sucks when you are in a doctorate program!
</p>
<p>And, I too am having trouble syncing....again. </p>

    <title>History does not work in IE 11. Is there any fix for it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewpavelyev  say:</h3>
<h2>            History does not work in IE 11. Is there any fix for it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Several days ago I upgraded IE 10 to IE 11 on two computers - Windows 7 Home 64-bit and Windows 7 Pro 64-bit (the latter is just two months old). And I have already noticed the same annoying&nbsp;behavior on both computers. When I browse, say, cnn.com (as well
 as other websites), all the links that I click on are correctly shown as read in the browser (they change color). So clearly IE records those URLs somewhere.&nbsp;However only a small fraction of those links are actually displayed in the History tab. The fact that
 this happens on two computers suggests that this is an issue with the&nbsp;Internet Explorer itself rather than any local issue.</p>
<p>Does anybody know a fix? Does Microsoft ever&nbsp;plan to fix it? I remember there was a somewhat similar issue with IE 9. Internet history was stored in a file that could only grow up to certain size, and after that the history would no longer be recorded (I
 have already checked, and IE 11 does not have that file). Microsoft never bothered to fix that well known issue. I gave IE 9 a try two or three times and had to roll back to IE 8 each and every time. Should I go back to IE 10 (that I never had any problem
 with) and just wait for IE 12 to be released? If Microsoft now&nbsp;considers odd numbered versions of IE&nbsp;merely beta versions while only even numbered versions are "real", it should just come out and say so.</p>

            <p>Hi Karthik,</p>
<p>Method 1 was not applicable as I never had that option checked on either computer.</p>
<p>I tried Method 2 on one of the computers and also deleted the entire browsing history on the off chance that some file therein got corrupted (although it is unlikely to happen simultaneously on two computers).</p>
<p>The behavior is still present. I went to the&nbsp;CNN site for quick testing and clicked on several unread links. All of them subsequently changed the color in the browser to indicate (correctly) that they have been viewed. But when I looked at the&nbsp;history tab,
 there were just two folders there, Bing (the browser's homepage) and CNN. So far so good, but when I expanded the CNN folder, there were just two URLs there, while I actually clicked on at least six&nbsp;links&nbsp;(and as I have already mentioned, they&nbsp;are all correctly
 shown as viewed).</p>

<p>Hi jlzk,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post and welcome to the forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is not possible to select multiple threads in the messaging view. The same applies to selecting contacts, but it is possible to create a new contacts group which will enable you send all of them an email or a message. You can create new
 groups by selecting <strong>People &gt; + &gt; New group</strong>, after that just add contacts to the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hello,<br />
It is not possible?? The update cant fix this? Coz it is somehow bugging if you have a plenty of messages threads because as we all know it is linked to fb so tendency if someone chat you thru his/her fb it will be directly to your messaging thread right? So
 its hard to delete all of that if the only way is to delete it one by one. :( i hope some future updates can fix this! :)

<p>Thank you for your post and welcome to the forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is not possible to select multiple threads in the messaging view. The same applies to selecting contacts, but it is possible to create a new contacts group which will enable you send all of them an email or a message. You can create new
 groups by selecting <strong>People &gt; + &gt; New group</strong>, after that just add contacts to the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 for Mac - Spam</h2>
                    <p>I think I understand that my programme is not going to be good at avoiding spam but what can I do? &nbsp;Am I wasting my lime blocking emails and moving to junk or is this effective. &nbsp;I have asked my IT man to reconfigure the soap settings at the server but sometimes
 its just ridiculous the amount of spam I receive.</p>

            Hi Suzzon_0714,<br />
<br />
If you are using an Office 365 account, you may try the methods instructed in <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-email-anti-spam-protection-6a601501-a6a8-4559-b2e7-56b59c96a586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-email-anti-spam-protection-6a601501-a6a8-4559-b2e7-56b59c96a586</a> to prevent receiving spam. (The detailed steps should be performed by an admin. You can contact your admin for help if you are not an admin.)<br />
<br />
But if you are using another account (email service, for example, Gmail/Hotmail or Google account, etc), I suggest you contact your admin (Gmail, Hotmail or Google account related) for dedicated help as this forum mainly focuses on Office 365 for Business online
 services. Your understanding is highly appreciated. <br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

            Many toolbars, Add-ons, screensavers, and weather monitoring programs come bundled with other software (often without the knowledge of the user) (often without the knowledge of the user) and can be the source of various issues and problems to include Adware/browser
 hijacking. Even if advised of a toolbar, many folks do not know that it is optional and NOT necessary to install in order to operate the program. Toolbars and Add-ons can usually be removed via Add/Remove Programs or Programs and Features in Vista/Windows
 7, so always check there first.
