            Hi  SSG 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, your attached image is not coming through.
<br />
<br />See if these steps help.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.‚Äù 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

            Hi SSG.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Cannot see your screenshot, please reload it.  
<br />
<br />Does the problem happen in other games or other apps?  If not then first check for Minecraft Update in Microsoft Store Settings (three dots at top right) &gt; Downloads &amp; Updates.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the game at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Minecraft &gt; Advanced Settings.  
<br /> 
<br />If the problem happens elsewhere then:
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />3) If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi SSG
<br />
<br />Let us know when you have completed the steps. 
<br />
<br />Other things you can try...
<br />
<br />First of all, make sure you are running the latest version of Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator/active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Do you have the latest cumulative updates for Windows 10 1803 installed?
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Minecraft
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />download the following utility and use it to remove Minecraft:

                    <p>I get this message when I try to move some picture &nbsp;files in my library or try to send them to a third party to make a movie . I am having a problem on burning DVD DISCS&nbsp; they will not open on my dvd player . They just say bad disc .</p>
<p>IS this dll important and why would it be missing?&nbsp;The computer says to reload it&nbsp; how? When I go online and check it out sites want $35.00 and up.</p>
<p>Surely there must be a place where this can be reloaded without costs. I cannot afford to spend money on a chance this will fix my problem.</p>

            I found the same message as well. Follow these steps, should work.
<div><br />
<div>1. The message in the <b>Action Center</b>&nbsp;automatically took me to Intel's <b>
Download Center</b>. If it doesn't, try this.&nbsp;<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Default.aspx?lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Default.aspx?lang=eng</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>2. Choose <i>Product Family</i> as <b>Wireless Networking</b>, <i>Product Line</i> as
<b>Intel Wi-Fi Products</b>, and select the <i>Product Name</i>.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Note:</b> &nbsp;Find your product name from the <b>Device Manager</b> (i.e. which device of
<b>Intel Centrino</b>&nbsp;you are using). You can also find that from <b>Network and Sharing Center</b> -&gt;
<b>Manage Adapter Settings</b> , and then look for the adapter name.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. See the search results. There should be a file labelled <b>Windows 8.1</b>. Refresh the page once if you don't get it. Select the driver you want to install. Mine says&nbsp;<b>Wireless_16.5.3_e164.exe</b>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I guess that's about it. Let me know if it worked for you.</div>

<h2>            Windows Eight messenger shows facebook messages double</h2>
                    When I use the windows 8 messenger app that is included in metro the messages I send to facebook contacts show double in the messenger. When I check facebook it only shows the messages I send once, however in the app it doesn't. What is the cause of this
 problem and can I solve it or is it a bug that windows has to fix?
<div>I already used the app for quite a while and it only started doing this a few days ago.</div>

I am having this exact same issue. 



I have the Facebook Desktop Messenger app installed on my home PC (which is currently turned off). 


I have a Nokia Lumia 920 (which i have gone 'offline' for facebook chat and the issue is still occuring) 



I really don't know why it's doing this, but it's annoying as **** and is severely impacting my experience with the messaging app, which is other fantastic :/

            <p>Hi <strong>RubenTan</strong>, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was facing the same problem few days back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have created a local account from&nbsp;Charms Bar - Settings - Change PC Settings - Add User - Sign in Without a Microsoft Account - Local Account - Created a Local Account - Filled in the Username and done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that I went to Control Panel - Users - Manage another account - Selected the User I just created and Change Account type - Choose Administrator and change it to Administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Login to the new user account and remove Microsoft Account that you were using before completely. (You will not loose any data)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check for updates and install all the latest updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once removed restart the computer and login to the local account and then go to Charms Bar - Settings - Change PC Settings - Add User - Add your existing Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>Login to the Microsoft Account and try to use Messenger App.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This worked for me. Hope it works for you too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Unfortunately this part is not possible for me. When I go back into messenger it automatically asks for my live account. I signed back in and it wasn't fixed. Are you talking about unlinking the accounts? How would I go about that?</p>

</p>
<p>:( It's really annoying, even though the other side doesn't receive double messages it's still driving me crazy.

<h2>            I deleted the system reserved partition, can&#39;t clean install Win 7 Pro because of error message</h2>
                    <p>So, I tried to install Windows 10 onto a friends older PC (acer aspire 5920g). I bought a brandnew SSD and exchanged it with the HDD, performed a clean install of Win 10 and realized that I should go back to Win 7 after too many things didn't work right.
 So, I formatted the drive (230 GB) and the system reserved partition. (I took the SSD out and put it into an external case which I connected to my own Win 10 PC.)<br />
I didn't know much about this system reserved partition but read that it's not really needed when you intend to perform a clean install of another OS. After formatting this system reserved partition, it said 500GB of unallocated space. I didn't quite understand
 that since the drive is a 240GB Sandisk SSD. I set the other partition (230GB) to the active and primary one with the disk management tool of Win 10.<br />
I put in the Win 7 DVD and changed the bios setting in such a way that it would boot from DVD first. However, the Win 7 setup dialogue doesn't appear at all. Instead DOS is giving me this message: "An operating system wasn't found. Try disconnecting any drives
 that don't contain an operating system. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried different boot orders but didn't get any other outcome. What shall I do next? How can I perform a simple clean install of Win 7 Pro (onto the new SSD)?</p>

            Same problem As OP had, I opened shell prompt, started all disabled services (it was successful ), but after restart nothing changed, probably I did something wrong?

<p>(This is a bit of a ramble, so there's a TL/DR closer to the bottom)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I had a very similar problem that I just resolved.&nbsp; Before I get to how I fixed it, though, let me recount how it happened.&nbsp; Also, before I get going, I should say I've been using Windows for over 20 years, I've been a professional programmer for over
 10, and while I certainly wouldn't claim to know everything about troubleshooting Windows, let's just say I can follow a how-to pretty easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the latest Windows update, I could no longer access my NAS device over SMB.&nbsp; Since the update was so recent, searching for help on Google showed no good leads.&nbsp; So I figured Microsoft Support might be useful, since they should be dealing
 with this sort of thing by now directly.&nbsp; Anyway, using my desktop PC, I start chatting with this one agent, he says "let me remote in, I'll try to fix it".&nbsp; It took him half an hour to do virtually nothing besides what I'd already tried.&nbsp; Remote Assistance
 is more of a pain in the butt than anything.&nbsp; You're both sharing the mouse control, you both have to chat via the chat window, which requires focus to actually use.&nbsp; So I just sit back and bite my tongue.&nbsp; Eventually he starts digging into the services, and
 not just through the standard services.msc window, but also the msconfig window, both open at the same time.&nbsp; While he's typing stuff in the services window, he accidentally switches to the msconfig window and whatever key he hits selects "disable all".&nbsp; I
 see it happening and I think "it's ok, he knows well enough to cancel that."&nbsp; The cursor wanders a little as he's clearly trying to figure out what happened and what to do. Then he hits ok, and as I'm reaching for my mouse to stop him he hits "Restart Now"
 on the new popup window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boom, I'm locked out.&nbsp; The login screen is blank, except for the wallpaper, the power icon, and the internet icon with a big red X on it.&nbsp; No name or password box, no matter which keys I press.&nbsp; I try using the power icon to boot into safe mode (hold shift
 and click restart).&nbsp; Just goes back to login, not safe mode.&nbsp; I Google for some solutions (this thread pops up, but ultimately doesn't solve my problem).&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp; So, since I wanted to scream at someone, I grab my laptop and get back in touch with
 MS Support and give him hell.&nbsp; Well, not him, since I got on with another agent who wasn't to blame for my problems, but I did spend a bit of time venting.&nbsp; He says create a recovery disk.&nbsp; Already did, to no avail.&nbsp; Since it's booting off USB, the local drives
 don't get mounted, and the restore points aren't accessible.&nbsp; Then he says "let me remote in, I'll try to fix it."&nbsp; I politely tell him no way, I have no confidence in MS Support at this point, at least regarding total control of any of my computers.&nbsp; So his
 suggestion was to create a Windows Update boot image and use that to do an in-place upgrade.&nbsp; So I scramble looking for a thumbdrive with at least 8 GB.&nbsp; Nada.&nbsp; I found two - a 16 and a 32 - that are both defective.&nbsp; While I'm searching, my chat session times
 out, but not before he sends me a rundown of what the in-place upgrade will do, which is basically leave me in a state like when you do a Windows 8 to 10 update, or something along those lines.&nbsp; Most stuff would still be there, just with some settings and
 such data lost.&nbsp; At least my files would live, as would (apparently) my installed apps, although that may have just been store apps.&nbsp; So I keep digging and finally find a Micro SD card that's big enough and an adapter, and start creating the update media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While that's happening, I go back to my desktop and oddly my name is on the screen.&nbsp; I think "oh thank god, it just needed some of the startups to just time out."&nbsp; I tap a key and it...almost shows the password box.&nbsp; Things move as though it's going to be
 a standard login, but no, not quite. Try rebooting into safe mode again, just in case I just had stupid fingers, but no.&nbsp; Swearing louder now, I go back and check on the Media Creation status.&nbsp; Around 25%.&nbsp; I still had some questions about the upgrade process,
 mostly about the fact that my laptop was running Win10 Home, and my desktop is Win10 Pro (and I really want to keep the Pro).&nbsp; So, thinking I was ready for the next step soon, I get back into chat.&nbsp; Takes me about 10 minutes to get the new agent to completely
 understand my issue.&nbsp; She also wants to remote into my laptop for some reason (had already told her I couldn't access my desktop via RDP).&nbsp; Again, I say no.&nbsp; She accepts it and waits with me, while I just ask some questions to build up my confidence that I
 wasn't gonna end up resetting my whole PC, end up downgrading to Home, or lose my registration key.&nbsp; She reassures me that it will all be fine.&nbsp; Then the media creation hits 50% and craps out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sanity hanging by a thin thread, I start thrashing my apartment again, but I know I don't have more USB drives.&nbsp; What I do find are SD cards that can store enough.&nbsp; Problem is, I can only find a Micro SD adapter, not regular SD.&nbsp; The whole time I'm searching,
 I keep coming back to the chat to make sure it doesn't time out.&nbsp; I also re-format the Micro SD I'd tried earlier and give it another shot.&nbsp; Half an hour later, it stalls at 50%.&nbsp; 15 minutes later, still at 50%.&nbsp; Once again, thrash my apartment (don't worry,
 I'll clean it up tomorrow).&nbsp; This time, though, it dawns on me - my camera takes SD cards.&nbsp; So I check my camera bag and there it is - a standard SD USB adapter.&nbsp; So I grab one of my 16 GB cards and start pumping that up with Media.&nbsp; By now this third chat
 has gone on for over an hour, and I'm feeling bad about it, mostly because I'm keeping her from helping other people.&nbsp; So I asked her to file my original NAS problem with the higher-ups and let her go.&nbsp; She recommends that I contact help when the media creation
 is complete so someone can help me through the in-place upgrade.&nbsp; I say ok, although I wasn't actually sure that I was going to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's around 3 am at this point, but it's Friday and I'm a night guy anyway, so I stick it out.&nbsp; While the media creation is ticking along, I toss on some TV and play some Switch to calm down, which I do.&nbsp; Finally the Media Creation Tool finishes and I now
 have a Windows 10 upgrade stick.&nbsp; I grab it, pause Dirk Gently, review the steps to to the in-place upgrade, and go into my computer room.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had left my computer on purposefully, given that earlier it made it a bit further along.&nbsp; And, as I walked into the room, a similar scene greeted me - my name in the centre of the screen, taunting me.&nbsp; I figure "give it one more go and then dig into the
 upgrade."&nbsp; As it happens, one more go was all it needed.&nbsp; This time, inexplicably, after tapping the Ctrl key, the password box shows up.&nbsp; I type my password while trying not to get too hopeful, but it actually logs me in!&nbsp; As Windows starts, I'm greeted by
 dozens of "this thing ain't working" popups, which isn't surprising since there's virtually no services running.&nbsp; I pop into msconfig, enable all, and hit ok.&nbsp; This had actually worried me for a bit, because I didn't want to go and set everything to auto-start,
 and I didn't know which specific ones should be set to that and which to manual.&nbsp; But since he'd disabled the services via msconfig, re-enabling them through that brought them back to their own previous states (some were auto, some were manual).&nbsp; When the
 popup appears, I do a quick mental check to make sure I'm not being a total idiot before clicking reboot.&nbsp; The only concern were services that had been disabled before - they'd be back now.&nbsp; But I figure I'll deal with that when everything else is working
 as expected.&nbsp; I click "Reboot Now."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bingpot!&nbsp; Login screen pops up a few seconds later, I type my password, and things work as usual.&nbsp; And I'm relieved at last.&nbsp; I'd let out a victory roar if it wasn't 3:30 in the morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>TL/DR: So, what worked for me in the end was to just let everything fail and time out on the login screen.&nbsp; It must have been at least a half an hour that first time when just my name showed up but no password box would. I'd say my computer had to be on
 for about an hour or more for everything to settle down into a bit pot of fail, at which point it let me log in.&nbsp; One thing to note is that I don't use my online credentials to log in to my computers at home.&nbsp; Since all of the services had been disabled, shutting
 down my internet connection, I'm thinking that my one saving grace was that the computer didn't have to connect to the internet to confirm my credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If just letting the machine sit hadn't worked for me, I feel pretty confident that the in-place upgrade would have worked instead.&nbsp; Maybe I would have had to re-install some apps, but I have a feeling that, like updating from Windows 8 to 10 (which I did
 three times on separate machines), most of them would have stuck around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual moral of this story, though, is to never take your hand off the mouse when you're getting Remote Assistance.</p>

<p>Hi, I have the same issues, but here is a solution to get msconfig to do Normal startup, 1.bootbup with windows 10 USB drive then go repair and get to command prompt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Go to you main windows boot drive depending on how many drives you have,</p>
<p>3. Go to windows/system32</p>
<p>4. Type following copy osk.exe osk.exe.bak</p>
<p>5. Type following copy cmd.exe osk.exe</p>
<p>What you do is replace on screen keyboard with command prompt,&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.reboot</p>
<p>7.once windows is log to normal login screen but since you can't see user name or login but you will see bottom right x on network icon and accessible&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.clikc on On screen keyboard, it will bring up commands prompt instead&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Type in msconfig it will bring up System Configuration GUI, now lock on Normal startup then reboot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is how I get my windows boot back to normal &nbsp;</p>

<p>Wow, I did the exact same thing as you OP. I tried everything I knew in attempt to fix the problem! Safe mode, recovery mode, etc.-all those options didn‚Äôt work. After a day of frustration and anger, I continued to look for solutions online. Finally, I came
 to this thread and after reading KristSmith‚Äôs post I had hope. As I read his post, I noticed that he pressed ctrl before typing in the password. I didn‚Äôt think this was of any significance, until I thought I would try it one last time before I finish downloading
 the media creation tool. I boot up my computer and reluctantly press ctrl a few times and voila. The password box shows up, and all my frustrations finally go away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can something so small fix such a seemingly huge problem! *facepalm*</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will help someone else!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help here OP and KristSmith!</p>

<p><span>Hi RstewB,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Windows 7 Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I have a few questions regarding you issue:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Is the computer attached to the computer locally or is it on network?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If on a network, other comp. are able to access or not?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try updating the drivers for the printer from the manufacturer‚Äôs website. You may also check for the same in Device Manager
 if any update for the device is required or not.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also try uninstalling and re-installing the drivers for the printer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If no exclamation point appears next to the name of the device and the device does not function correctly, manually uninstall
 and reinstall the device drivers. To do this, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<span>Start</span><span>Collapse this imageExpand this ima</span>, type
<span>Device Manager</span> in the <span>Start Search</span> box, and then press ENTER.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<span>Continue</span>. The <span>Device Manager</span> Dialog box is displayed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator
 password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click <span>Continue</span>.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the list of device types, click the kind of device, and then locate the specific device that is not functioning.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right-click the device and then click
<span>Properties</span>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<span>Driver</span> tab. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<span>Uninstall</span>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>7.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<span>OK</span>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>8.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<span>Device Manager</span> Dialog box, click the <span>Action</span> menu, and then click
<span>Scan for hardware changes</span>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>You may receive a message that states that Windows has to install driver software for your unknown device. If you receive this message, click
<span>Locate and install driver software (recommended)</span>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>You may also receive a message that states that a hardware device is being installed and that the uninstalled device is now present in Device Manager.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note:</span><span> If you do not receive either message or the hardware device is not
 installed, go to step 3, "Use Windows Update to find a device driver."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also try disabling the security software and check if you get the same error.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try booting into Safe Mode with networking and see if you face the same problem there.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To boot to Safe Mode with Networking you can follow the below given steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Do one of the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a. If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b. If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating
 system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode with Networking, and then press ENTER.
 For more information about options, see Advanced startup options (including safe mode).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart
 your computer and let Windows start normally.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you boot to the desktop then try installing the Windows installer 4.5 that you have downloaded from the link given.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if you get the same error in Safe mode with Networking.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information on Safe Mode follow the link below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows Audio Service Not Running &#38; Can&#39;t Find it to Enable</h2>
                    I am having problems with my sound and the Windows Audio Service is not enabled and I have tried all sorts of ways to find it to enable it but it does not appear anywhere on my computer. Under directx diagnostics I get the following message "This computer
 cannot play audio because the windows audio service is not enabled. Enable this service using the service management console". this doesn't give me any options to enable the audio. Windows audio doesn't appear in "Services" either, in fact it appears to have
 disappeared off the machine! Any Help???

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Run the system file checker tool.</p>
<p>Check the article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ‚ÄúHow to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7‚Äù</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> If that does not help, perform an in-place upgrade of vista.</p>
<p>The steps to perform are: Perform an in-place upgrade to Windows Vista</p>
<p>Warning: Before you perform an in-place upgrade, you should be prepared for a worst case scenario that results in your existing data on your computer being deleted. This data includes personal data, settings, hardware driver information, and software programs.
 If a worst case scenario occurs, you may have to reinstall all programs. Make sure that you back up personal data to disks or to other external storage devices before you perform an in-place upgrade. To perform an in-place upgrade, follow these steps:</p>
<p>a. Start the computer. <br />
b. Insert the Windows Vista DVD into the DVD drive and then close the drive tray. Wait for the Setup program to start automatically.<br />
c. If the Setup program does not start automatically, click Start, type Drive:\setup.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
<strong>Note</strong> In this step, Drive is the drive letter of the computer‚Äôs DVD drive.<br />
d. When the "Install now" screen appears, click Install now. <br />
<strong>Note:</strong> When you receive the Get important updates for installation message, do not click Go Online.<br />
e. Click Upgrade when the Which type of installation do you want screen appears. <br />
f. Follow the instructions to install Windows Vista. <br />
g. If Windows Vista is now running on your computer, you have completed the upgrade to Windows Vista.</p>
<p>After the upgrade has completed, you have to activate your copy of Windows Vista. For more information about how to activate Windows Vista, click the following link to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940315/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940315/</a>

            Hello Judith,<br />
<br />
I do not know which web browser you are using so I will give you the directions for IE8, which should work for the other versions.
<br />
<br />
In IE8 click on the word tools in the upper right hand section of the browser. On that list is the words pop-up blocker, click on that and then allow pop-up and this will fix that. Make sure to re-enable pop-up blocker after your done.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps,<br />
<br />
Jim<br />
<br />

<p>Most people I've talked to&nbsp;want the gears 3 shotgun that way. I don't see what is so great about it. It only works the way you want it to when your the&nbsp;host other than that it is not very consistent.

<p>it was perfect. because if someone should have died, they always died. gears 2 shotgun was pure BS and the gears 3 shotgun is close to perfection but not as good as the gears 1 shotty. but only just.</p>

<p>because it actually took skill to use...and i dont think it was so much the gnasher, but it was your characters movement within the game, its so fluid its amazing, gears 2 movement was horrible, gears 3 is closer to gears 1 but not so perfect</p>
<p>in gears 1 u felt heavy but fast (exactly how it should be)</p>
<p>in gears 2 you felt heavy AND i gues they tried to make it more "realistic" by makin you slow, and it ended up just bein dumb</p>
<p>in gears 3 your fast again, but u feel lighter, and i guess they are trying to do that so it makes sense that ur moving fast, but you dont have that sense that ur carrying some big @@@ gun and are some 300 pound guy carryin hundred pounds of armor on you
 anymore</p>
<p>anyway, the movement makes the shotgun...im gunna coin that phrase</p>

<p>Before you talk about GoW 1 you must realize that there are two kinds of people out there. The ones who loved the game but realize its time has passed and the ones that love the game and think that it was and still is pure greatness.
</p>
<p>Those people seem to point out all the bad things about GoW 2 and seem to overlook all the bad in GoW 1. They seem to forget about host advantage, crab walkers, weapon sliding, ninja flipping, leaving maps, etc. They see nothing wrong with GoW 1 in any way.</p>
<p>Now, as a Gears Head who loved GoW 1 and tolerated GoW 2 the gnasher in GoW 1 was pretty sweet but it still had issues. People say it hit all the time correctly but GoW 1 was always one big shotgun danceathon. If the weapon worked right then there would
 not be any dance offs. The main reason shotgun battles even happened was not because of how well the shotgun worked but it was because of how weak all the other weapons were.
</p>
<p>Now that those weapons work correctly in GoW 3 all the GoW 1 gnasher lovers are crying because they can't dance the night away with their shotguns.</p>

<p>Gears 1 shotgun was by no means great. It had its BS moments as well. The reason why I didn't complain about that was because the game for me was not laggy at all, and I was able to play fast paced without having to worry about Stopping Power.</p>

<p>Gears of War 1 was an easier game to adapt to. &nbsp;You have your One shot down snipers and your shotgun with no range whatsoever. &nbsp;I understand people cry about the Gears 2 TU6 hard-aim shotgun (&lt;--- that was a mouthful ), but what kind of a shotgun actually
 has the sorry range of Gears 1 shotty? &nbsp;Did you guys see the size of those maps in the Beta anyway? &nbsp;Gears 1 shotty would never work. &nbsp;Everyone would weild the Retro.</p>

            <p>If you see a small x on bottom of the App after it doesn't work.. click on that x ..&nbsp;takes you&nbsp;to the&nbsp;store..&nbsp;and will option you to repair it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might look in Control Panel at Internet Options / Connections&nbsp;</p>
<p>see if those settings all look OK and look to make sure you don't have a proxy server on the main page and also&nbsp;look in the LAN settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Some of the 3rd party anti-virus and firewalls&nbsp;seem to block things in the tiles.&nbsp; You might try disabling yours?</p>

            What is the model of your Epson color printer?
<br />
<br />You can use below instructions for scanning which is applicable for most of the Epson printers - <a href="https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-scan-documents-with-an-epson-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-scan-...</a>
<br />
<br />For sending mail, you can attach in mail and send.
<br />
<br />Some scanners offer scan and e mail facility also. This I can tell you once I know your model number

                    I installed Windows 7 and now I can no longer record audio.&nbsp; I have a CL Audigy sound card, as well as two different recording programs (RIP Vinyl and Adobe Audition).&nbsp; I have playback, but I can't get either program to record.

            Hi, <br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers.<br />
<br />
Since when are facing this problem, wa it working before?<br />
<br />
There is no Microsoft tool to record streaming audio, you need to use a third party softwares.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So, I suggest you to contact RIP Vinyl and Adobe Audition websites for better assistance<br />

<h2>            Dead Rising 3 - Showed on Games with Gold</h2>
                    
<p>Guys, please explain! &nbsp;For the last 2 Days my games with gold page under the featured games heading at xblive store has been showing 'Dead Rising 3' for the XB-ONE as a Free Game.</p>
<p>Although it never went free to Gold members during the time it was up on that page, I would like to point out that this is a stuff up of Epic proportions and has severely upset me and several friends that I had advised to keep an eye on the page for when
 the pricing was updated (and they WERE seeing the same information they tell me).</p>
<p>It has now been reverted to 'Max - The Curse of Brotherhood' game and NOTHING has been said to apologise for the false information! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please know it is things like This that will truly cost you loyal customers! &nbsp;I am a long time live user, but if this sort of thing can happen at this stage of the game after a new console release, I have to say I am disappointed!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply with how this could happen and if you plan to make up for such misleading information being placed up!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MS doesn't read these forums... However during the "purchase" process there is a page that says if you click accept your card will be charged and provides you with the amount. &nbsp;Might I suggest just chalking this up to human error. &nbsp;Who knows maybe DR3 will
 be one of the GWG free games next month and someone hit apply instead of save. &nbsp;I know I have made mistakes. &nbsp;Hell the other night I ordered Italian and I said a whole order of garlic bread and they sent me 4 whole orders of garlic bread... human error.</p>
