    <title>PS&#47;2 to USB adapter Win 7, &#34;Unknown Device&#34; on reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonylamp  say:</h3>
<h2>            PS&#47;2 to USB adapter Win 7, &#34;Unknown Device&#34; on reboot</h2>
                    <p>I've recently picked up a couple&nbsp;PS/2 to USB adapter for use with Win 7. I've used two different machines (different hardware) and two different PS/2 devices (a keyboard and mouse) with the same results. Every time the PC boots up it detects the USB adapter
 and fails to load the driver. It shows up in Device Manager as "Unknown Device". If I unplug the adapter and plug it back in, the OS then loads the appropriate HID drivers and everything works fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I have to disconnect and reconnect the adapter for Windows to load the correct drivers? Is there a fix for this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another oddity: Every time it correctly detects the adapter (after the disconnect/reconnect) it reaches out to Windows Update for the drivers. Shouldn't it just use the drivers on the system? Any explanation here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any info.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>I can understand the frustration when things don’t work the usual way.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;•Hardware problems</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please make sure that you install all windows updates</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>How can I tell if my computer is up to date?</span></strong></span></p>

</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to follow few troubleshooting steps and check if that fixes the issue on your computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:<br />
Uninstall</span></strong><span> the driver from <strong>device manager</strong> and
<strong>reinstall</strong> it and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to uninstall the driver from device manager:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><span>a. Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Device Manager</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. <br />
b. Click <strong>Continue</strong>. The Device Manager dialog box is displayed.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Note: If you are prompted for an <strong>administrator</strong> <strong>
password</strong> or for a confirmation, type the password, or click <strong>Continue</strong>.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;c. In the list of device types, click the kind of device, and then locate the specific device that is not functioning.<br />
&nbsp;d. <strong>Right-click</strong> the device and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
<br />
&nbsp;e. Click the <strong>Driver</strong> tab. <br />
&nbsp;f. Click Uninstall. <br />
&nbsp;g. Click OK. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Download the driver from the manufacturer website</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
Follow the steps to install the driver:</span></p>
<p><span>In the <strong>Device Manager</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Action</strong> menu, and then click
<strong>Scan</strong> for hardware changes. <br />
<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>You may receive a message that states that Windows has to install driver software for your unknown device. If you receive this message, click Locate and install driver software (recommended).<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>You may also receive a message that states that a hardware device is being installed and that the uninstalled device is now present in Device Manager.
</span></li></ol>
<p>

            <p>I'm not going include the make/model of the PC as they are both custom built machines. The fact that OS behaves the same way on both machines (made up of different hardware) tells me it is not a machine/hardware issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said "<span>Mouse, touchpad, and keyboard problems can have a number of causes:"&nbsp;</span><span>This is not a problem with the&nbsp;peripheral I/O devices. The issue here lies on how Windows
 is detecting the USB adapter. I can have nothing plugged into the USB adapter and get the same results described in my first post. Please re-read the initial post.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Both machines are completely up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: No go here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Didn't work either... Also, there are no manufacture drivers for the adapter. Like I said, The Microsoft HID drivers work fine. The issue is with Windows detecting the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem isn't clear let me know and I can break it down further.</p>

            <p>My guess is that with the device plugged during boot, the BIOS on the system tries to interact and put the device in a weird state. So when the USB stack tries to enumerate, the device doesn't respond. Later when you unplug and plug the device, it sets the
 device back in the right mind set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want to find out more, collect USB trace by following the instruction on this page:</p>
<p>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/usbcoreblog/archive/2012/08/07/how-to-trace-usb-3-activity.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this issue is happening on boot, jump to the last boot tracing section and follow the instruction.</p>
<p>
Boot tracing (special tracing commands)
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Are you seeing this issue with only Win10? Have you run other versions of Windows on this system?</p>

            <p>Both PCs have and have only had Win 7 on them. The USB trace instructions are for Win 8... I haven't looked closely yet, but I assume they will work for Win 7.</p>

            <p>Yes the trace instruction will work on Win7. If the adapter works on other versions of Windows but doesn't work on Win10 then it's concerning. Getting tracelog would help in understanding the issue.</p>

            <p>We looked at the trace and see that OS (USB core stack) effort to reset the port keeps failing. So as I said something in the preboot environment leaves the device in a bad state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure on this exact machine, if you install Win7, the device works fine on boot?</p>

            <p>Thanks for taking a look at the trace. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The device never works upon boot. It will only work if I disconnect and reconnect the USB adapter. The events of disconnecting and reconnecting the adapter should be in the trace as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the device works fine in the BIOS (i.e. using a PS/2 keyboard attached to the adapter to navigate through the menus). I'm not sure what Windows 7 is doing to put the devise in a bad state or how to resolve this issue.</p>

<p><span><span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After doing some research I have found that the MCI drivers may be related to your audio card that is installed in your computer.
 Do you know if the software that you are installing has functions or features that require audio services from the computer to help it run? Sometimes a program will have multimedia presentations that require audio or video drivers or services to be available
 for the program to run properly. In the research I have done this problem can be related to several different types of soundcards but more frequently people with a Creative (SoundBlaster) product seem to be victims of this problem. Try going to the manufacturer’s
 website and downloading updated drivers for your soundcard and installing them manually by using the Device Manager. You can also do a search for your brand of audio card and its relation to MCI drivers and see what your favorite search engine pulls up.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us know if this helps.</span></span></p>

<h3> noahvt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t activate Windows 10 pro on brand new laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a brand new laptop and erased the stock windows 10 home from it to replace it with a clean windows 10 pro install, This all went fine, I deactived windows 10 pro on my OLD laptop by using slmgr /upk and the key was removed from the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to activate the key on my brand NEW laptop(The edition has already been upgraded to windows 10 pro) I get this error: "0XC004C003 The product key used on this pc didn't work with this edition of windows" and I cannot activate it despite this being
 a valid windows 10 pro key... When I restart my laptop it will say "Couldn't reach windows activation servers" and pressing the activate button does absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I always used to do is start a live chat with microsoft if this happend and they were able to fix my issue within 2 minutes by using SLUI however, when I try to access the chat link now, it says "This chat link has been discontinued" and I cannot use
 it anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me with this?</p>
<p>

            <p>You may not understand the Win 10 activation is kept online using an electronic key.&nbsp; An upgrade install is good for one machine only unless you purchased a Win 10 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your new laptop came with Win 10 Home, so it has a license for that OS.&nbsp; Unless your Win 10 Pro has it own license key, you will need to upgrade the machine to Win 10 Pro first to allow it to set the Electronic key for that version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old machine should still have its original Win 10 activation.</p>

            The windows 10 pro key I have was a purchased windows 8 key from when it was released and it has been upgraded all the way to windows 10, I've used this key to activate another pc once and deactivate my old laptop and that worked fine so there is no reason
 for this key to not work on my new laptop

</p><blockquote>The windows 10 pro key I have was a purchased windows 8 key</blockquote>
<p>That is quite a confusing sentence, a key is either this or that.<br />
You likely meant to say that you used that Windows 8 (Pro???) key to upgrade to windows 10 pro.<br />
Since you forgot to mention the "Pro" part, I am assuming you meant Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>If not, than that alone explains the issue, you have a mismatch (Home vs Pro).<br />
If it was windows 8 Pro: was it preinstalled with the laptop (OEM), bought of the shelves (Retail or perhaps Systembuilder), or a digital download (could be anything, depending the source).<br />
If OEM or Systembuilder : you already used it once to upgrade to Windows 10 on the first system.</p>
<p>Then you cannot use it again on another system for 2 reasons:</p>
<p>1) the OEM licence does not allow to transfer it to new hardware</p>
<p>2) to prevent software piracy, a device(licence) can only <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
once</span> have a free upgrade path to Windows 10 (else anyone can lend their key to friends or family and upgrade for free).<br />
If you have a legitimate Windows 8 Pro retail key: contact support and provide a proof of purchase of your laptop.</p>
<p>Note: this must be completed before the free PROMO ends (7/29th).</p>

            <p>Sorry for the confusing post, I bought windows 8 pro back in I think it was 2012 and I've used this key ever since to activate all my new laptops (while deactivating the previous one of course) and this key has been updated to windows 10 pro as soon as I
 installed it on my old laptop, I've reset this old laptop a couple of times and I was always able to reapply that key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this key does not work on my new laptop running windows 10 pro despite me deactivating it on my old laptop, it keeps saying "this product key didn't work with this edition" even though it is infact a windows 10 pro key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called their service and I keep getting "the Installation ID could not be verified" when I enter it so I'm pretty much clueless now...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You may try the below steps and check if this helps.</p>
<p>1. Go to the Control Panel and choose the Device Manager applet<br />
2. You should see two items called Bluetooth Peripheral Device being listed with a yellow icon, meaning that they can't be used due to missing drivers.<br />
3. Right click the first Bluetooth Peripheral Device and choose Update Driver Software...<br />
4. When asked how do you want to search for the driver software, select the second option Browse My Computer for driver software<br />
5. When asked for what kind of hardware this is, select the option Ports (COM &amp; LPT) and click Next<br />
6. At the Update Driver Software Dialog, click on the bottom option that is preceded by a green arrow Let me pick from a list of device drivers from my computer<br />
7. In the next dialog, make sure the option Show compatible hardware is NOT SELECTED<br />
8. From the list of Manufacturers at the left, select Apple Virtual Serial Ports<br />
9. The list of Models at the right will drill down to Virtual Serial Port. Select this model and click Next.<br />
10. You should get a confirmation that the driver was successfully installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you still face the same problem then, I’d recommend you to contact iPhone support team, as they would be the best people to assist you with this issue.</p>

            I had this same thing happen. I installed windows 10 last evening then let computer run all night, as I thought that the circle of dots meant that data was being loaded. 12 hours later and sleep, I tried again, I started again. First thing I noticed was
 that I needed to give permission to windows to change or update a program. I forgot this step and I had used wrong password for my Microsoft account. After getting correct password listed on permission popup, things started to work and an hour later downloading
 of program is done. Now to see how it works.<br />

            Easy way to take care of this is to open windows update and run it. You will have the windows 10 upgrade waiting and accept permission and let it run. That is all i did to take care of this issue. Goodluck all.

            If you hit the Windows key + E on your keyboard it will open Windows File Explorer.<br />
Now plug in your USB drive.<br />
Do you see a new drive letter appear?If so that should be it.<br />
Also if you have the Desktop open you should see a box saying Device Setup on the taskbar as Windows installs the drivers for the USB stick.<br />
<br />
If not then there could be an issue with the USB port.<br />
Have you tried a different port?<br />
<br />
Another thing to try is go to the top right of your screen and the Charms bar should open.<br />
Hit Search and type Device Manager.Hit Settings and choose Device Manager.There could also be a keyboard shortcut to get there I just don't know it off hand.<br />
When it opens do you see anything with a Yellow exclamation mark?<br />
If you look under Portable Devices it should show a drive letter for the stick if one has been assigned.<br />

            The log-in screen just has the icon/image of a person (I haven't put a picture of anything there yet) above my email address. And yes, I have rebooted several times since making the change.

<p>Alright -- that is certainly the problem.&nbsp; The account needs some kind of name to show (it can't be&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span> a picture, there must always be a text name).&nbsp; But since there is no actual name, it is required to show
 the email address as an account identifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally the account name should sync from your online account (http://account.microsoft.com), but you can also do this:&nbsp; type "NETPLWIZ" into your Run box, double-click your account listed there, and make sure the "Full Name" field is set -- then that should
 be what is used on the login screen.</p>

            Somewhere in the process of investigating this, I think when I went looking for how and where to ask for help and encountered needing to sign in to MS, I ended up entering a name. Now that has appeared in place of my email. So I guess I accidentally fixed
 this! Thank you anyway for taking the time to respond. R<br />

    <title>Windows 8.1 created a duplicate user &#34;Documents&#34; folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bj1020  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 created a duplicate user &#34;Documents&#34; folder</h2>
                    <p>I moved the location of my user folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos) from the OS (C:) drive to the DATA (D:) drive. I preformed the move according to the instructions in this article:&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/redirect-folder-new-location#1TC=windows-7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new location for my user folders is working fine. In the File Explorer Navigation Pane&nbsp;<em>This PC &gt; Documents</em> points to the correct location on drive (D:).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is Windows created another Documents folder in the original location on&nbsp;OS (C:) drive. The duplicate folder Windows created doesn't have a Location tab when viewing the folder's Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get rid of the duplicate Documents folder on the&nbsp;OS (C:) drive? The folder does not contain any files -- it's totally empty. I don't know if it's safe to just delete it or if I need to do something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some screen shots...</p>
<p><br />

            <p>That is odd.&nbsp;The one inside your user folder should redirect, and it should have a location tab describing the re-direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would delete the Documents folder on the C drive, then carefully edit the registry to make sure that this value is set properly. Remember to include the final folder name ("Documents") in the path.</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Default Value: </td>
<td>%UserProfile%\Documents</td>

<tr>
<td>What your value should say:</td>
<td>D:\Brian\Documents</td>

<p>
</p><p>After you set this, reboot the computer so that it will re-initialize the user shell folders.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Photos App Crashes When Trimming Video - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> singh1rocks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Photos App Crashes When Trimming Video</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope everyone's having a wonderful day! The following is a minor problem, but it's been bugging me for quite some time now.</p>
<p>Among a collection of issues that I've been experiencing after the April 2018 Creator's Update, this one is quite strange. So, I'll open a video in the Movies &amp; TV app, and I'll click on the little "pencil" in the bottom-right corner, then "Trim." I'll then
 proceed to trim the video to my desired length. Once I click the "Save a Copy" button and select a file destination, however, the progress bar will show for about 2 seconds, and then the Photos app will crash. The file will be saved to my desired location,
 but upon opening, a message will pop up saying that it is corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried resetting the app in Settings, as well as running the Troubleshooter, but neither of those have worked. I've also tried creating a new, temporary user on my computer to test out if it still happens, and it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, this is my problem. Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to type out a short message if you're having this problem as well, this will definitely gain traction if it's a widespread issue.</p>

            This may be due to 1803 upgrade but I am listening to this for the first time. Hence, I am not able to say whether 1803 has caused this.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows App Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down to the bottom &gt; Click Windows Store Apps &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />2. Re-register All Store apps
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Right click on Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the following from below and right click in Powershell to paste &gt; Enter &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />3. You should uninstall using Powershell and reinstall the Photos App
<br />Windows+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below command and right click in Powershell to paste it
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage Microsoft.Windows.Photos | remove-appxpackage
<br />
<br />Now, you need to reinstall it
<br />Use below Powershell command to install
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.Windows.Photos | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”

<p>Hey E for Excel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, none of the three methods you suggested ended up working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already given the first method a try quite a while ago, but I did it anyways just to see if it would work. It didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running your second method through, Powershell came through with a series of errors (I think? I'm not an expert at Powershell myself). I'll attach them as images.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f355a50-c90f-4ec7-a5bc-f7a26cdf161f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f355a50-c90f-4ec7-a5bc-f7a26cdf161f?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>The thing about your third method: the first command worked fine, and I was able to uninstall Photos, but the second command didn't work. I had to manually reinstall Photos off of the MS Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, none of these methods worked. Photos still crashes upon trimming a video, but I really,&nbsp;<strong>really
</strong>do appreciate you taking out the time to help me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find anything else, please let me know! Thanks for your help! 😊</p>

            Yes, before 1803, the function was working perfectly fine. I can't exactly rollback right now, as I've uninstalled the previous update to free up some space on my SSD.

<p>Hey, community members.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem still isn't solved. If anyone has any suggestions as to how this can be fixed, or whether this should be in a different category, please don't hesitate to post a reply. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, it seems like this is a problem with 1803, for&nbsp;<em>my specific computer</em>. From where I've searched, no one else seems to be having this issue. If it helps, I own a MSI GS63VR laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, does anyone have an ETA on when the next major Windows 10 update will be released to hopefully patch this? I can't exactly rollback, as I've uninstalled the last update.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Either this ties into a substantially deeper issue, or the program won't open simply because my laptop is utilizing it's most basic drivers.</p>

<h2>            Windows has detected an IP Address Conflict</h2>
                    
<p>Running W7 Home Prem 32BIT.</p>
<p>Secured Home Network.....Modem to Router....2 Desktops Wired\Ethernet connected to Router, 1 Printer..Wired\Ethernet connected to Router, 2 Wireless laps.</p>
<p>I have not changed anything on any of my PC, Printer or Network....which has been running for 8 mos since I Connected the printer to my network...and suddenly in the past 2 weeks I get the message "Windows has Detected an IP Address Conflict".&nbsp; All Desktops
 and Laptops are acquiring IP address dynamically, Printer has an assigned address (Static Address); HP Tech had me set it this way because the printer kept changing IP addresses when left dynamically...and there were issues printing.&nbsp; When I view Windows System
 Event Log the error shows the Conflict is with the Printers IP address (my Printers Static IP address ends in 1.5 and that is referenced in the System Event Log).</p>
<p>When I see this Conflict message, the only choice you have is to click Close....no other options offered.</p>
<p>Since I have not changed anything in my system\network....and all has been running without&nbsp;seeing this Conflict message....why have I now seen it several times in the past 3 weeks....and...how&nbsp;do I&nbsp;fix it.&nbsp; The error message reads, Contact your&nbsp;Administrator
 for help....lots of help that is...I am the Administrator...and I have no idea what to do!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Router DHCP is usually set for a range.</p>
<p>Like assign IPs from, 192.168.1.<strong>10</strong> to 192.168.1.<strong>50</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that the Static IP assigned to the printer is out of the DHCP range, like (in the example)it can be 192.168.1.<strong>60</strong></p>

<p>Your response makes the fix sound easy....but my bet is it in not.&nbsp; That is, it is not as easy as going into the printer and changing its Static IP address to lets say&nbsp; 192.168.2.0 ( I only have 5 devices on my Network, 2 desktops\wired, 2 Laptops, wireless...and
 the printer.&nbsp; The printer is Wired to the&nbsp;Wireless Router.&nbsp; Seems if I change the Printers IP address....I'll need to make changes in the 2 desktops and Laptops.......</p>
<p>Sure hope there is an easy way to accomplish the changes to avoid the&nbsp;IP address conflict....but my gut tells me otherwise.&nbsp; I only see the IP Conflict message on 1 desktop...does that mean it is having the conflict and the other 3 PC's is not....not even
 sure this makes any difference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The conflict is with the IP in question not with the others.</p>
<p>Each device on the Network must have its own unique IP.</p>
<p>Configuring Printer, Servers, Routers, and other devices that are used by the Networked computers to Static IPs is actually a policy on good networks.</p>
<p>That makes sharing easy since Devices with Static IP are always the same address.</p>
<p>Changing a printer IP is not a "Humongous" challenge.</p>
<p>Many Routers can also can do IP reservation (aka Static DHCP).</p>
<p>Read the Router is manual if it can do it and follow the&nbsp;manual’s instructions</p>

<p>Thanks; you have been very helpful ....</p>
<p>It sounds like you are saying I should leave the Static IP address as is in the Printer and change the Dynamic IP's of the 2 desktops and 2 Laptops to Static.&nbsp; I had been told Static Addresses can create issues, especially when connecting to your&nbsp;Internet
 provider....their Licensces can change.....so I have allowed the PC's to use Dynamic IP Addresses.&nbsp; I know that Static IP Addresses can be safer and more reliable.....but would rather the fix be on the device that is the root, the printer...and leave the PC's
 as they are.&nbsp; It just would seem changing the Printers IP address, which is the root of the problem....should be done....yet, as I wrote previously, that may not be an easy fix since once changed....the PC's&nbsp;would need some chnages to see and print to the
 printer.</p>
<p>So I'll keep digging in to hopefully come up with the steps to assign a new...higher Static IP Address to the printer....and leave the PC's with Dynamic IP Addresses......</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>When you are behind a router with IPs like 192.168.x.x you are on a private network.</p>
<p>This IPs cannot go to the Internet (that is why you have a router). The ISP does not know and does not care about your private IPs.</p>
<p>The info that you got is pertaining to the external ISP IP and it is not relevant to your topology.</p>

<p>Thank you for all your help....I contacted HP and they said that they have never encountered this issue.&nbsp; They described going into all 4 PC's and perhaps making changes so that after changing the Static IP address in the printer....the PC's would print.&nbsp;
 They just did not sound convincing to me...so I decided to hold off.&nbsp; They did provide instructions to go to Control panel\Devices and printers\the Printers Properities....Port Tab\Add Port\New Port..follow instructions....which were, enter name or IP address....I
 tried inserting the name of the printer (HP Officejet....) that did not work, then I tried entering 192.168.2.0 and that just kept tried to complete....&nbsp;&nbsp; Had I changed the Static IP address in the Printer to 192.168.2.0....and followed the HP Instructions...entering
 192.168.2.0...would this give me the results I am looking for?&nbsp; All PC's would print to Printer...and there would be no need to make any changes in the PC's?&nbsp; If so use 192.168.2.0...or go higher?</p>

<p>Denmarfl,</p>
<p>It sounds like you're a bit confused on how IP addresses work. Here's a general&nbsp;explanation:</p>
<p>One of the primary tasks of a router is to hand out IP addresses. The router is configured with an IP address scheme and DHCP range. The scheme is the<strong>192.168.2.X</strong> part of the IP address. In home networks, the first 3 numbers never change.
 The last number in the IP address differs per network device. You seem to have a good understanding between Dynamic and Static IP address so I'll skip that. The IP address&nbsp;<span>DHCP&nbsp;</span><span>range
 is the range of IP addresses the router is allowed to hand out&nbsp;dynamically. Everything outside that range is a safe IP address to set as static.</span></p>
<p>For example...</p>
<p>My router's IP address scheme is 192.168.2.X. I've configured my router's IP address DHCP range to be between 50 and 100. So I know anything between 192.168.2.50 and 192.168.2.100 should be considered taken because at anytime the router could hand out one
 of those IP addresses and cause a conflict. So when I'm configuring the static on my printer, I can choose anything between 1-49 and 101-254 since those are all open IP addresses.</p>
<p>All this to say, you need to log into your router and find out what the IP address range is. Once you know that, you can pick a static IP address for your printer that you know won't cause a conflict later down the road.&nbsp;<span>192.168.2.0
 is (in most cases) not a valid IP address. You need to configure the printer's IP address and then create the New Port as suggested by HP.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps explain things!</span></p>

<p>I understand......my Router shows Starting 192.168.1.2 thru 192.168.1.51, so that means these IP addresses are used by the Router to assign an IP addres to a device connected to see.....and it can assign an IP address ranging from .12 to 1.51</p>
<p>I also saw this when accesses my Router:</p>
<p><strong>Address Reservation</strong></p>
<p>When you specify a reserved IP address for a PC on the LAN, that PC will always receive the same IP address each time it accesses the DHCP server. Reserved IP addresses should be assigned to servers that require permanent IP settings.</p>
<p><strong>To Reserve An IP Address:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Add</strong> button. </li><li>Select the radio button of the Computer you wish to add from the <strong>Address Reservation Table</strong>.</li><li>If the Computer is not on the <strong>Address Reservation Table</strong>, enter the IP Address, MAC Address, and Device Name of the computer you wish to add.</li><li>Click the <strong>Add</strong> button when finished. </li></ol>
<p><strong>To Edit A Reserved IP Address:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Select the radio button next to the reserved address you want to edit. </li><li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button. </li><li>Edit the IP Address, MAC Address or Device Name. </li><li>Click the <strong>Accept</strong> button when finished. </li></ol>
<p><strong>To Delete A Reserved IP Address:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Select the radio button next to the reserved address you want to delete. </li><li>Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button. </li></ol>
<p>I clicked on ADD...and saw the 2 Devices that where currently powered on and assigned IP addresses, one of which was the Printer which is 192.168.1.5....and again, the Printers IP address is Static, all others are dymanic.&nbsp; This almost makes me think that
 if I I bullet the Printers IP address....that the Router will RESERVE 192.168.1.5......always and ONLY for the Printer thereby no other Device could be assigned this IP address.....and if I am correct....I wouldn't get the "Windows has detected an IP Address
 Conflict" (and Windowns System Event Viewer report shows its this IP address ending in 1.5 that is the Conflict).....</p>
<p>Is this correct? Go ahead and use this RESERVE IP Address Feature of the Router?&nbsp; I don't want to proceed if other issues could surface.....</p>

<p>You're exactly right! Not all routers offer this feature and the steps to use it differ on each box so I didn't mention it.</p>
<p>But yes, reserving the printer's IP address is a perfect solution to this issue! I say go for it!</p>

            this is a classic Microsoft issue. Microsoft Corporation has supplied software that includes default network solutions that are not really solutions but real headaches for consumers. The issue with default static ip addresses assigned by Microsoft is that
 they are not editable by the end-user which means end users will always experience the ip conflict label whenever routers are unable to 'lease' an ip address to the NIC managed by the Ip properties of Microsoft's communication stack software. End users are
 not given access to controlling the rogue 169.254. whatever static ip address forcibly assigned to their NIC which leaves Windows users totally high and dry, marooned, without any help what so ever.

<h2>            Can i install windows 7 drivers on a windows 10 system&#63;</h2>
                    I am building a CD ingest station using a pentium D 820. I bought an Intel D975XBX2 motherboard. I found out that intel did not make drivers for their lga 775 boards for windows 8, 8.1 and 10. they did make windows 7 drivers. If i were to install windows
 10 on the machine and then try the windows 7 drivers would they work? and yes the system meets minimum specs for windows 10 so don't try that.

            Windows 10 and Windows 7 share a somewhat similar driver model, so, you could try, but its not guaranteed to work.

            That entirely depends on Manufacturer. Some might work or some might not. You can try running the Setup file in compatibility mode.

            I think yes because of similar driver model.

<p>Windows Update error 800706ba can occur if an update installation crashes.</p>
<p>To correct the problem, you need restart your computer, and then run Windows Update again by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Windows Update by clicking the Start button<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%25207%2fmain%2f4%2ff%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33.jpg" />.
 In the search box, type Update, and then, in the list of results, click Windows Update.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the left pane, click Check for updates, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If any updates are found, click Install updates.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%25207%2fMain%2f1%2f8%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b.jpg" />&nbsp;If
 you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If the problem persists after you've followed the steps above, go to the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/ph/6527#tab0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/ph/6527#tab0</a> website to request support by <strong>
e&nbsp;mail</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Copied</strong> response from&nbsp;Robear Dyer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OPTION A: You can hide these two Optional, non-security updates.</p>
<p>1. Stop the Automatic Updates service:</p>
<p>Start &gt; Run &gt; (type in) <strong><em>services.msc</em></strong> &gt; [OK]</p>
<p>Double-click Automatic Updates &gt; Click on Stop</p>
<p>(Stopping the service will take a moment)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Delete the contents of the Download folder:</p>
<p>Start &gt; Run &gt; (type in) <strong><em>%windir%\SoftwareDistribution</em></strong> &gt; [OK]</p>
<p>Open the Download folder and delete its contents</p>
<p>Close the window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Go to Windows Update website | Select CUSTOM and allow the scan to complete | Uncheck/deselect<strong>KB982524</strong> &amp;
<strong>KB982168</strong> and hide them ("Don't show me this update again").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Start the Automatic Updates service:</p>
<p>Start &gt; Run &gt; (type in) services.msc &gt; [OK]</p>
<p>Double-click Automatic Updates &gt; Click on Start</p>
<p>(Starting the service will take a moment)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OPTION B: First run the Fix It in this KB article &amp; see if the update will install after doing so:</p>
<p>How to fix MSI software update registration corruption issues&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971187</a>&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If no joy, see...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When installing updates using Windows update or Microsoft Update you may receive Error 0x643 or 0x80070643&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then proceed per the following:</p>
<p>Step #1 =&gt; Before doing anything else, write down what .NET Framework versions are currently installed:</p>
<p>How to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are installed and whether service packs have been applied [finally revised 05 August 2010 - HALLELUJAH!]&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step #2 =&gt; Now see Resolution Method 2 in this related KB article:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100</a>&gt;</p>
<p>After running the .NET Framework Cleanup Tool (not the Windows Installer Cleanup utility!), reinstall all .NET Framework versions (but only the ones you wrote down in #1 above) manually using the download links on the page then
 run Windows Update manually to install security updates for same.</p>
<p>Download links for .NET Framework Cleanup Tool:</p>

<p>NB: If you remove .NET Framework 3.5 (SP1) using the tool, reinstalling .NET Framework 3.5 will also install .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 and 3.0 SP2; then Windows Update will offer .NET Framework 3.5 SP1.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT! =&gt; If you remove .NET Framework 3.5 (SP1), reinstall your .NET Framework versions in the following order:</p>
<p>1. .Net Framework 3.5, then...</p>
<p>2. .Net Framework 1.1, then...</p>
<p>3. .Net Framework 1.1 SP1</p>

 Cleanup Tool.</p>
<p>Step #3 =&gt; Check-in at Windows Update and install any critical security updates offered.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Error recovery - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Error recovery</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope somebody will be able to help me I have a Dell Inspiron 530 running windows 7 Ultimate (if I recall correctly) 64 bit which will no longer load. This is disastrous for me as I'm in the final month of my degree and I have my work on this computer as
 well as all of my other documents and media files. Not all of it is backed up so I need to be able to fix this without wiping my hard drive or erasing any files. Here's the story so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer started installing Windows 10, automatically, without me actually wanting to upgrade to Windows 10. The timing was horrible as I then lost power to the computer during the early part of the installation (copying files 1%). Now when I turn on
 my computer I get the message&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows Error Recovery</p>
<p>Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both options</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Launch startup repair&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Start Windows normally</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting windows normally loads the 'Starting Windows' screen before restarting . Startup repair leads me to the following;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6397dec0-244c-420d-b676-59672daeb8b6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6397dec0-244c-420d-b676-59672daeb8b6" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By going into the advanced options for system recovery and support I tried to do a System Restore but got this;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4951a213-d499-4ded-b9b8-d6f8d3ee6e70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4951a213-d499-4ded-b9b8-d6f8d3ee6e70" /></a></p>
<p>This is particularly strange as I definitely had at least one manually created restore point as well as others which I believe would've been created during updates etc. I tried to run the memory diagnostic tool which runs the tests as normal without finding
 any issues then goes to the 'Starting Windows' screen, then restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By searching these forums for advice I've also tried some of the other tips mentioned by going through the advanced boot options menu. Safe mode loads Windows files, then says please wait and then restarts - safe mode with networking also does the same thing.
 When trying 'Last known good configuration' I get the 'Starting Windows' screen before my PC restarts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So having done all of that, here I am to try and get some advice from you guys before taking my PC to a shop and shelling out however much money I'm going to have to shell out to get this fixed. As I mentioned earlier I am a student and am currently unemployed
 so if I could find a way to fix this myself that would be great as money is tight for me right now but I do need a quick fix and one which doesn't involve me loosing all of my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help me?</p>

            <p>Chances are (99.99%) that your Dell computer came with a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. Failing to fully-remove the free-trialware by&nbsp;running the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool may have something to do with your situation. But I think the power failure
 (and possibly a power surge afterward) is the #1 troublemaker. That being said...</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply PA Bear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you're right, I probably did have a free McAfee trial pre installed on my computer when I bought it. My computer came with Windows Vista preinstalled but when I upgraded to Windows 7 I put all of my files and programs I wanted to keep onto an external
 hard drive and then zero filled my hard drive using SeaTools for DOS to make sure I'd gotten rid of all of the accumulated junk to the best of my abilities. I do (or did) have an active McAfee subscription on my PC but I'm pretty sure there was no longer any
 free trial version because of how **** I was about having a clean install of Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of interest why do you think this would be a contributing factor to my situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I'm unable to start my computer in safe mode (with or without networking) as stated above, attempting to start in safe mode through the advanced boot options menu (accessed by pressing F8) just shows me 'loading Windows files' followed by
 'please wait' and then my computer restarts again :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my PC connected to the mains via an extension box with surge protection so I don't think it would've been affected by a power surge but I think you're right the the loss of power during the Windows 10 upgrade is the likely cause here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is how can I fix it without loosing my files?</p>

            <p>1&nbsp; It seems that your most pressing concern is to rescue your files [including any saved application installation files, emails containing product keys, ...].&nbsp; You are the best individual to do this task&nbsp;- possibly&nbsp;with some&nbsp;assistance from&nbsp;a suitably competent
 friend or helper.</p>
<p>1.1&nbsp; To do this you will need to boot your computer from a USB/DVD and then use its facilities to crawl over your HDD looking for your files and copying them to an external HDD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1.2&nbsp; The boot disk could be a Windows 7/10 System repair disk or installation disk, any number of rescue disks such as Ubuntu boot disks [<em>but I understand you have to be careful with Ubuntu disks to make sure you do not accidentally install Ubuntu instead
 of just booting up with it once</em>].&nbsp; Most of the major backup utility &amp; antimalware rescue disks also allow you to get at your system.</p>
<p>1.3&nbsp; The procedures you would then use to crawl around looking for your files would depend on which disk you booted up with.&nbsp; The Windows disks, for example,&nbsp;allow you to get to a Command prompt window.&nbsp; Many of the others have rudimentary file explorers
 which would be sufficient for this task.&nbsp; Even the Windows disks' Command prompt windows can be cajoled into providing you with a very basic explorer interface [I could find at least two links explaining how to use it this way].</p>
<p>1.4&nbsp; Once you decide what you will boot with then post back here so people can advise you how best to use it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1.5&nbsp; In any posts state what applications you use and what you know about where you have stored the relevant files - MS Office Outlook, just for example, stores its main pst files in an obscure location by default but you might have changed that to a better
 one already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; Once you have secured your files you can decide how to proceed with the main repair [spending money or expending time &amp; effort].&nbsp; Somebody else might be able to suggest a quicker repair so&nbsp;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;concentrated on your&nbsp;situation if that is not possible.</p>
<p>2.1&nbsp; Do you have a recent system image?&nbsp; This could achieve a complete repair, potentially&nbsp;in under half an hour if your OS drive is separate from your data drive.</p>
<p>2.2&nbsp; Might you be in a position to use another computer for your studies for the next month so you can delay fixing the computer&nbsp;until July?&nbsp; Note that Windows 10 upgrades have to be complete before 29th July.</p>
<p>23&nbsp; You'll need to explain if you&nbsp;still have&nbsp;your Windows 7 installation disk.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2.3&nbsp; You will also need to find out if your Windows was 32 or 64 bit.&nbsp; This will be stated on your installation DVD label if you still have it.&nbsp; If it was an OEM rather than a retail licence then you will probably have only bought one type of DVD so your
 purchase documentation&nbsp;should&nbsp;also have the information.</p>
<p>2.4&nbsp; Can you find the Certificate of authenticity &amp; check that you can still read the product key?&nbsp; This will probably be&nbsp;gathering dust in the same shoebox as&nbsp;your original installation disk or else in the purchase documentation if it was an electronic
 delivery from the Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck,</p>

    <title>Headset Mute Button Disabling Mic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headset Mute Button Disabling Mic</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased a headset with mic after using a desktop mic for some time. I have no issues with the mic until I use the button on the headset to mute the mic. This causes the receive volume in the audio device manager to spike to full, even though
 it isn't picking up any sound. Once I unmute the mic this remains at peak volume and the mic does not work at all. After about a minute the volume slowly works its way down and then works again. This is annoying when trying to use ventrilo as I have to wait
 for the mic to come back on.</p>
<p>I've done a bunch of searching and played with settings to no avail.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, you have to activate Windows to use most of its utilities. Windows needs to be activated to install all Windows Updates successfully. If you are getting activation errors, I would suggest you to follow the below provided methods and check if the issue

    <title>Start PXE over IPv4 message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jan philips  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start PXE over IPv4 message</h2>
                    <p>I got a new computer with Windows 10 about two weeks ago.&nbsp; It came with a SSD drive.&nbsp; I added a hard drive and all was OK.&nbsp; Then yesterday I added another hard drive.&nbsp; Now when the computer boots, I get the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>checking media presence</p>
<p>media present</p>
<p>start PXE over IPv4</p>
<p>
</p><p>That stays there a minute or two, then something flashes on the screen (too fast to read), then it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>checking media presence</p>
<p>media present</p>
<p>start PXE over IPv6 (note change from 4 to 6)</p>
<p>
</p><p>for a minute or two, then it finally boots.&nbsp; The drives seem to be working perfectly, once it boots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is causing this message, slow boot time, and how can it be fixed?</p>

            <p>Thank you.&nbsp; The user's guide doesn't say how to do that.&nbsp; But F11 gets me in to it.&nbsp; (This is on Windows 10.)&nbsp; After several screens, I get to some choices, UEFI Firmware Settings and Startup Settings are two of them.&nbsp; I select UEFI Firmware Settings and
 it gives me more choices, F9 to restart to change Boot Device Options and F10 to BIOS setup, and there are other choices.&nbsp; I choose F9 and it reboots, and shows me some choices:</p>
<p>
</p><p>IPv4 ....</p>
<p>IPv6....</p>
<p>Windows Boot Manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>and below that it says to ENTER to Select Boot Device or ESC to Boot Using Default.&nbsp; I move the arrow down to Windows Boot Manager and press ENTER, but the next time I restart, it still goes through the IPv4 and IPv6 stuff.&nbsp; Should I do Boot Using Default
 instead?&nbsp; Or is there something else I should change?</p>

            If this is your first time restarting since getting Windows 10, you probably have a boatload of Windows Updates to install so, yeah, it's going to take plenty of time. Anything good on TV?

    <title>Bluetooth audio is interrupted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james hun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth audio is interrupted</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung HS3000 bluetooth stereo headset. It was working fine on Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 on my Samsung&nbsp;350V5C laptop. But when I updated to Windows 10 and connect to my headset, audio starts to skip, be interrupted and desynchronize. To better express
 the issue; it is similar to what happens when I move too much further from the PC and the signal gets weak, except I am only a meter away from it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using this headset with various devices including very old and new android devices, it is a shame that Windows 10 is the only thing that is causing me a problem with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you ask; my computer manufacturer doesn't have a sound or bluetooth driver for Windows 10. I guess it is the new marketing policy of Windows to cause problems with people's current laptops so they are pushed to buy new ones from the companies you
 sell your software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried removing and pairing the headset again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have aldread tried turning off Hands-free Telephone from services tab.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Well you sort of answered your own question. If the driver or device is not<br />
Windows 10 compatible that is the issue. <br />
<br />
Try this :<br />
<br />
In Device Manager - Double Click the device - Drivers tab - update driver<br />
(will probably do nothing) - when that completes Right Click on the device<br />
and uninstall it- then Reboot.<br />
<br />
If needed try re-installing the driver in compatibility mode :<br />
<br />
Download the latest available drivers from the maker's website. Right Click <br />
the setup.exe (installable file&nbsp; if a ZIP unpack first) - click properties then <br />
the Compatibility tab. Check Run in Compatibility mode - select the OS <br />
same as your driver. <br />
<br />
The compatibility center indicates the Samsung HS3000 is Windows 10 <br />
compatible.<br />
<br />
I can't find any information on the compatibility of the&nbsp;Samsung&nbsp;350V5C<br />
though it seems to be since the site discusses installing Windows 10.<br />
<br />
And check with Samsung Support :<br />
<br />
Samsung - Support - click the&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;link <br />
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/main/supportMain.do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.samsung.com/us/support/main/supportMain.do</span></a><br />

<br />
Be sure you have the latest BIOS/Firmware, chipset, and other major drivers.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<h2>            convert WIN10 driver 64bit to 32 bit</h2>
                    <p>I have a 32 bit computer "Acer switch10" and received software with driver for 64bit as an extra file. I am supposed to install 64.
</p>
<p>Installed the software on 32 bit computer, but <strong>USB </strong>driver does not show working.
<strong>Can I convert 64 driver to 32, How?</strong> Software vendor / programmer wrote he does not currently (2017.03.) know why 32 drivers won't work in WIN10 (what changes MS had made?).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have a 32-bit Windows 10, it is advisable that you download apps and drivers that are only 32-bit. You may download the 64-bit apps and drivers, however, it may cause compatibility issues. Converting a 64-bit app or driver to 32-bit is restricted.
 You will need to download a new one that is compatible to your system, which in this case is 32-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, feel free to post.</p>
