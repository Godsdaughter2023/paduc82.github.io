<h2>            Windows Search Bar becomes unclickable, cannot change default applications</h2>
                    <p>Main specs: surface laptop 64 bit windows 10 pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>After KB4090913 patch (part of the windows 10 1709), 1. my windows search bar becomes not clickable,&nbsp; the color turned grey, and clicking on it does not respond in any way. 2. I cannot change my default programs setting, clicking on anything does not change
 anything, also, a “reset default app” notification pops up at every boot-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I cannot revert the update, tried it once and the act of uninstalling the update itself failed.</p>

<p>Hi Chen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting the PC usually fixes issues about Windows search. In case that it didn't help, you may run the troubleshooter for Windows search. Kindly refer to this
<em><strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_search10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a></strong></em>to download the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to your issue about the default programs, we suggest that you perform a reset of the default apps.
<em><strong>Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default apps &gt; Reset. </strong></em>After resetting, try changing the default apps according to your preference and options available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please let us know of the result.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Nuno PdS,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This kind of issue may need us to perform a series of steps for us to resolve it. Based on your post, you were able to try some suggestions to troubleshoot the problem. Since you reset the Surface, please download and run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit.
 It will get the latest driver and software updates for the device. Aside from that, it will check the system for other possible software issues. For more information and to download the tool, go
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit, perform a forced shutdown. While the Surface is on, press the power button for 10 seconds until the screen goes off. The updates will be applied and the software will be loaded properly upon the next restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem continues after following the suggestions above, let's boot into the Surface UEFI to check if this could be a hardware issue. Shut down the Surface and make sure it is completely off. Press and hold the volume-up button then press and release
 the power button. When you see the Surface logo, you can let go of the volume-up button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without changing any settings, try to navigate through the UEFI menu using the touchpad or arrow keys on the keyboard. If the keys do not work, then what you're having is a hardware problem. Please
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact Microsoft Support</a></strong> or take the Surface to a
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store</a></strong>. They will be able to help you with issues involving the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the keyboard works in the UEFI, then we would need to perform further software troubleshooting. Please update the post once you're able to perform the suggestions so I can be alerted and I'll get back to you the soonest I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

    <title>Problem with Windows 10 Fall Creator&#39;s Update and Backup Software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meld51  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with  Windows 10 Fall Creator&#39;s Update and Backup Software</h2>
                    <p>In the last week I have installed the Fall Creator's Update on one of my two PCs. I am a user of Microsoft Onedrive so that I can keep my files in the cloud and also keep my 2 PCs synchronised. I
 also perform a monthly backup of both PCs to a hard disk drive using commercially available backup software called Retrospect. This is so that I can keep&nbsp; a reasonably current file set offline where Ransomware is less likely to get at it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Updated PC I have invoked the new Windows Explorer "Files&nbsp; on Demand" service. The other PC does not have FOD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that I can no longer perform an offline back up my Onedrive folders on the PC with FOD invoked.&nbsp; I am still able to back up my Onedrive folders on the other PC which does not have the
 Fall Creator's Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this the expected functionality for backup software used with File on Demand? This is a real problem for me so I hope this problem can be resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PC1: Windows 10 Ver 1703 Build 15063.726</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PC2: Windows 10 Pro Version 1709 Build 16299.64 (Fall Creator's Update)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Retrospect Ver 11.5.0.190</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            You are the second user I have read reporting issues with backing up OneDrive folder. Others have reported issues trying backup OneDrive using File History after upgrading to Windows 10 1709. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft must have made changes to ensure you don't some how corrupt it.

<h2>            Laptop windows 7 black screen no windows no cursor</h2>
                    I have a Lenovo Y560 and it was working fine. I powered down without any problems and the next time I start it back up I get the Lenovo start up where you can press f2 and f12 and then in the top left the cursor line will flash a couple times then it goes
 black. Ctrl+Alt+Del sends me back to the Lenovo page.&nbsp; F2 asks for a phoenix password that I have no idea what it may be. F12 sends me back to Lenovo page. F8 does not work. Any ideas what may have happened? It's only a little over a year old and don't have
 the funds to fix or get a new one. Please tell me it's something that I can fix. TIA

            No I have no made any changes on the computer. Just using it like I normally do.
<br />
<br />
The problem with all the suggestions made is that I don't think that I have a disk for the laptop so I can't go beyond the black screen to do anything. The Lenovo has a restore button and when I push it nothing happens, it just stays black. I think I've push
 every button there is to push and all I get is the black screen. <br />

<h2>            the menu key works but shift f10 doesn&#39;t in win xp</h2>
                    I am using Windows XP SP3, and there is an application that I use that still uses the F-keys.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I noticed the other day that the Shift+F10 keyboard command doesn't work in this application, and no one knows why it isn't working. It doesn't seem to work whether I use the built-in or a third party keyboard and even over remote desktop if wasn't working.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After searching around I noticed Shift+F10 is also the command to bring up a contextual menu (like the menu key), but even this doesn't work in other applications</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only thing I can assume is that there is something installed on the computer that has stopped this key combo from working, does anyone know what I cna do to fix this?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thanks in advance</div>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</div>
<div>2. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to try these steps and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>Check the issue status in safe mode.</div>
<div>A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP.</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>If the computer works fine in safe mode. Keep the computer on a clean boot and check for the issue status.<br />
How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow these steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>If above steps fail to fix the issue, uninstall and reinstall the keyboard driver.</div>
<div>Uninstall Keyboard driver.</div>
<div>a) Right-click the My Computer icon<br />
b) Select Manage from the menu.<br />
c) Select Device Manager from the System Tools that are listed in the resulting display.
<br />

e) Right click on Keyboard device.<br />
f) Click on Uninstall<br />
g) Restart the computer</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Download the Keyboard driver from the manufacturer website and install on your computer.<br />

<p>Passmark Keytest shows the LSHIFT keydown, but after that, F9 or F10 are not seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same for RSHIFT.</p>

<p>LSHIFT F1 brings up windows help</p>
<p>LSHIFT F2-F8, F11,F12 all get captured correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issue is on for LSHIFT-F9, LSHIFT-F10, RSHIFT-F9, RSHIFT-F10</p>
<p>New behavior, only updates have been windows updates, Acrobat reader, flash.</p>

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker - images have been replaced by &#34;X&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>When I&nbsp; open a raw WMM file, the audio plays normally, the titles are properly displayed, but each image has been replaced by an X.</p>
<p>The message: source image can't be found, even though the photos are in plain sight on the desk top. WMM cannot recognize the source photos.</p>
<p>I know the problem: I was trying to clean up my desktop and moved the file of raw WMM files and source photos into the Pictures folder. When it became immediately obvious that the move negatively impacted WMM, I moved all the files back to the desktop, the
 original location.</p>
<p>But despite correcting the files location problem, WMM still can't locate source photos. I have over 100 raw WMM files, and not a single picture can be opened in WMM.</p>
<p>Please help. Thanks</p>

<p><span>Hi Greg1212,</span></p>
<p><span>This issue occurs when the source files are corrupt or could not be found, and you must locate the missing source files</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Movie Maker does not store an actual copy of source files; instead, a reference to the original source file is created and appears in
 Windows Movie Maker as a clip. So any edits that you make in Windows Movie Maker do not affect the original source file. You can edit audio clips, video clips, or pictures in Windows Movie Maker and be confident that the original audio, video, or picture source
 files remain unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span>Try this step to locate the files.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Contents pane, click the file that is missing or could not be found (that is, the file with a red X).</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<strong>Edit</strong>,
 and then click <strong>Browse for Missing File</strong>. If Windows Movie Maker finds the file, the red X disappears.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 Windows Movie Maker cannot find the file, click<strong>File</strong>, click <strong>
Import Media Items</strong>, and then browse for the missing file.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that you are unable to upgrade to Windows 10 pro from Home which is ending up with an error. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue&nbsp;might have caused due to the system file conflicts in Windows or because of any third party applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let's try the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Perform a </span><strong><span>clean boot</span></strong></span> and check if the same issue&nbsp;persists.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>to disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"> </span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong> </span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run
 a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong> </span><span><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> I also suggest you to perform a <strong>
SFC scan (System file checker) scan </strong>and check if the issue resolves<strong>.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Refer: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>The solution was to delete the contents of several temp folders:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete the contents of that folder, restart, then try again.</p>

            You report suggests that you enabled disk space quota management. Why would you do this? It is normally used in a corporate environment where several people share the same PC.<br />
<br />
Here is how you can turn it off:<br />
<ol>
<li>Click Start.</li><li>Click "Computer"</li><li>Right-click the system drive. It is usually drive C:.</li><li>Left-click Properties.</li><li>Click Quota.</li><li>Click "Show quota settings".</li><li>Untick "Enable quota management".<br />
</li></ol>

            Thanks.&nbsp; I think it was a different issue; some sort of virus that was turning on something called proquota. I disabled all access to this component and the problem went away.&nbsp; Thanks for your help!<br />

            I finally solved my issue.. I downloaded a free copy of a Windows 8.1 ISO ran the program &nbsp;then I went to the recovery section and did a refresh of my computer. When it was done the App store was working properly. I am able to download and install plus
 run all apps without issue.

<h2>            High Disk Usage Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have discovered that, using Task Manager, that there are various processes that use up a lot of disk activity - up too a 100%. These processes are not high all the time but seem to go up and down randomly, even when the computer is not in use.
 There are a few processes that have high disk activity such as the processess "system" and the various "svchost,exe", to name a few. &nbsp;Have others encountered the same problems? Any help would be great.</p>

            Typically these are background updates, caching, or indexing.&nbsp; Unless you suspect a virus, my first suggestion is to leave the computer on overnight to let it wrap up all the work, and then see if it settles down and stops being a problem.

<p>I've been helping my friend with his Xbox one (I dared not pre-order it knowing stuff like this would happen. Until the bugs get worked out I won't buy it yet.) Anywho, we left the darn thing alone for a bit, made sure it wasn't hot. Adjusted cords, nothing
 was loose. It powered on for about a half hour before dying, so finally we decided that him requesting a replacement/repair for the console was the best thing.
</p>
<p>In all honesty I think the only thing going to fix these issues are replacements/repairs. Till then I guess people just have to wait it out. :/ Much to the regret I have saying it. I cannot help digress the odd increasing severity of such issues, it seems
 almost everyone is having them. At least the warranty covers repair/replacement right? Haha.

<p>I'm having the same problem. &nbsp;I received a replacement from Microsoft and it did not fix the problem. Since two different consoles are doing the exact same thing, I don't think it is due to the console itself. &nbsp;I'm hoping it is the power supply (which I
 am now sending in for a replacement, since they aren't sold separately right now). &nbsp;I don't know what else it could be, if it isn't the power supply.</p>

 on just XBOX ONE problems and they said they have not even been looking at the forms. i told him to start looking at them and told him to pass it on to head Microsoft people to look at the forms. cuz most of the problems going on they dont even know about
 or heard about. i told the dude that there is lots and lots of people having these problems and there all one the forms, so he better start looking at them. -You people need to start calling them and telling them these things.</p>

    <title>NTFS corruption after Fall Creators Update&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timyoungls  say:</h3>
<h2>            NTFS corruption after Fall Creators Update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed the fall creator's update and started running into this issue shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>It seems that various programs that create a directory and delete a directory have this same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end result is a directory entry that is visible (it shows up as a directory in windows explorer, from a command-line you can do a dir and see it, etc), but the directory cannot be deleted.</p>
<p>In Windows Explorer, it says it needs admin privs to delete.&nbsp; I click "yes" to try again using admin privs, and then it says, "You need permission to perform this action.&nbsp; You require permission from the computer's administrator to make changes to this folder."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into powershell as administrator, I can see the file when I do a "dir"</p>
<p>When I go to delete it, I get:&nbsp;</p>
del : Access is denied<br />
At line:1 char:1<br />
+ del app.publish<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; + CategoryInfo&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : PermissionDenied: (C:\Users\USER\PATH\app.publish:String) [Remove-Item], Unauthorized<br />

<p>
</p><p>If I scan the disk with Windows running, it does not find anything.&nbsp; But if I force a checkdisk and reboot, it seems to clear it up.&nbsp; A reboot without doing the checkdisk does not solve anything.</p>

<p>After the update finished, everything looked fine, though I did not try *everything* on my computer.&nbsp; So I cannot say, for sure, which order the problems came in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I noticed a problem was when I tried to install itunes.&nbsp; It kept complaining that it did not have permission to do so.&nbsp; I tracked it down to a directory that I could not delete.&nbsp; It was a directory that had been there for the old version of
 itunes that had been deleted and re-created during the install.&nbsp; I gave up for a while.&nbsp; iTunes was not that important to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few hours later I tried to open a Word doc.&nbsp; It gave me a message that it could not open a temporary file.&nbsp; When I opened the temp folder it was trying to use (my user's appdata temp folder), it said I did not have permissions to look at the folder.&nbsp; I
 could not even look to see what the permissions were on the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My user is an admin account.&nbsp; I know this means it needs to increase the level to admin when it wants to do something with admin permissions, but it could not do it, even when I told it to do it with admin permissions.&nbsp; I tried both through Windows Explorer
 and through a shell prompt (the shell prompt had admin permissions)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After rebooting and messing with it for a bit, I forced a scandisk and rebooted.&nbsp; It scanned to 12% and hung there for quite some time.&nbsp; (4 hours or so at 12%).&nbsp; I ended up rebooting it so I could use the computer for a bit, and then, when I had more time,
 I rebooted to let it continue scanning.&nbsp; The second reboot chugged up to 45% in fairly short order, and then I left it to go watch a movie.&nbsp; It was happily done scanning when I was done with the movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, everything worked.&nbsp; iTunes installed fine and Word opened up fine.&nbsp; Everything was happy until I was working in Visual Studio and did a rebuild.&nbsp; It started to rebuild and then gave me an error.&nbsp; It could not move a file from one directory to
 another.&nbsp; Again, a directory had been created that it could not remove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the directory that I tried to delete five or six different ways (multiple times in windows explorer, through the dos shell, through powershell, through Linux on the shell, and using different tools.)&nbsp; When I rebooted into safe mode, it was gone.&nbsp;
 (maybe it had been deleted but the OS had it cached at the kernel level; opening it in different shells means it was not just Windows Explorer that thought it was there.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What bugs me the most is that it seems to be something that reoccurs.&nbsp; And, since it seems to be happening through a number of different vectors, it seems to be something deeply ingrained to my computer.&nbsp; Not sure if it is a kernel issue, or my HD driver.</p>

<p>Ok.&nbsp; It is nice when a problem consistently returns.</p>
<p>It turned out to be my webroot antivirus.&nbsp; Occam's Razor is not always correct; sometimes multiple things can happen at once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not entirely sure what is happening behind the scenes, and I will try to post a followup for how to solve it instead of rebooting or turning off and on the virus protection...&nbsp; There should be a way to disable checking of a certain directory or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The symptoms are basically that, when a directory of contents is created and then deleted, webroot would do something to the directory (and probably the contents) so it can finish scanning it.&nbsp; So the directory remains, even though it is deleted.&nbsp; You cannot
 see the permissions on the directory, you cannot delete it, and you cannot see the contents of the directory.&nbsp; You cannot remove it, rename it, or do anything to it.&nbsp; It basically blocks your usage of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried it in all cases, but it seems that when a new directory is created and then quickly deleted, the above is what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not yet just sat and watched it for an hour or so to see if it disappears on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, if I disable webroot, then in an instant, the directory disappears, and then I can re-enable the protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of my initial tests, as posted in my first and second post, were probably misleading.&nbsp; After a reboot, I would re-run my tests (reinstall, etc) which would create a new temp folder, delete it, and then block it.&nbsp; I thought the original temp folder was
 blocking it, but the process recreated the problem using the same directory name, so I thought it was the original directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is nice to be able to say that it is not the fall creator's update, nor ntfs corruption.&nbsp; It just happened to coincide with when I did the update.&nbsp; I am not sure if this is something new to webroot, or why it just now showed up.</p>

                    The disc was made from ultrasound at the dr's office. I have tried everything to view the pictures, but&nbsp; the computer insist that windows photo viewer does not support format. Viewing pictures from a disc has never been an issue, before.

            <p><span>Hi</span></p>
<p><span>1. What is the picture file format?<br />
2. What is the exact error message?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>See
</span></strong><span>question:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Understanding-picture-file-types" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Understanding-picture-file-types</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try to open the picture on another computer to see if it's the issue with the pictures or the Windows software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Change which programs Windows uses by default</span></strong><span>
<br />
A default program is the program that Windows uses when you open a particular type of file, such as a music file, an image, or a webpage. For example, if you have more than one web browser installed on your computer, you can choose one of them to be the default
 browser.<br />
<br />
Open Default Programs by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Default Programs.<br />
<br />
In Default Programs, you can:<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>Set your default programs. Use this option to choose which programs you want Windows to use by default. If you want to use your Windows Live Photo Gallery or Photo Gallery to open all photos, use this option.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Creator&#39;s Update Throttled My Download Speed</h2>
                    After installing the update my download speed was throttled down to an average of 9 Mbps; all other network traffic was fine(web browsing and uploads) but download speed was being limited. &nbsp;I spent the next day messing with network adapter settings, messing
 with router settings, stopping services, uninstalling programs, scanning for malware, and deep cleaning the computer. &nbsp;Finally I reverted back to the previous Windows build and downloads were back to an 180 Mbps average. &nbsp;Anyone else have a similar experience?

<p>My mobo has 2 nic, when the cap occours i switch the cable and everything runs fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then after a while the limit kick in in the secondo nic so i just swap the cable another time.</p>

<p>I am having a very similar issue. My download speeds are around 70-80 Mbps before installing the creator's update; but after downloading the update I'm lucky if I get a total of 5 Mbps down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an Edimax AC1200 Wireless LAN USB Adapter for my wireless, and I've locked it to the 5GHz band in the adapter settings. The Router is in the next room over, so my signal is absolutely perfect; When I go back to the previous build my download speed
 is exactly as it was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a similar setup for your wireless connection or do you think this may span over various network adapters? I've heard of plenty of people who have had no issue with the update; and my Lenovo Y700 laptop doesn't appear to take any hit from the
 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it would be related to any of my other hardware, but I am using an i7 4790k CPU in a Z170 motherboard; not sure if my platform may be related. My Laptop on the other hand has an i7 6700HQ.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: As a note, the software on my desktop and on my laptop are almost entirely identical, save for the files and games that I have on the desktop which will not run/cannot be stored on my laptop. That is to say, I do not believe it has anything to do with
 any software I use.</p>

            Thank you.&nbsp; That sound so easy but when I open my Windows Live Mail in my new computer I don't get the people box.&nbsp; I click on an envelope in a menu at the bottom of my windows screen and my email comes up with a menu at the bottom with a contacts icon.&nbsp;
 When I open it there is a list of my contacts that are in my computer.&nbsp; I don't know how to go from that to what you are telling me about signing out go to gmail account and sign back into windows.&nbsp; I don't sign it to windows live mail to get into it and I
 don't sign out ever.&nbsp; Lorraine

    <title>Audio and video intermittent stutter Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobjonesy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio and video intermittent stutter Windows 7</h2>
                    Both my audio and video are stuttering across multiple programs.&nbsp; It is a brief stutter typically about every 2-3 seconds, sometimes more frequent sometimes less.&nbsp; The problem occurs regardless of how much my computer is working, although the stutter length
 seems to increase the harder the computer is working, ie. if cpu usage spikes there will most likely be a longer stutter.&nbsp; It is most noticeable through the audio playback and mouse, but video playback is also affected.<br />
<br />
Some background.&nbsp; I wasn't having this issue for the past 3 years on this machine and it started occurring when my video card died on me.&nbsp; The temporary card had the issue and I thought it might have been a driver conflict or buffer issue.&nbsp; The replacement
 card is now in and it is still doing it.&nbsp; Although it isn't the same exact card it is very similar spec wise brand being the same.<br />
<br />
Typical CPU usage of 1% with maybe 3.2 GB memory used with firefox running.&nbsp; I've tried basically everything I could think of or find.&nbsp; Clean booting still has the issue.&nbsp; Updating every driver I can think of or rolling them back didn't seem to make a difference.&nbsp;
 Disabling firewall, anti-virus, and any non essential programs made no difference.&nbsp; I tried looking for processes that used abnormal amounts of memory and can't find anything suspicious.&nbsp; I haven't flashed my bios yet, I'd like to not destroy my save points
 if possible.&nbsp; I've tried removing old drivers, switching mice, and probably a lot of other things I can't remember at this point.
<br />
<br />
Below are my system specs as of right now.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be great.<br />
<br />
Motherboard: EVGA x58 132-BL-E758-A1<br />
CPU:&nbsp; i7 920 2.67gHz 45N R<br />

    <title>Surface power cover fake charge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> poultrey wolf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface power cover fake charge</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a refurbished surface pro, and then I even more recently bought a surface power cover. My surface power cover will currently function as keyboard, but when I plug in my surface to charge with the power cover attached, the power cover (battery
 2) will read as either 0% or 100%. unplug it when the surface is fully charged, and it will hold that 100% for a bit but then not too terribly long after using the surface on battery (less than 30 minutes), the power cover will be at 0% and my surface will
 be at like 95% ish. What gives?</p>
<p>I've tried multiple restarts, checked for updates numerous times. Even did a refresh on my surface.
<br />
</p>
<p>I will point out that when the surface is fully charged, and the windows says both battery are fully charged, the battery icon at the bottom will say 59% plugged in, not charging.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Any tips?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did remove the sticker on the power cover reminding me to not attach the surface charging cord to the power cover.

            You can't block the Yahoo domain. It's one of the unblockable ones, along with Hotmail, MSN, Live, AOL&nbsp;and Gmail. There are just so many users with addresses on those domains that you risk blocking desirable ones. You'll have to find another way to block
 spam from them.
