            Hello Symorne,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well a system file maybe missing or corrupt! <strong>To help resolve this issue, use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, click
<strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>
Run as administrator</strong>.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>. </li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong> (yes there is a space after sfc)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions. This scan make take a&nbsp; while to complete.&nbsp;
</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps you. Let us know either way. Make it a great day!<br />
<br />

            No, only recovery drives. You will actually have to download the Media Creation Tool then create a bootable copy.

<h2>            Hard drive capacity got cut  nearly in half</h2>
                    My hard drive typically has an overall capacity of around 930 gig which was until recently allocated to the C drive. Of this i have used about 490 gig. Today when i started up my laptop and clicked on my computer the C drive was showing an overall capacity
 of 580 gig. I didn't do any recent installs, formats or changes to the drive but for some reason around 350 gig is just gone. &nbsp;When i checked disk management it showed that the recovery partition is now around 350 gig of which only 1.5 gig is being used. Is
 there any thing i can do about this as 350 gig is alot of space to take from the c drive.

I can see some contradiction in your report. In one place you mention that the partition size for drive C: is 530 GBytes. Elsewhere you think it is 930 GBytes. Which one is it? Did you repartition your disk recently?
<div><br />
<div>You also need to be aware of the difference between partition <b>size</b>&nbsp;and partition
<b>usage</b>. The size of a partition is constant and does not change when storing data on &nbsp;it. It's the same with your disk: Although your subject line says "Drive capacity got cut in half", the capacity of the drive is the same today as it was yesterday.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are unable to resolve your problem then I recommend that you post the complete table you see in the disk manager (diskmgmt.msc).</div>

            there is no contradictions in my post. until recently my c drive has always had an overall capacity of 930gig. Like when u clock on my computer and it shows C drive there it would say 930gig. &nbsp;but since &nbsp;yesterday its suddenly showing an overall capacity
 off 580 gig

Ok, let's see the values of the table you get when you run the disk manager. Remember to include
<b>all</b>&nbsp;the values you see on the left side of the frame, right down to the bottom.

            Your disk size is exactly the same size as it was before: nearly 932 GBytes. However, at the far end of the disk you have a partition of 350 GBytes that appears to be unformatted. Since it is impossible for disks to get repartitioned by themselves you
 need to find out from the various users of this machine what happened. As the partition is unused you can use the Disk Manager to expand the existing partition for drive C: so that it once more uses the whole disk. Make sure to back up your data beforehand
 and to check on a different machine if you can read the backed up stuff.&nbsp;

You cannot extend drive C: until you have made room for it by deleting the unwanted partition.

<h2>            OLEAUT32.dll is missing and I cannot open any files, install anything or Roll back. Black screen - Please Help.</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 7. After leaving a game of Diablo 3 my computer froze and I had to manually restart it. During the restart, the computer started scanning, so I left it to it. During the scan, it has deleted several 'things'. It has restarted itself yet
 again and the error OLEAUT32.dll has popped up. When I log in, in no matter what mode i.e. Normal or safe mode, the desktop is black with no icons, I cannot open any folders/files. I can go to Windows task manager (WTM) but anytime I want to do anything the
 error comes up and a further error of 0xc0000142 comes up on occasion. While in WTM&nbsp; I have navigated to Services -&gt; Services ... and the OLEAUT32.dll error comes up again. I have tried to follow some of the ways highlighted in this article&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-oleaut32-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623880</p>
<p>Yet, non&nbsp;of them seem to be working or I just can't do the highlighted instructions as my Windows is not responsive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the msvbvm50.exe from the Microsoft&nbsp;website, yet I have no way of opening it on my desktop. I have placed it on my USB drive in hopes that I can install it through BIOS somehow, but I don't know if that is possible. The only way my limited
 knowledge of computers sees a resolution to this problem is formatting the Desktop computer. Although, this is the last thing I would like to do as I have files which I'd like to keep on the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no way to resolve this problem I would ask for suggestions as to how I could retrieve some of the files on the desktop such as opening the HDD through a laptop or similar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I have tried restarting the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 2: I can open CMD but I cannot open anything with it including msconfig.</p>

<p>Hello Luke,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oleaut32.dll is a shared file installed by the operating system and used by the Setup program. The Setup program is looking for a newer version of the file than the one that you have installed on your system. I suggest that you run a System File Checker
 by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open command prompt as administrator.</li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow</li></ol>
<p>The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</a></strong>
 for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this helps or if you have other inquiries.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem with Luke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I read your reply Ms. Carmela, I immediately start my laptop and tried to follow the steps you stated. But or desktop is pure black only the cursor can be seen and moved. How can I/we be able to open the commad prompt and run it as an administrator?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping to hear from you soon..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Chrome shows a &#34;Failed - Blocked&#34; error everytime I try to download a file and I can&#39;t open many programmes because of &#34;SHLWAPI.dll&#34; error&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I updated my laptop a couple of days ago (Windows Update). When I for example want to download a picture from Google images, the download bar pops up as it usually would when you download a file, but instead the text "Failed - Blocked" is shown. Also, whenever
 I try to open some programme, for example windows movie maker or skype, I can't! It say's something about accesspoint UrlCompareW and how it is not found in SHLWAPI.dll???? Please can someone tell me how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S.: I also have Norton Internet Security which got updated a few days ago. However, on my other computer Chrome works fine so I don't think it's my antivirus software.</p>

<p><span>I will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your computer will not work properly if a Windows Dynamic-Link Library (.dll) file is damaged or missing. When this happens, you will receive an error message similar to this: "[program name] Illegal system DLL relocation." The .dll file type contains
 instructions, or code, to run scripts that open dialog boxes. These important graphical elements are necessary for computer user interaction in most software programs.</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox one to xbox 360 party chat compatibility</h2>
                    
<p>Hello sir or miss if you are reading this i would like to recommend something for the Xbox one compatibility its nice that we can play Xbox 360 games alone or with a friend but it would be nice to be able to have a Xbox live party while you play i know that
 will be hard but it would be amazing because once i heard that you could play i wanted to sell my 360 to get an Xbox one but now ill only be able to talk to them through Skype or something else so if you guys can work even harder i know that lots of customers
 will be happy especially my friends because they have been struggling with the same problem as me thank you so much for reading this have a wonderful day sir or miss</p>

<h2>            Avatar item.</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so..</p>
<p>I bought an monkey for my avatar, since it was going to clash with my Gorilla Space suit from Black Ops.</p>
<p>I had it for the longest time.&nbsp; The only way I could really get to see it, is if I didn't touch it or I go to my account thing itself.&nbsp; But I didn't waste time on that, it was gaming or bust.</p>
<p>And then one day, I decided to show my friends how awesome my gamertag was and how awesome it is that my avatar totally clashed with my gamertag.</p>
<p>Monkey isn't there.</p>
<p>Monkey isn't even on the avatar marketplace.</p>
<p>WHERE DID MY MONKEY GO?!</p>

<h2>            Replaced video card but Win 10 app still sees old card</h2>
                    Have a Compaq Presario desktop that my wife uses for accounting and tax work running win 7. &nbsp;Clicked on the Get Win 10 app and it said sorry the video board, nVidia GeForce 6000 series was not compatible. &nbsp;Got a new board today, nVidia GeForce 600 series
 which I know is compatible, and installed it today. &nbsp;The old board was on the motherboard and I disabled it in BIOS. &nbsp;When I run System Info, it shows the new board. &nbsp;BUT, when I run the Get Win 10 app, I get the same message referring to the old board. &nbsp;Naturally,
 it doesn't let me download Win 10. &nbsp;What should I do. &nbsp;I know I can just download Win 10 to a USB/DVD and install it, but I'm afraid it will still "see" the old board and cause problems. &nbsp;Any advice or suggestions?

            Sorry for late reply. &nbsp;Searching on line, I found that the Win 10 icon was the result of a windows up date. &nbsp;I searched for 3035583 and 2976978 updates and uninstalled them. &nbsp;I then updated the computer and re downloaded them. &nbsp;Overnight they did their
 magic and I once again had the icon. &nbsp;When I clicked on it this time, it said the computer was ready to upgrade to Win 10. &nbsp;Went ahead with it and had a good install. &nbsp;Hope this helps

            <p>I had the same issues with a graphics card that didn't pass the test.&nbsp; After replacing the video card, the Compatibility Appraiser kept telling me the old card was still there even when the Device Manager said I had the new card.&nbsp; I even ran the Appraiser
 from the&nbsp;elevated command line prompt but no change.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the KB3035583 update, rebooted, and did not see the Win 10 Upgrade icon in the Task Bar any more.&nbsp;&nbsp;I ran Windows Update again.&nbsp; It downloaded KB3035583, and I installed it.&nbsp; Within a minute or so, the Win 10&nbsp;Upgrade icon came back and re-ran
 the Appraiser correctly.&nbsp; It then let me download Win 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Win 10 upgrade app needs to be modified to enable it to run again without just loading the old report.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.</p>

    <title>The Testament of Sherlock Holmes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Testament of Sherlock Holmes</h2>
                    
<p>Am I the only one to have bought this game?<br />
<br />
I missed out on the previous title of <strong>vs Jack the Ripper</strong> so thought I'd grab this one.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The graphics and voice work are fairly ropey but it has the investigative charm that LA Noire was missing. You really have to search around for the clues to solve the case, though you can call on Holmes' sixth sense for help (*cough* not that I do that) should
 you need it.&nbsp;You then get to put the clues you've found together on the deduction board to deduce what really happened.<br />
<br />
Not exactly a classic game and I don't think the controls work that well on a console, you can tell they were really meant for a keyboard and mouse, but it is a game that makes you think and examine.<br />
<br />
I think I am going to enjoy seeing how this Sherlock Holmes adventure turns out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wouldn't buy this at full price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was very happy with "VS Jack The Ripper" @ £ 17.00 but when I checked out some videos of "The Testament of SH" I thought I was looking at the exact same game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I realised... it's by Frogware... the same guys who made "VS Jack The Ripper" and it looks like they simply used the same game and coded a different story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This doesn't necessarily mean "bad"... but I don't think it means £ 34.00 worth of "good" either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you've not played the first one though, it's probably not going to be as much of an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm only working from some gameplay vids I've seen as well so there could be a lot more to this title.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed Vs Jack but I only paid £20 for it. I don't think they are worth the full price really, especially with whats coming up in the next month, had they released it during the summer it might of been different, or even better released it at a
 discounted price, at the moment I can't really afford to buy it at full price so I'll wait for a price drop.</p>

<p>Hi voteDC, rest assured you are not the only one to buy this game, I pre ordered the testament of sherlock holmes and it has proved to be a good decision. I don't often pre order games but as the release date had been put back a couple of times I just couldn't
 wait any longer, and yes it probably will be cheaper in a month or so but that applies to most if not all games. The testament of sherlock holmes is a great puzzle game, pitched just right (not too easy or too hard) and in my opinion much better than vs jack
 the ripper, a game which I enjoyed greatly. I would recommend to anyone who likes this style of game.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>A method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to CTRL +<br />
ALT + DEL - Task Manager and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications&nbsp;Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe. Safe Mode is reached by<br />
repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up. CTRL + SHIFT + ESC also starts Task Manager.<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            It is okay and normal to have multiple svchost,exe Processes running.&nbsp; Important XP Services are actually running under the svchost.exe Processes. Sometimes there is just one XP Service running under a svchost.exe Process, sometimes there are several XP
 Services running under a svchost.exe Process.&nbsp; You might have 2 or 5 or 8 or 10 running at any time depending on what your system is doing.<br />
<br />
Sometimes malicious software will hide behind a svchost.exe Process since the malicious software knows you will not be able to spot it in Task Manager 9it is hiding).&nbsp; It will hide behind a svchost.exe Process to fool you.<br />
<br />
Malicious software can also disguise itself to appear to be a legitimate XP Process or it could hide under/behind other Processes that you see running in Task Manager so you cannot see it running.<br />
<br />
If you think one of your svchost.exe processes is out of control or run amok, understand that some malicious software will hide itself as a process behind one of your several svchost.exe processes.&nbsp; All you will see in Task Manager is a svchost.exe process
 that is out of control.<br />
<br />
If you even <span style="font-style: italic">think</span> your system might have a malicious software infection, do this:<br />
<br />
No matter what you are using for malware detection and removal do this first:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
If you read this article, you will be smarter than the average bear about what goes on with svchost.exe and understand why it is normal to see several svchost processes running in Task Manager:<br />

<br />
If you download and run Process Explorer, you will be able to get a better view of what is really running on your system and what is going on behind those multiple svchost.exe Processes you see in Task Manager.<br />
<br />
Here is what my Process Explorer looks like showing several svchost.exe Processes:<br />

<br />
You might be able to get some clues using about what is going with your svchost.exe Processes using Task Manager and maybe figure it out.<br />
<br />
You will <span style="font-style: italic">always</span> be able to figure out what is going with your svchost.exe Processes if you use Process Explorer.<br />
<br />
Download Process Explorer so you can see what is "really" running on your system, especially behind those multiple svchost Processes you see running in Task Manager.<br />
<br />
Download Process Explorer from here:<br />

<br />
You'll like Process Explorer when you get the hang of it.&nbsp; Process Explorer is the Windows Task Manager on steroids.<br />
<br />
Process Explorer installs nothing so it will not slow your system down since it only runs on demand.<br />
<br />
Process Explorer may look a little intimidating at first since it presents so much information, but you will start to get to like the way it works when you are looking for performance problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can even tell PE that you want it to be your new default
 "Task Manager" from now on.&nbsp; You can still run the original Task Manger too.<br />

<h2>            Two Skype accounts linked to one email address</h2>
                    I apparently have two Skype accounts and it is confusing my windows computer. I had an IM (Instant Messenger) account that was converted to Skype years ago. When Microsoft acquired Skype, my account with Microsoft was converted as well. How can I get rid
 of the original IM/Skype account. The biggest problem I have with the original account is the email address. While I have been able to link my current email address to it, the email address that I used originally to sign up for that account is no longer valid
 and I can't figure out how to get rid of it. Thank you for your help!

<p>Hello StephaniBelt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to get rid of your original Skype account like deleting it, you need to have access to the old account to accomplish this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try to reset the password of the account following this link. In the event that you no longer have access to the
<strong>security information</strong> <em>(masked alternate email address or phone number that you add to your account used to verify account ownership),
</em>you will need to fill out this <a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Account Recovery Form </a>to manually recover your account. Once submitted, you will received an update within 24-48 hours.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please consider below tips when answering the said form:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Fill out the form from a computer and from a location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where the previous successful sign-in occurred.</span></li><li><span>Make sure that you use an alternate email address that you have access with in order to receive the security code and not the email address of the account you want to recover.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance with Skype in the future. We will be glad to assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>

<h2>            DVD&#47;CD RW drive will read DVD but not play CD.</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody out there.&nbsp; I have just installed a brand new DVD/CD Writer DRW - 24B3ST 24X SATA because my old one all of a sudden wouldn't play CDs.&nbsp; However, although the new one worked fine reading both CDs and DVDs , within a couple of hours the same
 situation occurred with the new drive and no CD play.&nbsp; I get the same message with the new drive&nbsp; "Windows media player cannot play the file.&nbsp; The player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is absurd because a few minutes earlier the CDs had worked fine for a couple of hours.&nbsp; I also tested the CDs in my laptop where they played fine as well.&nbsp; My processor is Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo CPU E6550&nbsp; 2.33 Ghz&nbsp; running Windows 7 64 Bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have
 also noticed, when running device manager, that both my PCI Serial Port and PCI Simple Communications Controller have no drivers installed showing (Code 28). &nbsp; When I try to update them windows can't find them and&nbsp; I don't know if this lack of drivers could
 be affecting my DVD/CD drive performance.&nbsp; I've been reading other posts where others are having similar problems so any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe that a brand new drive could be broken right out of the package....?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you
 for your time.</p>

            <p>Hello and thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I have updated my computer from Windows 7 to Windows 10 yesterday.&nbsp; I was hoping that the upgrade could possibly resolve the missing driver problem and subsequently restore Windows Media Player operation but no dice!&nbsp;
 I have tried all of your methods above and they did not work.&nbsp; I finally was able to download the missing drivers for both PCI Serial Port and PCI Simple Communications Controller and installed them.&nbsp; I did this by accessing Details tab in the Device manager
 under 'Hardware ID' and copying and pasting that information into my browser which led me to the correct manufacturer downloads.&nbsp; However, this still did not solve the problem.&nbsp; I then turned Windows Media Player off and on in Programs &amp; Features within the
 control panel to re-start it.&nbsp; All of this has not worked.&nbsp; However, interestingly enough VLC Media player will now play CDs when it actually didn't work when I was running Windows 7! At least one media player works!&nbsp; My computer make and model are as below:</p>
<p>Operating System: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (10.0, Build 10586) (10586.th2_release.151121-2308)<br />
System Manufacturer: LENOVO<br />
System Model: 9181A1U<br />
BIOS: Lenovo ThinkCentre BIOS Ver 2RKT54.0<br />
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E6550&nbsp; @ 2.33GHz (2 CPUs), ~2.3GHz<br />
Memory: 4096MB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I really can't think of what to do next about it but fortunately everything else seems to running fine even after this upgrade.&nbsp; Thanks again for your time!&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry it took so long to get back to you all.&nbsp; Thank you for your help and latest suggestion to run 'SFC Scan'.&nbsp; However, I tried it and the result came back that no errors were found.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; Windows Media Player in fact,&nbsp; although likely unrelated
 to the scan, has seemed to have degraded even further.&nbsp;&nbsp; As above, I still receive the following message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file."
</em></p>
<p>However, what is new is that this message now occurs whether I try to play either a CD or even a DVD.&nbsp; It used to fail only with CD but now it is with both.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned above, I am running Windows 10.<em>
</em></p>
<p>I've also noticed a couple of other peculiarities but I'm not sure they're related to the problem I'm having or are just symptoms of some other issue.&nbsp; When I view the drive associated with DVD/CD in Windows Explorer after I've inserted a CD,&nbsp; the track
 information for each song remains blank ex: it only indicates 'Track 01' for the first song and so on even though I am connected to the internet.&nbsp; When I look at the same drive when a DVD is inserted the information is present and indicated correctly. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another strange thing that is starting to happen is that I will place a CD in the drive and, although VLC media player will start to play it correctly,&nbsp; the information for the album within the 'Now playing' player library itself, will be entirely different
 from the music I put in the CD ROM.&nbsp; The player in other words is showing a completely different album with different songs.&nbsp; To possibly make matters even more confusing is that the album it chooses to display, complete with correct track metadata, does not
 even exist within my computer.....!!! &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I've written quite a bit here but I wanted to do as thorough a job of writing back my results as best I could to help you and because I appreciate your help and time.&nbsp; Thank you and have a great day.&nbsp; &nbsp;
<br />
