The Windows Insider Program already 2 million testers evaluating the Windows 10 Previews since October of 2014. With Microsoft planning a promotional upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 and the intention to provide a direct upgrade path from the preview to the final release, users are taking the plunge earlier. This does not exempt the fact that Windows 10 is still under heavy development and we are still in the early days before we are anywhere near the final code. With that said, users who are willing to give the Preview a spin early might be encountering issues getting Windows 10 to successfully install on their PC.

<h2>            who do I talk to to fix a billing problem&#63;</h2>
                    I recently had my CC number stolen, and had to replace it. This happened around the end of the billing cycle so I didn't get the new information into the account before I missed my payment. I received a notice email. I quickly made the changes to my account,
 and am sure that the new method of payment is in placed and selected. Now I am still getting notices and am unable to make sure that the new method of payment is paying for the overdue charge. I also can't seem to get ahold of anyone to make sure that the
 problem is taken care of. I need a way to contact someone to make sure the problem is indeed resolved.

<h2>            Error box appearing whenever Skype receives a message</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden an error box is appearing whenever I receive a message on Skype. It says something about the Skype app not opening and has a series of letters and&nbsp;numbers which include the following: '14.42.60.0_x64-kzf8qxf38zg5c'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated to Skype as part of my Office&nbsp;365 account, so wondering it something to do with the old installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is I cannot see any way of uninstalling this or reinstalling Skype to try to stop this error box from appearing.</p>

            Hi JamesU12345, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear that, give a try to this and see if the same thing happens.
<br />
<br />Quit Skype
<br />
<br />Press windows key + R
<br />
<br />Type %appdata%/Microsoft
<br />
<br />Rename your "Skype for Desktop" folder to Skypefordesktop_old
<br />
<br />Open Skype and sign back into your account.
<br />
<br />Check if you're still having the issue.
<br />
<br />Regards.       
        </p>

<h2>            Disconnected Active Directory from Office365, all user accounts set to password never expires&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Last month we disconnected Office365 from our on-premises Active Directory/dirsync. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The admin portal within Office365 shows that our passwords are set to expire as a company every 90 days, with a notification within 14 days. &nbsp;The checkbox to "Set Passwords to Never Expire" is not checked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when I run a Powershell command on any of our 250 accounts to see whether the password is set to expire, it says PasswordNeverExpires is set to TRUE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I have to set each user account separately with Powershell to PasswordNeverExpires=false? &nbsp;Shouldn't the overall Service Settings - Passwords screen do that for me?</p>

<p>Hi JWitt,</p>
<p>Please first let us know if the DirSync has been disabled. Please go the Portal page, under
<strong>Health</strong> and go to<strong> Directory Sync Status</strong>, check if it is disabled.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please use the following cmdlet to set <strong>PasswordNeverExpires</strong> attribute to
<strong>false</strong> for all of your uses rather than set it one user by one user.<br />
<strong>Get-MSOLUser | Set-MsolUser -PasswordNeverExpires $false</strong></p>

<p>Hi J Witt,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the information. When you disable the Directory Sync, it is normal that in portal page, the password sync still saying it is enabled. Please rerun the Azure AD connect wizard and uncheck Password Sync opting in the wizard. After finishing
 the wizard, we can disable Directory Sync via <strong>Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled –EnableDirSync $false</strong> with Azure AD Powershell.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, have tried using <strong>Get-MSOLUser | Set-MsolUser -PasswordNeverExpires $false</strong> to set all of your users password never expire to false, what are the results?</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Ran<br />

<p>Hi JWitt,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the feedback. Regarding “<strong>it says my account is not set up for synchronization</strong>”, it could be related to that your directory sync is disable at the moment. Please first enable it from Portal page or via
<strong>Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled –EnableDirSync $true</strong>. Then re-run Azure AD Connector or DirSync to uncheck Password Sync option. After that, disable Directory Sync via
<strong>Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled –EnableDirSync $false</strong> and see if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />

<h2>            ATT Tilt Windows Mobile 6 &#40; AT&#38;T &#41; A-Z  what do you think</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought a new cell phone called the "Tilt" from ATT.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My Verizon bill was going to about 130$ a month and it just didn’t seem right.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am now paying 80$ a month with way more then I had with Verizon.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Here is what is cool about the phone...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- 3G - 3g is what Google is trying to get into.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This seems to be a faster wireless wifi signal for your internet.<span>&nbsp; </span>
The next GPhone by Google will be using this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a) It is better then the Iphone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have windows mobile 6 professional edition.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is a pocket PC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Iphone has about 50 less programs then windows.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plus you are "locked in" on the iphone leaving customization not applicable. I’m not even sure if you can buy games and programs for the phone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>With my phone since I am a computer program I can even write programs for my own phone to do WHATEVER i want.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>b) This is also my iPod so I do not have to carry around another device.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don’t need an iPod.<span>&nbsp; </span>Apple did come out with an "itouch" which does the same thing in combing the two.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But still it does not have near the options as this phone.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not only that, I bought the new Bluetooth stereo headsets so I can now listen wirelessly to my new phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>c)<span>&nbsp; </span>This is also a game boy or psp.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I play allot of tiger woods golf, and those new smart brain games can become addicting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I also like marble madness.<span>&nbsp; </span>Games just go on and on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>d)<span>&nbsp; </span>The Camera!!<span>&nbsp;
</span>or should i say video camera!.<span>&nbsp; </span>Its 3 megapixels which in cell phone land is ALLOT.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But I must elaborate.<span>&nbsp; </span>The functions on this phone are endless.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When your turn the cell phone sideways it looks no different then a Digital camera.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The button to take the picture is in the same place and everything.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can crop pictures, they have default Man of the Year and Woman of the year frames.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Effects on pictures, etc etc<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>e) The Mobile TV.<span>&nbsp; </span>Finally it looks like they got it right.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Put the tv in full screen mode and the quality and audio is on par with any device out there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I could easly handle watching tv on this thing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also they have all the major networks so there are tons of channels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>f)<span>&nbsp; </span>The screen saver automatically scrolls threw your pictures that are on file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Small feature but nice<span>&nbsp; </span>=)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>g) The Internet Explorer.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Its still not perfect but its better.<span>&nbsp; </span>Att's network seems fast enough to not have to wait long for pages to load.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don’t like how you cannot have more the one window but it seems to be only IE 4.0 compatible still.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don’t know the technical details of the browser yet.<span>&nbsp; </span>It might be IE 5 compatible but stripped down not to allow java script etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But it does seem to be working fine with activex controls and installing applications.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>h) GPS!!!<span>&nbsp; </span>I think they are charging me an extra 10$ a month for this but its kinda worth it toy wise.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I never had navigation in my car or a hand held navigation before but this showed me where i was and how to get home right on point.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It gave me a visual and audio directions perfectly.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well not perfectly because it doesn’t know the shortcuts ;x</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i) Messaging.<span>&nbsp; </span>This handles SMS (Text messages/Outlook synch/Yahoo/Hotmail/AOL/AIM mailboxes!.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It keeps control of all your email in one application and shows you a count of new messages on the today or desktop of your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>j)<span>&nbsp; </span>Instant Messaging.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They have all 3 messengers now.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yahoo, MSM, and AIM included now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They only handle the basic operations but they are all there and working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>k) Bluetooth - This is nothing new but with this phone I cannot report any problems.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can tell my phone to call a contact and the voice recognition is working find and calls the person without a glitch.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can also start certain applications with your voice as well.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
There are some advanced features such as tethering over bluetooth or sending files from you computer to the phone via bluetooth, as well as a ISP over bluetooth, but i will get into that later</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>l)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>WinZip - Finally included is an unzip utility so if somebody sends me a zip file or i download something from the internet i can actually DO SOMETHING with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>m) ActiveSynch 4.5<span>&nbsp; </span>
- Not sure what the difference is but its running flawlessly synching my contacts, calendar, files, notes etc etc to my phone and computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>n) Push to Talk - Now nextel and sprint users are not the only cool people to have this feature.<span>&nbsp;
</span>ATT also gives you a buddy list to for this operation.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>o) Microsoft Office - I can except and work in Excel, Power Point and Word.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You cant work with files that have advanced options in them but i wouldnt expect such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>p) Event Viewer - This is a new feature and only for advanced users who want to find out more information on errors and stuff.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may think your phone is working smoothly until you look at this log to see more details on things that are not working</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>q)<span>&nbsp; </span>Skype compatible - THIS IS BIG!!!<span>&nbsp;
</span>Most people have no idea how big this is.<span>&nbsp; </span>I tell the people at ATT who are even techs and they have no idea what im talking about.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Im about to tell you.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is a VOIP program.<span>&nbsp; </span>
That means you can make phone calls over the internet.<span>&nbsp; </span>That means you can tell them to take their "PLAN" and only give you the basic minimum in terms of minutes per month.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can make calls for almost free using the skype application instead of the phone line the att gives you.<span>&nbsp;
</span>All you have to do is goto www.skype.com and install the correct version for your phone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now you can for fee call skype to skype users without any money at all.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But if you want to call skype to phone users you have to pay per minute.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Skype used to charge .2 cents per minute but has now changed that and you can buy an unlimited 3 dollars a month fee.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So for 3 dollars a month you can make as many outgoing phone calls as you want.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Im not sure how you can handle incoming calls but that might be free already in terms of ATT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>r)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I absolutely love the sliding "tilt".<span>&nbsp;
</span>That means i can open my pocket pc phone to look like a sidekick.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Even the sound is so cool when i "tilt" my phone back and it looks like a little personal computer!<span>&nbsp;
</span>I also like the keyboard.<span>&nbsp; </span>it looks very nice colorful and easy to find buttons.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>s)<span>&nbsp; </span>Windows Update is now built in.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Although this should have been in the previous two versions!!!<span>&nbsp; </span>
This now lets microsoft apply patches and even security patches to fix any issues with the phone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This means you wont have to wait for a new cell phone in order for something to work ( and eventually another option that doesnt work)<span>&nbsp;
</span>its and endless loop that has finally ended. Security wise this is a major benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>t)<span>&nbsp; </span>The interface on this phone is just great.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I love how its black instead of silver like all phones.<span>&nbsp; </span>It has chrome buttons and it gives you allot. It has a button for call and end call. Star menu, internet explorer , email, ok, cancel, and appropriate menu buttons for the screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It also has an instant take a picture button for those quick people.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It has a click button and a navigate button as well.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also if you do not like to use the pen, it is possible for you to just use the scroll wheel on the side and push it in to select something.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It aslo has a PTT (push to talk) button the left side to do so.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>u)<span>&nbsp; </span>Memory - For everything I have mentioned here memory is super important.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is allot of positives to talk about here.<span>&nbsp; </span>One, they give you a default 150 megs of space which is about 100 megs more then normal.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Secondly, and most important, they give you a 36 GIG compatible phone!!!!!<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>v)<span>&nbsp; </span>Wifi - This phone has a built in wifi card so you can now connect to local wifi signals in your area.<span>&nbsp;
</span>These connections are faster then the 3g network (or internet line) that comes with the phone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So if you can pick one of these up use these instead for your internet connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>w)<span>&nbsp; </span>Tethering.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This means you can use your cell phone as your ISP.<span>&nbsp; </span>Drop your cable bill, drop your dsl.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you have dial up still (god forgive you) you can now use your cellphone for you personal computer or mac to give you an internet connection.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You suppose to pay for this per month, they charge you an extra 30$ a month to your unlimited internet bill which is 30 bucks a month to a total of 60$ a month.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Technically its not worth it because the speed is around 30k which is not competitive to DSL or Cable at all.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But you can tether via your phone without telling them or paying for it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Whether they catch your or not I have yet to find out =)<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- i will give you a quick how to set up tethering on this phone without paying for it instructions</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1) hook up your USB wire to your phone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Make sure ActiveSynch is working and connected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2) on your phone, AT&amp;T has hidden it but i seemed to have found it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>By using the file manager, you can browse to your Windows directory on the phone and then double click the Internet Connection Sharing icon.<span>&nbsp;
</span>From here chose the USB (or bluetooth if you wish hahha) and now your phone is listening for a connecting to really as an internet service provider.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now on any device, all you need to do is disable your wifi or LAN connection if you are using one.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now you computer will look to the new connection by default</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>X)<span>&nbsp; </span>Works with PDF files
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>y)<span>&nbsp; </span>A very good J2ME or Jbuild java support from sunsystems</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>z) The phone is very light for what it can do!!</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommendations to ATT</p>
<p>- Allow svideo and/or rca output.<span>&nbsp; </span>This could allow you to use GPS to a mounted monitor on a dashboard in your car.<span>&nbsp;
</span>not only for GPS but for anything.<span>&nbsp; </span>The only negative about these phones will always be the screen size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<span>&nbsp; </span>ATT mall.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is where they allow you to shop for games, programs and music.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>They use internet explorer to take you to there webpage which is not ideal yet.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The page they bring you too is bloated and too big for the screen size.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They can probably fix that on their side but still i do not think IE is they way to go.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have seen Handagos shopping application which gives you a WAP like menu and automatically filters things to only see what your phone is compatible with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Instant Messaging.<span>&nbsp; </span>They seem to not allow any of the instant messages to work when you are connect via a local WIFI connection.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I dont understand why but the application detects and doesnt even let you try!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<span>&nbsp; </span>Quick GPS - not sure what this is but evetr time i run it it says cannot connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<span>&nbsp; </span>Phone lag - Phone seems to have a slight lag to clicking on things.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I dont mind it but instant would be nice =)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- PTT - Couple things here.<span>&nbsp; </span>One major problem is i have nobody to PTT with?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Everyone seems to have verizon.<span>&nbsp; </span>I know thats their problem but this feature is useless without people.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So i hope people start realizing the ATT is where it is att.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Another problem is this feature is not an<span>&nbsp; </span>"always on feature"<span>&nbsp;
</span>When i start my phone i have to tell it that im available.<span>&nbsp; </span>Im not sure if this is only for buddylist display or nobody can PTT me until i say im available.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Im still trying to see how the PTT options work in terms of privacy, mute, vibrate etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Dont hide ICS or internet connection sharing .... its just not cool<span>&nbsp;
</span>=)<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The battery seems to only last about 2-3 hours which is not good at all if you ask me.<span>&nbsp;
</span>4-6 is the minimum in my book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recommendations to Microsoft<span> </span></p>
<p>-<span>&nbsp; </span>I dont like when using mail applications that i do not see the entire message and they give a click here to download the entire message.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I click here to do so, but it says it will show me the message next time i check mail.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I check mail and it still has not download the message.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think you actually need to restart the phone or somehow close the email application and open it again (via the task manager) to see the entire message.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I believe this also applies to attachments.<span>&nbsp; </span>Very annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I really dont like when sending SMS message i cannot "SELECT ALL" contacts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I hate having to add all my contacts manually one by one (and where talking 4 clicks to add each one) when i want to send all my friends a message.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Also, people are responding to me saying they cannot accept large messages over 160 characters because you are not a verizon customer etc etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Maybe that is on verizons side I cannot tell. But there is a probably when sending txt messages are large.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Voice recognition - (made by cyberon so not sure if this is a microsoft thing)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It will not dial people by voice.<span>&nbsp; </span>I also dont know why it doesnt read other messages like sms and email which is just text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Text to voice is easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Search - I did a search for *.* and nothing comes up?<span>&nbsp;
</span>thats not possible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<span>&nbsp; </span>The space button on the stylus keyboard is not on the default keys.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You have to page to the number screen in order to click the spacebar.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is totally illogical.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maybe that had a space problem when they were clicking the interface.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But there is two big spaces to the left and the right of the keyboard that i would assume would create spaces when i click them but they do not.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Changes definitely need to be made here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<span>&nbsp; </span>Task manger - for some reason this is only showing the high level applications.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There are programs that are running that are not showing up in the menu and I wanted to end and is very frustrating that i cannot end them.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Microsoft should really give you the same low level access they give you in at least like windows xp in terms of ipconfig, netstat why this is hidden is beyond me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<span>&nbsp; </span>Remove programs - This option does not work for all applications that i have installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Very frustrating to install an application that is in use under this scenario.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This means I cant manually delete the directory because a file is in use.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I cant kill the process in memory because the task manger doesnt seem to show all applications that are in memory as i have stated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Connections - This is in settings and i have no idea what this is.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Im not sure if this is just and ATT thing but its useless.<span>&nbsp; </span>It brings me to a menu of add a new modem connection, add a new vpn server, edit proxy server ,manage existing connections etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It would be more logical to separate this icon into more then one icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- WModem - This feature did not work for me.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I Told the application to connect to my computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then my computer prompted me for a driver.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Fine..then i inserted the CD that came with my phone and pointed to the folder where it should go to .<span>&nbsp;
</span>The only problem is its looking for the wrong file name.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have checked the internet and the folder on the CD is the correct driver for what i am trying to install .<span>&nbsp;
</span>But my XP is looking for a different filename for the driver then what is expected on my CD.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I had to use the hidden ICS(internet connection sharing) instead of this application</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not mentioned</p>
<p>- Sim Manager.<span>&nbsp; </span>I dont really use a SIM card to store memory anymore<span>&nbsp;
</span>outlook synch seems to do that fine</p>
<p>- Calendar,<span>&nbsp; </span>Bubble Breaker, JewelQwest, Midnight pool, Ms PacMan, My Cast, MySpace, Solitair, Proxy Manager, calculator, file explorer, sprite backup voice recorder, sim manger, tasks , phone dialer, help, TTY, button manager
 ,input manager, keyboard sound manager, lock manager, menu manager, owner information manager, phone manager, sounds manager, today manager, voice manager, about, backlight manager, certificates manager , clear storage manager, clock and alarms manager, device
 info manager, encryption manager, error reporting manager, power manager, regional settings manager, remove programs manager, screen manager, task manager, infared, wireless manager, click to play music on desktop, lock icon on desktop, running applications
 on desktop icon systray, improved toolbar next to start menu.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of quick updates for those still following this post...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hotmail has a great mobile site...&nbsp; start at mobile.msn.com&nbsp; </p>
<p>and for that matter, there are a lot of great mobile sites to check out:</p>
<p>google mobile </p>
<p>imdb mobile edition</p>
<p>The weather channel mobile</p>
<p>&nbsp;and about a million others, more and more sites are getting a mobile site, google them and find them</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as for the email, you can set the preferences on the Tilt to download the full message each time:</p>
<p>Open the account on the Tilt, go to Tools - Options - go through all the account set up stuff and on the last page is the "Download Limit" -- pull it down to ENTIRE MESSAGE and there you go.&nbsp; If you're worried about storage, the TILT can support
 a MicroSD card (I have a 4 gig one, they make them at 8 gigs and are working on a 32 gig version now).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Live Search is another GREAT feature that will significantly enhance your GPS, check it out also...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had mine for just over a month and I love it.&nbsp; I installed TOMTOM mobile for the navigation software</p>

<h2>            How do I toggle between my Powerpoint Presentation and another open application on my laptop&#63;</h2>
                    I have Powerpoint 2002, and can't find a way to toggle (or pause) my presentation so that I can access another open application on my laptop.&nbsp; I have to end the slide show and then restart it.

    <title>Blocking and Phishing... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffmitchell3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blocking and Phishing...</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I don't gamble but I've blocked , unsubscribed and reported as phishing a couple of Casino sites to absolutely no avail whatsoever. After blocking them, they returned and they don't have an unsubscribe ikon on their facia panel. I sent them an email asking
 to be unsubscribed from their mailing lists. They sent the same Casino site garbage so I let them know how I really feel and they just kept sending the **** they reel out, over and over. I reported them to phishing but I'm still getting the same ****-shoot-****
 being shot out at me several times a week. Also, while I believe I have your attention, I might mention that a lot of sites who send their pamphlets have no unsubscribe option on the front page, making it impossible for us to unsubscribe unless we go into
 the site to find it and there's no guarantee that it will be there either. And, why should I have to unsubscribe to **** I haven't subscribed into in the first place ? There are sites that send out pamphlets appearing to be sent randomly, they have an unsubscribe
 option which, when you give them your email address, they now have an email address to sell onto other sites, an email address they didn't have prior to you unsubscribing. I'd like to hear some kind of feedback. Thank you, Mitchell.</p>

            Hi Jeff,
<br />If you did not subscribe, don't contact them or try to unsubscribe. That just confirms your address is valid. 
<br />
<br />Are the messages in your Inbox? If so, you can create a rule to delete them - this would be faster than marking them as junk. (You need to use words in the sender address or words in the message header. Words in the subject or body is also an option).  
<br />
<br />If they going into the Junk mail folder, outlook.com's junk filter is taking care of it.

                    Help! The top of my document is up under the ribbon at the top of the page and I can't get it back down so I can't use the toolbars. Also, I managed to make all of the things on the ribbon (except for the word WORD) disappear. How do I get the top of my
 page back and how do I get all the ribbon categories back?

<p><span>Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions!&nbsp;:cathappy:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did something happen to your phone before this issue came up? When did the display issue start to occur? Try to remove and reinsert the phone's battery and see if it's well-fitted in the battery compartment. Meanwhile, we suggest that you keep monitoring
 the phone to further verify what could possibly cause the issue.</span></p>

<p>Hi Alyce,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, if you want to distribute a page to certain group of students, we need to add student groups before doing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For adding the student groups, you need to open OneNote 2016 for Windows application:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open OneNote 2016 for Windows.</p>
<p>2. Select the page in Teacher Only Section and click on Distribute Page.</p>
<p>3. Select Individual and Group Distribution.</p>
<p>4. Go to Students Groups&gt; Add&gt; Enter the name as per requirement&gt; Select students&gt; Add.</p>
<p>5. Select the beside the group name to distribute a page and select the Student sections to distribute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chitrahaas</p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may get a message that a file is read-only if it was created on a previous version of Excel, if
<strong>Office </strong>is not activated, or if the file is corrupted. To provide the best steps to resolve the issue, we'd like to isolate it first by asking a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is Office activated? To check, open any Office application, go to <strong>Files
</strong>&gt; <strong>Account</strong>. The activation information is found on the right part of the screen.</li><li>Is this happening on all Excel files you open?</li><li>What is its file type?</li><li>Have you tried opening other Office files to see of you have the same file permission type?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

</p><p>Yes, excel is 'activated'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried 'Repair' last night, and new Excel files seem to be OK. Nut, any files created prior to that are Read-Only. The files are either Excel files of Compatibility mode files.</p>

<p><span>Again, the file become 'Read Only'.</span></p>

            After 8 cumulative hours with Office Help, it was 'discovered' that my Antivirus, Avast, had placed Excel in the Randomware prevention area, which blocked any changes to files. The technician form Office Help discovered a post on a AVG board. Go figure.
 I did NOT place Excel in the Randomware area. Once Excel was removed from the Randomware area, Excel worked as it had previously! Biut, 8 L-O-N-G hours and 4 remote sessions. Yikes!!

<h2>            Windows 10 Logo</h2>
                    Although my Windows 7 edition has the Service Pack 1 upgrade and Windows Update works perfectly fine I have not received the windows 10 logo to reserve my copy of the upgrade. I have tried the Windows troubleshooting tool and it just continues to look
 for problems for hours on end. Is there a way in which I can download Windows 10 manually. My version of Windows 7 is compatable so why I have not received the logo I am puzzled.

<h2>            How do i remove conversation view in Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I use Outlook in Office 365 to manage my email online.</p>
<p>My emails are grouped into conversations but I do not like this view.&nbsp; I like a good old fashioned chronological view of my emails.</p>
<p>I have searched the Options to fix this but I cannot find a way to achieve this.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>Thank you:-)</p>

<p>hi veeridgley,<br />
<br />
i understand that you want to change the conversations view in your mailbox. it is possible to do this in office 365. here are the detailed steps:<br />
if you are using office 365 owa (outlook web app) to manage emails, you can do this as the screenshot below to change from conversations view to messages view. after that, all the emails will be listed as separate messages instead of conversations.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66e3a475-14a3-4e23-8ece-3631579ff3b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66e3a475-14a3-4e23-8ece-3631579ff3b3" /></a><br />
if you are using an outlook client to manage emails, you can do this like the screenshot below to change from show as conversations to show in groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

<h3> mikeking63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2003&#58; Multiple Required Fields on a Form</h2>
                    <p>I have a form where the back-end table fields are set to required and the Tracking ID is default entered and auto-generated. However, if the 'Submit' button is clicked on the form and there are blank fields, it follows through my code and&nbsp;brings&nbsp;a new form
 up without requiring the user to populate the empty fields. Also, the data is submitted in the table, even though there are blank fields.</p>
<p>I know my code may not be the best, but this is what I have now. What can I add and/or edit the language so that when the Submit button is clicked, if any fields are blank an error message appears stating the user must fill in all fields and when "OK" is
 clicked they are returned to the form? If all fields are completed, then (for now) the code tells the form to close and then reopen (I did this because I want a new automated Tracking ID to appear on the form -- don't know how to make this happen without closing
 and reopening the form).</p>
<p>Thanks for your help:</p>

            You need to run a string of IFs before the start of your code. Like:<br />
<br />
If IsNull(Me.controlname) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "&lt;controlname&gt; is required, please fill in!"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.controlname.SetFocus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
End If<br />
<br />
Repeat this for each control you want to check.<br />
<br />
By the way, you need to include an Else...Exit Sub in the code you show. Because it runs the rest of the code where a user presses Yes or No.<br />
<br />
Finally, you shouldn't need to close and reopen a form to get a new TrackingID. But without knowing how you generate the TrackingID, it Can't tell what to do.<br />

            <p>Hi guys, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I got this sorted. For those who may experience the same problem &amp; to answer the other's questions - I have full admin access, all resources are assigned to projects, have licenses and all projects are live &amp; published.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The users were fine up until this week (no major PWA changes occurred). When they clicked on the My Timesheets link along the left of the screen the page would load, but there would be a blank screen. Essentially, the exact same as a normally loaded My Timesheets
 page, only without any timesheets (new or pre-existing)</p>
<p>While acting as a delegate, all profiles seemed normal, &amp; I was able to create/edit their timesheets (on IE).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it happens, the users had received new laptops (Do not work in the same country so could not confirm this before posting).&nbsp;They were using IE to access the PWA as per the old laptops.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In short: IE on the new laptop would not render the PWA properly, I asked them to try it via Chrome and they were successful. It seems to be with Windows 10 &amp; IE 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: Has anybody used W10 &amp; IE 11 with the PWA? Does anybody have any idea why they won't allow the app to work &amp; if Microsoft intend on fixing the issue?
</p>

<h2>            Excel 2007 - Conditional Format Australian Phone Numbers.</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to set up my contact worksheet to format phone numbers automatically, based on if they are a mobile or landline.</p>
<p>Australian Phone Number formats are as follows.;</p>
<p>Mobile/Cell&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0412 345 678</p>
<p>Landline&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (00) 1234 5678</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mobiles numbers always start with 04, and is explicitly used only for mobiles.</p>
<p>Landline area codes always start with a 0, second digit depending on the state the line is in. (i.e. Wester/South Australia and NT&nbsp;is 08)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I can format them all as one or the other with the Number option, but setting them all as landline and then conditional format if cell starts with 04 won't change the format of the 04 numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please provide me with some help or the Expression I need to do this?</p>

    <title>Default Paragraph Spacing in Outlook for Mac 15.25 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default Paragraph Spacing in Outlook for Mac 15.25</h2>
                    <p>I can't figure out how to set the default paragraph spacing for new email messages in Outlook for Mac 15.25.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of half-finished threads on this but they are for earlier builds so I wanted to restart discussion with what I understand to be the current version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still cannot find any menus or anything in Outlook to set or adjust default paragraph spacing, despite threads indicating that this IS actually a feature now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double spaced emails by default are driving me crazy.</p>

<h2>            Install Office 2010 on replacement computer</h2>
                    I have a separately purchased disk of Office 2010 Home &amp; Business, and my computer is lost/stolen. &nbsp;It was already the third computer I installed this Office copy on, and now I need to install on a new computer. &nbsp;How do I proceed?

            <p>Retail licenses (the traditional packaged discs you would buy in a store, or if directly purchased and downloaded from Microsoft) for Office Home and Business 2010 permit you to concurrently activate two (2) installations of Office H&amp;B 2010, one on your
 "main" computer and the other on your "portable" computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the retail licenses does permit you to move the license from computer to computer, it&nbsp;does NOT permit more than two concurrent activations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to properly activate Office H&amp;B 2010 on a new replacement computer, you need to uninstall one of the other installations still in your possession, decrementing the activation count down to one, in order to make room for the second activation, which
 would be on the new computer.&nbsp; The installation on the stolen computer will theoretically no longer count against your allowed activations, but due to the way Microsoft Office Product Activation works, you will most likley have to do Telephonic Activations
 and speak with a live activation representative to conduct your activations, and it may be necessary to document your rightful possession of the product, by emailing or faxing an image of your Certificate of Authenticity---but the activation rep will explain
 that if necessary.</p>

            The replies below where somewhat helpful, however I have already taken the step of trying to register it via the online method, and after entering the installation ID it terminates the interaction, and I end up back to using the trial product supplied
 with the new machine (it has 5 days left).&nbsp; I obviously cannot uninstall the product from a computer I no longer have in order to "decrement" the prior installations.&nbsp; Nowhere in all this does there appear any way to learn what phone number to call to talk
 to a live "Product Activation" person.&nbsp; Any further help would be appreciated.<br />

            <p>My understanding of your situation is that you have Office Home and Business 2010 retail license.&nbsp; This license permits two concurrent activations, not three.&nbsp; You activated this license on three computers.&nbsp; One of those computers has been stolen, and the
 computer still had that installation of Office Home and Business 2010 on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;you have two computers&nbsp;in your possession, and both have your Office H&amp;B 2010 installed.&nbsp; If that's correct, you have reached your limit of two concurrent activations, nevermid the activation on the computer that was stolen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If want to install H&amp;B onto a new computer, you have to remove it from one of the two that are in your possession that have Office installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to speak with a live activation representative, rerun the Activation Wizard and choose the option for Telephone Activation. Dial the number and when the automated system picks up, do not enter or say anything into the system, which should&nbsp;then transfer
 you to a live activation representative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you call the number during normal business hours for your country/region, you are more likely to be connected to an activation center whose staff speaks your language natively.</p>

            <p>You have already received the correct advice for your situation, but another alternative is open to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Claim on your insurance for a new copy of Office which was lost with the original machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chances are that the stolen machine's product codes are already circulatiing on the 'net and sooner or later MS will notice the number of illegal activations and block that product code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home and Business only allows TWO current installations, one on your main computer and one on your portable one.&nbsp; Only one should be in use at any one time - that's the EULA you agreed to when you did the first install.</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures in the links below, explain how request read and/or delivery receipts for all messages that you send:
<br />
<br />On the File menu, select Options &gt; Mail.
<br />Under Tracking, select the Delivery receipt confirming the message was delivered to the recipient's e-mail server or Read receipt confirming the recipient viewed the message check box.

<h2>            Bulk import contacts and calendars in Office365 - Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody, I am migrating some mail accounts from a Linux-based webmail to Office 365. Emails are not a problem, but I am searching a way to bulk migrate contacts and calendars: from the old system I can export them in .csv and .ics file using a script,
 but is there a way to bulk import those files into Office 365 (maybe using PowerShell)? Or will I have to import them one-by-one using web interface?</p>

<p>Last night i tried using the software updater again and I see v2.0 is available! Somehow, the download size of 133MB is rather huge and it has been failing to update the firmware since last night. Bothered by it :smileymad:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw, I expect the new firmware release to be available in every region, somehow, i could not control it :P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know wher i could get the annoucment of new firmware updates in future? It could save my time by visiting forums and looking around in google. Kind of troublesome &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Firmware release depands on the Product code of your device depanding on your region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some will be released at a later date then others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may check the latest firmware by keying in your product code <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/get-support-and-software/download-software/device-software-update/can-i-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-In the event you are not able to do the update then i would suggest you to contact the nearest NCP to you.</p>
