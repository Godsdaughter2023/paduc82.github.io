    <title>Cannot connect to Xbox Live after switching Routers. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skytop7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot connect to Xbox Live after switching Routers.</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently purchased and set up a new router in my home, and now my Xbox cannot connect to Xbox Live.<br />
<br />
It detects the Network without issue, but it gets an "IP Address" error every time I attempt to connect.<br />
<br />
Every other device in my house has had zero issues whatsoever connecting.<br />
<br />
The weird thing is, at the network select screen, it shows the connection at 3-4 bars, then suddenly it flickers between 3-4 bars and zero bars.<br />
<br />
Nothing I have done has worked, MAC Filtering is off, I have reset factory defaults, I have switched off anything and everything that could cause interference, I have reset my router for 30 seconds, I have reset my adapter for 30 seconds, I have reset my DSL
 for 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Xbox Support told me to contact my ISP, and my ISP basically told me to go find a rocket scientist, because they had no clue.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had this problem, and do you know how to fix it?</p>

<p>With this, go to your xbox network, click on configure network---&gt;additional settings---&gt;restore to factory defaults. then turn off your console</p>
<p>Go to your router, then unplug it for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, plug it back in and wait for all the lights to turn on.</p>
<p>go back to your console, turn it back on, reconnect to your network. </p>
<p>Let me know if this helps.</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>When its a IP-Adress issue, you can try to set a binding IP-Adress and DNS-entry and turn UPnP</p>
<p>If this doesent work you can try to set an DMZ to the configuratet Xbox-IP in your Router Admin-Panel.</p>
<p>Or try to connect with a LAN-Kable.</p>

            <p>Greetings Skytop!</p>
<p>Can we rewind for a minute and try to find out why your console is unable to communicate with the DHCP server on your router, to obtain IP configuration.</p>
<p>Please read: forums.xbox.com/.../155724.aspx And post back in full detail (the questions in bold). This will allow us to have a better understanding of your situation.</p>
<p>TIA!</p>

Given you are using the <a href="http://home.cisco.com/en-apac/products/adapters/WUSB100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<i>Linksys</i> WUSB100 Wireless-N USB Adapter</a>&nbsp;(version 1.0 or version 2.0??),&nbsp;I have to ask if this is a desktop system that you added wireless to by going the USB route&nbsp;or laptop system where you just wanted the "N" capability?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Also - along the same line of that question - what is the make &amp; model of the computer system as a whole or the motherboard if this happens to be a desktop system you assembled or had assembled for you?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Being a USB adapter - a few things can make or break the connectivity.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
There is the simple location factor.&nbsp; Is it connected in such a way&nbsp; that it is up high with as unobstructed path to the router itself as possible?&nbsp; If needed - some sort of USB extension could be used, preferrably one that is not too long or an active extension
 cable.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
There are the motherboard chipset drivers.&nbsp; Since this is a USB device, if there is some communications issue between the USB ports and the operating system you have chosen to utilize - that can cause issues like this.&nbsp; Make sure your motherboard chipset drivers
 are current via the motherboard manufacturer's (or computer manufacturer's OR chipset manufacturer's) web page.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
There is, of course, the wireless device drivers themselves.&nbsp; There seems to be two different versions of the product (conveniently version 1.0 and version 2.0) and I can only hope, looking at the drivers, that you have version 2.0 (if you do not - your problem
 could be simply that.)&nbsp; Even version 2.0 hasn't been well taken care of (the last driver update for Windows 7 was 11/09/2009 --&gt; which tells me that support for this device has pretty much died and they likely consider this a legacy product and were already
 starting to consider it that way then.)&nbsp; In any case - make sure you have the latest driver from here:<br />

<div>I click the View User Guides and it directs me to a browser page that has about 10-12 different options under four main headings: "Server adapter guides, Desktop/mobile adapter guides, Adapter guides for Itanium based computers, and other guides." Each
 of the categories have 2-4 different selections under them. I assume I need to look under the desktop guides, and there are two options: "Gigabit Network Adapters, and PRO/100 Adaptors." I click on either of these and they redirect me to pages filled with
 words and links.. It is just confusing.. Anything I should know?</div>

            Same problem. &nbsp;Bought computer new in Feb 2011.
<div>Desktop. &nbsp;Not wireless.</div>
<div>Connected to DSL via a hub.</div>
<div>Tried connecting directly to DSL hub.</div>
<div>Tried three different vintage DSL boxes.</div>
<div>Tried connecting through different hubs which are connected to DSL.</div>
<div><span>Tried different ethernet cables.</span></div>
<div><span>Intel motherboard. &nbsp;DH55PJ &nbsp;i5 core processor.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Built in integrated Intel® PRO10/100/1000 Mb/s network connection.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>8GB memory.</div>
<div><span>I have re-formated hard drive at least 3 times and reinstalled</span></div>
<div>Win 7. &nbsp;Nothing has fixed it. &nbsp;It works after reinstall for a while</div>
<div>then starts failing again in a month.</div>
<div>When internet access is not working - access to the other computers</div>
<div>on my home LAN works just fine.</div>
<div>I can VNC from this machine to my other computers downstairs. &nbsp;</div>
<div>I can transfer files&nbsp;<span>between shared computer drives.</span></div>
<div>But from this Win 7 machine, about half the time,&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can't get out of the house to the internet.</div>
<div>It won't even ping google.com.</div>
<div>Watching a youtube video stalls so often that I don't even try anymore.</div>
<div>I just go downstairs and watch youtube on my 2003 XP machine.</div>
<div>Or my 2004 Dell with Ubuntu.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All other computers connected to same DSL work fine.</div>
<div>They play youtubes just fine.</div>
<div>None of them are Win 7.</div>

<div>Internet access stops frequently.</div>
<div>As I type this the little exclamation mark has appeared and the balloon</div>
<div>box says no internet access. &nbsp;In several minutes it will come back.</div>
<div>In a few months it will get so bad that it hardly ever comes back</div>
<div>and I will reinstall Win 7 again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>At work, the company has supplied me with a less than one year old Dell</div>
<div>with Win 7 on it. &nbsp;It does the same thing. &nbsp;But not nearly as often as my home</div>
<div>machine. &nbsp;I have had the IT dept at work re image that machine 3 times.</div>
<div><br />
<div>At work I still have a 2004 XP machine. &nbsp;It works flawlessly.</div>

I just bought a Lightscribe to watch some of them but the others still not working. Was told to get a codec also for that, how can one do that? I guess you and I must both wait for the answer or my son can tell me.

<h2>            Microsoft Sudoku-- extremely buggy</h2>
                    <p>I can't find a way to deliberately recreate this problem, and it keeps happening over and over and over and over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 on a desktop computer, and I downloaded Microsoft Sudoku. I've tried numerous other Sudoku apps in the MIcrosoft store and cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to use them. Microsoft Sudoku is the only sudoku app I've been able
 to use, but these bugs are driving me, excuse the pun.... buggy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game will suddenly, and extremely frequently, stop accepting mouse clicks of any kind, whether to place a number or to switch to the "active" number (which number will be placed if I click a particular square inthe grid), or pretty much anything. It's
 like the game just locks up, except that the TIMER will keep running. If I sit and wait, it can be ten entire minutes before mouse clicks start working again. I can close the game and restart it, but the bug will just keep happening and keep happening and
 KEEP happening until I get sick of putting up with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there any way to STOP the absolutely incessant demands to "sign in?" This is a particular problem if I shut down and restart the game because I get tired of waiting for mouse clicks to be accepted in the game app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Sidewinder X6 Keyboard Macro Keys Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eliotnpt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sidewinder X6 Keyboard Macro Keys Issue</h2>
                    I updated the drivers today 20/10/12 for the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Centre.&nbsp; I use the Sidewinder X6 keyboard.&nbsp; Since then I have not been able to get some of my macro keys working correctly.<br />
<br />
The keys assigned for calculator and to produce an action, work as before.<br />
<br />
The keys I had for walk forward/back/fly etc will now no long function as though the key is pressed and held.&nbsp; They will only do one single small movement as if the key is pressed once.&nbsp; There appears to be no press and hold function now.<br />
<br />
I have tried deleting the macro keys and resetting them but there is no change.&nbsp; Since they have been working without an issue for many months, I thought the drivers updated today might have caused an issue but a roll back made no difference.&nbsp; It is also possible
 that I have totally forgotten how to set a macro for a key, such as left arrow from the main keyboard, and have it function as press and hold.<br />
<br />
I have rolled back the drivers and it made no difference and so I allowed Windows to update again.<br />
<br />
I use Windows 7 Home, 64 bit.<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
I had to assign a key combination, even though it was only one key press.&nbsp; Problem solved.<br />

            Thank you Tom<br />
I have edited my post about an hour after leaving it here.<br />
I did try the repeat option but it also wouldn't work.&nbsp; Instead, I had to select the option to assign a key combination even though it was only one key.&nbsp; Then I could press and hold for the arrow keys and PdUp etc that I wanted on my macro pad.<br />
Being left-handed, having a macro pad on the left side is massively helpful.<br />
Thank you for your reply and suggestion.<br />

            <p>I have the X4, and also noticed that the "press-and-hold" function is gone. Or it may have been renamed:</p><p>Open the M&amp;K Center, click on your Walk macro, then click on the pencil icon to edit it. One of the settings under that is Repeat on/off. The help next to it states:</p><p>"Macros can be repeated continuously.<br />• To repeat a macro, quickly press and release the macro key. To stop a macro while it is repeating, quickly press and release the macro key again.<br />OR<br />•To repeat a macro, press and hold the macro key. To stop a macro while it is repeating, release the macro key."</p><p>Will that work for you? Hope this helps :-)</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;SC Tom</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows is trying to launch an application, the process requires several program files. If the system detects that there are some broken components within the program files, error 0xc000007b will appear. For us to provide an effective resolution, we
 would need you to answer the following questions: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build, version and edition of Windows is installed on your device?</li><li>What application are you trying to open?</li><li>Are you experiencing the same issue with all of the games installed on your computer or is the issue isolated with a specific game?</li><li>Have you made any changes to your computer before this issue occurred?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you installed the game from the Windows Store, we suggest running the automated troubleshooter for Windows apps. Visit this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>, click on Run troubleshooter and then follow the prompts to successfully run the tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try to download the Skype app from the Apple Store app in the iPad? If you are reading this message from it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.skype.com/download-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Tap this link to download Skype</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And the App Store will open for you. Make sure your iPad has a good connection, and if you are using 3G, please try WiFi instead.</p>

<p>Please comment back what iOS version are you using in your iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the App Store and the button:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did it have an “Open” button instead? It may be because you already have the app installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can look for Skype app in the iPad dashboard, delete it and restart the iPad. Then, try to install it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To delete the app, just tap and hold until all the icons start to wiggle. Then you can press the small “x” button in a corner of the Skype icon. Please let us know how did it work for you!</p>

<p>Hello ThaPro1998,</p>
<p>You can make you're Avatar similar to the way it looks as the users gamer Pic. You can do this in the Avatar App on the Xbox 360 and or Xbox One. You will need to chose to set you're Avatar as Gamer Pic. There you can choose a Different Background and Style.
 Once their you will have the option to Zoom in or out to find the right one for you. &nbsp;Zoom closer in and you can have the head of the Avatar as you're Pic. If you have any further questions please let us know.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>if you are&nbsp;running <strong>Windows 7 Ultimate</strong> or <strong>Windows 7 Enterprise</strong>, you can install an English language pack&nbsp;via Microsoft Update:</p>

<p>Once you installed a language pack, you can change the interface language of Windows 7 to the language that you select.</p>

<div>You can not do this with Windows 7 Professional. You need to be</div>

<p>
</p><p>1. Does the windows pops up when you start any application?</p>
<p>2. Do you mean that the windows does not close even if you select either of the options in the screenshot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, this could be due to software conflict. Hence, please try doing&nbsp;a clean boot and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>OK, that's odd.</p>
<p>To migrate, did you do everything here? <a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-account/change-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../change-region</a></p>
<p>Log in at <a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a> and make sure that everything seems good there too.</p>
<p>Is the payment option you're trying to use also US-based?</p>

<p>-Yep, I migrated using that link.</p>
<p>-Accounts seem fine, following the commerce link. However, it defaults to "GB - Personal Account" (which has no balance) on the page, but I can switch it to "US - Personal Account" when I hover over it, which show my actual account balance in US dollars.</p>
<p>-I have no payment option stored. It has a US dollar balance from leftover MS points. &nbsp;This should have no issues, since I used part of this balance to pay for Brothers: a Tale of Two Sons on the xbox dashboard a couple months back, while I was in the States.
 It correctly charged by US balance and downloaded the game.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>

            <p>OK, well based on the error message you get while on the console, I would ordinarily guess it's because it's a Game on Demand and the console itself is a different region. Games on Demand have more region locks than other content.</p>
<p>However, that Xbox.com says it too has me confused... because it would only normally complain if there were an account issue (rather than a console issue).</p>
<p>If you say everything looks fine on the Commerce site, you might want to get in touch Phone Support who can poke around more in your account and see if there is anything up. You can reach them here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>
<p>Let us know how that goes.</p>

<p>Thanks for your suggestions, Maxen.</p>
<p>I went ahead and 'chatted' with a MS support person for about an hour to no avail. &nbsp;They suggested, first, that it had to do with current Xbox Live issues with billing, but I reminded them that I am using an existing balance, and the current issues are with
 credit cards. &nbsp;They then found that my account was not 'fully migrated'. &nbsp;They told me to go to
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/Shell/ChangeLocale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live.xbox.com/.../ChangeLocale</a> and select United States, which I did. &nbsp;The purchase did not go through at this point.</p>
<p>They then had me delete my profile on my console and re-download it. &nbsp;The purchase did not go through again, with the same message.</p>
<p>After this, they took my console ID and said my case would be escalated to a 'Specialist' who will contact me within 24-48 hours. &nbsp;I remarked that the sale on Dark Souls is today only (so another 90 minutes), and they assured me they would be in touch as
 soon as possible.</p>
<p>So that's there... &nbsp;I reckon you're right about the Games on Demand having more significant region locks. I guess I wonder if there's a way for them to fix that on the back end.</p>

<p>ngocphi, thanks for your input. &nbsp;Why would they put NTSC/PAL region locks on downloadable content that is priced in local currency matching the account's actual physical and billing region? &nbsp;If they do, it seems pretty silly...</p>

            its a remote access program which allows me to access of The Directors Assistant from a remote location such as my home computer which this is. The directors assistance is the main software/data base we use at our funeral home. . it is not an automatic

            Thanks for the tip but that did not help this issue. I now find that the same issue happens on any computer that I use the program. I though it was a windows 10 issue but it is happening on a windows 8 machine. I contacted the software support team that
 makes to program.

    <title>Timeline of Our Troubles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stucku  say:</h3>
<h2>            Timeline of Our Troubles</h2>
                    
<p>I put this on another thread, but it took me forever.&nbsp; Hence, I felt obligated to give it it's own thread.&nbsp; Wow, I never want to write another post this long again....It's as accurate as I could possibly make it given the circumstances and it you find a
 wrong date or if I left something major out, feel free to comment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a quick timeline of the trouble gamers have faced. &nbsp;I think most people would be accepting of some bumps in the road, but NRS has hit a lot of bumps in the road. &nbsp;With that said, the major netcode problems are behind us, and I am able to enjoy the
 game fully now.</p>
<p>-Game released 4-19-11</p>
<p>-Within a couple of days most gamers that play online are very unhappy with the netcode...lag, desyncs, 5 min to match ranked or player matches, KOTH was insanely laggy with input delay at best, and some 1v1 matches that said they were a 4 dot ping rating
 were very laggy. &nbsp;You get the point. &nbsp;</p>
<p>-People wanted answers and NRS was hush-hush...the forums exploded with "nerd rage"</p>
<p>-On 4-27-11 NRS posted a official statement saying they were fixing the netcode and improvements will be noticed over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>-On 5-25-11 NRS Announces DLC for Klassic Kostume Pack. Oviously more upset fans since no update on the netcode fix, but we get DLC?</p>
<p>-On 6-7-11 Klassic Kostume Pack goes on sale...No Netcode fix</p>
<p>-On 6-11-11 The netcode patch hits PSN but not XBL. &nbsp;Gamers immediately notice a couple of bugs. &nbsp;Gamers who bought the Klassic Kostume Pack sometimes cannot access them during the character select screen and desyncs are very common during the character
 select screen. &nbsp;This has to do with the Kostume pack and alternate costumes in general. &nbsp;Obviously, people that bought the Kostume pack are upset. &nbsp;On the flip side, Most all other problems with the netcode that I listed above are fixed.</p>
<p>-On 6-14-11 Skarlet is slated for a 6-21-11 release.</p>
<p>-On 6-20-11 XBL gets the netcode patch with all the good, bad, and ugly noted above.</p>
<p>-On 6-21-11 Skarlet hits the market. Some people had trouble accessing the Kombat Season Pass, but I don't really know much about it.</p>
<p>-On 6-24-11 NRS released a statement on how to correct the Klassic Kostume Desync bug. &nbsp;I guess it works....some people didn't follow the directions though and desyncs still happen but not as much.</p>
<p>-On 6-27-11 Kenshi is slated for a 7-5-11 release.</p>
<p>-On 7-5-11 PSN gets Kenshi around 3pm Eastern...XBL is caught in limbo....Ed Boone says Kenshi will be on XBL at 5pm on his Twitter account. &nbsp;He later says Kenshi will be released on XBL 7-6-11. &nbsp;Some say it's MS's fault while I believe NRS submitted it
 late, but only MS and NRS know for sure. &nbsp;Common sense tells me that if it was MS's fault they would have updated immediately after finding out about the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>-On 7-6-11Kenshi is released on XBL sometime in the am</p>
<p>I think the major highlight is that it took 2 months to fix the netcode on XBL with only 2 official responses from NRS and WB. &nbsp;That had most gamers pissed off enough to get really ticked at the smaller things like the Kostume Pack bug and the Kenshi delay.
 &nbsp;Currently, I'm very happy with the game. &nbsp;I didn't buy the Kostume Pack or that would have pissed me off I'm sure. &nbsp;Some people were over the top mad while others sugar coated everything...typical forum crap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm sure more typos are in there. &nbsp;I copied it from another thread so I didn't have to type it again. &nbsp;I think part of the issue is a lot of people haven't downloaded the compatibility packs. &nbsp;As a result, sometimes Skarlet and Kenshi aren't available
 for me to select. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows Search fails to find files from Documents folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hackneylad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Search fails to find files from Documents folder</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: <span>Windows 7 Search fails to find files, even after all settings have been checked and the search index was rebuilt</span></p>
<p>I recently bought a new Dell Studio 1558 notebook with Windows 7 Home Premium and transferred across several hundred documents from my old PC into the new 'My Documents' folder.</p>
<p>As many others have found, Windows Search has been completely useless. It seems to have no problem finding files in the Music or Pictures folder, yet anything in the Documents library is invisible to it - even if I search within a small subfolder for a filename
 I can see right in front of me, Windows Search will announce that 'No items match your search'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've taken a number of steps so far to correct the problem, none of which have worked:</p>
<p>1. I've checked which locations are indexed for searching and ensured that the documents library is amongst them (along with the whole of my C drive).</p>
<p>2. I've checked that the relevant file extensions (.doc .docx .pdf etc.) are all selected in the list of 'File Types' within the Indexing options (although I notice that 'Filter Description' for .pdf reads 'Registered IFilert is not found' - no such problem
 with the Word docs).</p>
<p>3. I've deleted and rebuilt the search index.</p>
<p>4. I've run the Windows 7 Search troubleshooter, which reports that it can't find any problems.</p>
<p>5. I've read that some problems with Windows 7 Search can be fixed by editing a registry key (<a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-fix-windows-7-search-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-fix-windows-7-search-problems/</a>) but when I navigate
 to the relevant folder in my registry, only the following three keys are there (not the one mentioned in the fix):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FolderTypes\{0B2BAAEB-0042-4DCA-AA4D-3EE8648D03E5}</li><li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FolderTypes\{36011842-DCCC-40FE-AA3D-6177EA401788}</li><li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FolderTypes\{59BD6DD1-5CEC-4D7E-9AD2-ECC64154418D}</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of things I've noted - if I create a new word doc and save it, Windows Search seems to instantly pick up on it and is able to find it. I also noted that initially when I opened one of the word docs that were transferred over from the old PC, and
 then closed it again, Windows Search picked up on it and could find it. So I went about trying to open and then close all my documents (a&nbsp;laborious&nbsp;task...) but about halfway through Windows Search stopped being able to find them.</p>
<p>All the Word Docs are using Microsoft Word 2007 in either .doc or .docx format, although the problem also applies to Excel, PDF and image files, so I don't think the issue is with Word itself.</p>
<p>I've tried everything I can think of so far including all the solutions I could see suggested in previous threads. I really need the search function working to use my laptop efficiently so any help would be gratefully received!</p>
<p>Thanks, Jack</p>

<p><span>Hi hackneylad,</span></p>
<p><span>This issue can occur if the folder containing the files does not have “SYSTEM” permissions or if it was removed somehow.</span></p>
<p><span>To troubleshoot this, do the following:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Right-click the folder which is not returning results.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Select the Properties option.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click the Security tab.</span></p>
<p><span>4. If SYSTEM appears in the Group or user names box, system permissions is not the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>5. If SYSTEM does not appear in the Group or user names box, click the Edit button to open the Permissions dialog.</span></p>
<p><span>6. In the Permissions dialog, click the Add button.</span></p>
<p><span>7. In the Select Users, Computers, Service Accounts, or Groups dialog, enter system in the Enter the object names to select box and click the Check
 Names button.</span></p>
<p><span>8. Select SYSTEM from the list of Matching names and click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>9. Check if the issue is fixed.</span></p>

<p>Thanks Santosh, I checked the permissions for the relevant folders and SYSTEM was present, so that doesn't seem to be the problem. However I have found a solution, which might work for others experiencing the same issue.</p>
<p>I noticed that if I changed the locations of the files, Windows search seemed to suddenly realise they existed and then indexed and tracked them correctly - even if they were subsequently moved back to the original location. So I just created a temporary
 folder outside my documents library and then moved each sub-folder within my documents folder over to it and then back again, one by one. It was a bit&nbsp;laborious&nbsp;but the problem's solved - I don't know why this worked, but all the old files are now indexed
 and show up correctly when using Windows Search, and it doesn't seem to have any problems tracking newly created files.</p>
<p>Cheers, Jack</p>

When you select the compatibility mode option, Windows&nbsp;7 emulates the selected operating system when you run that particular program.
<br />
<br />
<strong>To run the program in compatibility mode, follow these steps: </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Click Start&nbsp;, and then type the name of the program in the Start Search box. <br />
2) In the Programs list, right-click the program name, and then click Properties.
<br />
3) On the Compatibility tab, click to select the Run this program in compatibility mode for check box.
<br />
4) In the list, select an operating system, and then click OK. <br />
5) If the program still does not work correctly, go to the next method. <br />
&nbsp; <br />
<p>To configure the compatibility mode for an application, just locate the installation directory and right click on the .exe, selecting Properties from the menu.</p>
<p>Select the Compatibility tab:</p>

<p>You can choose to run the program in Windows XP compatibility mode, or even all the way back to Windows 95 compatibility.</p>
<p>Probably the most useful setting&nbsp;to start off with would be to disable the visual themes and desktop composition, if you can’t get things working. If you are trying to run a video game, you will often need to choose “Run this program as an administrator”.
 You’ll have to play around with it, but most likely&nbsp;you can get your application working this way.</p>

<strong>Method 3:</strong> <br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Contact the program vendor or the hardware manufacturer </strong><br />
<br />
If a program will not run in Windows 7, or a piece of hardware does not function as expected after you install Windows 7, contact the program vendor or the hardware manufacturer for guidance about how to troubleshoot the issue. Typically, the software vendor's
 Web site provides a support section that you can use, for example, to search for an error message that you may receive from the program.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Frequently, the software vendor will be able to resolve the incompatibility issue by providing one of the following resolutions:
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
An update to make the current version of the program compatible with Windows&nbsp;7 <br />
A version of the program that is compatible with Windows 7<br />
Information about any configuration changes to make the program compatible with Windows&nbsp;7
<br />

&nbsp;<br />
If these steps fail, You'd have to wait for manufacturer's to update the drivers and then you may visit the manufacturer's website and download the drivers.<br />

Hope this information helped !<br />
