<h2>            Vcredist 2005 install errors on win 10</h2>
                    <p>so i tried installing it, it is a dependency for a videogame that i enjoy - it throws you an error that looks like this: http://smallfetuses.com/screenshots/2016-02-12_16-09-07.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an identical issue&nbsp; with 2008 which i solved after a while - basically when it installs it copies itself to (for some reason) E drive (i have 3 hdd's so it chose E for some reason),before clicking OK on the error you can copy the files over to a separate
 folder - i did that, discovered theres a file called "install.ini" - you can edit that, particularly a line that says "supportwin9x=0" - if you change 0 to 1, it will then allow for installation on win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing that with vcredist 2005, Except it does not install itself in a similar fashion, it is merely a .cab file which contents are useless as well as a vcredist.msi which also contains useless things (as far as editing them goes at least)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i cant really install it and kinda need to</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'm running win 10 LTS build 10240, and obviously i've already tried "simple" things like compatibility modes and so on. what i need is to get it running on a version of windows that it doesnt support :P

            <p>1) Self built computer, i5 4670k, 8gb of ddr3 ram, nvidia 660, definitely meet specs for just about anything</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)A month or two, this is a well known issue if you Google the error, it apparently has existed for a long time now and no one got a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)Sure i killed wuaserv, not turning it back on( i already tried that anyway and that has no effect)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)See previous point</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) no, also this is irrlevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) ltsb, build 10240.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you quit the **** ? These questions are not related to the issue, this is a simple issue that i myself cannot fix, it simply needs a stamp in the code that allows it to run on win 10. That's it</p>

                    I am running Windows XP Pro with the most recent service pack&nbsp; (3, I think...automatic updates) and since the update from servicepack 2, my WinFax pro 10.02 will not install after a recent disk wipe and reinstall of system and software. Symantec is pretending
 that WinFax Pro never existed. Anybody kknow of a fix for this problem?

            There have been numerous reports of issues with WinFax Pro, I dont believe Symantec now supplies or supports it. I ran winFax Pro on an winxp PC, but frequently had issues that required me to reinstall it or reconfigure it using the winFax Pro utilities.
 The program was to say the least problomatic.

            Winfax Pro ver 10.02 and later worked great with XP before service pack updates were introduced.<br />
<br />
Microsoft and Symantec never really did figure out which program had the bug.<br />
<br />
Symantec did issue a detailed fix for problems with XP SP1 but then they stopped supporting Winfax. And the fix did not always work. I discovered one additional step that did.<br />
<br />
Winfax Pro 10.02 and later versions may still have problems integrating with some programs but I found a simple fix for the problems of adding phone book entries and changing other settings that would abort when trying to implement them.<br />
<br />
I had these problems on every computers I have Winfax 10.02 on.<br />
<br />
The bug issue seems related to the setting of your regional time zone not being identified correctly by Winfax. Some how the XP service packs created this bug.<br />
<br />
To fix it I discovered by simply changing your time zone and rebooting your computer fixes the problems. Change your timezone back to your real time zone and reboot again.<br />
<br />
I hope this tip helps many who still want to use XP and Winfax pro 10.02 or later.<br />

            <p>Yes, this seems something to do with the 1607 update. I have to reinstall the LGS510 driver each time</p>
<p>I reconnect my G27, but never had an issue before 1607.</p>
<p>The wheel is now detected as a Driving Force, probably because the 'new' driver has no
</p>
<p>idea what else to say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the Show/hide tool to block Windows updates from stuffing around with this driver,</p>
<p>but it does not come up on the list, so it looks like there is no way to stop Windows 'updating'.</p>
<p>This mandatory Big Brother knows best Windows Updates is getting old real quick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Some games are no longer detecting the wheel on Win10 as well.</p>
<p>Need for Speed Underground, and NFS - Most Wanted ( '05 version ) are two examples.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Little by little, bit by bit, Win 10 is chipping away at the PC gaming experience.</p>
<p>Nothing at all like the happy days promised by MS with the '<em>Best gaming Windows ever...</em>" NOT !</p>

 me to is a very useful tool.&nbsp;But the problem wasn't a reinstalling issue but files that never got removed. I would uninstall the driver, restart PC and the problem just came back. So I ran a program (&nbsp;jv16 PowerTools) that looks for anything related to (Logitech)
 it finds the files and then you can remove then. Then when to control panel and uninstalled one more time Logitech Software (from programs and features). Restarted my PC and installed the 5.10 driver and good to go. (I restarted and still good to go). I did
 take it one step further &nbsp;and went to task manager (alt/ctsl/delete) startup/Logitech download assistant and disable it.</p>

            <p>I have found that the driver reverts to the one Win10 wants&nbsp; when the wheel gets disconnected between use.</p>
<p>I just reinstalled the drivers yesterday, and found they have reverted when plugging the wheel in again today.</p>
<p>I had the Logitech Download Assistant disabled in Startup a long time ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>EDIT:</em></span> I just did some experimenting. I don't know why, but there seems to only be a problem over a period of</p>
<p>time. In the short term of a few minutes shutdown there seems to be no affect on the G27 being recognised.</p>
<p>I have tried with the wheel being left connected and removed and only reconnected after rebooting, and it</p>
<p>is still being recognised, but if I have the wheel disconnected over night the problem pops up again. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is, the profiling software still says v. 5.10.127 even though it does not properly detect the G27.</p>
<p>It may be Windows is installing a different ( 'new') driver, but this does not affect the profiling software version number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I initially rebooted after uninstalling the driver Windows installs, as I do with all drivers, but I had to go off line to prevent Windows from doing it's own thing on reboot (there should be a brief message on reboot that Window</p>
<p>is installing the driver, but this may not always pop up ) . </p>
<p>I have found there is no need to reboot. Just uninstall via P&amp;F and then reinstall.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any changes made to your computer before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>General Troubleshooting of Stop Messages</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you can’t find a specific reference to your problem, running through the following checklist stands a good chance of resolving the problem for you. This checklist is also
 usually the best approach to troubleshooting some specific Stop messages.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If you have recently added new hardware, remove it and retest.
</span></p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Run hardware diagnostics supplied by the manufacturer.
</span></p>
<p><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Make sure device drivers and system BIOS are up-to-date.
</span></p>
<p><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>However, if you’ve installed new drivers just before the problem appeared, try rolling them back to the older ones.
</span></p>
<p><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Open the box and make sure all hardware is correctly installed, well seated, and solidly connected.
</span></p>
<p><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Check for viruses. </span></p>
<p><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Investigate recently added software. 
</span></p>
<p><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Examine (and try disabling) BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b></p>
<p><span>When a Stop message occurs, Windows can create a debug file for very detailed analysis. To do this, it needs a workspace equal to the amount of physical RAM you have installed.
 If you resize your Win XP pagefile minimum to less than the size of your physical RAM, you will get an advisory message that your system may not be able to create a debugging information file if a Stop error occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I hope this information helps. Please get back to us if you have any more questions about this issue.</p>

<p>Original Title:&nbsp;I have a new issue and I can't figure out what it is or where it's at the name of the issue is TestWorker. I'm running win7 64 and IE9 with the adobe flash square beta 64x and the 32x version. Thanks for any help/info!</p>
<p>I believe this might be related to either Adobe Flash updater or something to do with IE 9, because it seems to try to run about once a week 15&nbsp;minutes after boot. Anyway here is one of the several logs it produces for about 5 minutes and it gives up I guess.

<p>It seems you are running two 'beta' programs. Have you tried uninstalling them to see if the problem corrects itself?</p>
<p>Beta programs are not considered to be bullet-proof and may in fact cause this type of problem.</p>

            Hi Michael-Bereece,
<br />
<br />When you are in the process of picking the distribution of windows you can download the Gnome Version. The link is: <a href="https://ubuntugnome.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ubuntugnome.org/</a>
<br />
<br />If you also want to see the differents flavors of Linux feel free to visit <a href="https://distrowatch.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://distrowatch.com</a>

<br />Have a nice day.

<p>A few snafu overcome, the promised Windows Update to Windows 10 was finally installed, works, but:</p>

The above&nbsp; is about as close to applicable to symptoms of my situation, as the given Activation err code is 0xC004C003 which explains itself as "Blocked" , so you can see the association I make.&nbsp;&nbsp; All other aspects I believe I have looked at, inapplicable unless
 I missed something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<strong><em>Unfortunately the citation explains nothing about how to escalate being incorrectly castigated.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
And I'm up for the discussion, but I need to get somewhere - calling the Activation line and talking to techs running an intelligent call decision system isn't cutting it so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
I purchased my Toshiba with OEM installation of Win 7 from a Toshiba dealer. (still a dealer)</p>
<p>Up until the upgrade the system description page said proudly "Genuine Microsoft" opposite my product id &amp; key. The SP1 update required revalidation. The Get Windows 10 app advised me that my system was "Ready to Update".&nbsp; This has to be an administrative
 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the purchase, hardware - not just media; Its difficult for me to believe this reputable vendor bootlegged the os s/w, I'm not saying its impossible, just very unlikely, the computer was competitively priced alongside other vendors, including national
 sellers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Push-come-to-shove, I have the Toshiba recovery disks. </p>
<p>BUT I DO NOT want to have to take that path! </p>
<p>If I have to go back to Windows 7 and rebuild the system I will become supremely dissatisfied with MS, a company I have believed in since my PC-AT, own stock thereof. Especially given that the update from 7 to 10 went perfectly, once underway. Too close
 to void these promises.</p>
<p>This is a very low power netbook system, and Win10 runs as good as expected,&nbsp; <em>
<strong>sans Activation, that is.</strong></em>&nbsp; ( Perhaps better!, I expected more bloat -there are never fewer lines of code- but I turn&nbsp;off most&nbsp;that are unessential to ease the requirements.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Other points raised by Da Costa:</p>
<p><br />
The console command sfc /verifyonly just passed with no errs, as Mr Da Costa had referred to this within ZiGZag's article he referenced. But that is windows 10. In Win 7, prior to the update, I ran a similar checker: HOTFIX KB947821 System Readiness Tool,&nbsp;
 suggested during the pursuit to upgrade, some how related to DISM, I think. (link

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Backup &amp; Restore are running now. I'm not sure what exactly I'm backing up, but it was a test that is not doing well - failure to format the DVD(?).</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Early in the update I read about downloading Win10 ISO Images on the ms website, good thing I didn't follow that route, or I'd be doing that win 7 restore, given what I read in Da Costa's article.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> Its not a "clean install",
 but an upgrade run by Windows Update (a Win 7 artifact now). </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>But I still need to understand how to escalate this MS error to satisfaction.</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is but one, the first of five computers I run (one Win8.1 all the rest Win7), plan to update.
</p>
<p>If I have to beat my head against the wall this long for each, I guess I just won't care anymore.
</p>
<p>Pray for me. </p>

            <p>So this morning I am back on the phone with tech support today:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transferred to space&nbsp;twice, and connected once to an individual who&nbsp;could not hear any uttered response, so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>More importantly is&nbsp;followup that Windows backup/(restore) failed</strong> last night, somehow getting into a logic loop that kept repeating the same err, which was not being able to see more that 1GB on a SuperMulti DVD drive (Insufficient Backup
 Space), nor being able to format (loop loop loop) for and ISO image backup.</p>
<p>But I had little expectation going in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gather by the deafening level of&nbsp;"escalation" suggestions &nbsp;that what I'm doing is&nbsp; state of the art..
</p>
<p>That or Monday got everyone too busy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>==============================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>Late Edit (3.5 hours past my last expected callback from Support)</p>
<p>After I'd given up for today (I'm 3 hours west of&nbsp;Pacific Time), </p>
<p>Support called back:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Briefly as I was able I tried to bring the individual up to date, &nbsp;including the completed last verbal with them two days ago, "Being&nbsp;blocked for being a Win7 Starter edition."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per usual, we go through the gymnastics of delivering the A-N key and some time later he returned to the line and indicated that "this has been an issue, but believed it to be resolved and if I were to give it a few days, he indicated that it would self-activate
 and message me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we wait.</p>
<p>As I learn more I of course will share it.</p>
<p>I just wish I was as knowledgeable as the many folks who have offered so many vectors to me for investigation, &nbsp;that I might be capable&nbsp;of contributions&nbsp;greater&nbsp;than mere chronicles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Very Late Edit : Suddenly it occurs to me that when the fellow days ago said it was blocked because it was a "Starter" edition - Perhaps he was trying to&nbsp;express that is was&nbsp;"Blocked
<p>
</p><p>ANYONE? Is queuing a factor here?</p>

            <p>Persistence is the only means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the incubation period prescribed by Tech Support two weeks ago, I figured it was time to turn the crank again. Fortunately the 2.5 hour phone call culminated in a Remote Desktop session where the Tech inserted new PRODUCT ID &amp; LICENSE KEYS.</p>
<p>Activation proceeded and so far so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>16 Aug to Sept 8, about ten calls, half succeeding in getting to a live individual willing to say something besides that "they were unable to do what I needed", ended today: 23 days&nbsp;@ 25% minimum dedication.</p>
<p>The calls are excruciating enough, but all the ancillary reading,&nbsp;chasing concepts&nbsp;that end nowhere helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why these numbers could be corrupted in a fully automated process is beyond my cares, but it&nbsp;blows and a waste of about a week of the precious little time I have left.
</p>
<p>Probably just the piracy police at MS.</p>

<h2>            Unknown user name in file properties</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was just checking the preferences on a few of my folders and in some of them it says 'user unknown S-1-15-3-4096 in the security tab. There is no other user set up on the account which is a concern to me. Is this a hacker?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 'advanced' it says 'user inherited from-NOT INHERITED'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>could someone explain what this is please. Is it something to worry about? Why is it only on some folders and not on all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, on some it says UNKNOWN USER then the number and on others it just says&nbsp; S-1-15-3-4096.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise. thanks </p>

Hackers try to stay hidden for as long as they can. No good hacker would create an entry that sticks out like a canine attachment. What you see refers to an account that you deleted some time ago. Nothing to worry about.

Some installation programs will create an account which they subsequently delete.

    <title>Blu-Ray Stutter and random chapter pop-up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> puzzledmonkey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blu-Ray Stutter and random chapter pop-up</h2>
                    
<p>I've only had my Xbox One for a month and I've watched a couple of Blu-Rays with no issue until this week.</p>
<p>I fist noticed it with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, where the picture stuttered occasionally throughout the film and also the pop-up chapter menu appeared on three separate occasions during the film.</p>
<p>I assumed it was an issue with the disc so I've tried a few others like Avengers Assemble and have the same issue.</p>
<p>I've tried setting the Blu-Ray playback to 24Hz and can see no difference and also turned off the BD Live option.</p>
<p>Also, of note: I've tried some much older Blu-Rays such as The Crow and the problem does not seem to exist for them and I've also tried playing discs on my PS3 with no problems there at all.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had these problems and is their a fix forthcoming?</p>

<p>I've still had no response from Microsoft on these issues and I can't find any information anywhere that tells me they're going to fix this issue which seems to occur with 'newer' Blu-Rays.

    <title>Windows 8.1 Storage Spaces Hard Drive Re-Use Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allen coleman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Storage Spaces Hard Drive Re-Use Problem</h2>
                    <p>I set up a "home server" running Windows 8.1. &nbsp;My main storage was a Storage Spaces Pool that contained 8 hard drives running under a parity scheme. &nbsp;I use this to archive movies, music and television programs from my Windows Media Center system in another
 room of the house. &nbsp;When I originally set up the pool, I told Storage Spaces that my pool was 50 TB even though it was not even close to that amount. &nbsp;Not sure why I did that but the problem it caused was that Windows always tells me how much room I have left
 of the 50 TB instead of how much room I really have left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to fix things, after 12 months of successfully using Storage Spaces, I decided to save up all of my data to external backups and re-create my Storage Spaces pool from scratch using the actual amount of available space as the stated size of my pool. &nbsp;Had
 a few problems deleting the original pool; system kept telling me that the pool was still in use when I was very sure it was not. &nbsp;Finally, I was successful in deleting the pool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to re-create my pool with three additional new hard drives in addition to the eight original drives from the deleted pool, Storage Spaces refuses to allow me to incorporate the previously used drives into my newly created pool, even though the
 old pool has been deleted. &nbsp;An error message stating that the old drives are still in use prevents me from incorporating them into my newly created pool. &nbsp;These eight old drives can be formatted and used successfully as regular data drives without problem
 but Windows 8.1 Storage Spaces will not accept the previously used drives into my new pool, even though they are completely empty and have been re-initialized and totally cleared of all partitions and data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Approximately eight calls and six hours on the telephone with at least a dozen technicians and supervisors at Microsoft Answer Desk finally resulted in them telling me that Storage Spaces is only supported by the Pro support department for business users
 with at least 10 devices. &nbsp;I have scoured the Internet and tried many methods to "clear" these old drives unsuccessfully. &nbsp;Before giving up on the parity savings of Storage Spaces, I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to get my installation of Windows
 8.1 to "release" these old drives so that they can be incorporated into a new Storage Spaces Pool. &nbsp;I have not yet tried re-installing Windows 8.1 on my server machine; I was hoping someone might know a quicker, more elegant way to clear these old drives out
 of my registry where I suspect the problem lies.</p>

<h2>            Skype Name How to Edit, Skype photo How to remove</h2>
                    Hi, I just started to use Skype and now setting up my profile. A Skype name was assigned by Skype, and I'd like to change it so it will look different than my email address. How do I edit that? Also, I uploaded a photo, but now want to change it and the
 edit feature will not let me do anything. I'm on a laptop with Windows 10. Does someone know? Thanks! LCLakeMich

            Hello LCLakeMichigan 
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. 
<br />
<br />1st to change the photo in Skype:
<br />* From Chats, select your profile picture.
<br />* Select your profile picture again to upload a photo, view your photo, or remove it.
<br />* Select the check mark check mark button button to save your changes. 
<br />
<br />::::::Skype for ​Windows 10 (version 12)::::::
<br />* Select your profile picture.

<br />
<br />_______________________________________________
<br />
<br />Now, to Edit Skype name, you must have to know:
<br />
<br />Your Skype name is the username you created when you first joined Skype, other than your email address or phone number.
<br />
<br />If you sign in with an email address or phone number instead, then you have a Microsoft account, not a Skype Name.
<br />

<br />
<br />Unfortunately, you cannot change your Skype Name.
<br />
<br />You can create a new Microsoft account to use on Skype however, you will not be able to access your contacts and conversation history on your old Skype account.
<br />
<br />However, be present that for your contacts, when they go to find you in their skype they see your "Display Name".

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I own&nbsp; a netbook with only 32Gb of hard disk and windows 10 now cover more than 19 Gb reducing the empty space to minimum.</p>
<p>I have already useddisk clean up and installed most of applications to external disk but this iss slowing the system.</p>
<p>Is it possible to reduce windows size on disk? </p>
<p>

<h2>            Unable to download any programs&#47;files</h2>
                    <p>I had a problem with my computer when the keyboard and mouse no longer worked. I done a refresh and while I kept my files the programs they belonged too disappeared. I have tried to download the programs again but windows 7 will not download anything. This
 includes Microsoft Office amongst other programs. I get varying problems including "Page can't be displayed" and the download getting interrupted and when I resume, it starts all over again from the beginning. Previously Windows 7 had been upgraded to Windows
 8.1. As it stands I am unable to download or update any files.</p>

<p>Try this first and it should&nbsp;fix any system errors. Go to Microsoft download page, scroll down page&nbsp;and find the Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (KB976932) download stand alone installer. Check to see if you have 32 or 64 bit system.
 Get the right one for your system.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since you have issues accessing web pages and downloading, which could just be internet options settings are incorrect, then try another browser. If you use IE, then try google chrome or Firefox. Or uninstall SP1 if you have it installed and after restart
 try to download SP1 from link above. Do not use windows update to install SP1. Use the stand alone installer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not able to download the installer until you uninstall the SP1, that may fix the issues, and I would turn off windows update and install or re-install&nbsp;SP1 from your download SP1. Be sure to turn Windows Update back on after restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**If you cant download it, then download it on another computer and copy it to your system via network shared folders or burn it on a DVD or copy it on to a thumb drive. You need to check the size of your download on web page if copying to a thumb drive
 to assure thumb drive is large enough. It should be. 1GB or 2GB will work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If copying SP1 file&nbsp;to DVD, do not burn an ISO file, just copy it as a standard file to burn on DVD. Then if on DVD or TD, copy the file on to your desk top and install from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now go to installed programs. </p>
<p>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Programs and Features</p>
<p>Select top left; View Installed updates. </p>
<p>Look for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (KB976932).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is there, uninstall it. Restart computer, log on and open up the download file SP1 and install Win 7 Service Pack 1. Restart computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that will fix your issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you have individual programs prior to re-install of SP1 that are corrupt, you may have to re-install those programs but your OS and the issues you describe should be fixed, including windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the SP1 install, go to windows update and select to also install updates for Microsoft programs. Now check for updates and install them all. after restarting system, check windows update again until there are no more updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have trouble installing or un-installing the SP1, go here and <span>Download and run the System Update Readiness Tool.</span></p>

<p>I do not understand why a mouse and keyboard not working and you did a reset as in re installing the operating system again. Hmmm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you did a system refresh, then probably it is a new install, it keeps your personal files but all your installed programs some or most&nbsp;will have to be re installed again I believe if I understand you correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By you saying files you kept, do you mean the shortcuts to installed programs. I would go to C:\Program Files(x86) and C:\Program Files and see if your installed programs are still there, if not you basically did a Windows reinstall, like an upgrade that
 keeps your personal files but you may have to reinstall software and maybe some drivers again.</p>

<p>So you upgraded 7 to 8 and then back to 7 again. I can almost guarantee there is major file corruption.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will never do an upgrade like that. I will back up all my personal files and do a fresh install of the new operating system. Just like upgrading to Windows 10 Pro&nbsp;from 7 Ultimate. I had my 7 image for back-up, did the Free upgrade process (U.S. ONLY),
 which was a must, then retrieved my Windows OS Activation&nbsp;Key Code using a free program to retrieve it in windows (and it&nbsp;will even retrieve Microsoft Office and more Activation Key Codes) and wrote&nbsp;Key down. Then downloaded the windows 10 Pro 64bit installer
 and burned&nbsp;a Bootable&nbsp;ISO File On DVD&nbsp;and did a fresh install formatting hard drive, installing and activating windows with Key Code and getting rid of all the corruption and crap, like Windows.old folder and install logs files etc, by doing a clean install.
 Some programs after upgrade do not work and you have to reinstall most programs anyways after upgrade. Too much crap and corruption. You can also remove old windows installs and install log files in Disk cleanup, but you still have all the mess installing
 operating system over old OS and corruption and that windows old folder is about 20GB to 60GB of wasted drive space. And you could also wind up with a Program Files.old and Program Files(x86).old folder to get rid of taking up more wasted drive space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Actually, if an issue occurred,&nbsp;I would restore my system back exactly from my GOOD system image/shadow copy I made prior to upgrading to Win 8 with the repair DVD if any issues on 7 or 8 occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just like system restore, it is very flawed and does not always work and causes file corruption or does not either restore back to a point or does not restore back working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backing up your personal files using BU/Restore might be good idea too, but I do not use it. The recent system image (done weekly) has everything backed up and when GOOD image restored, all your problems are gone. I just copy and paste my personal files
 manually to an external drive or another PC's Public Folder&nbsp;on my network. Or you can&nbsp;use a DVD or&nbsp;Thumb drive, and then copy/paste them back to my restored system&nbsp;from Image.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is to assure you if your Image is several days or weeks old, then anything you have did, installed or&nbsp;saved after you created your image will be saved. If you create an image just before upgrading or making a change to your system, then backing up personal
 files is not necessary but it is necessary to back up personal files on a fresh windows install regardless if you reformat hard drive or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should learn how to use Windows 7 Back-up/Restore (Not available in all versions of&nbsp;7, 8 and 10 I believe)&nbsp;and once everything is working great, create a SYSTEM IMAGE/SHADOW COPY and create a 1 repair disk once or 2 for a back up disk and&nbsp;this will restore
 your system back exactly if something goes wrong.. See link below:</p>

<h2>            100&#37; Disk Usage by ntoskrn.exe in Windows 8&#47;8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>before i start i would like to point out that i have my Windows in Czech, so im not sure if i get everything correctly. I have a problem with 100% disk usage, lagging my computer. It started about a month ago, my programs and files stopped responding, so
 i opened task manager to see what's the deal. Then i noticed that my disk usage randomly goes up to 100% for no apparent reason. Also, i think it started happening after i updated my Windows, but im not sure of that. At first, it was happening like once a
 hour or two so i didnt pay it much attention. But then it went up to like 3/4 times a minute. Sometimes, the lag lasts for 3 seconds, sometimes 20 or the system stops responding completely, so i have to shut it manually. I was able to track down the process
 that kept the high disk usage, it was called system and further ntoskrn.exe. I did some research of the problem on the internet, but nothing seemed to help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The List of possible fixes i tried:</p>
<p>Disabling the superfetch, windows media network sharing, windows search, windows update and many more services</p>
<p>Setting the paging size to the size of my ram or disabling it completely.</p>
<p>I tried to defragment and check for mistakes in my drive.</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling&nbsp;Opera, my browser</p>
<p>I tried changing the power plan to high (which seemed to improve the system a little bit)</p>
<p>Ram memory test and Chkdsk</p>
<p>Scanning my system for viruses via several programs</p>
<p>Fixing my registry in CCleaner</p>
<p>And many more, that i couldnt recall</p>
<p>
</p><p>When nothing has worked, i tried The System Restore feature, which seemed to work for a day or two, but then the problem showed again. I tried all these things above again, with the same result. Nothing has worked again, so i tried to upgrade to Windows
 8.1, which has solved the problem for a day again. So this time, i did a fresh install of Windows, but that didnt help either. Its making me think that i have corrupted something in my computer instead of my Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesnt happen all the time, sometimes, im able to use the system for a day or two without any freeze or lag spike, sometimes it keeps the 100% disk usage for a three days in a row.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to further describe the lag or freeze, it starts like a normal lag, nothing seems to be working, excepts my mouse. I can move around clearly, but when i click something, its shows up the Windows message that the program stopped responding. It expires
 after 2-20 seconds and everything is normal again, but it happens again in a matter of seconds, sometimes minutes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my computer: MS Windows 8/8.1 64-bit, AMD Radeon HD 7770 Series, 8,0 GB RAM, AMD FX-4100 Quad-Core Processor</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any questions, please ask, i will be glad for anything that could help me. Also, im not a computer person, i know some basic stuff but nothing complicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help, also here's a screenshot i managed to take in my task manager.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8d29980-9790-493b-873d-f8984210057e" /></p>

            <p>Thank for your reply, and sorry for me not replying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However i think i made some progress. I disabled the Windows Search service and i also deleted the Windows.edb file which seemed to made a lot of mess. After that, the lag suddenly stopped for about 2 days. Then it came back happening like 3/4 times a day.
 Also, i think they lasted a little bit longer. So i also deleted the Windows.old folder which contained data of my old Windows. So i deleted that as well and the system seems pretty fluent so far. I was told that both the Windows.edb and Windows folders would
 increase their size with time, so that might even be the cause of my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, i will see after some time, if my problem truly disappeared. </p>

            <p>Enable everything that you have disabled. They are the cause they are just things that do use resources and disabling them makes the resource hog have a little more room to hide its use of resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Registry cleaners are really bad I would try and undo everything they did with a system restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you do that run the idea that are here and report back the results including any error messages.

<p>
</p><p>Also, upgrade your graphics card, network adapter and any other drivers that may be out of date. If a driver was updated recently use the Device manager option to roll&nbsp;it back. To do that you right click in the device&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Re-enabling all the services i disabled didnt help at all. I dont think Registry cleaners matter, because i had the problem on all of my reinstalled windows before even trying to run Registry Cleaners. I tried Windows Servicing, but that didnt gave me any
 errors and didnt help at all. My drivers are up to date and were up to date&nbsp;before the problem started. I updated them only after i reinstalled&nbsp;Windows.</p>

</p><p>Yes registry cleaners are a huge problem. If windows changes a key or adds a new set of keys in a update and those keys are important cleaning them will ruin the PC. There is no possible way for the cleaner to keep up to date on the millions of PC&nbsp;configurations
 or stay up to date with windows updates or 3rd party software and driver updates. For example say a driver updates and it is needed during boot but the cleaner destroyed its keys, now if it loads during boot it may fail and hang other drivers or services and
 cause a ripple effect of broken drivers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus there is no added benefit. Maybe 20 years ago but not today. Check the startup tab in task manager and disable all of the programs in there. Also did the issue happen in safe mode?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would look for software that was installed before the issue started on all the computers.

            <p>All my security softwares, like antiviruses and stuff were removed even before the issue started. I have never really used them. I tried disabling Windows Defender even yesterday to see if that would help. It didnt so i can enable it again. About that full
 scan, i have tried that before, but it would take like really long time, i had it turned for a day and it wasnt even about 10% percent, however i will try look at that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Registry Cleaners a lot via CCleaner for the last year. I understand what you are saying, but if CCleaner would corrupt my registry, wouldnt a simple Windows reinstall solve it? Because when i reinstalled my Windows on this computer, the issue appeared
 again and no Registry Cleaners were used then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have permanently disabled all startup programs and the issue still persisted even in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont think i installed any software before the issue started to happen. But i think it was after a windows update. But im not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, i think, or at least i hope i made some progress. My guess is that its some kind of a problem with my Hard Drive. Before you ask, i have the latest driver downloaded. From now on, i have will to translate what i did into english, but i might not be
 really accurate. So, i looked at my Hard Drive in Device Manager. Under Properties, in the second tab from the left side (values or principles, not really sure how to translate it) i un-checked the "Enable Saving into cache on the disk" box, or something like
 that. And it worked like a charm. The high disk activity was no longer constant. It then happened like 1/2 times in a hour. Maybe even less. I highly doubt this is a permanent solution, but i hope it will be at least temporary so we can find out what the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanky you for your help.</p>

            <p>Uninstall Opera and you should be good. It is hammering away at all of your resources. If I am wrong leave it out of the picture till we finish so that any other issues are easier to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you have all&nbsp; Windows Services enabled that were disabled before to find the issue. If you disable some of those it may lower the disk activity but when you go to do something it will make it go up for a lot longer
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were the Virus programs removed with a uninstall or because you refreshed the PC? If they came preloaded then use the removal tools on that web site I sent to make sure they are gone</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, that would create a new registry as long as the method removes all programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many computers does this happen to? What happens if you disconnect the internet? Does the disk usage go down?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The item in you Disk Drives inside Device Manager is in the tab Policies and it is Enable Write caching on the device. That should be enabled, It allows the drive to cache what needs to be written and later on write it to the disk when the disk is free.
 If that is disabled there is a higher chance that the disk will become bottle-necked and there will be writes that need to wait for each other</p>

    <title>Can Bitlocker be used to encrypt mirrored disks in a RAID 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> win7geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can Bitlocker be used to encrypt mirrored disks in a RAID 1 volume&#63;</h2>
                    Is it possible to use Bitlocker to encrypt a RAID 1 volume in Windows 7 Ultimate? The volume consists of two mirrored disks, created using a RAID enabled motherboard. What happens if one of the disks fails? Will I still be able to read the other and re-mirror
 it to a new disk?

<p>I have the simple answer. BitLocker doesn't work on software RAIDs, but it does work for hardware RAIDs.</p>
<p>I'm running a RAID 1 under Windows 7 Ultimate x64 and wanted a way to secure my drives with BitLocker. So I did a lot of research to finally find the answer on Microsoft TechNet's&nbsp;site, buried deep. This answer should be out in the open in Windows 7 Help,
 yet I found nothing and wanted to be sure before I made a move. Here's the link if you want to read up on it yourself. It should take you to a chart about halfway down the document. Our concern is listed under Drive Configuration &gt; Software, where you'll see
 that software-based RAIDs are not supported. I've also found similar confirmation on other websites/forums.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Preview support help</h2>
                    <p>hello I been a member of the preview program for a while now and I just decovered I was part of the ring 3 preview program and decided to go to ring 4. After I done that. It now shows pending. How long will I be in pending before I can use the the updates that come with ring 4. It's been pending for&nbsp;an&nbsp;hour now. Also since my account is the home Xbox and part of&nbsp;the preview program does my family members also have acces to the updates?</p>

            <p>hi!</p><p><br /></p><p>Pending status can be anywhere from 72 hours to a week. I know there is a review process but not sure what exactly is reviewed.</p><p><br /></p><p>Second answer, Yes. Since the preview update is system wide, everyone on the console and especially those you have added to Family enjoy all the benefits of the beta as well.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you have issues, like wanting to change to a custom Gamer Pic, if you have a pc and download the Xbox Beta app, not the regular Xbox app, you can change custom Gamer Pics that way.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope that answers your questions!</p><p>CyclingGuyNOLA</p>

            <p>Submitting a case review is the only way to possibly have your suspension lifted.
