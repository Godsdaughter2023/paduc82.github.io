    <title>Emailing Excel files - blank subject line with latest update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Emailing Excel files - blank subject line with latest update</h2>
                    <p>The latest updat to the excel app, which we run on our iPads where I work, no longer populates the email subject line with the file name. The file is also only partially displayed, so this means our entire team, which sends upwards of 50 emails a day, has
 to now write down the file name before selecting "share file", and then type the name in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, &nbsp;when sharing files, either through outlook on a PC or most any other scenario, the file name automatically appears in the email subject line. I have spent a couple hours trying to reach tech support, (which is poor for Office apps) and this is
 my last resort looking for a fix.</p>
<p>While I'm at it, where is checkbox functionality as well.</p>

            You posted this in Windows PHONE 7 forum. I can move this to the Windows 7 forum or you should find a Nokia forum for help on this. We can only give help for the Nokia Lumia line here since those are Windows Phones.<br />
<br />
As a short line though, it might not be possible to Bluetooth file transfer the photos to your laptop.<br />

<br />
They haven't put a way in as yet however there is a way to stop the text from showing at the top if you put ........................ after&nbsp;the name in the contact list then when the message shows it will only show the name followed by&nbsp;dots not the&nbsp;content of
 the&nbsp;message. I know this is a workaround but it might help until MS add the feature.

<br />
Unfortunately&nbsp; there is no Option to stop showing the top "toast" notifications on your Windows phone . That feauture is missing on the Windows phones..<br />
<br />
Microsoft should consider the user privacy and have to provide a functionality to disable the same on its next OS update..<br />

    <title>how to insert a break in a slideshow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m.al yassin  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to insert a break in a slideshow</h2>
                    I have a presentation with a opening slide index then closure side. Hyper linked all the respective subjects (in hidden slides) to the index, and hyper linked a "back" button to the index. (clicking on the slide or pressing space bar and not choosing a
 subject (link) moves to the closure slide)<br />
The problem is, once you access any of the hidden slides through one of the Subjects links of the index, clicking (or space bar) not choosing the "Back" button, takes you to the next hidden slide of a different subject (that should've been directed from the
 index slide).<br />
I recall there was a "Break" option in previous versions where I can add a copy of the closure slide and never cross it to the next "off presentational" slides, but can't find it anymore.<br />

            I don't recall there ever being a "break" function and as far as I know if you linked to hidden slides clicking space etc always took you to the next slide (hidden or not)<br />
<br />
If you make each "topic" a custom show and make the link to the custom show with "Show and return" ticked it should do what (I think) you want.<br />

<h2>            Can not access my Microsoft Office 365 online</h2>
                    I have an Office 365 account that has my recreation board web site and email. I can not access it since I have forgotten the password and the only way to retrieve the password is by going through the steps to recover it. The phone that is linked to the
 account is lost and one of the steps is they have to call or text that phone. It will not let me get the password reset or retrieve it. Please help me. I have been bumped from person to person with this problem for months.

<h2>            Installing Insider Build 14352 Error 0X8020000f</h2>
                    <p>Good evening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC Set to Fast Ring WinUp offered PC Build 14352.&nbsp; Downloaded quickly, and installed to 64% where it stalled.&nbsp; Error presented 0X8020000f with no explanation. "Try again later."&nbsp; Space requirement from MSFT was 5 GB and I had 7.5GB. Searching the web I can
 find no explanation from any source for this error and I've read the MSFT forums don't have any.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to overcome this error?&nbsp; I can try the two common regedits offered for Win Up install problems if the reg values and subkeys are present.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might add MSFT is carrying forward a long standing tradition of totally worthless error messages for which there is no explanation, MSKB, or solution and the wording is childishly insulting.&nbsp; I wonder who is the Product Manager for the team who writes
 "There was a problem try again later with no helpful solution on forums or from MSFT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me like going to a doctor when you feel very sick and the doc does a cursory history/PE and says "Yeah you're pretty damn sick.&nbsp; There is a problem but I don't know what the **** it is and I don't have a clue how to find out.&nbsp; Have a nice day."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the opposite of all the achievements in Dona Sarkar's extraordinary career.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA.</p>

            <p>Space requirements of 5GB is for the download.&nbsp; Space requirements for installing are now 30+GB and can be much larger if you have a large amount of Programs installed on the drive that you are installing to.</p>
<p>With a fairly clean system my system drive has 26.3GB used.</p>
<p>The old original requirement was about 12GB of space and this was for a clean install meaning that there was nothing on the drive.</p>
<p>I had one installer that complained about th0 40GB I suggested and ended up having to have 65+GB of free space as he had so much on the drive that was put into Windows.old.</p>
<p>I just checked a new installation(installed this evening) on another of my test laptops which still has Windows.old and it was 11.5GB by itself.&nbsp; Windows.old gets removed.

            <p>I don't want to argue with you but I'll make a few points.&nbsp; <strong>I have been installing Windows 10 builds since near the start of the Insider program 11/14 since 1/15.&nbsp;</strong> I have followed the forums (this one and TechNet closely).&nbsp; I have seen a
 boatload of problems with Windows Update, but the majority of them were about free space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not reporting&nbsp; theoretical fiction.&nbsp; I'm reporting my experience having successfully installed nearly every build since the Insider Program started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You stated:</p>
<p><em><strong>"Space requirements for installing are 30+GB and can be much larger if you have a large amount of Programs installed on the drive that you are installing to.
</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>With a fairly clean system my system drive has 26.3GB used.</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The old original requirement was about 12GB of space and this was for a clean install meaning that there was nothing on the drive."</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>You may believe that, but I have lived an experience where I have installed all of these builds and NEVER HAD TO HAVE MORE THAN 8.5 GB OF FREE SPACE AT THE MOST.&nbsp; SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GETTING THOSE ASTRONOMICAL FIGURES, AND I'M WELL AWARE
 OF EXPANSION AND COMPRESSION IN SETUP SINCE VISTA.</strong></em></p>
<p>The last build I installed was 14332.&nbsp; The MSFT box tokld me I needed 8.5GB total to install (no download and multiples of ten to install that you claim).&nbsp; I've never seen that happen and it makes me smile that you tell me I needed multiples of tens of GBs
 to install when I never have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further I only have Office&gt;Adobe Reader&gt;Silverlight&gt;Firefox and Adobe Flash on the box.&nbsp; I uninstalled iTunes before installing the last build.&nbsp; It said I needed 8.5 GB.&nbsp; I moved things to my external.&nbsp; 10432 installed flawlessly.</p>
<p>This time I got the&nbsp; message I needed 5.0GB for the<strong> TOTAL INSTALL. I made sure I got 7.5 GB.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>And in my experience every time MSFT thought I needed more, it told me.&nbsp; But s ince 11/14 it has never told me that I needed anything more in any instance of an install than 8.5 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So where in the world are you getting those space requirements since I've successfully installed dozens of builds with no more than 8.5 GB total?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to me with all due respect it is unprofessional of Dona Sarker to give error messages to Insiders she says she wants to feel like family as bright and talented as she is that say simply "you have a problem" and to rattle off some number for which there
 is no explanation and no MSKB.&nbsp; Where did they pull that number from?&nbsp; </p>
0X8020000f It must have come from somewhere, or someone but where or from whom&nbsp; and why?<br />

</p><p>1) I didn't download any .iso for 14352.&nbsp; I simply set the Insider setting to Fast Ring and the build was offered.</p>
<p>2) I don''t let Windows.old get in my way of getting realestate.&nbsp; I delete it to make space prior to any install attempt.<br />
<em><strong>3) Again the space requirements you are quoting and linking ha ve not been anywhere close to what I have been using to install Win 10 builds since the start of the Insider program 11/14.&nbsp; So you can quote 16 GB and 20 GB into infinity but it's not
 the amount of space I have ever needed. 8.5 GB has bee the max on planet earth on this box for successful installs.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>4) Finally it makes no sense for MSFT to have those larger space requirements when in fact they give you the amount you need during a download or setup.</strong></em></p>

            <p>Lawrence-- </p>
<p>
</p><p>Did it occur to you that you don't know what that error message means and if MSFT, Donna&nbsp; Sarkar,&nbsp; or the Windows Update team know I asked them and they haven't responded.&nbsp; I have seen a lot of Windows Update problems since Win 10 started on the forums and
 helped when I could. Many are space related, but of course not all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1) In&nbsp; the first place what isn't bullhockey is since 1/15 when I joined the Insider Program I have been installing builds and I never needed to have any kind of space you're projecting. You can call it any name you like but it doesn't change that fact.&nbsp;
 I have pics of the installs of many of them completing on my phone so if you're prepared to put some money up that I didn't get this done, lol let me know. I can take a screenshot from the Feedback hub as to when I started doing Insider Builds.&nbsp; You can yell
 bullhockey from&nbsp; the rooftops for the rest of your life but it won't change the fact that what I'm telling you is&nbsp; true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always install 64 bit Windows and have since it was available.&nbsp; I use 32 bit Office because there is a very narrow purpose for 64 bit Office and I don't need it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I just deleted the $Windows&nbsp; ~BT folder and I have seen them larger but mine was only 65MB.</p>
<p>3) The Windows folder is about 16.5 GB and has zero to do with installing the new build via Win Up.&nbsp; I don't know where you got that idea.&nbsp; And unless you think I'm making it up, when I installed 14332 the Windows folder was the same size then, and it's
 the build I have on now.&nbsp; I got a message from MSFT when I was installing 14332 that I needed more space, and it said I needed 8.5 GB last week.&nbsp; So I uninstalled Office, moved a couple .PSTs to my external knowing I'd have to put them back for Outlook to
 work having helped people fix Outlook for years on the Newsgroups and now forums.&nbsp; I uninstalled Adobe Reader and Office 365.</p>
<p>I then installed the OS without the slightest regard as to the size of any of the folders you named, because they were simply not relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'd have to count but in installing almost every Insider Build since I started 1/15.&nbsp; I've never even considered size of either Program Folder and in looking at them I don't see anything remotely to do with any builds of Windows 10 that take up any significant
 space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I distinctly remember installing some builds with 7 to 7.5 GB.&nbsp; As to the User folder it's made irrelevant because the on ly significant space takers are the .pst folders and they need to be there for Outlook to work in Documents but if I need to for an
 install of a new build I move them to my external HD (one of two temporarily) then when the OS is installed I move them back.&nbsp; As to a lot of other word docs, they are put on my external HD and every download is directed via Firefox options to my external
 HD with no problem.&nbsp; I have a large music folder and it is directed to my external HD as well.&nbsp; I don't allow any&nbsp; significant space takers in my C:\Users folder ever so how large yours is is completely irrelevant to&nbsp; me not because I don't understand your
 point but as I told you I take every space taker and put it on the external HD always.&nbsp; The .psts need to be on C:\ to work for me so if I move them I take great care to put them back in C:\Users\Documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see Max has referenced Windows.old as a space taker.&nbsp; I uninstalled it because I don't every anticipate and haven't needed it for anything.&nbsp; A couple times I moved the WinSX folder which MSDN articles advise never doing but only in the context of an OS
 that I was going to format or install and in doing so the WinSX folder would be installed with the new build intact.&nbsp; I don't ever mess with Wow64 and you shouldn't--besides getting permissions to move it if I'm&nbsp; installing a new OS has not been possible in
 my hands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I either moved or deleted Windows.old created when I&nbsp; installed this current build. It's not there. I believe it can&nbsp; accumulated files and get larger fast but I don't give it a chance because I take it out first chance I get.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's 2:46AM here, but tomorrow I'll drill into your info.&nbsp; Or later today.&nbsp; Thanks for putting it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the scheme of things if I don't get 14352 in, it's not a huge deal because it has a number of problems in addition&nbsp; to the ones Dona has written about according to a lot of people who have reported them.&nbsp; I would assume that she'll release an .iso for
 the Anniversary issue since she released two in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>One thing puzzles me though.&nbsp; I have read that MSFT created a 3rd ring with newer builds.&nbsp; Articles say that you go to Advanced to choose it --"the Release Preview Ring will be available for Windows 10 PCs and Mobile devices and can be configured
 for that device using Settings&gt;Updates and security&gt;Advanced options on PCs and using the Windows Insider app on Windows 10 Mobile."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I&nbsp; don't&nbsp; see any ring choice in Advanced. I believe a slider was there but now they have a choice of Fast or Slow in Settings&gt;Windows Insider Builds.&nbsp; I chose Fast.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Where on earth then is the so-called Release Preview Ring? Do any of you guys have it because I don't see it&nbsp; yet I see articles saying it has the latest builds.

<p>What you end up with after deleting a lot of the folders does not mean that you do not need the free space for the installation.</p>

    <title>November Update not available on computers with insider builds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> asbj&#248;rn  say:</h3>
<h2>            November Update not available on computers with insider builds disabled</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 computers: A desktop, an older Dell XPS laptop and a Surface Pro 3. All three are signed into with the same Microsoft account (which is also the one participating in the Insider Program).</p>
<p>However, only the desktop is actually running insider builds. For stability reasons, the other two are on the public release only with insider builds disabled. Both computers are clean installs - they have never had an insider build installed. The only connection
 with the Insider program is the Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, today the two computers with insider builds disabled should get the November Update, right? Well, apparently not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Various other computers in the house using different MS Accounts have successfully gotten the update, but the two non-Insider computers with my account have not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems there is a bug where the update is not distributed to computers where you are signed in with an MSA that is part of the Insider Program, but where insider builds are not enabled. Rather annoying...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, yes, I know I can just enable insider builds and get 10586 that way. But I shouldn't have to. These two computers should behave like any other normal Windows 10 PC.</p>

            <p>If you have build 10586 on the two "insider" computers there is nothing to get. &nbsp;You already have the Fall Update. &nbsp;There is no difference whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should make media (one should always have installaiton media) at</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running earlier builds on the insider computers just use the new media to update them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the official name is "Windows version 1511." &nbsp;The nickname is "Fall Update."</p>

<p>Of course it is - but it is too much of a coincidence that the <em>only </em>two computers in the house not getting the update are the two running build 10240 and using my Microsoft Account. Every other computer gets the update immediately.</p>

I got the download of the upgrade for the RTM took 1/2 hour, but after that no noticed to install wondering maybe a delay for some reason.&nbsp; $WINDOWS.-BT does show under (panther)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            If the insiders were updated to 10586 last week then there is no update for them. &nbsp;They already have the Fall Update. &nbsp;Last week's 10586 update was not a preview build. &nbsp;It was the 1511 official build just like was released today for the general public.
 &nbsp;Just because 10586 went to insiders via the insider channel doesn't mean they were preview builds.

            Hi<br /><br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!<br /><br />I'm Maggie, an Independent Advisor from thr user community. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. <br /><br />Microsoft recommendation in this scenario is:<br />a) if an Office application isn’t working correctly, sometimes restarting it will fix the problem. :)<br />b) If that doesn’t work, you can try repairing it, which very frequently solves the issue. When you’re done, you might need to restart your computer. <br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a> <br /><br />If the recommended process does not work, for more technical help/questions, I would recommend to raise this request with Microsoft Tech Forums: <br />- <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/" targe

<h2>            fill excel cells without overwriting the cells containing entries</h2>
                    <p>I have a column that contains some entries, and there is a number of empty cells between each entry.</p>
<p>I want to make excel fill the entries down in this manner:</p>
<p>excel would fill the first cell down until it encounter the next not-empty cell, then it would stop filling.</p>
<p>at this point I want excel to take the value of that next not-empty cell and fill it down to the next not-empty cell</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<h2>            There was an error opening this document.  The file is damaged and could not be repaired &#40;when opening most file attachments in Outlook 2007&#41;.</h2>
                    
<p>In the past couple weeks our office has experienced the following error message when trying to open most file attachements in Outlook 2007:</p>
<p>There was an error opening this document.&nbsp; The file is damaged and could not be repaired.</p>
<p>This is for pdf, pub, doc, docx, jpg and other common file types.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not happen all the time.&nbsp; It is consistent on each computer in our office.&nbsp; We all run the same software, MS Office 2007, Windows 7 Pro, Adobe X.</p>
<p>I have tried many things but find that when I go directly to our mail server and download the file attachment the file opens normally.&nbsp; Only when we try to open it through Outlook are we having the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have a solution to this problem?</p>
<p>Alan</p>

            Thanks for the KB link.&nbsp; I installed that when it came out on Jan 12.&nbsp; Still getting some files coming into Outlook that are corrupted.&nbsp; Typically this now is only the pdf files.&nbsp; If one of my office partners sends me a pdf they are always good.&nbsp;&nbsp; I uninstalled
 Acrobat Reader as I am using Adobe Acrobat X.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then did a repair on Acrobat X.&nbsp; It seemed that things have gotten better after these fixes.&nbsp; But just yesterday I had a pdf file that came in again and was corrupted.&nbsp; When I went out to my mail server I was
 able to download this pdf file and open it.&nbsp; So things are still not fixed.

<p>Go ahead and do the save as, but as a different name....perhaps PacketInstructions1.pub. Also the problem may be that you are opening and saving to removable media? If so always copy the file to the local hard drive, open, edit, save and then copy back to
 the removable media if you want. Opening and saving to removable media can result in corrupted files.</p>

            I am saving to a folder on my desktop. I will save and rename as you suggest. But doing that everytime I work on this --hence ending up with PacketInstructions 1 - 25 in my folder seems silly. But if it saves me from re-entering all my data then I have
 no choice. Just wish there was a true fix for this. I'm guessing programs can get glitchy. After I am done with this I'll check on uprading my Publisher, for sure. Thanks, David :)

<p>First of all, unless you have to I would not 'upgrade' to newer versions of Publisher. Both 2010 and 2013 are very different than Pub 2007 and both have some bugs. If and when you do then be sure to do a custom install and opt to not overwrite the original
 version. You can run more than one version on the same computer and that way you can go back if you find you do not like the newer versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I have many cases where I have multiple versions of a single file. I use Save As a new name and usually add a date or a single digit and that way I keep a backup of my original file. Personally I find it a safer work flow as this way if something
 happens to my most current file, and it somehow becomes corrupt I can always go back to the most recent version which I have in backup. Just sayn' that there are worst things then having multiple copies of the same publication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that out of the way, let's explore other possibilities of why you are having this problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that you did the save as a new name, can you just open and save that version without doing a save as? Sometimes that simple act will fix a corrupt file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that you must do a save as for every Publisher file or just this single file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How big is your file now? Right click it and look at the properties. If you have large images you might want to consider compressing the graphics. Reference: Compress Pictures dialog box (2007):<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA100363901033.aspx?pid=CL100605171033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA100363901033.aspx?pid=CL100605171033</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are looking at the properties of the file look at the attributes and make sure it is not a
<strong>read only</strong> file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you installed the latest service patches for Publisher? Go to Help &gt; About Publisher and it should tell you what SP has been installed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You might also do a repair, <strong>not</strong> an uninstall/reinstall. Go to Help &gt; click the Office Diagnostics.</p>

<h2>            E-mail notification when a task is completed</h2>
                    Hi everyone.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd like to know if there's a way for Project Server to send a notification e-mail to a certain person when a task is 100% completed.</div>
<div>The person is not part of the project team. I could assign a specifit task to him or add him to the task but I'd rather not do that so I was wondering if there is another option?
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you very much for you help.</div>

            If they're not on the task Project Server doesn't know about them so no message can be sent unless you write custom code. However I caution against sending automatic emails as my experience is they typically end up being automatically sent to Junk folder
 by most users, so wasting teh development time and effort!<br />

    <title>N9 asking me to re-enter all account passwords every time I reboot it - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            N9 asking me to re-enter all account passwords every time I reboot it</h2>
                    
<p>Hey, I hope this hasn't been answered, but I searched around and didn't see anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got my N9 today, and updated it to the latest version. It's great and I love it, but this issue is getting really annoying. I've had to reboot the phone a few times, due to sluggishness ...etc. The first few times, it seemed fine. Now, however, every
 time I turn it back on it pops up with password prompts for each of my accounts. This is especially annoying in the case of Gmail, as I have two-step verification on, which means I need to generate a new application-specific password every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has coincided with the "can't connect to twitter" error, which someone has already posted about. Combined, these two errors have me pulling my hair out when I should be enjoying my brand new gadget!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help you guys can give with either of these issues.</p>

                    <p>I started seeing Cross Marks on the Smart Arts on PowerPoint. If I open the same file on another PC it works. I also tried re-installing the office. but the issue remains.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Rahul
<br />
<br />Go to File - Options
<br />
<br />On the left click Advanced 
<br />
<br />On the right under Display, turn on the Disable hardware graphics acceleration option
<br />
<br />Restart PowerPoint and check if that is still happening
<br />
<br />
<br />If that is still happening:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

<p>Unfortunately you don't specify what device you are using here. Just for information as I am using a Mac, I have only ever backed up phone memory to memory card and this combined with User Data Preservation feature of N82 has meant that my GPS landmarks
 have survived several phone software updates without ill effect.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>Sorry if I didn't say I have a nokia N95. Anyway from what I understand you can backup your landmarks only if it is with the same phone right? If yes under wich categorie they are saved? The phone memory or the memory card memory?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Unlike Vista &amp; WinXP, Win7 doesn't include a default Mail Client.&nbsp;[<em>What were they thinking?</em>]<br />
<br />
You will have to install one (e.g., MS Outlook; <a href="http://download.live.com/wlmail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Live Mail</a>; Thunderbird) <strong>and then</strong> set it as your default for Mail in the CUSTOM&nbsp;(<strong>&lt;=important!</strong>) section of&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-default-programs-using-Set-Program-Access-and-Computer-Defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Set
 Program Access and Computer Defaults</span></a> and then restart your computer before any&nbsp;<strong>Send To</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>MailTo</strong> functions will become available.<br />
<br />

            Hi Scott
<br />
<br />Thanks for your feedback :)!
<br />
<br />Some users reported similar issues and resolved them by doing the following:
<br />- use CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to launch the Task Manager
<br />- Kill any instance of Skype.exe 
<br />
<br />(1) If you are using Skype app from Windows from Microsoft Store
<br />- click Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall 
<br />&gt; then install Skype again from Microsoft Store (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>)
<br />
<br />(2) If you are using Skype for Desktop 
<br />- Copy the line 
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop 
<br />- Click Windows Key+R 
<br />- Paste into Run window by CTRL+V and then click Enter 
<br />- Rename this folder to something difference for instance Skype for Desktop_Skype_Old 
<br />- Reinstall Skype (<a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a> )
