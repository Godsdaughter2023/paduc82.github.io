            Is your device a part of a domain that uses WSUS?
<br />The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            There are many antivirus programs that can be used with Windows 10; essentially the latest version of any of them will work with Windows 10.. But please clarify what you mean by "using edge browser."<br />

            <p>Hello, sorry use Edge as &nbsp;I did not explain very well, I use defender and have not had any trouble. I&nbsp; keep reading that I should use other antivirus programmes such as Norton or&nbsp;Kasperski.&nbsp; though &nbsp;then I am told that I should use internet explorer&nbsp;because&nbsp;.
 these </p>
<p>antivirus programmes cannot work in Edge due to Edge not allowing add ons. So I am left wondering whether I should just carry on just using defender or whether I should be buying
</p>
<p>another antivirus programme to be safe. I do not want to use any other browserjust Edge.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thankyou.</p>

            <p>Hi Clifford,<br />
</p>
<p>Regarding your concern, we recommend that you continue using our Windows Defender on your computer since it's a real-time antivirus developed for Windows 10. Microsoft Edge doesn't support any web-based antivirus as of the moment and we would appreciate
 if you will send this concern to Feedback hub in your Windows 10 so that we could raise this to our team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<h2>            Upgrade to Ryzen 7, need to reinstall, how do I use my windows 10 key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. </p>
<p>I just upgraded to Ryzen 7, so I changed the motherboard, CPU and RAM, but kept the rest of my computer.</p>
<p>Some people had success switching from Intel to AMD without reinstalling, so I tried, but the computer crashes.</p>
<p>So, I went to Windows 10 recovery, but it fails, I can't reset windows 10 from the current installation.</p>
<p>I have downloaded the Media Creation tool to reinstall windows 10, I have to questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1-Can I recover my windows 10 installation with the media creation tool?</p>
<p>2-If I have to reinstall from scracth, how do I use my windows 10 key (I don't have it, it was a windows 10 upgrade, although the computer appears in my microsoft account)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Installing Windows 10 on new PC</h2>
                    <p>I have a legitimate copy of Windows 7 installer that came with my old laptop, and during the free upgrade period, I installed Windows 10 on that device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After so long, I can finally move on to a desktop PC. I'm thinking of installing Windows 7 on the desktop PC using the installation disc I have (the one that came with my old laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:<br />
<br />
1. I am aware that the product key only works on one device. What I plan to do is to reformat my old laptop and install a non-genuine copy of Windows (to erase whatever signature the copy of Windows 7 has on that device) and then I'll use my installer to install
 Windows 7 on the desktop PC. Would that result into having a legitimate copy of Windows 7 on my new computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If the plan stated above works and I end up with a desktop PC with a legitimate copy of Windows 7, will I still be able to upgrade to a legitimate copy of Windows 10? I still have a copy of Windows 10 that I downloaded from the free upgrade period.</p>
<p>

            Hi Paris.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello CBhaskar,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
If the information from Gokul didn't help to resolve your issue, then I would suggest you use the Windows Installer Cleanup Tool.
<br />
There may be a corrupt install you need to remove first.<br />
Click <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> for a link to download the utility from Microsoft.
<br />
<br />
You can use the utility to remove installation information for programs that were installed by using Windows Installer. Be aware that Windows Installer CleanUp Utility will not remove the actual program from your computer. However, it will remove the installation
 files so that you can start the installation, upgrade, or uninstall over. <br />
<br />
Please reply back and let us know if this helps to resolve your issue or if you still need assistance.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<hr />

<p>To be rather blunt with you, if whomever is allegedly harassing you keeps making new accounts and you don't want to restrict communications then what do you expect Microsoft to do? &nbsp;It's not like Microsoft can read the minds of the people you made upset
 and stop them before they do something.</p>

<p>If it's a new user every time then there is nothing to be done other than blocking communication with everyone who is not on your friends list. &nbsp;Happy people don't go around "harassing" folks. &nbsp;People who are upset do that and generally speaking the person

<p>FYI the change the moder forums is telling you that is "free" is restricted to terms of use violations</p>
<p>Forced game r Tag change</p>
<p>That terms of use violation like that &nbsp;is counted to Perma bans suggest you don't Google shady things</p>
<p>FYI live life and play fair</p>
<p>You should be happy that xbox even allows name changes cause they are the only console that does</p>
<p>Just like in real life name changes ain't free or easy</p>

<h2>            black screen after sleep mode and screen off, windows 8</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>a lot of my friends have this problem (black screen after sleep mode). It doesn't matter what type of card they have. My problem is more difficult. When the screen turns off it happens quite often that it doesn't turn back but otherwise the pc (windows)
 is in working ("blindly" i deleted my icons from the desktop) If i press the power button than for instance the screen comes back and than the computer turn off. I operated with the power setting and i found a newer driver for my intel 4000 vga, but the problem
 come back always. (+I tried on windows 7; always is ok!)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My power plan (when plugged in):</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Dim display: 2 min</div>
<div>Turn off the display: 3 min</div>
<div>Put the computer to sleep: never (on battery 1 hour)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards</div>

    <title>Windows cannot print due to a problem with the current printer setup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows cannot print due to a problem with the current printer setup</h2>
                    
<p><br />
I am hoping someone may be able to assist me with with an issue I am experiencing with a client. The user has the following environment</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 Professional 64-bit </li><li>4 HP printers, all using HP's 64-bit PCL 6 UPD print drivers, ver 5.2 (latest version)</li><li>2 Canon MX850 All-In-One InkJet printer – all using latest 64-bit drivers</li><li>2 Seiko Label Printers – all using v6.9.2.387 64-bit drives </li><li>Adobe Acrobat 9 Standard </li><li>Office 2007 </li></ul>
<p>Intermittently, my client will encounter an issue where he cannot print or print to PDF. When this occurs, he receives the following prompt - “Windows cannot print due to a problem with the current printer setup”. This typically occurs when he has a number
 of windows open (multiple Word, Acrobat and Outlook windows). All we have to do is to close off any open windows and then either try the same print or print to PDF and all is good. No reboot is required. Also restarting the print spooler does not seem to fix
 the issue. The only fix is to close off any open windows and try again.</p>
<p>I have narrowed down a corresponding event log error to this problem:</p>
<p>Log Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application<br />
Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application Error<br />
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05/01/2011 2:51:41 PM<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000<br />
Task Category: (100)<br />
Level:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error<br />
Keywords:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classic<br />
User:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N/A<br />
Computer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T500<br />
Description:<br />
Faulting application name: splwow64.exe, version: 6.1.7600.16385, time stamp: 0x4a5bd3ca<br />
Faulting module name: hpc6r109.dll, version: 0.3.1544.8874, time stamp: 0x4ccaf4fa<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000005<br />
Fault offset: 0x0000000000077f8b<br />
Faulting process id: 0x105c<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01cbad0bd900fb02<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Windows\splwow64.exe<br />
Faulting module path: C:\Windows\system32\spool\DRIVERS\x64\3\hpc6r109.dll<br />
Report Id: 5c55f5ef-191e-11e0-8667-00247e15479f</p>
<p>I do notice the hpc6r109.dll faulting module name, which leads me to believe that that it may be an HP driver that is at fault. I would like to add that we have had this same issue using earlier versions of the HP UPD PCL 6 drivers (5.0, 5.1). Also, going
 with either HP's PCL 5 or PostScript UPD drivers are not<br />
a possibility (PCL 5 seems to cause weird character spacings and PostScript drivers are hideously slow).</p>
<p>At this point, I am at a lost of what to do. My next move will be to remove all printer drivers and uninstall Adobe Acrobat and then re-install, however if anyone has any input as to how to resolve this issue, I would be most appreciated.</p>

            Good news. I obtained the Microsoft hotfix for Article ID: 979681 and installed the patch over a week ago. So far, this appears to have fixed the problem. Up until know, we were experiencing this printing issue at least every other day (if not every day),
 so being problem free for over a week now, I would say this hotfix did the trick. I will report again in a few weeks to confirm, however I would say to anyone else that is also experiencing the same splwow64.exe event log error along with the failure of printing,
 I definitely suggest obtaining this Microsoft hotfix. <br />

<p><span>Unfortunately it is not possible to show the Windows Explorers in either ‘Stacked’ or ‘Side by side’ on Windows startup. You may add the Windows Explorer to startup which
 will launch an Explorer Windows as you logon to the operating system but it won’t be ‘Stacked’.

<h3> tuck229  say:</h3>
<h2>            What would Windows 7 Installer Download File Name Be&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Windows 7 a couple of years ago to upgrade a Vista laptop.&nbsp; It was a download purchase that I had to create an install DVD from.&nbsp; Long story short, I never put Windows 7 on the laptop.&nbsp; The install DVD I made is nowhere to be found now that I
 want to&nbsp;upgrade it.&nbsp; Somewhere on my laptop is that file I downloaded to create the Windows install DVD...but what the heck would the file name be?&nbsp; I have my product code saved in the e-mail receipt from&nbsp;purchasing Windows, but obviously the download link&nbsp;for
 the file is now&nbsp;expired.&nbsp; I have the option to order a backup disc&nbsp;now that the download link expired,&nbsp;but I'd prefer to find the file&nbsp;and&nbsp;not have to wait on a disc to ship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help figuring out what file(s) I should be looking for?&nbsp; I'm guessing it was a zip file maybe?&nbsp; My hard drive is full and I have no idea what file name I should be looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Sort contacts last name first -</h2>
                    <p>I seem to have two Skype apps on my Windows 10 desktop.&nbsp; One is what I would call the classic version where I can choose to list contacts last name first.&nbsp; The other is an apparently newer version with fancier graphics, but that does not readily show how
 to list contacts last name first.&nbsp; So I have two questions:</p>
<p>1. Why two versions on the same computer with the same log in credentials?</p>
<p>2. For the second version, how can I list contacts last name first?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>The new client you are referring to is pre-installed&nbsp;in Windows 10, while the old client is the one that needs to be installed to be able to use on the desktop.&nbsp;You can choose either one version, no need to use both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to&nbsp;Contact Settings, there is no option&nbsp;on the new&nbsp;client to&nbsp;display Contacts&nbsp;using Last names first.&nbsp;That option is only available with the old client.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Startup Error- 0xc0000225- A required device isn&#39;t connected or cannot be accessed</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have an ASUS laptop, 1 TB HDD, 8Gb memory, running Windows 10, AMD chip and graphics- Radeon</p>
<p>Until recently, my laptop was running fine with no issues with running Windows 10 ( 4 months ). I ran the update to AMD catalyst and it couldn't update the graphics drivers, so I rolled it back to the previous version. At the same time, Windows did an update
 when I restarted, then that's when the errors started.</p>
<p>The latest error is this one - 0xc0000225</p>
<p>I spent the last couple of days creating a USB windows 10 boot stick- There seems to be an issue making a DVD that is bootable in UEFI.</p>
<p>Managed to change the UEFI so that the USB could even boot (that is another story)</p>
<p>Got into into the repair section- ran all choices</p>
<p>Automatic repair could not fix the issue</p>
<p>Cannot reset the PC- It says the drive with windows is locked</p>
<p>I tried the system restore- It couldn't find the last restore point</p>
<p>Even tried using &nbsp;DISKPART in CMD to show the volumes - 3 of them are showing hidden- cannot unhide</p>
<p>I have run out of ideas and I really don't want to lose my files by wiping this drive.
</p>
<p>Any other suggestions that might work?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely know that could be frustrating. I can understand how you feel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for mentioning the different steps you have tried to resolve the issue, we appreciate your effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned that the issue started after installing a Windows update, I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode using an installation media and uninstall the update and check if the issue persists. This will help us identify if the update
 is causing the issue. Follow the steps given below:</p>
<ol>
<li>On a working PC, go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=616447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>Download the media creation tool and then run it. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <span>Create installation media for another PC</span>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose a language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit).
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the steps to create installation media, and then select <span>
Finish</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Connect the installation media you created to your nonfunctional PC, and then turn it on.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the initial setup screen, enter your language and other preferences, and then select
<span>Next</span>. If you're not seeing the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to change your PC's boot order, and then try again.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <span>Repair your computer</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Choose an option</span> screen, select
<span>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings </span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>When the computer restarts, choose the option to sign in through safe mode.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If you are able to boot to safe mode through the steps suggested above, follow the steps below to uninstall the update.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press Windows key + R .</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type appwiz.cpl and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click "view installed updates".</span></p>
<p><span>4. Locate the update and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Restart the computer and check again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know the result.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p>I still had to use diskpart in the command prompt section to be able to get into safe mode, but it did not show any updates (showing windows 7 updates?)</p>
<p>I managed to use system restore to roll it back to an earlier date before the AMD update and the windows update. I had to re- install the AMD graphics drivers and windows did not prompt an update yet, but it's fixed for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Performance issues in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victoriacutbirth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Performance issues in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So, it will be a bit hard to pinpoint this out and maybe answer questions you have, but I will try my best to do both. Though, a bit of a disclaimer -- I'm completely ignorant to tech talk, so if you could break it down into something a bit simpler for me,
 that'd be great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to the problem: It's not the fact that my computer is "slow" per se. In fact, it's pretty quick when I type, open programs, etc. I'm just gonna give a&nbsp;prime example. File explorer when I open it seems to run fine. Let's say I click my downloads folder
 and attempt to try and copy some stuff and move it to recycle bin. Almost immediately, the whole entire program freezes and crashes causing my desktop not to like, restart, but like "refresh" in a sense. The toolbar goes blank and so does the shortcuts on
 my desktop. Even my google chrome crashes sometimes! My task manager doesn't even open at all without saying it isn't responding, also, when I go into my settings things seem to be unresponsive. Finally, my start menu just refuses to open up. And I'm currently
 running on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting the laptop, obviously and I've been searching for a fix almost the whole entire day! Of course, I'll probably be getting a new laptop, so if I cannot come to a fix -- it'll probably all work out in the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need any more information about the problem, please don't hesitate to ask! I'll try my best to answer :-)!</p>

<li>What is the make and model of the PC you are using?</li><li>Do you receive any relevant error messages?</li><li>Is it an abrupt issue? Do you have any System Restore point set in Windows prior to the issue?</li><li>Did you check if similar issues occur when you log in to Windows using a different user account?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to check for the latest updates in Windows 10 which helps the PC&nbsp;to make optimal&nbsp;use of Windows 10 capabilities

    <title>Surface Pro would not turn on for 2 days - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hayrey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro would not turn on for 2 days</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put my Surface Pro on sleep mode this past Saturday night after using it for several hours and having just updated it that day. I left it plugged in overnight so that I could use it first thing in the morning with a full battery. I do this often with my
 Surface Pro and have never experienced any issues before. Nor have I had any changes in the performance of my Surface Pro lately. It ran just as smoothly as the day I bought it.
</p>
<p>When I went to use it Sunday morning, it would not turn on. I tried holding the power button, holding the power and volume up button, using the keyboard to wake it. I even removed the keyboard and reattached it. Nothing worked. I followed all instructions
 available on the Microsoft support site. I finally decided to leave it alone for the day and figured I would wait and see if anything changes.
</p>
<p>That evening I tried powering it on and once again; nothing happened. At this point I am panicking because I rely on my Surface Pro for studying and finishing my school assignments. I plugged it into the charger to see if it was charging properly and the
 white light on the cord was turning on when it was plugged in. I did all of the recommendations on the Microsoft support site once again. And still, nothing happened. So I decided to plug it in overnight and would try again the next day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monday afternoon comes around and I decide to try my luck at powering it on. Nothing. Black screen of death. My heart sinks. At this point I assume it is gone for good and I am going to either be paying a hefty fee for a repair or buying a new laptop.&nbsp; I
 take it to the Best Buy where I bought it from where I am told that I would have to contact Microsoft in order to get it repaired or replaced depending on if I had a warranty for it. So I call Microsoft and finally get connected to a representative after a
 half an hour of trying to get through their voice operated menu options. The representative has me do all of the restart options that I have tried before. And you guessed it, nothing happened. He then tells me that he will have someone call me back in 1-2
 hours about what my options will be from there. And how I will proceed with either paying for a repair or getting a replacement laptop depending on if I have a warranty.</p>
<p>I wait for 1, then 2, then 3 hours. Nothing. No call. No email. I didn't bother trying to restart it again at this point because I feared that I might end up throwing it outside my front door and into the nearest snow bank in anger. At this point, I feel
 defeated and am trying to figure out what it will cost me to just get a new laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decide to try it one last time. I reattach the keyboard, which I had left unattached since I had talked to the representative hours before this, and prop the Surface Pro up. I simply hit the space bar and it turned on as if nothing had happened. Logged
 into my account and it was the same way I had left it Saturday night. I was ecstatic! But at the same time I was so confused and have many questions.</p>
<p>What had happened since I spoke with the representative? What even caused this in the first place? How do I prevent it from happening again? Has anyone else had this happen before?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any input, please let me know. It would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>If they offer a replacement laptop, be aware that it will likely be a "REFURBISHED" laptop.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Just last month I bought a Surface laptop i7, 16GB RAM, directly from Microsoft. &nbsp;There was a problem with the laptop. They said they can't fix it. &nbsp;Then they exchanged it for a so-called "REFURBISHED" machine. &nbsp;It's obviously
 not a 100% certified machine because the touch screen didn't work properly. &nbsp;Now they will collect this one and send me another "REFURBISHED" machine. &nbsp; This is how Microsoft treat its customers. &nbsp;You spend a load of money to buy their expensive product and
 when it breaks down, they give you a used one?? &nbsp;They "REFURBISH" used, rejected and returned machines to replace other broken machines. &nbsp;I didn't pay all that money for a "REFURBISHED" laptop. &nbsp; It's been more than a month now since I paid all that money
 and I have wasted so much of my time with them. &nbsp;I don't have a working machine to use, and when I do get one back, it will be a "REFURBISHED" machine.&nbsp; Basically, I will have&nbsp;paid a lot of money just&nbsp;in January 2019 for a USED machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;when I asked for
 a refund instead of a replacement?&nbsp; They said no.&nbsp;</div>

<p>I bought a new £2149 Surface laptop. After 5 months it failed to boot after one of the many, endless Microsoft updates. I returned it and was given a dirty, dented and worn "100% certified refurbished" laptop. I refused to accept it in that condition and
 at this point Microsoft refused a new replacement, store credit or refund. I fought for months and eventually got most of my money back but Microsoft ended up with my computer and some of my money. I can't begin to tell you how much of my life was spent chasing
 Microsoft or how shocked I was at their behaviour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I strongly discourage anyone buying from the Microsoft store; buy from a third party retailer instead.</p>

            <p>Hi Yeti,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the phone. </p>
<p>
To have Eduroam on your phone, your PDA must be a 802.1x capable device. Please refer to your PDA vendor's Web site for details.
</p><li>
<p>WiFi must be enabled&nbsp;(depending on the make, either via hardware or software switch).
</p>
</li><li>WiFi settings must be set to <strong>DHCP</strong>.
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below steps:</p>
<p>Go to&nbsp;any <span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">area at the EUI covered by WiFi</span>. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Cick on <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong>, pick the <strong>
Connections</strong> tab and finally click on the <strong>Wi-Fi</strong> icon; </li><li>In the <strong>Configure Wireless Networks</strong> window, select <strong>eduroam</strong> from the network list, then click on
<strong>Connect</strong>. </li><li>When&nbsp;prompted, enter your login credentials as follows:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Username: <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong> (for example <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong>)<br />
Password: <strong>your_EUI_password<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</strong>You may as well want to check the <strong>Save password</strong> tick box in order not to be asked for your credentials in future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li></ol>
<p>You now have successfully configured your&nbsp;Windows Phone&nbsp;to connect to the eduroam Network.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post in case you have any further issues, we are happy to help you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I was asking if the Windows 10 Phones are supporting 802.1x, with manually (not using a MDM software) changing the second phase authentication method to PAP. At least for my Lumia 640, this did not work. Please note that not all eduroam networks use the
 same setup, the ones which are using only TTLS-PAP did not work on Windows Phone 8.1. Since the unsupported workaround for my university (Uni Hamburg) is only known to be working with Windows Phone 8.1, I would like to know if eduroam will work after the upgrade
 to Windows Phone 10. <br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>until now (before aniversary update) you could use a provisioning package to import an "profile.xml" (create on Windows 10 Desktop with configured Wifi =&gt; netsh wlan export profile name=eduroam folder:C:\Profile ) to a Windows 10 Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Package can be created with the *free* Microsoft Tool "ICD" which is part of the ADK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the aniversary update there are some errors we stilll weren't able to fix, but it should work in general</p>
<br />

            <p>No. Unfortunately in my university, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, this method does not work in Aniversary update on a Lumia 950 XL.</p>
<p>Could you, PLEASE, do something on this topic not to feel alienated from the rest of Eduroam community?</p>
