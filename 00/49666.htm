            generally in the menu you'll have an about option, this will tell you which version you have, I don't use RP, but it may have a download latest version/update option, use this and it will check for you.

                    You can so easily report someone for being bad at the game and get banned for white lies they say about you. I find this super irritating and unfair to those who are just learning to play, including myself.

            The enforcement team investigates every complaint they receive and will only issue a suspension if they have determined you have done something to violate the code of conduct. So while yes, anyone can report you, that doesn't guarantee you will be suspended.&nbsp;

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some customers that use Windows 10 LTSB 2016 as their OS.</p>
<p>Our application now requires .NET Framework&nbsp;3.5.1 to use&nbsp;TLS 1.2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We thought Windows 10 LTSB would not be supported, but there is one customer running LTSB that is able to use the site successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if there is a patch or registry change I can make that will allow the other customers to use 1.2 as default for .NET.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, But I have already tried loading Scan software/driver from Epson web site as you stated. The problem still persists.</p>
<p>I originally purchhased a Canon PIXMA MP272 and the scanner&nbsp;program for this would not&nbsp;run,&nbsp;I took it back to Pcworld and they exhanged it for the Epson. I tried to find a solution for the&nbsp;Canon and found some comments about&nbsp;problems with user profiles,
 I am not familiar with these but&nbsp;as you can see I still need help with this Epson scanner software.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Reset Windows 8.1</h2>
                    i have upgraded to windows 8.1 and now i want to reset my pc. My question is if i reset it, will it retain windows 8.1 or will it revert to windows 8. What will happen if i just refresh it instead?

    <title>BLUE SCREEN ERRORS Page Fault nonpaged area - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abdul hadiachmad  say:</h3>
<h2>            BLUE SCREEN ERRORS Page Fault nonpaged area</h2>
                    <p>I recently reinstall Windows 10 in my Computer. From previous faulty caused by 2 Hardisks failures, I was using Raid 5. Its not a big deal, because I was planning to reinstall anyway. But the thing is that the problem didn't came back then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 3 weeks ago I reinstall Win10 using the same Motherboard that way I still have my activated Win10Pro 64bit.</p>
<p>Using :&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Motherboard : MSI 970 Gaming (MS7693)</p>
<p>-I'm now using 5 different Hardisks varied capacity, installed the OS on my 260GB SSD</p>
<p>-Graphic Card : AMD Radeon R7 370 Series 2048MB ATI</p>
<p>-CPU : AMD FX-4350 Vishera 32nm Technology</p>
<p>-RAM : 4 4GB DDR3 RAM overall 16GB, (1066MHz)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the first week, things are going so great. Performance are great and disk usage never go above 50%. The next 2 weeks, it started working very weird. I don't exactly remember what are the new things that I installed and I was trying to add another VGA
 Card that is NVIDIA because my AMD Radeon R7 is not compatible for 3 multiple monitor. But was obviously didn't work, then I remove the NVIDIA Graphic Card. Also I remember installing new addition 3.0 port directly plugged in the motherboard, there's a slot
 for it. I also installed another fan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I haven't checked if I remove those device would help solving this problems or not, but then the computer gets weird, game crashes. The longest time I record while playing the games, is 20minutes tops. Usually crashes after 5minutes when I start playing,
 the game doesn't crashes if I only start it and left it in the starting menu. (that info might help of finding the problem)</p>
<p>This whole week ago, it gets really scary, the Computer had bluescreen error so often, consist the information like MEMORY_MANAGEMENT, SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUEL, all this error only happen once. but the bluescreen happen
 so often, and most of the error codes are: PAGE_FAULT_NONPAGED_AREA - win32kfull.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Theres a time when the computer got blue screen error by the time I "sign in" to my account in the starting windows. clicked enter, and it went bluescreen afterwards. and the next reboot, let me sign in. Then there's a time when the computer got bluescreen
 in chain-reaction didn't let me log in at all with all different error codes (consist the one that I added before). Then the windows didn't start in the sign in screen. It gives a few option, and one of it are resetting the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to reset the OS and let it reinstall the windows. And it did. All the System files are resetted and reinstalled. Windows update and all. All done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before reinstall, I Installed all my games on my D Drive so on the OS Reinstall, it doesn't delete the games. But still the game wont start for long, still consist only 5-20mins gameplay. It crashes, I tried reinstalling all the apps and games, but still,
 not only the games, also my adobe apps crashes suddenly. I don't know why. Then sometimes the computer got bluescreen errors again consisting the same information as before. The blue screen still considerably happening oftenly, and most of the time are still
 PAGE_FAULT_NONPAGE_AREA - win32kfull.sys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the recent dmp files and the MSinfo32 files. I need help of finding the problems and want to fix it.</p>
<p>Thank you for the time.</p>

            Hi Abdul
Try to install ONLY Windows with all original applications without games and test that (if possible)
Make all necessary updates
Then check your games and compatibility with Windows 10

<p>Hello and thank you Ahmed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to mention, that I installed those Adobe programs on the SSD (C:\) Drive. And the program crashes too. Does it have to do with the installed application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need to make sure before I reinstall windows again for the third time, because I think its a bit improbable? that option would be my last option. If you could kindly point out other options. Thank you.</p>

            Try to remove/uninstall any application you may doubt it might caused the issue. It’s like deep investigation process to avoid formatting.
In case of format I recommend you test the machine with ONLY windows and office installed with no other application and creating systems restore for each application you install

<h2>            unable to watch rented movie bought from xbox video app. on windows rt tablet</h2>
                    
<p>I rented a movie to download for 48hrs not once but twice from the Xbox video app. The problem is, just after paying for a movie, I didn't even have a chance to download the movie, instead a notice would come up stating that it has 'expired'. Because I'm
 new to the whole renting movies online, I thought I would be able to find the movie automatically downloaded or saved into my desktop but nothing was found. I went back to view the movie from the app or see what I did wrong..and an error code appeared when
 I clicked on trailer..0xc101a7d1</p>
<p>Please I just paid $16 for a movie twice now, an answer would be very helpful..</p>

<p>I found this for you on the site.<br />
Hope this explains it a bit for you.</p>
<p>Renting movies:</p>
<p>When you rent a movie through Xbox Video, it's available to you for 14 days. This 14-day countdown starts when you make the purchase. When you start playing the movie, another clock starts ticking: you have a 24-hour period of time during which you can watch
 the movie as many times as you want.</p>
<p>Let's say you rent a movie at 3:00 P.M. on May 1. If you start watching the movie at 8:00 P.M. on May 5, your rental period expires at 8:00 P.M. on May 6.</p>
<p>Note Unlike a movie that you buy, a movie that you rent must be viewed on the device it was rented for (Xbox 360, computer, Windows Phone 8.</p>

<p>Thanks for that little research you did but I knew that already. I made sure I read everything about renting movies online with Xbox before doing it. Any way, my problem hasn't been solved and I'm too fed up with it to care at this point. This issue really
 put me off buying anything online from Xbox let alone recommending anyone to buy from Xbox video.</p>

<p>$16? Sounds like you bought the movie, not rented it. If you bought it, it shows up in your account on all devices (phones, computer, Xbox console, etc). Rentals only on the device you rented it on. Hate to say it, but if I'm renting a video, I rent from
 Amazon. It is usually a buck cheaper and there is no limitation on what device you watch it on---phone, tablet, pc, Xbox, Google TV, Tivo, etc.--anything with an Amazon Video app or a web browser.

<h3> asphyxiationexe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to join</h2>
                    
<p>Been playing campaign with 2 friends since release.</p>
<p>Had some issues getting connected at the start, but we managed somehow.</p>
<p>All 3 of our NATs are open.</p>
<p>We finished the campaign and jumped into matchmaking.</p>
<p>We did one game, I got disconnected from the party, then was unable to join again.</p>
<p>The message I&nbsp;receive when connecting to one of them is "Unable to Join: The party may have incompatible network setup. Your setting OPEN NAT, is usually compatible. Visit www.halo4.com/nat for more information"</p>
<p>When I try to connect to the other friend or others I get "Join failed: You could not be added to the party queue."</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Phone call representing microsoft</h2>
                    <p>This guy said he is from Geek squad representing microsoft. &nbsp;They received serious security alert that my laptop is infected with the Koobface so he wanted to access my laptop to remove it. &nbsp;Went as far as having me read what this virus can do. &nbsp;At first
 I went through where the security messages were located, just like he said (microsoft alerts) and said I wont be able to delete it myself so he needs to gain access remotely.</p>
<p>First, the phone was 'unknown' and had a sort of a chinese accent . &nbsp;I shut my phone off and when he called back, I told him I lost battery but this time, the phone shows Hartford,CT.</p>
<p>I feel this is a scam based on what I have read on some online posting. &nbsp;.</p>
<p>Has Microsoft ever used an outside firm for security issues?</p>

            Similar thing happened to me. &nbsp; The person from (India) said he could would fix windows 7 issue but first he needed to gain access to my computer to do so. &nbsp;He then said my computer was running slowly and he would need to fix that before he could work
 on the windows issue. While he was scanning for problems, we chatted. &nbsp;He asked me for lots of information. &nbsp;I wasSTUPID. I thought I was talking with microsoft tech so I gave him control of my computer and information about me. &nbsp;After a long while of checking
 all the bad things in my computer he said it would only cost only $279 to fix all the &nbsp;problems and then &nbsp;he would fix my windows problem. &nbsp; He was in my computer and would not let me log off until he did something else. &nbsp;I kept clicking but nothing happened
 until he released me. Don't be stupid like I was/am.

            This is a scam. I got a call from a lady with foreign accent who knew my name and told me she was calling from Microsoft and I have critical errors on my computer and wanted to know if I could open my computer. I said wait. What. Who are you and where
 you calling from ? I then asked how would she even know I have errors them I told the idiot to never call me again. No way am I letting anyone have remote access to my computer ever. There are tons of videos on YouTube about the scam. The funniest one on their
 is by Lon Seidman. He calls them back and acts like he doesn't know anything about computers when he really works in IT. He got them scammers mad and they hung up on him&nbsp;

            I am having the same issue. Previously with windows 7 it worked fine, i could connect to the network and access my data. This seems to be a default gateway issue.<br />
The PPTP connection in windows 8 is configured the same as windows 7 was previously.<br />
<br />
I found that after the remote connection is established I did an ipconfig in msdos and the default gateway address is the same ip address that is assigned to the remote device. From the remote device I can ping everything on the network except for the windows
 8 machine which is hosting the VPN. <br />

            &nbsp; &nbsp; Me too. &nbsp;Open VPN great with Win 7, connection consistently dropped after 1 to 3 hours with Win 8 Pro (x64) and a direct cable connection. &nbsp;Giving administrator rights to the OpenVPN app didn't fix it. &nbsp;Nor did playing with firewalls (app excepted).
 &nbsp;Can't tell if it's Windows 8 bug, a VPN provider bug,&nbsp; something wrong in my Win 8 installation or my ISP and Win 8. &nbsp;Since my VPN provider is blowing me off, even though they haven't tested Win 8, not sure how to figure this out. &nbsp;

            <p>Yes, in terms of connecting. &nbsp;What I did was uninstall everything and then reinstall openvpn-install-2.3.0-I001-x86_64.exe * and my VPN providers config folder with all the server locations. &nbsp;What I didn't install this time was "installer-win.exe," which
 puts an auto connect icon in the sys tray. &nbsp;The one catch is that the installer I used should have put an icon for manual starting in the sys tray, as it does with Win 7, but it didn't. &nbsp;So for now I have to start the icon from the desktop, which puts it in
 the sys tray, and from there I can manually connect.</p>

<h2>            Calendar shows the wrong month name</h2>
                    My calendar shows the wrong month name. For instance, I am looking at "September 2015," but it's actually only Sep.27-30, and then all the rest of the calendar is actually October.&nbsp; Then when I go to October, that page shows the 1st is on Sunday, but that
 whole month is actually NOVEMBER, not October.&nbsp; How can I fix this?

<h2>            Dismounting External &#40;USB&#41; Storage Devices</h2>
                    
<p>On my job, we are still using Windows XP.&nbsp; On my personal computers, I<br />

Windows XP, it dismounts the device, and the device seems to recognize<br />
that it has been dismounted - a thumbdrive's light goes off, a nook<br />
e-reader allows normal use, and so on.&nbsp; The computer reports that the<br />
device can safely be removed from the system.&nbsp; At this point, I can<br />
disconnect the device from the computer.</p>
<p>On windows 7, the device does not appear to recognize that it has been<br />
dismounted.&nbsp; I still get the message from the computer indicating safety<br />
for disconnect, but a thumbdrive's light is still on, or a nook e-reader<br />
is still not usable.&nbsp; I can disconnect the device, and not have any<br />

<p>This is a change in behaviour since Windows 7.&nbsp; Devices are logically disconnected but power to the device is not turned off as it was in earlier versions of Windows.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I don't know for certain but a good guess might be that this is more friendly towards
 external hard drives - the logical disconnect lets the drive flush buffers and such while power is still applied to the drive.&nbsp; Or it may be a charging issue for devices - disconnect the device but it can still charge while connected.</p>

<p>This isn't entirely the issue; there's something else that's not<br />
happening, as can be seen with the nook e-reader:</p>
<p>If I connect the nook to an XP system, and then dismount it, the nook<br />
recognizes that it's dismounted, and will let me read my e-books while<br />
charging off the XP system's USB port.&nbsp; (I can also plug the USB cord<br />
into the nook's AC adapter and read my content while it's charging from<br />
the wall).&nbsp; On Windows 7, it never recognizes that it's been dismounted,<br />
and tells me that I have to dismount the device in order to be able to<br />
read my content.&nbsp; Once I physically disconnect, I have no trouble with<br />
the nook, but as long as it's physically connected to a Windows 7<br />
system, it thinks it's mounted.</p>

                    <p>HP Envy<br />
Windows 8.1 OS<br />
<br />
When trying to refresh my PC to Windows 8, during the Setting a few things up... screen, I receive the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows could not complete the installation. To install Windows on this computer, restart the installation."</p>
<p><br />
After pressing Okay, the computer restarts, returns to the same screen, and I receive the same notification, so I am in a circular issue. Is there a way to resolve this, or to reset the computer from start up or access any kind of menu to get me to the desktop
 from Start Up before returning to the same process? This is an urgent matter and any help will be most appreciated.</p>

                    <span>
<p>I have recently upgraded to Windows 7 with a clean reinstall on my Sony VAIO VGN-SZ470N laptop. The full specs can be seen here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;kw=vgn-sz470n/c&amp;lp=8198552921665095013&amp;productId=8198552921665095013#footNotes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sonystyle.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;kw=vgn-sz470n/c&amp;lp=8198552921665095013&amp;productId=8198552921665095013#footNotes</a></p>
<p>My goal: To sync my new Blackberry Bold 9700 wirelessly over bluetooth using the&nbsp;integrated&nbsp;radio. Many people have had problems with this, and the forums are littered with solutions that have worked for others, but I am having no luck.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Windows auto-detects my bluetooth radio and installs the "Bluetooth USB Controller (ALPS/UGPZ6)" (Hardware ID:&nbsp;USB\VID_044E&amp;PID_300D&amp;REV_1915,&nbsp;USB\VID_044E&amp;PID_300D)&nbsp;&nbsp;driver. With this driver installed, I can go to the "Add a device" with my phone in discovery
 mode, and the computer will not find it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I go to 'control panel -&gt; add device', the add device wizard will tell me it is searching, but not find any of the two discoverable&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;devices in range. I went to control panel -&gt; view devices -&gt; UGX (which looks like a little bluetooth adapter)
 and there was no "bluetooth settings' option when I would right click.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having read on the Blackberry forums that the BB will only sync with the Windows Bluetooth stack, I updated my driver from the ALPS/UGPZ6 to "generic bluetooth adapter". The selection of this driver also installs 'Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator' driver.
 It also adds the bluetooth icon to the lower right start bar near the time and date. I can now go to "add a device" and it will show my BB 9700. When I connect, the pairing&nbsp;wizard&nbsp;appears on my phone and in windows. I enter a code on my blackberry, and then
 enter a code in the windows&nbsp;wizard. Both devices then tell me that pairing was&nbsp;successful. However, both machines lie.</p>
<p>Once the BB is paired, windows attempts to install drivers for two newly discovered devices, then gives me an error, and states that the drivers cannot be installed. It says it cannot install two drives&nbsp;The two devices are listed in device manager as "Bluetooth&nbsp;Peripheral&nbsp;Device"
 (Hardware ID&nbsp;BTHENUM\{426c6163-6b42-6572-7279-44736b746f70}_LOCALMFG&amp;000a).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 'Devices and Printers &gt; Bluetooth' the BB 9700 is now listed with a status of "needs troubleshooting." Although the devices are paired, the BB will never show a status of connected, rather it will just keep trying to connect every two minutes or so. I
 can connect to my friends MacBook, but I have no idea how to test the fact that the connection works. I also see listed in the "add devices" screen my room mate's bluetooth phone. Thus, I looked for ways to troubleshoot the missing drivers.</p>
<p>I have found three supposed solutions for the driver installation error that did not WORK for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) The first is to right click on the two unknown "Bluetooth&nbsp;Peripheral&nbsp;Devices" in the device manager and update the driver in both cases to 'RIM Virtual Serial v2.' When attempting to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;this solution, the "needs troubleshooting" status will go
 away, but blackberry device manager will not find the BB 9700 to add for bluetooth sync. Nothing else seems to change. Full instructions for this solution were listed here:&nbsp;<a href="http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/BlackBerry-Pearl-BlackBerry-8100/Need-Bluetooth-Peripheral-Device-driver-to-connect-to-8120/m-p/263541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/BlackBerry-Pearl-BlackBerry-8100/Need-Bluetooth-Peripheral-Device-driver-to-connect-to-8120/m-p/263541</a></p>
<p>The other way I attempted to fix the driver error problem was to, delete all the drivers listed above, and reinstall the generic USB&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;controller and enumerator. Then I went and downloaded the Windows Mobile Device Center Driver Upgrade. For the
 two unknown devices labeled&nbsp;"Bluetooth&nbsp;Peripheral&nbsp;Device" I selected the driver Bluetooth Radios &gt; Microsoft Corporation &gt; Windows Mobile Based Device Support. &nbsp;Again, the troubleshooting status message in Devices and Printers &gt; Bluetooth Devices goes away,
 but Blackberry Device Manager still cannot find the phone. I found the&nbsp;original&nbsp;steps for this here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.computers.nepalesemap.com/index.php?topic=3.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.computers.nepalesemap.com/index.php?topic=3.0</a></p>
<p>3) Supposedly the reason why the blackberry won't sync with the ALPS driver install is because the windows bluetooth stack doesn't recognize it as compatible. So I uninstall all&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;and blackberry devices. I restart, and the computer reinstalls the
 ALPS driver.</p>
<p>I found a solution that says to edit the&nbsp;<span>c:\windows\inf\bth.inf&nbsp;<span>file
 and add the hardware ID that is listed in device manager under the ALPS driver HardwareID. I did add the hardware ID to the list of devices, but the bluetooth enumerator never installs, and I cannot access the&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;settings.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Cptnnemo,</p>
<p>How close to the computer did you have your Blackberry?&nbsp; As with any Bluetooth the device needs to be 3-4 FEET away to be discovered.&nbsp; Please follow the directions the MSFT Support provided, then try to keep the device 3-4 feet away and attempt discovery
 mode.</p>

<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important </strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.

<br />
I would suggest you to disable the security software temporarily and then try to create a system image.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2: Place the computer in Clean boot and check of for the issue. <br />
</strong><br />
Perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps given in the link below to start the computer in clean boot.<br />

            <p>Hi Pranav,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all thanks for writing a reply to my post. I appreciate and accept your advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, let me answer your questions first and will go ahead to proceed with&nbsp;the steps you suggested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>1) Do you get any error when the computer runs slow or when the apps crashes?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ans: I don't get any error notification or alert, but&nbsp;ever&nbsp;app goes "Not responding" on the top, even if I try to open a word, excel or PowerPoint and try to&nbsp;see print preview</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;2) Do you have any third party antivirus or security system installed on your computer?</div>
<div>Ans: No third party antivirus or security system is installed in my computer</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;3) Is the issue specific to any particular update or any particular app?</div>
<div>Ans:&nbsp;All the office applications and other third party applications get hang as well and is not specific to any particular app</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;4) Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue other than Windows update?</div>
<div>Ans: Since when I started using Windows 8 professional, I have not faced any challenges and no changes been done to the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't know whether this helps or not, but I have added my windows live account for the secured sign in rather than using the default way of logging in the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your concern and I had&nbsp;followed the first method, as mentioned in your reply, to use Windows update troubleshooter. I had ended up in getting a complete black screen "no boot screen" type. After several restarts, to&nbsp;see whether my computer can
 complete the booting process or not, beforewhich the OS crashed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Absolutely was in a bad shape, that I couldnot retrieve my data which i lost, as I could not run a bootable CD with windows 7 or windows server either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for your concern and reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
