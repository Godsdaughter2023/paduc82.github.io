<li>Did you run the Windows Aero troubleshooter and check if that helps?</li></ol>
In case you suspect a Virus/malware infection, you may download and perform a full system scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner.<br />

Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means
<br />
there is a potential for data loss.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Commmunity forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are/were facing problems with moving OneDrive folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Were you able to fix the issue yourself after creating a new profile?</p>
<p>2. Had you changed the OneDrive default location or did you map the personal folder to a personal folder inside OneDrive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever, you change the OneDrive location and then try to restore it back, it will show the path as
<span>C:\Users\UserName</span>\OneDrive.&nbsp; It will copy all the old files inside the OneDrive folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kindly, reply back with more information and we will be glad to assist you if you have more queries.</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>When a Logitech Desktop (USB) microphone is connected, it is recognized by win 7. During the driver install, it causes the system to crash (Blue screen) and then restarts. The driver listed is the most current (determined by the system) and should be located
 at C;\windows\system32\drivers\usbccgp.sys. Microphone works on my ASUS Eeepc running xp SP3. MS provides the driver. All other USB devices work as intended. Note: I upgraded from Vista Premium x64 to Win 7 x64 but I never tried to connect the microphone to
 the Vista systemIdeas:</p>

<br />
Please look for files in C:\windows\minidumps.&nbsp; Take the files and put them on a public share on
<a href="http://skydrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://skydrive.live.com</a>, and then post a link here.&nbsp; Please also put c:\windows\inf\setupapi.dev.log on that same share.<br />
<br />
Looking at these files will allow me to see what's crashing.&nbsp; Does it happen every time you plug the device in?<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Mark, <br />
<br />
I'm having trouble uploading the files you requested because of premission issues. Will work it and get those files to you asap.<br />
<br />
The link you provided above is the product we are discussing. It is identified in the system as AK5370.<br />
<br />
Everytime the system attempts to install the driver, it crashes. The proceedure I used is first remove the driver, unplug the microphone, reboot the system. I then plug in the microphone and the system then aattempts to install the driver.</p>

Can you please check my earlier post in this thread (in response to Robin) and copy some of those minidump files to your SkyDrive account?<br />
<br />
I don't see anything on the spec sheet for that hub indicating that it has any sort of USB certification.&nbsp; And looking at the same spec sheet, I see that the power supply provides only 2A of power.&nbsp; For a 7 port hub, the power supply should provide at least
 500mA of power per port, along with whatever power the hub needs.&nbsp; Could be a typo on the spec sheet, but you should check what it says on the adapter.

<h2>            Micro soft automatic updates on Windows 10</h2>
                    I would like to know why my automatic updates are not installing on windows 10...history says failure....when I go to updates in the settings menu it says updates available but they will not download....If I look at details it says either waiting to install
 or waiting to download....They do not install or update...I cant even locate my automatic update settings to change the time of day to check for updates....I want my computer up to date and safe..So Mr.**** Gates tell your band of **** geeks to get this
 corrected..I have had this problem for weeks and can no answers from Microsoft which does not surprise me a bit...You sell the technology if you want tom&nbsp; call it that and when it doesn't work such as windows vista and windows 8 or 8.1...You let the customer
 suffer...Please advise on how to rectify.

Dell should have the drivers and control software available on their site. Please refresh your<br />
driver if possible and reboot before you load the new driver.&nbsp;Look&nbsp;for control software if any.&nbsp;<br />

Generic camera help :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS
<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<br />
<span>
<p>Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p><span>Hi Rohit,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Windows 7 Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>in addition to what Mark has suggested you can try the steps given below.<br />
<br />
The program that you are talking about is obsolete, still you can try running the same in Compatibility mode for lower version of Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For that follow the below given steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Locate the Setup program that will be used to install the program.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right-click the Setup program and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>Compatibility</strong> tab, click to select the <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong> check box.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the list, select the operating system that the program ran on previously, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. If you are unsure with which version of Windows the program previously worked, you can start by selecting the option for
<strong>Windows XP Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 3.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Try to install the program</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This should help in installing the program and run
<span>uninterrupted</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>Step 1: You need to download the install files for Windows 7 if you are reinstalling it on a system where it was previously installed. You can use the following resources:</p>

The Media you choose to install from will depend on certain factors, such as the Boot Scheme used by your computer (BIOS, UEFI) in addition to the storage device (hard disk partitioning layout). Examples of partitioning layout include MBR (BIOS) and GPT (UEFI). In this article, we show you several ways to create a bootable copy of Windows 10 from an ISO file. An ISO file is a digital replica of a virtual disc, which users will have to make bootable on a blank DVD, USB thumb drive or SD card.">How

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Step 3: Download any necessary drivers you might need for Windows 7 from the manufacturers website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Step 4: Perform a custom install - see the Windows 7 section of the following article how to do that:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Step 5: how find your product key and reactivate:</p>
<p><span>Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer,&nbsp;</span><span>how do I find the product key?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system
 unit.&nbsp;It looks like the following:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer.</li></ul>
<span>
<ul>
<li>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</li></ul>

 the manufacturer&nbsp;</a>of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need to use the product key also.</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p><span>I bought a retail box copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Windows 8.1; where do I find the product key?</span></p>

<h2>            Using keyboard keys to adjust volume.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Currently the only way that I can adjust the volume of my headphones is by using the buttons on the headphones or by adjusting the volume in the software that is playing the audio. When I use the volume keys on my keyboard or adjust the volume in the control
 panel, it shows me that the volume is increasing but the volume of the headphones does not increase at all. Does anyone know how to use the volume keys to adjust headphone volume?
<br />
<br />
I'm also not sure which topic this falls under in the given list so I am sorry if this is in the wrong place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Henry.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try for headset problems so at least something will work.  If you need help performing any steps I am standing by here to help:
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-headset-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-hea...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay to look for the device and change the default behavior in it's Dropdown Menu.
<br /> 
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sounds Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected and Connected for both Playback and Recording Default Devices.
<br />
<br />If not again right click Volume icon in System Tray to choose Troubleshoot sound problems.
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page. While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it helps to unpair or disconnect all other Bluetooth devices from the PC in Bluetooth settings, then try again to connect the headset.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  
<br /><a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Skype Web Control has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I've noticed the web control stopped working a couple of days ago. When clicking on the bubble, nothing happens. Here is some sample code:</p>
<p>
&lt;html&gt;<br />
&lt;body style="background-color:black"&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;span class="skype-button bubble " data-bot-id="MY BOT ID"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;<br />

&lt;/body&gt;<br />
&lt;/html&gt;
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, I had a question. Does a user need Skype installed on their device for the control to work? (I do have Skype installed on my test machine.)</p>

<p>AFAIK, this sort of thing is related to the ability to link online accounts, rather than to networking computers (which is what "trying to link 2 computers" sounds like).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to link accounts, see, for example, <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/streaming-your-windows-media-player-12-library-over-internet?utm_source=7tutorials.com&amp;utm_medium=redirect&amp;utm_campaign=7_Tutorials_Redirect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

https://www.groovypost.com/howto/microsoft/windows-7-automatically-login-online-services-live/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though that last article is only a couple of years old, the link to the Microsoft site for downloading online ID providers is no longer valid.&nbsp; Here's what it used to point to:&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although there is a currently available download for version 6.5 of the "Windows Live ID Sign-in Assistant" (rather than version 7 as in the archived web page), Windows Essentials is no longer supported and I've seen quite a few posts about problems with
 the Live ID Sign-in Assistant.&nbsp; FWIW, here's the link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>That exhausts my knowledge on the topic.&nbsp; I'm going to move this thread to the Windows Essentials section where someone with relevant information might see it and help you.</p>

            If it doesn't even see the HDMI in, then it might be a driver issue. Try getting another HDMI device and see if it detects it. If it does, it's the controller. If not, it's most likely a driver issue.

                    I have a music file that has a dozen or more songs in it, but the file is only recordable as a single 77 minute "song." How do I break down this file into the individual songs?&nbsp;

<h2>            Firefox and Chrome will not launch</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am not very technical so please be gentle.</p>
<p>I have had the following happen with both Chrome and Firefox:</p>
<p>I double click on the icon but nothing happens. If I hover over the icon at the bottom of the screen the browser appears but only as a small square the same as if the browser had launched and I hover over the icon.</p>
<p>I have tried Task Manager - details - end task. But that does not fix it.</p>
<p>In the end I have to go back to a previous restore point. That is the only way I have found to fix it.</p>
<p>Could someone tell me if there is a simple answer? Is there something I'm missing?</p>

            <p>Hello Graham,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you facing any issues with Internet Explorer?</li><li>Do you remember making any changes in the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>I understand that Firefox and Chrome will not launch. The issue can be caused due to any third party software conflict. Hence, I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Uninstall and re-install both the browsers</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to uninstall and re-install both the browsers to check if they work fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To uninstall:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X </strong>and click <strong>Programs</strong>
<strong>&amp; Features</strong></p>
<p>b. Right click each program (Firefox &amp; Chrome) and click <strong>Uninstall</strong></p>
<p>c. <strong>Restart</strong> the computer after uninstallation process and install them back</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I would recommend contacting support for each browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mozilla Support</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://productforums.google.com/d/forum/chrome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Chrome Support</a></strong></p>

</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<p>I have already read through 
this thread and see that the <a href="http://www.ueisupport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">remote code lookup page</a> reads the same thing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Xbox One remote will not control the volume of my Z906 set-up. &nbsp;The original remote for the Z906 works, the Xbox One remote works (there's nothing wrong with either of them) - it's just that the remote code given for the Z906 does not work.</p>
<p>Is there a different code I could use? &nbsp;I'd just like to control the volume with the Xbox One remote.</p>

            <p>Have you checked if your system meets the requirements for Movie Maker 2012?&nbsp; If so, you could update via the link in the prior post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option is to convert your webcam video into an audio-only file and then use it as "music".&nbsp; The quickest way is to use a 3rd party conversion utility. I've used Freemake Video Converter to take a video file and save it in .mp3 format.&nbsp; Then I've
 used that .mp3 as the "music".&nbsp; You could try that or do research on other conversion options. If you do install Freemake, just be aware that it is freeware and as is pretty typical with freeware, will offer to load&nbsp;extra add-ons.&nbsp; I always choose
<u>not</u> to install these and install just the program.</p>

            <p>Is the music part of the video, or is it a separate music file?&nbsp; Also, which version of Movie Maker are you using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the music isn't part of the video, you would make a split in your video (using the 'M' key on the keyboard or the 'Split' button on the 'Video Tools | Edit' tab).&nbsp; Then put your picture(s) in between.&nbsp; You would then have the music playing along then
 the photos and then back to the video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the music is part of the audio inside the original video, it's a little more complicated.&nbsp; The first thing you need to do is to treat the audio as a separate track.&nbsp; Assuming you are on the latest version of
<a href="http://download.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Movie Maker 2012</a>, you would add a second copy of your video as the music.&nbsp; The latest version will let you add a video file as the added music, where the prior version will only let you add music/audio files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have done this correctly you'll have your video, plus a second copy of its audio as the "music" track.&nbsp; But now you'll hear the music twice.&nbsp; So go to the video and mute it (Video Tools | Edit &gt; Video Volume, set it to zero).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, now you can remove portions of the video and replace them with the equivalent amount of photos.&nbsp; For example, let's say you wanted to add 4 photos for 7 seconds each.&nbsp; That would mean you would need to split out 28 seconds of video, delete it and replace
 it with the 4 photos.&nbsp; At the end, the video would still be at the right point to synch back up with the original audio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be a little tricky, especially if you plan to add some transitions between the items because it makes it harder to then calculate the amount of video to remove.&nbsp; In this case, you might want to use the audio waveform view in Movie Maker 2012 so
 you can match the waveform from the video back to the waveform from the added audio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, good luck and I hope this helped.</p>

            I built the computer myself and it was a retail version. &nbsp;Wife found the key today. &nbsp;Just needed a second set of eyes to see it. &nbsp;While looking through the .old folder I saw that I had created a disk image after i first installed the drivers and windows
 updates. &nbsp;That was going to be my next move.

<p>Off topic this is sad now we have to start everything over because of this stupid new forum.</p>
<p>On topic i love Brotherhood for gameplay, AC2 for story. Now im not saying Brotherhood doesn't have a good story it does just not as great as AC2. TBO im against online play for AC so im not going to post about that.</p>

<p>Yes, AC2 has a great story, really cool if you like history. Not sure how historically accurate the game is, but Da Medici looks like the paintings of him! &nbsp;I've been wanting to play AC2 for a long time, just now getting to it and I have marathon sessions
 playing. &nbsp;It really feels like a virtual world. &nbsp;Also very cool that using brains to outwit guards is very satisfying instead of hack n slash. But is it really good when I feel pleasure assassinating Alberti? &nbsp;I know I am near the start of the game, and for
 many here AC is very familiar. I have only been playing for about a week. </p>
<p>I will likely try Brotherhood, heard it has many cool new features. &nbsp;But curious why the online is not good. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The online is great..... when you can play it. &nbsp;I do love it, so just know that before reading the rest of my post.</p>
<p>That being said, the matchmaking is absolutely <i>terrible. &nbsp;</i>A lot of times you won't be able to get in. &nbsp;But when you do, you'll be glad, as this multiplayer provides fantastic gameplay, and while it's not necessarily new (There have been a couple of
 games with this style of MP) It is a definitely welcome break from the run 'gun of CoD. &nbsp;One thing you should know is that for this MP, Strategy is key! &nbsp;Don't go in there thinking, "Oh, I'll run up to this guy and stab him. &nbsp;He won't be able to do anything
 to me." &nbsp;he will.</p>
<p>So, yes, get this game, get AC2 as well if you can. &nbsp;Both fantastic, I love the AC games, and here's to the anticipation for Revelations!!!</p>

<p>I prefer Assassin's Creed II over Brotherhood storyline wise and because the game was more polished in general. Brotherhood wasn't bad though, the story was good and I absolutely loved running around in Rome (again). For MP, it's not perfect, with all it's
 matchmaking problems and lag but when it DOES work, it's absolutely wonderful! I love it</p>

<p>Both are pretty fun games. If you like Assassins Creed 2 then you should like Brotherhoods for the most part. Gamestop also has it marked down now to $30.</p>

<p>S/O to shotgunshine for the price info at gamestop. I almost never shop at gamestop, so who knows when I would have realized they were 20 dollars cheaper than walmart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first experience with this series was when my brother got the PSP bundle with Bloodlines...I went with Gran Turismo. I played it, a little, didn't interest me very much, so it was left alone. I actually still have the gamesaves on my PSP. Then, my stepfather
 was playing AC II in the living room on the flat screen like a year later, and I asked him if I can play it later. He let me play it a bit, but I didn't wanna just be sitting there playing on his console all day. So eventually, when I got an xbox in my bedroom,
 I played AC II from the beginning. I beat it twice. Second time was because everything on my hard drive became corrupt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I loved the gameplay and story. There were some parts that I didn't really like, the part where they killed the youngest brother, etc. But it was a great game for me. I like the type of strategy games where you have to actually use knowledge to progress.
 You can't just slap a few puzzles and riddles in a game and call it a strategy game. I haven't played The first title, but I will remedy that this summer. The introduction of the Gun was nice. Not always very accurate for me, but it was fun hearing that loud
 bang. Finding the Assassin's Tomb was so much fun it was crazy. That was probably one of the funnest parts of the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also liked the money system set up. Cash would be deposited every 20 minutes in the Villa...BTW, am I the only one who noticed that it isn't actually every 20 minutes? IT was also very exciting for me to try to rush back to the Villa to scoop up the florins
 before they were over the max and lost. The thing that pulled me in and kept my interest for the most part the Templar Factor. I have been interested in Templar's since about the age of 15, so that's what pulled me in. I'm 20 now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, my assessment of Brotherhood. I'm glad the intro didn't just pick up anywhere. IT showed them actually traveling to the Villa in the present day. I Thought getting into the Villa was a bit more involved than it should have been. But alas, we made it
 inside and the story got started. Hated them killing Mario Auditoré, but it pushed the game along. My absolute favorite part of Brotherhood was training the recruits. I actually lost one of them in a fight, but eventually I hardened them up and had them all
 at the top level in just a few days. I liked tapping the button and seeing them literally come out of nowhere, kill everyone, and be gone in 30 seconds. that was just awesome. And when it finally came up, ARROW STORM was pretty cool. My first full Assassin
 was a girl...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Christina Missions...although they had no real purpose, they were nice...I had hoped it meant they would be together when it was all over, but with the information from Revelations, it looks like they'll never each other again. And there was a part when
 Ezio and Leonardo first meet up in Rome...some of my friends say something happened but I didn't catch it. The tools he gives you in the game were alright. Aren't they always?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ending when they found the Apple where Ezio hid it in the Colosseum was kind of intense. It took me a while to get to the Apple. The voice was quite distracting at first, but I got used to it. Then when Desmond killed Lucy, In was so surprised and amazed.
 And then that part with the voices, I never understood what happened. I thought they were found by Templar/Abstergo Agents. I read in GameInformer that they were actually found by other Assassins. Curious...how did the others find them? Hmm...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online Multiplayer Modes. I liked it. MP was good, once you understood the different modes and how to play them. Some people said it was a bit hard at times to find a session. I almost never played alone; I was always in a party with my friends while the
 session leader searched for a game. Gameplay was nice. Leveling up seemed to take forever. I also think there were a few too many online achievements...I don't like online achievements very much for any game because not everyone has online access. IT seems
 a bit unfair. But hey...I'm just one gamer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My final part...I can't really say which game has a better story. It's not like it two different versions of the same story. It's the Beginning and Continuation of one story. Therefore, I can't compare them in those terms. I will say this, however. I liked
 the Elements of Brotherhood more. with that said, I'm buying my own copy of it. Oh...I forgot to mention these were both my Stepfathers games and I beat them both before he did.
