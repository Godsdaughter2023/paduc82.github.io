<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t play Dark Souls on my Xbox One - Cloud Saved Games</h2>
                    
<p>I just downloaded Dark Souls on my Xbox One and it's not allowing me to play without the game not saving my progress. When I select the storage device for the game saves, I choose the only one available, Cloud Storage, and it gives me an error. "<strong>Items
 on another Xbox are waiting to be uploaded for this game or app. To use cloud storage, sign in to the Xbox you last played on and upload the items to the cloud</strong>."</p>
<p>I don't have an Xbox 360 anymore and I have no way to access that data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am having the same issue. I have my 360 still and that doesn't help as it says "Items on another Xbox are waiting to be uploaded for this game or app. To use cloud storage, sign in to the Xbox you last played on and upload the items to the cloud." referring
 to my Xbox one. So I cant even start a new game. There is another forum on this where more people are having this issue with Dark Souls but i haven't got a response yet.</p>

            <p>Hey all.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear the trouble you're having with your saved data with this game. If you haven't already, please be sure to run through all the steps in this sticky. If none of those steps help please be sure to fill out the survey included near the end.</p>
<p>I have seen a few users report that deleting your in-game save and creating a new save can clear this up, although some users have reported this doesn't help. So long as you fill out the survey the appropriate teams will be made aware of this. Thanks for your patience!</p>

    <title>Stereo sound only playing one channel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zuz456  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stereo sound only playing one channel</h2>
                    Hi Guys, for some reason my speakers do not play the right channel of audio in music or movies.<br />
<br />
Im running Windows 7 64 bit, I have two speakers playing stereo sound, sound comes out of both speakers, but only the left channel of audio
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been all through the Control Panel &gt; Sound options, I have selected stereo sound, checked the balance levels between L &amp; R speakers, I recently thought it might have been a hardware issue, so i recently bought a new soundcard and updated all of
 its drivers - still the problem remains. I have tried several different media players, and when testing windows sound (Control Panel &gt; Sound &gt; Configure &gt; Test stereo) it is very faint when playing the right channel.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>any suggestions / advice would help would help at this point, Thanks!</div>
                </div>

    <title>No speakers or headphones are plugged in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ziax43  say:</h3>
<h2>            No speakers or headphones are plugged in</h2>
                    I started getting this error since yesterday upon turning on my PC. I am using Windows 8.1, Alienware m14x R2 with creative recon3di driver installed.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried installing the driver there and back again but still hopeless. I restarted a lot of time, went to device manager and found 2 options under the " Sound, video and game controllers" : High Definition Audio Device, and NVIDIA Virtual Audio Device.
 I'm not sure if it is so before this. Went into safe mode, nothing. I used system restore, nothing.</div>
<div>The only thing that's left is to reinstall windows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am practically clueless on how to fix this issue. the sound isn;t there even when i insert my headphone jack. Please help. I've contacted Dell to try to get my pc diagnosed and still waiting for answers. I thought Windows community would give a hand.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you very much.</div>

            <p>Hi Ziax,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue usually causes due to not having updated audio&nbsp;driver or due to driver compatibility issues.&nbsp; There may be an issue with Creative recon3di driver as well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here in this scenario, I would suggest you to download the latest audio drivers first and check if it helps. If that does not help then try install Creative recon3di driver in compatibility mode and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download and install the latest Audio driver:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>&nbsp;Download the Creative recon3di driver and install in compatibility mode.</p>
<p><strong>Creative driver download</strong>: <a href="http://support.creative.com/Products/product_list.aspx?catid=1&amp;CatName=Sound+Blaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Install in compatibility mode:</strong></p>

    <title>Warranty Xbox 360 controller&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Warranty Xbox 360 controller&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp;</p><p>I bought a new xbox 360 controller on Amazon 4 months ago (the wire one), but it's unfortnunatly not working well, I think there is a connection problem between the controller and the wire, it just comes and goes for no obvious reasons (cannot see anything damaged, etc....) I went to the Amazon website, but can't apparently claim any warranty on their side. When I bought it, it came with a "1 Year constuctor warranty" so I was wondering who to contact to get help with fixing it or getting it replaced?</p><p><br /></p><p>Cheers,</p><p><br /></p><p>Charlotte.<br /></p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span>Gorsey,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Since
 when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you recall making any changes to the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Method 1:&nbsp; </span></strong><span>Run the fixit available in the link below and check if that makes any difference<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/slow_windows_performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Fix Windows system performance problems on slow Windows computers</span></a><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Put the computer in clean boot
 and check to see if the issue persists</span></p>
<p><span>Follow&nbsp;<strong>Step 1
</strong>in the link below,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.</span></p>
<p><span>After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software
 you can consider uninstalling it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> - Remember to put the computer
 back to normal startup <strong>follow step 7</strong> in the link.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span> Download and install all the available Windows Updates</span></p>

<h3> normgee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Signing in &#8211; Microsoft ignores customers own oft-used passwords</h2>
                    <p>I just want to let off some steam and imagine that other users of Skype and Microsoft have the same gripe.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned on my Mac and clicked the Skype icon. Instead of just bringing up my user window, it asked for my username and password. One option it offered was logging in via my Microsoft login. Which I did. No go. I double-checked my password, but it still
 resisted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Fine, I found my Skype log-in details and tried them. The password was not accepted, no matter how many times I input it. Now, I have not changed the password. It's saved in my computer and Skype just lets me in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not this time. Even after trying the password several times and inputting the robot prevention characters, it didn't work. So I had to claim that I'd forgotten my password. Along comes the email with the verification code, then the window asking for a password.
 Obviously, Skype or Microsoft had forgotten my password, so I typed it in. Why waste a good password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope, the robot on the other side THAT about. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Screed completed. Anyone else want a legitimate chance to dump on Microsoft?</p>

    <title>Unable to Connect to Internet After Windows 10 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregg98  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Connect to Internet After Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>My Internet connection, for the most part, has remained relatively stable and strong while my desktop operated under Windows 8.1.&nbsp; However, ever since I updated it to Windows 10, the computer can't seem to pick any networks at all, and when it does pick
 up my household's usual Wi-Fi network, it will only partially connect to it, and won't allow an Internet connection, and eventually said connection is simply lost within minutes.&nbsp; I've tried using the troubleshooter, but it never detects any issues, and when
 I try using it when the desktop actually has a partial connection to the Wi-Fi, the connection is, again, simply lost, and vanishes alongside all other detected networks from the Networks list.&nbsp; Disabling and Enabling the Wi-Fi from the Adapter Settings tends
 to temporarily reestablish the connection, but again, it's still the partial one with no Internet access.&nbsp; I don't understand what's even causing the issue, let alone how to fix it.</p>

<p>Do you have more than one Xbox connected to your network? Such as a Xbox360..... If so disconnect the Xbox360 from the router and reset Xbox one and router. Then see what happens. Some routers don't allow for multiple xboxs to play well together on the same
 network. There are many things that can cause Nat issues and can take some time to figure it out.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro dead after Windows Update. Would like to upgrade as part - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sean w_04  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro dead after Windows Update. Would like to upgrade as part of the warranty replacement.</h2>
                    <p>Q: Does anyone know if it's possible to do a warranty replacement for a dead Surface and get the newest model back as the replacement?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details:</p>
<p>So here's my situation: it looks like the latest Windows Update and/or the Firmware Update for my 2017 Surface Pro killed it. I woke up yesterday morning to find the device extremely hot to the touch and it would not turn on. After unplugging it for a while
 to cool off, I was finally able to get it to start up using the two button hot-key (power and volume+). Once booted up, I saw a warning in the notifications section that said I needed to install the latest updates. When I went into Windows Update, it showed
 that updates had been attempted (and failed) during the night. There were three updates pending, one for the Windows, one for Office, and a Firmware Update for the Surface itself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initiated the update, but then got the Blue Screen of Death and had to do a hard shutdown. Now the system won't boot past the Windows logo. After about 20 minutes it goes into the UEFI screen where it shows a disc icon with an 'x' in it. The online tech
 support told me that means there's probably a hardware issue with the SSD; so I think this basically means the update killed my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to work with Microsoft Tech Support to do a warranty replacement since this happened less than 11 months after I got it. What no one seems to be able to answer is if it's possible to do an upgrade to a new Surface 6 as my replacement unit
 instead of a refurbished Pro. I assume I would need to pay some kind of fee for depreciation, and am willing to. I keep being told that to even explore this option I need to go to a Microsoft Store. The catch is that I'm in the military and currently stationed
 in Germany, and there are no MS Stores in Europe so I'm out of luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I upgrade my device at the same time as I do a warranty exchange?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sean W</p>

                    <p>This is the easiest&nbsp;way as of now to permanently stop Cortana and Edge ( I only disabled Edge cuz the lack of security)...
</p>
<p>Right click Start Menu, open task manager, go to Cortana right click and open file location Re-name it with .old at the end of it. A box will open up saying can't close cuz it is running. Drag that box close to task mgr. and end task Cortana&nbsp;and quickly
 hit try again (this is NECESSARY as Cortana turns back on within 3 seconds)&nbsp;Once you get it before Cortana turns back on you will NOT see it in task mgr. anymore, and will NOT open if you click on it in Start menu. You will have to re-do this after one of
 the Windows 10 system&nbsp;updates,&nbsp; this method works 100% guaranteed so now your memory is freed up for a faster PC AS IT SHOULD BE!!!! After I did same to Edge I went to control panel/Default Programs and set whichever browser you use. I set mine for IE 11.
 This HAS to be done through control panel as if you try to in settings it won't allow to change it.... Microsoft should ALLOW Administrator to disable anything or end task as in Windows 7 etc. BUT they chose to control you and your OWN personal PC. Cortana
 may be OK for cells (like Siri for IPhone) and Tablets, but I have no need for it on my laptop....</p>
<p>Hope this helps everyone who wants their PC to run as fast as it should. </p>

<p>My PCs and laptops run just fine with Cortana (Search indexing) going on in the back ground. Sounds like you had other issues on your system causing the constant slowdowns.</p>

            I'm an IT Tech and all my computers, friends, Family and customers are much happier with what I did to their PC's and ALL say it is much more responsive than it was after Windows 10 update. Everyone has their own preferences and I respect your opinion,
 but Cortana uses up 47-51% of memory open your task mgr. and sort by memory you will see. I also installed AdBlock Plus for web surfing and it is a lot faster loading pages. It blocks Adchoices in which it is on almost every page and with Cortana not set right
 for privacy, the ads will show things you searched for or even after I was browsing E Bay, those items were being advertised. Like I said if I was using my cell or a tablet I wouldn't mind Cortana I'd just&nbsp;make sure&nbsp;privacy settings were set right. I posted
 this for the thousands of people have asked me, and this is the easiest way. I didn't want to get into registry editing or Power Shell options cuz that is how people could screw up their PC. This will NOT harm your PC in any wa

<p>Yes and like I said everyone has their own opinion to keep or not. I understand you say it doesn't affect your computer's performance, I am using an Asus with Intel I7, 12 GB Ram etc... and after I disabled,&nbsp;all 100 GB of Internet speed were definitely being
 used, AND after I installed AdBlock Plus <a href="https://adblockplus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://adblockplus.org/</a>&nbsp; opened my homepage (MSN.com) all&nbsp;Google Adchoice were blocked and loaded 5 to 10 times faster. Also if you haven't already have it, I recommend downloading&nbsp;WOT
 Web of Trust &nbsp;<a href="https://www.mywot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mywot.com/</a> for safer browsing. Most sites are rated, you can rate any site you believe is safe for adults and children separately. Also in your searches each link will have a green, yellow or red
 circle next to it, kinda like a stop light... I think it was the best add-on ever made for the web. Anyhow I hope you don't take anything I post offensively, I am just stating facts on my research to make everyone's PC to run as it should and most importantly
 SAFE. I have 1 Anti-Virus and 2 anti-spyware, plus I have a double Firewall so I CAN do my research and find what's safe and what isn't, for my own PC and expanding my knowledge for Virus removal jobs. I am kinda like your username I like to help anyone and

            No problem I have seen thousands of people asking this question and also all my customers. So I posted this because I saw others saying to disable it through settings and also using command prompts or editing the registry. I can do all that but most people
 would end up screwing up the operating system so this was the easiest way for anybody to disable if they want and I also disabled Edge because of the security issues now if I had a phone or a tablet I would probably use Edge just because you can draw on it
 my laptop is not a touch screen so I have no use for that even if it was Secure glad I could help and the other two links I put on here a for quicker and safer internet surfing

<p>You said it is using 47% - 51% of MEMORY. Is it or is it not using that amount of RAM as you state? That's the statement we are interested in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;yes approximately 47% to 51% I'm not exactly sure how much at this moment because I cannot see it on task manager since it's disabled but when I did see it it fluctuated between 47 and 51% when you open task manager you'll see how much it is using by sorting
 it through memory. Either way it does slow down your computer and compromise your privacy in which Google was the number one personal information collector until Cortana came around and Google still collects information and put it into their ad choices so
 whatever you search for or say you're on eBay looking for something that will start posting in adchoices use the 2 links I put in and that will disappear and you will have a safer internet with WOT and Adblock Plus</p>

<p>Task Manager doesn't display percentages for each item in either the Processes or the Details view. In the Processes view you get one percentage and a bunch of actual amounts in use. In the Details view you get the actual amount.

                    <p>Original title: Problem with touchpad</p>
<p>I have a Sony laptop and the touch-pad is not working well. The cursor keeps moving everywhere and it's quite irritating. Moreover the left button keeps clicking on its own (sometimes). I was using windows 8 initially and one of my friend suggested that
 changing to new OS might solve the problem. I installed windows 8.1 bootable one but the problem is still there...Please help.

    <title>Making System Tray Icon Selections Stick Across Reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanw12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Making System Tray Icon Selections Stick Across Reboot</h2>
                    I want my Lync icon to show up in the system tray, but it is not there by default. &nbsp;I can go into Notification Area Icons menu and change the setting from "Only show notificatons" to "Show icon and notifications." &nbsp;Great - that works. &nbsp;But whenever I restart
 my system, that configuration is lost and it goes back to being hidden.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to lock in this selection so that it doesn't get lost on a reboot?</div>
                </div>

            No - the issue is not specific to Lync. &nbsp;I tried making the One Note icon show in the notification area and the same thing happened - it got hidden again after restart.
<div><br />
<div>The options mentioned in Both Method 1 and Method 2 are already selected. &nbsp;Also those seem to be targeted and ensuring that lync starts automatically when after boot. &nbsp;That is not the problem - Lync i starting and logging in.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have gone through the basic steps described in the tutorial on changing how icons appear in the notification area - that is how I get the Lync icon to show up after a reboot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem is that Notification area icons setting gets reset from "Show icon and notifications" (which I set it to) back to "Only show notifications" on system restart.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Seems like either:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) these settings are not designed &nbsp;to stick across a reset (seems strange)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) there is some other mechanism which configures the notificaiton area on boot which is overriding the setting</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Thank you for the reply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I understand that you still have the issue with adding items to the notification area. So, please follow the suggestions mentioned below to fix the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> Firstly,<strong> </strong>I would suggest you to perform these steps to make changes in the registry for notifications.</div>

<strong>regedit</strong>, and press <strong>Enter.</strong> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. In regedit, navigate to the location below. <br />
<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. In the right pane, double click/tap on<strong> EnableAutoTray</strong> to modify it.
<div><br />
4. To Turn On<strong> "Always show all taskbar icons and notifcations"<br />
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Type in<strong> 0 (zero)</strong> and <strong>click/tap on</strong> <strong>
OK</strong>. </div>
<div><br />
b) Close<strong> Regedit.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5. To Turn Off <strong>"Always show all taskbar icons and notifcations"</strong>.Again go to the same location by folowing steps from 1 -4.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Type in 1 and <strong>click/tap on OK</strong>. (see screenshot above)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>6. Close <strong>Regedit.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>7. Log off and log on, or<strong> Restart the computer</strong> to apply the changes<strong>.</strong></div>
<div>

<h3> rohit-gaikwad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Issue&#58; Applications Keep on Not Responding and see disk usage mostly at 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hello ,</p>
<p>2 days back i got my Windows security updated &nbsp;i don't remember the Kcode . after that update i started getting many issues like if i am using Eclipse for more then 5 min it stop working and i can see a gray eclipse screen with Not-Responding same for Google
 Chrome same for VLC and others.</p>
<p>So, i tried to solve it &nbsp;and found my system disk usage is at 100% figured out which app is taking the max disk usage and it was service host so i found a solution like disable the super fetch i tried it like 3 times but it &nbsp;was getting started after every
 reboot.</p>
<p>Finally id disabled it from Register. i thought it will work fine &nbsp;as this time Super-fetch was Disabled so i started using my laptop again and after 10 min i got the issue again, application Stopped working and i was just able to move my mouse pointer but
 was unable to click any thing , so i did a hard Reboot . and once again entered the Task Manager and i noticed that now &nbsp;System and Compressed memory is and Windows module installer worker is taking maximum disk space . So checked my windows updates and there
 was an On going&nbsp;Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 (Definition 1.219.1878.0). which is sucked at 0%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i don't know whats Wrong actually and please tell me which solution should i follow like the one for Application Not responding as each and every application is not responding after 5-10 min or should i follow 100% disk usage for&nbsp;System and Compressed
 memory is and Windows module installer worker. Please help me a this thing is really making me crazy&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>That is not a good sign. If chkdsk takes a long time it is indication that the tool ha a lot of work to do to restore the drive. All you can do is to be patient as to interrupt could make matters even worse.</p>

<h2>            Resize Window w&#47;o Cutting Off Screen</h2>
                    I replaced my old pc which had two monitors with a new one that has one large, wide screen.&nbsp; I'd like to use the wide screen essentially as two monitors, but when I view two windows side by side, each window cuts off half of what I'm trying to view.&nbsp; I'd
 like to view the full contents of the window while reducing the size of the window.&nbsp; How do I do this?

            Hi WIll.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Many ultra-wide monitors come with software to facilitate more easily double screen display on the one ultra-wide.  I'd first look on the Support web page for monitor model for this information or download.  Dell and LG are leaders on this.
<br />
<br />The most complete overviews with all options discussed here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10-ultrawide-monitor-experience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10-ultra...</a>

<br />
<br />A good software to manage this is demonstrated in this video:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvXtcB2mYPE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvXtcB2mYPE</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/CvXtcB2mYPE?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/CvXtcB2mYPE?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>
<br />
<br />There is also professional software here for this:  <a href="https://www.digitaltigers.com/split-4k-monitor-into-multiple-virtual-monitors.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitaltigers.com/split-4k-monitor-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

Just to verify, is this happening when you try to watch other movies as well? What changes have you made prior to getting this issue? What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?<br />
