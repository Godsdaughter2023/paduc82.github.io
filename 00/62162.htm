            Hi Johnny.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click the Start button to open Disk management, scroll down to find the flash drive on the drive map, right click to assign a letter if none so it will show up.
<br />
<br />If that fail right click Start to open Device Manager, under Disk Drives find the flash stick, right click to Uninstall driver, restart PC to reinstall driver.  
<br />
<br />If that fails can you read the stick in another PC at all?  If so back up the files to the desktop there, then format it in the new PC:  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Format-an-External-Hard-Drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Format-an-External-Hard-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Are there any unrecognized devices shown in Device Manager?&nbsp; If it detects something but unrecognized, you might be able to apply a driver for it to the detected device.

<h2>            Windows 10 Re-Install on a New Drive.....HELP PLEASE&#47;.</h2>
                    <p>Hello all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop that came with Windows 10, Home version I think, and the hard drive has failed.&nbsp; I cannot access anything on it.&nbsp; I've tried everything and can't get to it.&nbsp; I tried downloading a version to a USB drive and couldn't complete the install because
 it couldn't access the drive, I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now I am going to get a new drive and install it.&nbsp; I never made a rescue disc and it didn't come with one.&nbsp; So I have nothing to start with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me what version of Windows 10 I need to download and put on my USB drive to get it back up and running?&nbsp; I also have no product key but I have been told that the newer machines have the product key and other info on the Motherboard.&nbsp; I am skeptical
 of this.&nbsp; I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to do a FULL, CLEAN install if I can.&nbsp; If I can't I'll install anything I can get that will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need your help and advice to get this back up and running with what I have.&nbsp; I don't want to have to buy a copy of Windows 10 just because my drive failed.&nbsp; There has to be a way I can det this machine back up and running.....right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help if you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great weekend.</p>
<p>Larry</p>

<p>Well, you need to know if Home or Pro version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your manufacturers site and look up your model number and look at the features it came with. it should tell you what version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also highly suggest that a Windows update caused this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You already tried a clean install and may have wiped out the previous OEM install. Or I would point you to use system restore, you can create a repair CD or use any windows 10 install DVD to access the start up options to accomplish this. You can download
 the repair cd iso or win 10 install iso and burn on to a disk. You must know someone you can use their PC to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which update was it. If it was the newest cumulative update <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4074588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>hold down shift key</p>
<p>Select - Start Menu&gt;&gt;Power&gt;&gt;Restart PC</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>log off/sign out, </p>
<p>hold down shift key </p>

<p>system restore</p>
<p>select a date and time before this update, maybe go back 2 or 3 days</p>
<p>restore system</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now try and do the update manually</p>
<p>first, go to control panel&gt;&gt;System&gt;&gt;system protection</p>
<p>and create a new restore point and name it</p>
<p>now go to here</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have a newer UEFI system, which you do, then you have to prepare the new SDD or HDD and create 4 partitions</p>
<p>EFI _ Boot partition.</p>
<p>Windows recovery</p>
<p>C:\ OS</p>
<p>MSR</p>
<p>or you will not get it to install</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you try and install right on same disk over corrupted crashed current OS, then when you clean install 10, do not format drive, just select to install to large partition C:\</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go into the BIOS and select a Dual EFI and BIOS or just BIOS and do the install just formatting the drive NTFS and installing that way, personally, I will not use EFI as I believe most all issues with Windows 10 booting, installing or crashing are
 because of the EFI system setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows should detect your Board ID and even with new drive, you should have it activated automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to do a clean install, here is the link to download and burn iso on dvd for Windows 10 v1709 Fall Creators Update version.</p>
<p>get the 64 bit version, but do not install Pro if you only qualify for Home version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean install of 1709. back up your personal files. your settings and apps will be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windowsiso.net/windows-10-iso/windows-10-creators-update-1709-download-build-16299-15/windows-10-fall-creators-update-1709-iso-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsiso.net/windows-10-iso/windows-10-creators-update-1709-download-build-16299-15/windows-10-fall-creators-update-1709-iso-download/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Select Language</p>
<p>Be sure to select the 64 bit version and make sure if you have home to install home and if you have pro&nbsp;to install pro. Both are on the Windows10.ISO Image file.
</p>
<p>Burn the ISO file onto a DVD (It will be a Bootable Disk) I would not use USB if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not format drive or anything if installing with EFI boot partition, unless it is a new replaced SSD or HDD. Just install to the large C:\ Partition</p>
<p>If using&nbsp;old legacy BIOS then format NTFS</p>
<p>
</p><p>After install, go to windows update and install all the current updates until you have Build 16299.248

<p>Hey Guys....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot access the hard drive!!&nbsp; &nbsp;It's totally GONE.&nbsp; I took it out and put it in a drive carrier and plugged it into my laptop to see what was going on.&nbsp; It just spun.&nbsp; I took it to a local computer guy and asked him to see if he could access it and he
 plugged it in and after a minute or so it came back and asked him to FORMAT it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So, that's when I tried the INSTALL on the USB just to see if it would work.</p>
<p>All I could do was put the thumb drive in, start it up, hit ESC and get to the BOOT menu where I chose USB Drive.&nbsp; It started the Windows Install but when it gets to the writing on the hard drive....it stops and tells me there is a problem with the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the ONLY thing I could do.&nbsp; I tried to do the same thing again to see if I would get the same results and it got to where it asked me where I wanted to install it to and when I picked the BIG partition it came back after a few seconds and told me
 "THIS DRIVE IS GOING TO FAIL SOON...SELECT ANOTHER LOCATION."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version it had in it was the Windows 10 HOME version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How am I going to install Windows 10 on a formatted hard drive or a NEW DRIVE with NOTHING on it?&nbsp; I think what I have on my USB drive is the Windows 10 UPDATE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>

            If creating all the partitions is too much for you to understand and do, on start up, usually the delete or tab key, enter your BIOS and change the setting from UEFI/EFI to dual EFI/BIOS or just to BIOS and use the DVD to install and select format NTFS
 and install windows. It should create the Windows recovery partition and your C:\ partition for the OS.

<p>Hey Guys...</p>
<p>
</p><p>NO, the drive wasn't formatted.&nbsp; I had him give it back to me before he done anything.&nbsp; Everything is still on there as it was when it failed.</p>
<p>I bought the laptop for my mother to use.&nbsp; She's 74 and I try to make things as easy as possible for her.&nbsp; About a month ago she called me and told me something was wrong with the computer and I needed to look at it when I could.&nbsp; So, I went over when I
 had the time later that evening.&nbsp; She said she got up and opened the lid and upon it's waking up, it showed a message "THE HARD DRIVE HAS A PROBLEM......WINDOWS IS ATTEMPTING TO FIX IT.&nbsp; THIS MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN AN HOUR."&nbsp; That might not be exact, but it's
 close to what it said.&nbsp; I told her to leave it alone and let it do whatever it is going to do.&nbsp; At some point that night it stopped trying to fix it and then it just had a blank screen.&nbsp; IT looks as if the screen is OFF.&nbsp; I can also tell that the hard drive
 is not spinning much at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to be able to keep this drive, its structure, her files, and so forth and not have to go through all this stuff to get it working.&nbsp; I've tried to get into it with a USB cable and one of those drive caddys and it just spins and spins and doesn't
 show anything.&nbsp; It sometimes gives a message "Windows was unable to access the drive."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if there are better tools out there, better recovery and repair software, or other apps and such that could help me repair and eventually use this drive.&nbsp; I just know I can't get into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions on what I could do to get into the drive, please post them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the method that seahawks posted, I can do it, but I wish I didn't have to go to that method.&nbsp; I know I'm grasping at straws here, but if there is a possibility to get into it, repair the damaged parts and put it back in use, I have to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 will let me create and name partitions on a hard drive won't it?&nbsp; I figure the folders are named exactly as Seahawk put them, right?</p>
<p>Lastly, with all that done, does Windows automatically recognize them during the install and put the necessary files into the folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all kindly for your time and help.&nbsp; I appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Larry</p>

<p>Alright. If the installation is giving you a message that you cannot install windows on this drive because it is failing soon the only solution for that is totally wiping the Drive by using the DISKPART command and applying a CLEAN parameter on it.<br />
<br />
But if there are files that it is holding you to apply a Format or Wipe. i would suggest that you can plug that Drive on another computer first and Backup every files on it. so there is no hesitant on doing a Wipe. if you have done this. try applying this DISKPART
 method to fully Clean install windows.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When you are on the Drive selection where to install windows Follow this.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span>1. Press Shift + F10 to open Command prompt</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Type : DISKPART</span></p>
<p><span>Hit enter</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Type : Select Disk 0</span></p>
<p><span>hit enter (Disk 0 is now Selected)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Last type : CLEAN</span><br />
<span>Hit enter</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5</strong>. <strong>Exit command prompt and refresh the drive list. and then on the
<em>unlocated partition.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>try installing windows on it and it will automatically generate the System partition (OEM RESERVE, SYSTEM RESERVE)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the windows is still not allowing you to install windows on that drive, consider buying a new one and install windows on it and put back the files later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have experience this before this kind of message what fixed that for me is repairing the
<em><strong>BAD SECTORS</strong> </em>this can be performed by applying a 3rd party tool but since we are in a Microsoft forum we cannot talk about it here.</p>

<p>I do not know what to tell you, It is either a failed drive, that may be unusable. It may be just corruption. I suggest to buy a new drive, install windows on it, connect the bad drive and then try and access it at THIS PC. Take over ownership of the whole
 drive and all objects and sub containers and then access the personal files and copy them to new drive with your new OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you unplug the drive power and cable and let it sit and cool down while you get a new drive. Wait until you are ready for it as I mentioned, and then try to recover your important data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both my Asus PC and Laptop is the&nbsp;DELETE key on start up to access my BIOS, </p>
<p>TAB key&nbsp;to display BIOS messages. But all depends on the Bios used on the board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some tools for boot, start up and then the usual restore etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would run command prompt for check disk,. this is your brst chance to get data off the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>at command prompt type in</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Help</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;help chkdsk</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;chkdsk c: /f /r /x /b /spotfix /sdcleanup /offlinescanandfix</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I would run system file checker</p>
<p>at command prompt type in</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;sfc /?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;sfc (then any switch you want to enter for the process)</p>

            Hi Jaku.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) See how to fix search here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/how-to-solve-windows-search-issues-index-rebuild/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/how-to-solve-windo...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.askvg.com/fix-windows-search-crashes-fails-to-start-or-doesnt-show-search-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.askvg.com/fix-windows-search-crashes...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-windows-10-search-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-windows-10...</a>
<br />
<br />2)Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I went from E3 to E5 licensing. I've verified all of my users are enabled in Admin Center and are licensed, but for some reason not showing up in the Users section of Skype for Business Admin section of the portal. I've also verified the users have SIP:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 setup in EOL. As a result of this issue, I am unable to login using *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;- however, it
<em><strong>does</strong> </em>work if I login with my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (this account does show in skype admin center)</p>

<p>Help!</p>

<p>hi cory,</p>
<p>generally, if the users have set up *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as the sip address, they should be able to log into skype for business using *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. therefore, i’d like to confirm the following information to look into the issue:<br />
1. have you successfully verified your custom domain in office 365?<br />
2. can you provide the subscriptions of your office 365 tenant for our analysis? refer to the following steps to capture a screenshot of your subscriptions:<br />
a. log into <a href="https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx#eadmindefaultpage_adminhomepageesku_admindashboardpage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
office 365 admin center</a> with an admin account.<br />
b. navigate to <strong>billing</strong> &gt; <strong>subscriptions</strong><br />
to upload pictures, please click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> and <strong>
insert/edit media</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9d27cd5a-1147-47e0-acf5-322d687b753e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9d27cd5a-1147-47e0-acf5-322d687b753e" /></a></p>
<p><br />
3. please provide the detailed steps of how you upgrade office 365 enterprise e3 plan to office 365 enterprise e5 plan.<br />
4. about ‘i went from e3 to e5 licensing’, i’d like to confirm which office 365 licenses the affected users are using.<br />
5. by saying ‘i've verified all of my users are enabled in admin center and are licensed’, do you mean all of them are properly assigned with skype for business online licenses?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=405727cc-90bd-42f1-90c9-e21c35d299f9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d405727cc-90bd-42f1-90c9-e21c35d299f9" /></a></p>
<p><br />
if yes, can they use skype for business online service normally?<br />
6. could you take some related screenshots regarding users are properly assigned with skype for business online license while they are not shown under users in skype for business admin center for our better understanding?</p>
<p>let us know if anything is misunderstood.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
sam</p>

<p>Hi yes they are licensed as E5 with Skype plan 2 enabled and all check boxes checked for complete plan. Also note I am using dirsync and also E5 for voice functionality. I thought issue to be with RTP attributes in user accounts inside of ADUC so I removed
 those RTP entries using adsiedit. My main concern is while the users are licensed in the portal they are not appearing under the users section of Skype for business admin on portal. The only account that is there is the onmicrosoft account which, again, works
 perfectly. It almost seems like a provisioning issue which I know has been prevalent with E5.

<p>Hi Cory,</p>
<p>Could you provide the information that Sam asked before, so we can better understand your situation?</p>
<p>I understand that the synced users cannot be provisioned in Skype for Business Online. Based on my experience, this kind of Skype for Business provision issue could be caused if the users were enabled in Skype for Business on-premises and the msRTCSIP related
 attributes were set. Sometimes, it also can be caused if the DirSync is not running properly.</p>
<p>I realize that you have checked the "msRTC,,," attributes. However, in order to narrow down the issue, I recommend you run the ADSIEdit to check the following attributes again:</p>
<p>msRTCSIP – DeploymentLocator</p>
<p>msRTCSIP – FederationEnabled</p>
<p>msRTCSIP -InternetAccessEnabled</p>
<p>msRTCSIP-Line</p>
<p>msRTCSIP -OptionFlag</p>
<p>msRTCSIP -PrimaryHomeServer</p>
<p>msRTCSIP –PrimaryUserAddress</p>
<p>msRTCSIP –UserEnabled</p>
<p>msRTCSIP-UserPolicies</p>
<p>If these attributes are set, it is suggested you clear all the attribute values, then
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj151771.aspx#BKMK_SynchronizeDirectories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
force a directory synchronization</a> and check if the users can be found in the Skype for Business admin center (several minutes later). If the issue persists after that, let’s continue to perform the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Remove the Skype for Business Online license for one problematic account for test purpose.</p>
<p>2. Run DirSync and check if any error is shown in Synchronization Service Manager.</p>
<p>3. Assign the Skype for Business Online license to the problematic account and check if the account is shown in Skype for Business Admin Center.</p>
<p>If there is any error message received when performing the steps above, please capture a screenshot of the error for further research.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Toby</p>

<h2>            USB Drives Won&#39;t Work After Windows 7 Installation</h2>
                    I had Windows 7 installed on an old computer. After installing it, my USB ports don't work. Is there a program in Windows 7 that can find and install the existing hardware in my computer? I can hook things up to the ports and they'll charge, like my iPod,
 but it won't register actually being there. I've been trying to fix this for months but can't find it...help!!

<h2>            Class action lawsuit</h2>
                    <p>Anybody else not received their rewards and their accounts got reset? I haven't got a single reward point in over a year. On top of that, they won't and haven't responded to any of my forum or Twitter posts. I'm speaking with an attorney this afternoon and I advise you to do the same if you have the records. If we all do it then we might b able to get something actually accomplished. If they don't want to honor the system that they created, then i'm going to need to be compensated for their fraudulent activities and blatant disrespect toward their members.</p>

<h3> txpilot69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word won&#39;t print on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell multi-function network printer (Dell 1235cn), and Adobe Acrobat DC. &nbsp;After my upgrade to Windows 10, I can print a Windows Test Page from the printer settings, but I can't print from Microsoft Word Professional Plus 2010 won't print to PDF,
 or any other printer. &nbsp;However, Chrome will print, as will Edge, and Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? &nbsp;Obviously the printer, driver, and TCP/IP port are set properly--if they weren't, NOTHING would print. &nbsp;But why won't Word print a document now, to any printer? &nbsp; &nbsp;I tried running Word with Administrator privileges, and got the same result. &nbsp;Documents
 from Word don't even make it to the print queue, though Word's print dialog shows the printer as "Ready", and print preview works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found other posts that mentioned the "Fax" pseudo printer causing this issue, but I've deleted it and have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've cycled the Print Spooler Service, and rebooted the computer... no change. &nbsp;So why won't Word print?? &nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;This problem is solved... it ended up being this specific DOCUMENT wouldn't print. &nbsp;Printing other documents in Word worked fine. &nbsp;Copying and pasting the content from this document into a new one also allowed me to print. &nbsp;Never
 seen a document do this before... perhaps there was an escape sequence or something in the text that was causing me an issue. &nbsp;It was a template with form fields for a legal document, and I've printed successfully from it in the past. &nbsp;In any case, this is
 resolved.

            <p>I solved a similar problem. I have two Lenovo S20 Thinkstations, Windows 10&nbsp;with an HP LaserJet MFP M277 common to both on my local network. I was able to print to this printer until 3/15/2017. Only Word would not print to it after that date but Word would
 print to my other HP printer a LaserJet 4050. However, all other apps Excel, Adobe, Notepad, Wordpad and browsers would still print to the MFP M277. Only Word would not. The print que would flash the print job and then it would disappear as if it did go to
 the printer - maybe it did, don't know.</p>
<p>Solved it by looking at my updates and uninstalled update "Security Update for Microsoft Office Word 2007 (KB3178683)".&nbsp; This fixed it for both computers.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>

<p>this problem solved by check my page number, I was set two different page numbers in my document.</p>
<p>for example my document was 48 pages but first 15 pages numbered as alphabetic number and the rest was numbered from 1 to 33. print was not sent when i chose 41 to 48 pages for print.</p>

            I am having the same problem. Nothing will print. I have tried every solution mentioned and still nothing. At this point I feel that it is safe to say that the cause of the problem is not the printers, but Windows 10 itself. Namely the designers of this
 program. They should all be fired and go back to flipping burgers for a living because software design is obviously not working out for them.

<p>Solved for me.</p>
<p>I solved a similar problem. I have two Lenovo S20 Thinkstations, Windows 10&nbsp;with an HP LaserJet MFP M277 common to both on my local network. I was able to print to this printer until 3/15/2017. Only Word 2007 would not print to it after that date but Word
 would print to my other HP printer a LaserJet 4050. However, all other apps Excel, Adobe, Notepad, Wordpad and browsers would still print to the MFP M277. Only Word would not. The print que would flash the print job and then it would disappear as if it did
 go to the printer - maybe it did, don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Solved it" by looking at my updates and uninstalled update "Security Update for Microsoft Office Word 2007 (KB3178683)".&nbsp; This fixed it for both computers.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>

            Hey Iceman.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the antivirus? I'd uninstall it and use built-in Defender to troubleshoot this.
<br />
<br />If you type Defender Security Center in Start Search, open it, then choose Virus and Threat Protection Settings, is Controlled Folder Access turned On?
<br />
<br />Also in Security Center under App and Browser Control, is Check Apps and Files set to Block?  Change to Warn.  
<br />
<br />Is Device Guard enabled?  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enable-disable-device-guard-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if the Update installs and causes the same problem again uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> swaginabag  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add a searchable shortcut in &#34;All apps&#34;</h2>
                    <p>In past versions of windows, a user has been able to manually add shortcuts (NOT TILES) to the start menu by placing them in the All Programs folder either in %appdata% or in %programdata%. On windows 10, with default drive lettering, the paths to these
 two folders are <em>C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</em> or
<em>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a shortcut is added to one of these locations, it appears in the "All apps" section of the start menu. On Windows 8/8.1, a manually-added shortcut could be found by typing in the start menu search. On Windows 10, however, manually-added shortcuts can
 only be found by manually going through All apps -- that is, if one creates a shortcut called ABC.lnk, it will appear at the top of the All apps section but one will not be able to find it by typing ABC in the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching for an installed program (e.g. Firefox) will come up with a the following result: "Firefox [desktop app]", which (by right-clicking and selecting "Open file location") is located in the ProgramData start menu folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can a shortcut be manually added to All apps such that it is searchable?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same problem I've encountered. It worked perfectly in Windows 7 and 8, but unfortunately not in Windows 10. I have not found a perfect solution, but maybe my workaround works for you too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of making a shortcut to a file (or website), create one to the executable and specify the parameter. For example create a shortcut to a specific website by setting as location: ""C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" "http://support.microsoft.com/"".<br />
<br />
The location of the shortcut doesn't seem to matter, both locations seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still hope this gets fixed soon, but this might work for you too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With kind regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Switching Hard Drives between Xbox Slims</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My flatmate managed to spill liquid on her xbox slim 250Gig. We switched it off and left it for 48 hours to dry. Tried it after 48 hours and it worked fine and the hard drive was fine. 24 hours later tried to switch it on again and it wouldn't switch on,
 it would make the noise when you pressed the on button but wouldn't switch on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to buy another xbox slim tomorrow and wondered, if i put in the old hard drive will old saved games and gamertag etc still be available? Or is there a specific procedure i'll need to follow to recover them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corvidius.</p>

<p>no longer 365 days :P according to the xbox support forum support people</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Support/LicenseMigration/FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Support/LicenseMigration/FAQ</a></p>
How often can I use the tool?
<p>The tool can only be used once every 121 days.</p>
Why can I use the tool only once per 121 days?
<p>The tool is intended to allow consumers to consolidate their licenses they purchased on multiple consoles to a primary console. It is not intended to continually move content between multiple consoles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>its 121 because you need to wait till the 120th day to pass before using the tool lol</p>

<h2>            Built-In Webcam not working&#63;</h2>
                    My webcam has stopped working. I installed windows 8.1 on my laptop and since then, the webcam has not been functional. The webcam shows up as USB2.0 UVC HD Webcam in the device manager. I tried uninstalled it and it reinstalled itself but it still doesn't
 work neither on programs or on metro apps. I have an Asus AR5B225.

            <p>I'm using an Asus X452L with Windows 8.1 </p>
<p>
</p><p>In device manager the webcam is listed under Imaging Devices as USB2.0 UVC HD Webcam. The driver provider is Microsoft, driver version 6.3.9600.16384. the driver date is
<strong>21/6/2006</strong>. When I click update driver, Windows says that the best driver is already installed. There is no webcam driver from the Asus download area, but I've checked that the chipset and graphics drivers are all the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling the webcam driver and restarting Windows which made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Skype video settings, a black rectangle appears along with a loading icon as if the webcam is starting but it then disappears and reappears repeatedly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Camera app shows the text 'Camera - to get started , connect a camera.' The webcam light flashes and the text refreshes repeatedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried starting Windows in safe mode and the problem still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the hardware troubleshooter as per Method 1 above, it says 'Hardware changes might not have been detected.' Under advanced details it says: Scan for recent hardware changes - completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 says that the best driver for the device is already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<span>Are you facing this issue with Built in Webcam or is it an external Webcam?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to follow the steps below and see if the issue persists:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)"><span>Put the computer in clean boot</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A clean boot allows the Windows operating system to launch without any additional programs or services running when you turn the computer on. This allows you to determine if computer
 issues are caused by a program or service that starts up when you boot the machine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Perform a Clean Boot</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Refer:</span></strong><span>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps for clean boot refer the section<strong><span>“how
 to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>As you mentioned that the device is listed as
<strong>usb2.0 hd uvc webcam</strong>, so the issue could have occurred if the drivers are either corrupt or faulty.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps below to remove the driver and restart the system after performing these steps so that the default driver or the correct drivers are installed

            <p>Hello Shrikar,</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for such a quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find the requested details below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>What is the model number of the laptop you are facing issues with? :<strong> Asus X553MA-XX063D Notebook</strong></span></li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you facing this issue while using a specific app or is it with all applications? :
<strong>Specific app, in Facebook when I am trying to capture the profile picture it is successfully showing me and also capturing the photo. I am facing when offline I am trying to capture photo using Microsoft 'Camera' app.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you facing this issue with Built in Webcam or is it an external Webcam?:<strong>It is Built in camera(in upper section of Laptop screen there is just a point ,which is emitting light when I open camera app, there is no external
 device)</strong></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>Regarding Clean boot, I clicked on the link given by you, its taking time as I am in wireless network. Will let you know the progress later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding device driver, I already checked in the <strong>'device manager'-&gt;Imaging devices
</strong>, and it says <strong>'This device is working properly.'</strong> and also when tried to update the driver , it says most recent version is already installed. So I don't think we have any issue here. And also if I uninstall then again I need to install
 right ? Please let me know how to/from where to install the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!!!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Hafizul,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for keeping us updated on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Please provide us following information:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did&nbsp;you change your camera's&nbsp;settings?</span></li><li><span>Is the screen solid black or just very dark?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps below and see if it fixes the issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open the Camera App</span></li><li><span>Click the "camera options" button </span></li><li><span>Select "more"</span></li><li><span>Try to adjust the "brightness" moving the slider left or right</span></li><li><span>Configure the "Exposure" setting, change it from "auto" to "manual" or vice versa&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If you have more than one video input devices (e.g. a webcam and a video card), it is also possible that the wrong device is selected as default.&nbsp;When clicking "camera options" on the Camera App do you see a drop-down
 list named "video device"? If yes, select the correct device. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>I</span></strong><strong><span>mportant: </span></strong><span>Uninstalling a driver removes the faulty driver completely from the device, when you try to upgrade a device the faulty driver may not get updated with the correct version as the
 driver version still remains the same. After removing the driver Windows will automatically start searching for the most appropriate drivers and will reinstall it.</span></p>

<h2>            Laptop keeps beeping every one to two minutes</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Laptop beeping</p>
<p>What would cause my laptop to beep every one to two minutes? This is happening when my Laptop is plugged in and appears to be related to the screen brightness. With every beep the computer will decrease or increase in brightness. How can I make it stop?
 What is or could be causing this?</p>
