            Hello j_waver0000,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I would like to get some more information on what make and model of mouse you are using?&nbsp; I know you listed Trackball but I am showing several manufacturers using the name Trackball, including Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;You advised you uninstalled the drivers for the mouse, did you do this in Device Manager?&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Start-&gt; Type 'Device Manager' in search field-&gt; Select Device Manager-&gt; Select Mice and other pointing devices-&gt; Right-Click your device and select update.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If device is already updated then right-click and select 'Uninstall'.&nbsp; You might be prompted to reboot, if not right-click again on your device and select 'Install'<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If you have a Microsoft Mouse, please check this link for any additional information.&nbsp; Please let us know status.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

            <p>I have the same problem, on Win 7 x64,&nbsp;and it started around the same time as this article was posted, right after a Windows Update (which did not seem to have updated the Bluetooth driver).</p>
<p>My bluetooth mouse just stopped working and didn't show up in the Devices list.</p>
<p>After that, whenever I try to detect a bluetooth device such as a mouse it just never finds it - the Add Device screen just sits there and never discovers anything - mouse, phones, whatever (yet the phones can see each other).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the various suggestions from other threads, running fsutil and the scan thing etc, but the result is still the same when I try to install the Dell Bluetooth 375 drivers from their site - exactly as the original post described, rolls back near
 the end with the same error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried uninstalling and using the WIDCOMM drivers but they complain that there's an old version of the drivers that needs to be uninstalled first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I reboot, Windows Update installs a generic Microsoft bluetooth driver. However, it doesn't work either&nbsp;-&nbsp;same thing with no devices being detected although the BT service is running and the hardware (internal) is definitely switched on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a VERY large number of threads on this problem on the net, I think it's time Microsoft took this seriously and produced a fix.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail Opens up 32 bit, instead of 64 bit IE9</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
How do I configure Windows Live Mail?

<div><b>Please provide your impacted Email address : </b></div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Mail are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
Ever since I bought my new compaq, I have had problems with Windows 7, Windows Live Mail, not opening up url links within emails. I just determined, that Windows Live Mail, is opeing up the new window in 32 bit, rather than 64 bit. I called compaq, and they
 resolved part of the beginning issue, where I couldn't open up, some urls. But now I see the problem is not IE9 per se, but the two in combination don't want to open up url links. So, what's the answer. I do like using Windows Live, but if it keeps up, then
 I will have to revert back to using AT&amp;T Mail Service. Compaq also, downloaded Mozilla to use as the explorer. The technician discovered the computer had both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of internet explorer 9 on this compaq, Model CQ2014PC.</p>

            I have tried your solution, but that doesn't work.&nbsp; What I have discovered is if you open up, Internet Explorer 9 64 bit first, then Windows Live Mail, will then also open up in 64 bit, and any links chosen from emails.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you open up Windows Live first,
 then it chooses 32 bit, and won't allow url's on webpages, to open up such as foodnetwork.com "recipe of the day"&nbsp; print mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or inbox dollars.com&nbsp; "view this email message", and then "confirm this paid message".&nbsp; These are the problems with the combination
 of IE9 and Windows Live Mail.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess Microsoft needs to resolve this with an update.

            Hello <span>RobMcK222,<br />
<br />
<span>It is possible that the issue was caused by a corrupted program file in Windows Live Mail client installed in your desktop. Kindly repair Windows Live Mail by following the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Go to Control Panel.<br />
2. Under Programs, click <b>Uninstall a Program.<br />
</b>3. Locate Windows Live Essential 2011 then click <b>Uninstall/Change.<br />
</b>4. When a window appears, select <b>Repair all Windows Live programs.<br />
</b>5. Restart your computer after the repair.<br />
<br />
<p><span>If the issue persists, kindly provide us the following information listed below for us to isolate the issue:
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>How long this issue has been going on?
</span></li><li><span>Is this issue constant or intermittent?
</span></li><li><span>Have you checked if your Firewall is enabled?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Thanks,<br />
Windows Live Ken C.<br />

            I tried your solution, and the problem still continues.&nbsp; I uninstalled Windows Live Essentials, and reinstalled it all.&nbsp; I did try to do the fix mode, option first.&nbsp; Again, this problem has been going on since I bought this new computer, in Dec 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Compaq CQ2014PC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, when you open up Windows mail first, it defaults to 32 bit.&nbsp; When you open up IE9 first, then open windows mail, then all the links within the emails, will then open up in 64 bit.&nbsp;
<br />
So answering your questions:<br />
<br />
1. How long has it been happening.&nbsp; Ever since I got this computer.<br />
2. It is constant, unless you do the beforementioned.&nbsp; Opeing up IE9 first.<br />
3. Firewall is on.

<p>Hi <span>RobMcK222,<br />
<br />
May we ask for a Fiddler trace log for us to better understand what happens within Windows Live Mail whenever you try to click a link on an email.<br />
<br />
</span>How to gather Fiddler trace log:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the file from this <a href="http://windowslivehelp.com/thread.aspx?threadid=2437d07f-c343-4ee2-b614-0b5b3901bbba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>and save it to your desktop. </li><li>Once the installer has finished downloading, double click on “FiddlerCapSetup.exe” on your desktop.
</li><li>Click “Install”. </li><li>Once installed, click “Close”. FiddlerCap will now open automatically. Note: In Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems, you may be asked to run the file, in which case you must run the file.
</li><li>Close all browsers, e-mail applications that use HTTP protocol (ex. Outlook Express etc.) including any other program that connects to the Internet.
</li><li>Click “1. Start Capture”. You might want to disable your firewall or allow Fiddler Cap within the firewall so that the traffic can be captured.
</li><li>Reproduce the issue/workaround you are having. We need one log for when Windows Live Mail defaults to IE 32 bit and one log where you have IE 64 bit initially opened.
</li><li>Once completed, go back to the FiddlerCap window and select “2. Stop Capture”.
</li><li>Click on “3. Save Capture”, which will open the save file menu. </li><li>Click the “Save” button to save the capture file to your desktop. </li><li>You can uninstall FiddlerCap by going to Control Panel and selecting Add/Remove Programs or Programs and Features.
</li></ol>
<p>A private area just below this post has been provided for you to upload the log file. You need to be signed it to see it.
<br />

            Since the fiddler program also defaults to 32 bit, IE9, the problem should be apparent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this happens, you can't show when it works. As I mentioned before, if I open IE9 64 bit first, then Windows Live will also work, and the links, within the emails
 will open up in 64 bit format, allowiing me to click on links, such as the print command on foodnetwork.com "recipe of the day",&nbsp; and a survey called inboxdollars&nbsp;email, where the first link is "view this paid emai", which opens up another webpage, with a
 link to "confirm this paid email."&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to currentely reset the computer now, to get it back to working for Windows Live, it seems to only want to open up 32 bit webpages.&nbsp;
<br />
Thanks for trying to resolve this isssue.

            @Rob<br />
<br />
Windows Live Mail will use a Windows function to invoke the default browser to open a link to a web page if no browser is running. You cannot set IE9 64-bit as the default browser, so what you're trying to do can't be done. However, there is no such thing as
 a '32 bit webpage'. <br />
<br />
Your problem is not with Windows Live Mail; it's with IE. You most probably have software that is interfering with&nbsp;the proper functioning of the 32-bit version. You should first confirm that this is the case by disabling all such software and then&nbsp;try to establish
 what software is involved. Open IE9 32-bit in <em>No Add-ons </em>mode and then visit the problem sites to check whether they work properly. To do so, click Start &gt; All programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System tools &gt; Internet Explorer (No Add-ons). If the sites now
 work properly, you can be sure that some add-on is responsible. You'll get help with troubleshooting in the Internet Explorer forum:<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie9-windows_7?tab=all&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When you do ask your question there, don't mention Windows Live Mail; explain how pages that work properly in the 64-bit browser don't do so in the 32-bit browser, and give links to the pages involved. Otherwise, you may simply be advised to come back here
 to ask your question - as I said, it has nothing to do with Windows Live Mail. Get IE working properly first, and you'll find that the problem is solved in Windows Live Mail.<br />

<h2>            Window 8.1 Update Messed Up My Desktop View</h2>
                    I recently downloaded the new 8.1 update and everything seems to work, except for some reason certain windows are now blurred and unclear when on the desktop. Some of these include Google Chrome (desktop mode), iTunes, and download set-up windows. I know
 I can uninstall the update but I like the other changes it includes and I don't want to have to essentially do a hard reboot and delete all my downloaded apps and personalized settings.

<h2>            Xbox Settings say console is connected, but won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t sign in to XBL</h2>
                    
<p>I have 2 Xbox Ones. One of them is connected to Xbox Live just fine, however the other will not connect. I checked the Network Settings and tested my connection and the console says I'm connected and all services are available. But the home screen says I'm
 not connected and when I select "Connect to Xbox Live" nothing happens.</p>
<p>I've performed the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>- Cold booted the console</p>
<p>- Power cycled modem</p>
<p>- Changed ethernet ports</p>

<p>I feel I've done everything short of a factory reset. Any suggestions that will keep me from needing to do that are much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>@Bimnog Thanks for trying, but I'm afraid this didn't work. Just did what said it does after a while of playing.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was luck, but it seemed to last longer to happen though.</p>

<h2>            WLM2012 Upgrades Not supported by Microsoft due to their Forced Upgrade Policy Use to Win 10&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Complaint to Microsoft and its Outlook.com Team!!!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Support your&nbsp;***** Program or Windows Live Mail 2012 for Win 7 and Win 10!!!!</div>
<div>How can you justify not supporting and changing WLM2012 to work with the new Outlook.com or protocol??? I don't want to use the degraded Outlook Web Version on any web Browser!!!!!!&nbsp; Why are you using this change or non-support of Win 7 and WLM2012 to
 force Users to upgrade to Win 10????&nbsp; This is unfair and totally goes against promised User Support for Win 7 and WLM2012!!!!&nbsp; Its an asinine forced change ( I paid MS for Hotmail.com Use!!!!!) on your long time Users of WLM2012 and Win 7, just to force Win
 7 Users to upgrade to Win 10!!!!! Any Web version of Outlook is a mush degraded and slower version from WLM2012 and you or MS knows this!&nbsp; Why not be fair to all your current Win 7&nbsp; Users and just Upgrade WLF2012 to work with your new Protocol, which you are
 supposed to support much longer on Win 7 and on Win 10???&nbsp; I will now not ever Upgrade to Win 10 and will Post this Complaint everywhere I can, ie, Facebook and on Web Browsers and in Forums!&nbsp; You have pissed off too many people who depend on and have depended
 on and use WLM2012 with Win 7 and also Win 10, if you would just upgrade WLM2012 to work with both!!&nbsp; I tried and hate the new Mail App in Win 10 as it Sucks and I won't be forced to buy Office 365 Personal just to use its Email App!!!! Upgrade WLM2012 and
 STOP this crazy action to **** off all or very many Win 7 OS Users!!!!!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Your Emailed Notice of Doom follows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>From: Outlook&nbsp;&nbsp; (5 May 2016 Notice of Doom from MS’ Outlook Team to Win 7 Users, if you don't Upgrade to Win 10 or Office 365 Personal for their Email Apps that I don’t want)&nbsp; Don’t fix something that isn’t broke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;
 At least don’t harm your current Users of Win 7 by not supporting WLM2012 with updates!!!!!!!!!!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Action required for users of Windows Live Mail 2012&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Dear User,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Earlier this year we introduced a new Outl‍ook‍.‍com that will help you collaborate with others, focus on what matters, and get more done. The new Outlo‍ok‍.‍com delivers an exciting set of new experiences across web, phone, and desktop, and we’re eager
 for you to start using it.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;It appears that you are currently using Windows Live Mail 2012 to connect to your Out‍look‍.‍com account. Windows Live Mail 2012 does not support the synchronization technologies used by the new Outl‍ook‍.‍com. When account upgrades begin at the end of
 June, you will no longer be able to receive email sent to your Out‍look‍.‍com account in Windows Live Mail 2012. Rest assured, you can always access your email by logging into Out‍look‍.‍com from any web browser, and you will continue to have access to all
 your data that is currently in Windows Live Mail 2012.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;If you currently use Windows Live Mail 2012, we recommend that you switch to the Mail app in Windows to‍day. The Mail app is built in to Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10, and has a more modern design. To begin using it, simply launch the app and add your
 Out‍look‍.‍com account.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;If you are using Windows 7, you can upgrade to a newer version of Windows to enjoy the Mail app and the other benefits. If you do not wish to upgrade, you can access your account via a web browser, or, you can take advantage of a free one-year subscription
 of Office 365 Personal, and use Outl‍ook 2016 to connect to your account.* This Off‍ice 365 subscription also includes other productivity applications such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel. It works on Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, and Windows 10.&nbsp;
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Please take action before Ju‍ne 30th, 2016, which is when we’ll begin upgrading accounts that currently use Windows Live Mail 2012. If you have more questions, please find answers to common FAQs in this help article, or you can contact Microsoft support.&nbsp;
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;We recognize that changes like this can be difficult, and apologize for any inconvenience this causes you. We hope that you’ll enjoy the benefits of moving to the new Outl‍ook‍.‍com.&nbsp;
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Sincerely,</div>
<div>Outl‍ook‍.‍com team&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>

            <p>What if we download Windows Essentials 2016?&nbsp; Would that include Windows Live Mail, with all the features that we enjoy with&nbsp;Windows Live Mail 2012?&nbsp; Or would it look just like Microsoft Outlook?&nbsp; Or would it only be compatible with Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone could show me what Windows Essentials 2016 looks like, and tell me whether or not it's compatible with Windows 7,&nbsp;without me having to download it to find out, that would be immensely helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not okay with this change either.&nbsp; I don't want to access my email through a browser, and I really don't want to have to go from page to page to look at all my emails.&nbsp; I like my email as it is, thank you very much, and I need some advice for what I
 can do to keep it that way.&nbsp; Don't tell me to access my email through a browser.&nbsp; That is NOT an adequate solution.&nbsp; This change is NOT OKAY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time I checked, the United States was supposedly still a first world country, with a free market, which means that business are supposed to give the customers what they want and need, not the other way around.&nbsp; So why does Microsoft think it's okay
 for them to tell us what we're supposed to want?&nbsp; Obviously they need some more competition.&nbsp; They've had a virtual monopoly on the computer industry (at least where laptops and desktops are concerned) for too long, and it's going to their head.&nbsp; Someone needs
 to come along and put them in their place.&nbsp; They've become too arrogant and need to be taken down a notch or two.</p>

            <p>Teresa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well said, so hope Microsoft is listening, but it doesn't even reply to inquires or discussions&nbsp;on this MS Community Forum or even monitor it that I know of!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never heard of Windows Essentials 2016, does it exist??&nbsp; Maybe its available for Win 10, but it certainly doesn't have an upgraded version of WLM2012 as you can see in their Email!!&nbsp; WLM2012 is a very fast and efficient and matured&nbsp;Email App that always
 worked great with Hotmail (now called Outlook)&nbsp;and Other emails like Gmail and Yahoo, but now Microsoft has decided to not keep it updated so that it will work with their coming new Hotmail or Outlook email Protocol?? They have a new and buggy Mail or Email
 App built into Win 10 that they say you have to upgrade to Win 10 to use because WLM2012 won't work with their new Protocol, and Win 10 Mail won't work on Win 7???&nbsp; All they had to do is keep supporting WLM2012 with normal updates so that it would keep working,
 but NO they are just using it to force you to Update to Win 10 by not updating WLM2012????&nbsp; This is totally strange behavior or behavior of an arrogant&nbsp;Monopolist, which Microsoft has become!!&nbsp; No one wants to use Hotmail or Outlook on a Browser platform,
 which is slower and less secure with fewer features, or be forced to buy their Office 365 Suite to use its new or similar new Mail App, or be forced to Upgrade to Win 10 as MS is trying to do or use it as a tool to get Users to Upgrade to Win 10!!!!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft&nbsp;just needs to keep supporting or support&nbsp;WLM2012 and issue normal upgrades for it as they do for all their other Apps in Win 7 or Vista!!&nbsp; They are violating their promise or contract to support previous OSs and Apps by following this insane policy
 of discarding support for them in order to force you to their new OS or Win 10!&nbsp; WLM2012 may still work with Gmail or Yahoo email after 30 June 2016, but who will keep using it if it doesn't support its own main email sources or Hotmail and Outlook???&nbsp; Microsoft
 has overstepped its authority and good sense by resorting to Monopolist policies or bullying policies and tactics&nbsp;by not supporting current Apps for Win 7&nbsp;and using this nonsupport to force Users to Upgrade to Win 10 and new Apps only available on Win 10 or
 in Office 365 Personal that you have to buy to use its email App!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users only Options (it seems)&nbsp;are to go to the MAC OS or a Linex OS, if MS does not change its policies and support&nbsp; all of its own OSs and Apps&nbsp;like it used too!!!!!&nbsp; They have become overly greedy and arrogant, but they really don't have a true monopoly
 now with Smart Phone availability and all its Apps and MAC &amp; Linex availability!!!&nbsp; What are they thinking, to act so arrogantly???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft had better listen to its Customers, or it won't have any left soon!!!!!</p>

            <p>Thanks for understanding where I'm coming from.&nbsp; I've just been informed that there is no Windows Essentials 2016, although there I saw something online that looked like it.&nbsp; But it wasn't on a Microsoft webpage, which I understand is a big red flag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe Linux will be the way to go.&nbsp; I wonder what their operating systems are like.&nbsp; I wonder if I could have an email program on one of their computers that would resemble&nbsp;Windows Live Mail, or would at least have all the features that Windows Live Mail
 has that I have come to enjoy.&nbsp; I have a friend who knows a lot about Linux computers, and I'll see what I can find out from him.</p>

<p>This Email App seems to be a good or great Option to replace WLM2012, if it works with or supports the new Outlook Protocol or ActiveSync I believe they call it!&nbsp; Sorry Microsoft, your Scheme or lack of&nbsp;User support for your own Users and email App&nbsp;is doomed
 to fail, much to your deterrence and desire to control your Users or to force them into an Upgrade to Win 10, etc!&nbsp; This very good Alternate email Client for Win OSs&nbsp;should convince you that your scheme won't work!</p>

</p><p>I reject your statement that they were duplicates, as they were under different Categories listed in this Forum!!&nbsp; This is a very important Issue and Subject and I should be allowed to Post similar Posts under different Subjects and Categories in order to
 reach additional Users having the same Issue as it affects more than one Category!&nbsp; Request you restore all the deleted Posts and/or more effectively explain why I cannot Post the same Issue under different subjects such as Windows and Outlook, etc, as the
 Issue is not a narrow one????&nbsp; You should have at least had the curtsey to ask first about what my intent was, before taking such drastic action???&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Possibility of Sidetone on Xbox One Stereo Headset&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sigmund  say:</h3>
<h2>            Possibility of Sidetone on Xbox One Stereo Headset&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>After a moderate amount of shopping around last summer, I picked up the Xbox One Stereo Headset. &nbsp;It seemed like the sweet spot of price and performance for me, and I'm happy to say that it turned out to be a mostly positive experience. &nbsp;(The headset adapter
 that came with it stopped working, and I needed to replace it out of warranty, but that's another issue.)</p>
<p>However, when I first bought the headset, I wasn't playing a lot of online games. &nbsp;Recently, I've started playing a lot more Destiny, and I've been using the headset to chat with friends while playing. &nbsp;This is when I realized I have one fairly major problem
 with this headset. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There's no "sidetone" or "mic monitor" feature, so I can't hear myself speaking with the headphones on. &nbsp;I really don't like that.</p>
<p>I know I'm not the only person that would like this feature. &nbsp;Is there any chance that this feature could be added in a future controller firmware update? &nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, does anyone know of any good 3rd party adapters that would perform a sidetone mix from the microphone back to the headset? &nbsp;(I really don't like that idea.)</p>
<p>Sigmund&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why are there so many, and so frequent updates to Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I use Windows 7 at work and at home.&nbsp; At work, we have to have the automatic updates turned on.&nbsp; At home I have turned off this feature.&nbsp; Please do not lecture me on why this is necessary, it will not change my mind.
<br />
<br />
My question is why there are so frequent updates for Windows 7?&nbsp; Not only are they almost weekly in occurrence, they install thousands of files each time, take a long time to download, and take a long time to 'configure' when I next turn on my computer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Are details regarding these updates available anywhere so I can possibly understand why there need to be so many of them?
<br />
<br />
If an operating system is coded correctly, and you're not using any built in virus protection or firewalls, why are updates required on a near weekly basis?<br />
<br />
Please, someone enlighten me.&nbsp; <br />

You're done.&nbsp; If nothing will change your mind, why bother?</p>
<p>Updates are released because there is always someone trying to circumvent something so they can control things that are not theirs.&nbsp; Also because there isn't anything perfect out there and software and hardware is always changing, growing, becoming more
 effective (or that is the idea.)</p>
<p>They are essentially on a monthly schedule (every second Tuesday) for the operating system.&nbsp; It has been this way for years.&nbsp; Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7.</p>
<p>What is "coded correctly" in your opinion?&nbsp; Are you saying you have the answer to a perfect operating system and you just don't want to share?&nbsp; Something that will never have to change and is perfectly adaptable and fully functional for 7 billion people
 and millions upon millions of hardware configurations?</p>
<p>How cool.</p>

<p>If you are *not* using any antivirus and firewall protection on top of&nbsp;ignoring patching...&nbsp; Ouch! That's what you asked...&nbsp; "If an operating system is coded correctly, and you're not using any built in virus protection or firewalls, why are updates required
 on a near weekly basis?" - and it's not 'nearly weekly'.&nbsp; Sometimes there are early releases and there are some other patches released at the end of some months (or revisions of some previously released patches to correct issues they may have caused.)</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Updates can be a bit of a pain, but it's a lot more painful if you DON'T apply them and you get hit by a virus, hacker, identity thief, or other nefarious action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;You want enlightenment?&nbsp; Try writing a few billion lines of programming and send it out to billions of users and see how "correctly coded" your operating system is.&nbsp; A billion is 1,000,000,000 or 1000 times 1000 times 1000. &nbsp;To say your post was naive would
 be like saying an H-bomb produces a bit of heat!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you want to find out what these updates do, just click on the Frequently Asked Questions text or one of the "More Information" buttons from the Windows Update window.&nbsp; For example see this one:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2709981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2709981</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you're still unconvinced, you might want to apply the same approach in other areas to be consistent, maybe you'd want to cancel all your insurance policies, get rid of your spare tire, and never pay any attention to other drivers on the road.&nbsp; That would
 be consistent with your posted philosophy about Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Rundll32 stopped working and not showing in Task Manager&#58; which software recommended on these threads should be used&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I started having Windows Vista issues when trying to save files in different directories or as jpegs in PowerPoint (system closed down). I tried the suggestions made in the PowerPoint
 forum (see link below) but they didn't resolve the issue and it spread to Word and Excel.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/pptcreate/thread/52cd5e3d-1821-46ce-a2ff-72a1199aedb4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/pptcreate/thread/52cd5e3d-1821-46ce-a2ff-72a1199aedb4</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now all Office programs, Outlook and Control Panel are closing down and saying 'Windows host process (Rundll32) has stopped working'.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I checked Task Manager but rundll32 is not listed there, although it is in the System32 sub-directory.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I've tried using the suggestions in this thread.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaperformance/thread/6bbe93b4-8e49-432f-9733-d972571fd3c7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaperformance/thread/6bbe93b4-8e49-432f-9733-d972571fd3c7/</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The disk scan (sfc /scannow) found corrupt files but was unable to fix them. I can't open the CBS log because it says I don't have access (even though I'm the admin).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The CheckDisk from reboot says that the system is clean.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I've read the instructions for performing a Vista clean boot but the process of unchecking each Service entry until the problem is fixed seems quite lengthy, and still might not
 fix the problem. Also, the explanation is not too clear about clicking 'Disable All': will this remove the ability to use restore function or not? I can't&nbsp;make that out and so reluctant to try this without knowing for sure.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My anti-malware software can’t find any issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have restored my system to four weeks ago and the issue still remains.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have sent details of all crashes (560 in total) to Microsoft via the ‘report problem’ function but the system says there are no solutions at this time.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have a feeling that a trial run of Uniblue’s Registry Booster (when it removed 15 entries but didn’t tell me which ones) may have kicked off the issue but I can’t be sure.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any further suggestions would be gratefully received.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks, Temp.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Thanks for this although I would have prefered my final post to have been left in the Performance forum (where most rundll32 issues are answered) and the first three posts removed altogether to avoid duplication and avoid confusion. Is this possible?</p>
<p>Also, how will the clean boot process identify which element the Registry Booster software removed from the registry? I don't want to spend hours going through a process of elimination on 140 Services if it is not going to highlight this issue.</p>
<p>I have gone through the first step of the clean boot and the problem still exists.</p>

<p><span>Hi Temp,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you mentioned I have removed your old (first three) posts and moved this one to performance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 service pack is installed on the computer?</span></p>

 the issue occur with any other application apart from the office applications?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check Event Viewer for more details about the
 problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

When Rundll32.exe crashes, Windows Error Reporting Service [1] creates a dmp file under C:\Localdumps. Please upload the dump (zip it first) to your public Skydrive [2] folder and post the link here. I take a look at the dump with the Debugger, maybe I can
 see the cause.<br />

<h2>            Cortana can&#39;t set Reminders, Access Calendar, Send Email</h2>
                    I&nbsp;am on build 10525 and on my primary desktop PC, Cortana stopped working every time I issue a command that accesses my account. For example the command, "what's the weather tomorrow" works but&nbsp;anything that has to do with accessing my personal info stopped
 working like "what's on my calendar today" or "remind me to do laundry in 10 minutes" and she just brings up "No results found for....". I have reset my PC already and it's still broken. The reminders is the feature I used the most and for it to stop working
 all of a sudden is really really frustrating. I have tried everything to get this working again like resetting my PC, reinstalling language packs, etc but so far nothing worked. Between this and my lumia 1520 constantly freezing makes me want to jump ship
 to Apple. Has anyone here experienced the same issue? I would like to avoid doing another clean install.

            <p>Hi Jose,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you get any error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may be due to the corrupted files present in your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Performing <strong>SFC scan </strong>and <strong>DISM scan
</strong>will help you repair the corrupted files in your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To perform <strong>SFC</strong> scan, follow the link below:</span></p>

Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Check to make sure the above command ran, shows a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt,</p>
<ol>
<li>If you see a red error, then the command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be a larger problem with Windows 10. Try again.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Check the issue is resolved.</p>
<ol>
<li>If not, restart the PC. In this case try as a new Administrator user account.
</li></ol>

            <p>None of the solutions I've tried worked. The only thing that worked is a complete clean install. Not even a reset solve my issue. Doing a clean install helped me understand what caused the issue. The issue occurs after upgrading to a new build. As soon as
 I upgrade to a new build, Cortana stops working and as soon as I roll back to a previous build, she starts working again. I sure hope I won't have to do a clean install again to upgrade to newer builds in the future!!</p>

<h2>            Windows update is stalled or moving very slow</h2>
                    I have windows 10 on my laptop. &nbsp;It has been installing updates for 2 days or more. &nbsp;The green bar or blue bar is barely moving. &nbsp;It has been on 41% since yesterday. &nbsp;What is wrong or what can I do to get this update. installed? It has never taken this
 long. &nbsp;It's usually quick.

            <p>gupdate is Google Updater. I think this is a known problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KB2505454 is a Hotfix for slow startup with disks over 2TB.</p>

<p>I don't think this has been distributed through&nbsp;Windows Update yet. Did you download some updates from your computer's manufacturer or elsewhere?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does KB2505454 show up in Installed updates (not Update History). That error code can indicate the update is already installed.</p>

            <p>It's not recommended to install Hotfixes unless you are experiencing the problem they fix but if you have installed it I should leave it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this was bundled up with drivers you downloaded. I don't think you need to take any action.</p>

<h2>            Oneguide not working</h2>
                    
<p>Everything on my Xbox One was working fine until today. I went to use my TV today and it started setup for me, on to the screen where it says "Looking for your TV picture", after a few seconds I can hear sound through my cablebox but no video. I select skip
 and it shows me the Xbox One remote and says to press X, but that doesn't work. I select Next then I can watch Live TV, but there is no ONEGUIDE. &nbsp;When I select it the screen is blank and says "favorite", App channels" and "watch TV" on the left side. I've
 tried resarting and powering down. Nothing worked. i also noticed i cannot switch my audio reciever in the menu, there was an option to select the make and model of my reciever, it's not there anymore</p>

    <title>Unwanted Services - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mechtek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unwanted Services</h2>
                    
<p>After checking my bank account activity last week, I noticed that i had been charged for a subscription to xbox music. This is a service offered by xbox that not only was i unaware had been activated by someone other than me, it is a service that i do not
 want, that i do not use, and that I do not want to pay for. I contacted xbox live support only to be told that there was nothing that they could about the charge as the charge did not meet the policy requirements that alow a refund to be made. As a matter
 of fact, I was told that a refund would have been possible IF I was at least a 3-month xbox live gold subscription holder. However, because i am a month to month subscription holder who ACTUALLY PAYS MORE MONEY TO XBOX than a 3 month subscription holder, a
 refund was not possible. So in conclusion, not all gold subscription holders are treated equally. More upsetting than this is the pure and simple principle of the matter that i am being forced to pay for something i do not want by this company, as they refuse
 to refund the charge or do anything about it. This company would, quite surprisingly, rather lose me as a monthly paying customer and all of my future business, than to refund a charge of $10.89 for something the customer does not want. Xbox did absolutely
 nothing to try and resolve the issue or to make me a happy customer. If they could not remove the charge, then they could have done something to compensate for it, such as a free 1 month membership, a free movie pass, or anything really. I work with a business
 that will give customers half off their entire bill plus a voucher for free products and services on the persons next visit just to keep that customer happy and coming back to spend more money. It really escapes my comprehension of how a company will refuse
 to do something, anything, for a loyal customer of many years, causing them to lose that customer and all future revenue that customer would have spent. Plain and simple,&nbsp; Xbox does not have good business practices when it comes to customer support. They really
 messed up on this situation, which should have been seen as an opportunity for Xbox to show they have great customer service and that they value their customers. I no longer feel that I can do business with Xbox and they will never recieve any money from me
 ever again. I really hope that $10.89 was worth the loss of more than just 1 customer, Xbox Associates, because for me its not about the money, its about the principal. BAD BUSINESS!!</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            Hi Tristan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did this begin after a Version Update, as there are reports of right click failures after version update which are addressed here:
<br /><a href="https://www.winhelponline.com/xp/slowrightclick.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.winhelponline.com/xp/slowrightclick...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise the Can't reach this page  error is handled here:

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Feature Pack kb2932046 &#40;part of kb2919355&#41; won&#39;t install</h2>
                    Tried downloading 8.1 update via Windows update on 8 March and kb2919355 failed to load citing corrupt or missing file. Went to Microsoft Download center and searched for kb2919355 which brought up several sub files. I was able to successfully download
 and install all but the kb2932046 . Any idea on how to get it to install?&nbsp; I am on an original Windows 7 32 bit computer which has been upgraded to Windows 8 Pro with Media Center and then to Windows 8.1, all via download. I thus have no DVD, USB etc to do
 a refresh, which I don't wish to do anyway. I've already tried the Updater Tool Fix and the DISM procedures suggested by Windows Update&nbsp;with no luck. As far as I know, I've not moved any directories. Any help appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.

How to install Windows 8.1 Update manually or using Windows Update
</p><div><span>Technical Level</span><span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;</span><span>Intermediate</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Summary
<div>Windows 8.1 Update&nbsp;continues Microsoft’s refinement of its current version of Windows, presenting even greater accessibility to functionality such as Power and Search once hidden in hot corners and menus. Other
 noticeable changes include title bars, minimize and close buttons now available in modern apps. Another great feature includes the ability to pin your favourite modern apps to the Windows Taskbar. Lets take a quick look at getting it up and running on a Windows
 8.1 install.</div>
Details
<div>
<p>Please note, before you can install this update, you need to first ensure you Windows 8.1 installed. If you have Windows 8 which was launched in October 2012, this update will not apply to you. If you want to take advantage of the improvements offered in
 the Windows 8.1 Update, see instructions at the following link how to upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/how-to-upgrade-from-windows-8-to-windows-8-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/how-to-upgrade-from-windows-8-to-windows-8-1/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Backup:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a precaution, you should backup your computer.</p>
<p>See the following How To Geek article about how to do so:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/167984/how-to-create-and-restore-system-image-backups-on-windows-8.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/167984/how-to-create-and-restore-system-image-backups-on-windows-8.1/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, this is standalone Windows Update installers I am using which requires installation in a specific order. On April 8th, Windows Update will take care of this, but for this article sake, I will describe the experience. Depended on your system,
 Windows 8.1 Update 1 is provided as 6 updates, in my case, I only needed to apply 5, since
<em>KB2919442</em> was already installed. </p>

<p>The biggest one of them all is KB2919355, which took quite a while to install. In fact, I did this on my work computer around 3:30 PM and I leave work at 4:30, KB2919355 took about 30 minutes be completed and required a reboot. I recommend you do this at
 a convenient time. </p>

            <p>I have the prerequisite KB2919442 installed. I have followed the options described in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/windows-update-error-0x80073712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/windows-update-error-0x80073712</a> but KB2919355 still will not install. The error code is not always the same: I have had 8007312, 800F0902 and&nbsp;80070005.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am down to trying a "refresh" on my PC, so if there is a better way to resolve this issue, I would very much lie to hear it. I have two other Windows 8.1 PC's in the house both of which updated without problem.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to me Andre. As for your response, the first&nbsp;four&nbsp;times the update failed was using Windows Update. Can I assume Windows Update will have tried to install it in the right order? The prerequisite KB2919442 was installed on March
 12th, using Windows Update, so I assume that one was OK as well. I did not try to hack it&nbsp;in any way; I searched on line for solutions and found your post from someone else with this problem.&nbsp;I did try installing the update in the order you suggested and it
 still failed &nbsp;KB2919355. So, no attempt made to install in the wrong order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, this is not good at all! For Microsoft to issue an update <strong>on which the ability to get any future updates depends</strong>, without the install being absolutely guaranteed, is not good enough. This is not the only thread with this problem,
 so I am not the only person with the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be gratefully accepted.</p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry to try to understand, KB2919355 will not install on my Dell Inpresion 660 8.1 64bit system. When I try to it just hangs up hrs. Windows Standalone installer package, says not compatable for this system.&nbsp; Kb2919442 was auto updated (installed)
 3/28&nbsp; So is my problem that KB2919355 will not install is because KB2919442 is already in the system, I had Remote Accest from Microsoft Assure look at it no, luck, I had Dell tech support try to install w/ remote also no luck, New program from Dell, Click
 to fix installed from Dell, which said download was checked and completed still not showing up in system. MS and Dell checked for proper ver. of&nbsp;system,&nbsp; Why standalone installer not right for system 8.1 64x or bit I don't know? Can I download on flash drive
 and copy or move?&nbsp; Where and how if possible? Please help, &nbsp;many treads of this problem,&nbsp;I'm not a PC geek and don't where else to go. Thank You.

            <p>From your recommended install order, I have numbers&nbsp;1, 2, 4, and 5 installed and all of the advertised new Windows 8.1 Update1 features seem to be working just fine. I know 3, 4, and 5 are feature or supplement packages so I suspect their order of installation
 doesn't matter. Can you tell me exactly what features 3 (kb2932046) is supposed to provide? I do not have a touch screen, so I'm guessing it has something to do with that, otherwise I would be having problems. Will I be able to get new updates next month if
 that file is not installed? If yes, then I'll just hide the update and be done with it.</p>
<p>

            I have been having the same problem with downloading KB2919355.&nbsp; My KB2919442 was automatically downloaded with Windows Automatic Updates on March 15, 2014.&nbsp; I have tried to uninstall it so that I could download KB2919355, but the Control Panel will not
 let me.&nbsp;&nbsp;An attempt to uninstall it through the Command Prompt (Admin) resulted in the message "Update for Microsoft Windows&nbsp;(KB2919442) is required by your computer and cannot be uninstalled."&nbsp; (By the way, I have a Windows 8.1 Update x64 on my system.)

            Quick question:&nbsp; Could an error in the code of KB2919442 (released before April 8, 2014)&nbsp;be causing the 80070020 and&nbsp;80073712 error codes when downloading and/or installing KB2919355?&nbsp;

            <p>Just to let Microsoft know, as requested,&nbsp;that my questions still have not been answered. I have tried hints in this thread as well as those in the other thread dealing with kb2919355 and error code 80073712. My computer does appear to be running all of
 the advertised updates using mouse and keyboard even though the Feature Pack kb2932046 is not installed. I suspect kb2932046 applies to touch screens and since I do not have one, that particular kb is not necessary for me? I would still like to get it installed
 in case it's needed for future updates/patches starting May. kb2932046 appears to install but at the very end it says "failed." I am "really" dating myself, but I seem to remember a similar situation where a file would be read from or saved to a cassette tape
 and it would fail due to a "check sum?" error. Could there be a similar situation here where a byte/bit is somehow getting dropped or missed? And yes, I did say cassette tape. TRS-80 era :-)</p>
