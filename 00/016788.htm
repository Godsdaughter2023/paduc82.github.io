<h2>            Copy a word table into excel and maintaining table&#39;s dimension</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When copying a table from word into excel (both 2007) each cell that contains a few paragrphs is devided into seperate cells. I need that not to happen.</p>
<p>Meaning a table 3*3 in word should stay 3*3 in excel. If the cell content has a few paragraphs I would like it to stay that way in excel.</p>
<p>Can it be done?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Tamir</p>

<p>Select the table in Word.</p>
<p>Press Ctrl+H to activate the Replace dialog.</p>
<p>Enter ^p (the code for the paragraph mark) in the Find what box.</p>
<p>Enter some unique dummy text in the Replace with box, e.g. @@@@.</p>
<p>Click Replace All (do not continue to the rest of the document).</p>
<p>Copy the table, then paste it into Excel.</p>
<p>With the pasted table still selected, press Ctrl+H to activate the Replace dialog.</p>
<p>Enter the dummy text (in this example @@@@) in the Find what box.</p>
<p>Click in the Replace with box and press Alt+0010 with the digits on the numeric keypad.</p>
<p>Click Replace All.</p>
<p>You now have multiple lines in the cells.</p>
<p>You can go back to word and Undo the replacement there.</p>

<h2>            No right click on the Recycle bin &#40;it crashes explorer&#41;</h2>
                    Every time I try to right click on the recycle bin (from the desktop or the file explorer) it crashes the desktop and any open explorer windows. I'm glad it only takes half a second to refresh the desktop but you have to open the recycle bin to empty it.

<h2>            Need Product Key to Install Office 2000 Small Business</h2>
                    
<p>I accidentally uninstalled Office 2003 Standard Edition.&nbsp; I have the Discs, but in order to install on my computer, I need to have Office 2000 on my system---and I don't currently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the Discs for Office 2000 Small Business, but I can't install because I can't find paperwork with the Product Key.&nbsp; Can anyone help me with this?</p>
<p>(I know this is really outdated software.&nbsp; I will be getting a new computer in a few months---but for now, I need my current computer to work!)</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            I finally got Office 2003 re-installed! The first 3 times I tried, when prompted I put in Disc 1 of Office 2000---because I assumed that is what I was supposed to do. After your answer, I decided I had better try using Disc 2 of Office 2000 in case that
 made a differece---and it did. Disc 2 made the installation work, where disc 1 did not. This still does not seem right to me, but I should have tried both discs before bothering anyone. Thanks again for your help!

    <title>Problem with modern views in SharePoint Online list - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with modern views in SharePoint Online list</h2>
                    <p>I have been created lists from the Tasks list type and using new (modern) experience with no issues, until today.&nbsp; When I created a list using the Tasks list type as the base today I am having problems.&nbsp; Below are the steps I follow and the end result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Create a list based on the Tasks list type</li><li>Change the columns to what I need for the list</li><li>Set the list to use new experience (not classic)</li><li>Setup the views for the list</li></ol>
<p>When initially accessing the list and the views everything seems to be ok.&nbsp; The fun starts when I add a new item.&nbsp; I fill in the form with no issues, however once I save it I receive the "Something went wrong Please try again or refresh the page", with a
 Go to the list link at the bottom.&nbsp; Clicking Go to the List doesn't work.&nbsp; It just comes back to the same message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go back to classic experience the item is there, so it seems to be a problem with the views in the modern experience.&nbsp; It have tried removing fields from the views one by one and adding them one by one with no success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else come across this issue and worked out how to resolve it?</p>

<p>I had another go to try and fix this&nbsp;today and I have worked it out!&nbsp; Very frustrating!&nbsp; However...&nbsp;&nbsp; The default field for the Task list type which is Task Name needs to be in the view as either the Task Name (linked to item) or Task Name (linked to item
 with edit menu).&nbsp; You can't include just Task Name as this causes the error.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To replicate the issue I was having: </p>
<p>- Create a list based on the task app</p>
<p>- Set to New experience under Advanced Settings</p>
<p>- Change the default view to add Task name in the view and remove Task Name (linked to item) and/or Task Name (linked to item with edit menu)</p>
<p>- Add a task</p>
<p>- The view will then break and the "Something went wrong message" will come up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you put Task Name (linked to item) or Task Name (linked to item with edit menu) and the view will work again.

            If your device is still running windows 8, unfortunately whatsapp dropped support for it. If you want to use it you will have to try and upgrade to windows 10 mobile, however I'm not sure whether it is supported on your device.

    <title>Office 365 OWA users, sent emails go directly to drafts and get stuck - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 OWA users, sent emails go directly to drafts and get stuck there.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello there,</p>

<p>I strange behaviour started yesterday. Some of our 500 Office365 (E3) OWA users are facing this issue, when they create new email, or reply to an existing one, edit and hit SEND, the email goes directly to DRAFTS folder and stays there, like forever.</p>
<p>If the user went to the drafts folder, and try opening the sending the message from there, OWA says: "You don't have permission to perform this action" so messages are not leaving the mailbox.</p>
<p>Remaining users mail flow is normal.</p>
<p>We tried resetting browsers (IE, Chrome, FF), it seem it is hitting users randomly.</p>
<p>Any idea what' going on?</p>

<p>Much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>This morning I started trying your suggestions but the problem was auto-magically gone just like it came. the same users are able to send normally and users are able to open drafts items send them as usual. If I catch another issue shortly I'll do what's
 your recommending and send your the results.</p>
<p>Much appreciated.</p>

<h2>            MS Query - Sum a calculate field</h2>
                    
<p>I am using MS Query to retrieve data from an external database, SQL below. As part of this I am multiplying data in two&nbsp;fields (QTY_SOLD*COST_PRICE). How can i modify the statement so that it sums the QTY_SOLD*COST_PRICE for each INVOICE_NO to avoid thousands
 of lines being returned by the query. With each INVOICE_NO there are hundreds of&nbsp;LINES each with a QTY_SOLD and COST_PRICE value.</p>
<p>MS Query does not allow me to use the Sum Totals on the calculated column.</p>
<p>SELECT INVOICE_HISTORY_LINES.INVOICE_NO, QTY_SOLD*COST_PRICE<br />
FROM PUBLIC.INVOICE_HISTORY_LINES INVOICE_HISTORY_LINES</p>

Thanks, I'm confused

<h2>            Removing Text in One Cell of a Heading Row in an Excel Table, and Changing Text in the Total Row</h2>
                    <p>Good morning. <br />
<br />
I am hoping that someone can tell me how to perform two tasks.<br />
<br />
I have attached a link to a spreadsheet below, I would like to: <br />
<br />
1.) Make A1 blank so that it contains no text. (If it is not possible to remove the text in the heading row, is there a way to make it appear as if this is the case? I know that tables relay on those headings. In the attached file, I just changed the cell heading
 text&nbsp;to black so that it blends in with the background.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) Also, I have added a total row that I would like to average. How do I change A6 so that it says "Average". To clarify, I selected Average in D6, then I noticed that A6 said "Total", and I want it to say "Average". Any assistance is greatly appreciated.
<br />

            <p>a) I changed the fill and the text colour both to white in A1.</p>
<p>The drop-down arrow is still visible. If this is a problem: click A1, open Data tab, look in the Sort &amp; Filter group and click the funnel but this removes all drop-downs. This site shows VBA code to hide selective ones: http://blog.contextures.com/archives/2012/05/29/hide-arrows-in-excel-autofilter/</p>

<h2>            Critical fail when updating 10162 to 10166 and others</h2>
                    <p>First, themain problem. yesterday i update windows to v 10166 and i configure grub to start on windows always. but when i come back system said that there were a windows problem when it started and that i should restart computer. I try to make a fix on startup
 but it couldnt fix the problem. I try to make a recovery but it said that it doesn't find any image, then i try to go back to older version but it said that it doesn't find the previous vercion. I try to make a restore but system fail. I think that only chance
 is to download image and try from there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second let me show you my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 1.5tb drive that was working bad and were i had installed my system and were the 100 mb windows partition is.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe84b0b2-c477-4e59-9fde-0d6a719c2ade" /><br />
Then i have a new 1tb drive were i have windows 10, my linux distribution and swap memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0cd3381e-b02a-4309-a675-2508d5045c0d" /></p>
<p>I have seen than as I have the boot partition on the old drive I have no problem with grub and windows startup. it doesn't matter how many times i update windows it doesn't break grub as it happened before. but is there a chance that windows recognizes my
 linux install? or i have to use this trick so windows doesn't fack my linux install everytime it get updated?</p>

</p><p>Hi, The first problem is a 100% windows problem because is an upgrade (10162-10166) problem, and what is worst, is also a fix/recovery failure that, if it's repeatable, can be a serious problem next 29.<br />
The second problem is a windows problem as well, because linux compatibility works perfect and thanks to it I can use both system, but windows compatibility is bad and give some issues the users that need both system.<br />
Personally i consider your response unprofessional. Try to throw a problem to someone else is a politician bad tactic not a tactic that should take a professional company.</p>
<p>best regard</p>

<h3> christopheresposito  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint 2010 turns on webcam camera automatically, cannot turn off</h2>
                    Hi, whenever I open Powerpoint, the software automatically turns on my computer's webcam. It then (poorly) detects motion to see if I'm trying to swipe my hand in front of it to skip a slide.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The feature causes powerpoint to change slides when I don't want it to and turns on my camera when I don't want it on. I can't find anyway to disable the camera, and currently I'm stuck with it on whenever I have Powerpoint open.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any clue on how I can disable the feature? I have already disabled my camera via the driver, but I'd like to be able to just disable the feature so that I can still use my camera when I want to without restarting my computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>FYI I am running Windows 8 on a Lenovo Yoga. The camera is a built-in webcam.</div>

<h3> vikramswamy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error code -19741&#58; Mailbox has exceeded maximum mailbox size</h2>
                    Hi all -
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am in the process of moving from an in-house IMAP server to a hosted Exchange server for my small business e-mail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have a lot of email messages, especially in shared folders that are shared among our five users.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Previously I was using Apple Mail, so in order to transfer the mail to the Exchange server, I added the exchange account and manually transferred mail to my Exchange inbox.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As Apple Mail doesn't support Public Folders in exchange, I then set up my new Exchange account in Mac Outlook and moved the emails from my inbox to my Public Folder (that all 5 of us will be sharing).</div>
<div><br />
The problem is, the Public Folder is giving me the above error code and has only synchronized a portion of the emails in that folder. &nbsp;So when I go to Outlook Web Mail, it is only showing maybe 50% of the emails even though my Outlook client has them all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My hosting provider is unable to advise why and they said there is no limitation on mailbox size on their end. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
They have suggested that I try to migrate my emails using an IBM but I don't have any IBMs, and I"m afraid this issue may come again when I try to move emails to the Public Folder in the future.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's about 4 GB of mail.</div>
<div><br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            <p>Instead of paste special, try using Insert tab &gt; Illustrations group &gt; Screenshot drop down button &gt; Screen Clipping command. This will allow you to select the area of the screen you want to capture as an image</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Office 2010 has added basic screen capture functionality. <span>It will allow you to capture full application windows. There is supposed to be screen clipping, but I couldn’t get it to work. You can use any of the commands on the conditional Picture Tools
 Format tab to modify the image. You can use WordArt to add text/labels to the screen caps and Insert tab / Illustrations group / Shapes to all lines and pointers. This process isn’t quite as easy as I’ve seen in dedicated apps, but usable if you don’t have
 a separate screen capture app.</span></p>

 place the object right or center nor can I text wrap around the object. Any ideas?</span></em></strong></p>
<div>
<p>Posted By Kevin On January 10, 2011</p>
<p>Back in the days before the introduction of Windows 7 and Vista, if you wanted to take a picture of your screen, and then insert it into a Word 2007 document, you would have to jump through a gamut of virtual hoops. Usually the process would go something
 like this: Press the Print Screen key, open Microsoft Paint, Adobe Photoshop, or a similar image editor, paste your image into said image editor, crop and/or re-size as needed, export image from image editor to a Word friendly format, and finally paste into
 Word; at which point an adventure in proper image alignment would promptly begin. Thanks to Microsoft’s recently introduced Snipping tool however, creating a screen capture for import into Word (or any other word processor for that matter) has become a much
 easier task to undertake.<br />
<br />
One of the newest features to be introduced by Microsoft into their Windows operating system in the past few years, the Snipping tool provides a simple interface with which to capture, and save screen shots in Windows 7. Best of all, it adds a feature which
 allows you to draw an outline around only the parts of your screen which you wish to capture; eliminating the need to crop your screen shot in a third party image editing program prior to saving/exporting it into Word, as was required in past versions of Windows.<br />
<br />
Simply turn on the Snipping tool in your Start menu, drag your mouse to draw a box around the part of the screen you wish to capture, and the Snipping tool will process your screen shot and present you with a preview window showing your latest capture. It’s
 at this point where, for some, the aforementioned “adventure in image alignment” of your Snipping tool screen capture within Microsoft Word begins.<br />
<br />
As Word 2007 has a somewhat complicated user interface, especially for those whom have just recently migrated from using earlier versions of Word, or another word processor such as Open Office, lining up an image in your .docx document can seem to be quite
 the daunting task. However, simply follow these steps and you will become a Word screen capture alignment pro in no time!</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. Perform your screen capture with the Snipping tool as normal. When the Snipping tool screen capture preview window appears, click the “Save Snip” button and save your screen capture Snippet somewhere safe and easy to remember (i.e.
 your Desktop.)<br />
<br />
While you could simply “copy” the screen shot Snippet to your clipboard, if something goes wrong (i.e. you mistakenly “copy” something else, or your system freezes) you will lose your screen capture Snippet, and will have to recreate your screen shot using
 the Snipping tool all over again. Saving your screen capture Snippet will allow you to avoid having to re-do everything in the event a problem arises.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1-1</strong>. For maximum compatibility, choose to save your screen capture Snippet as a .JPG file in the
<strong>Save as Type</strong> drop down menu when saving your file.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. Open the Word document which your screen capture Snippet will be inserted into.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Drag and drop your screen capture Snippet into your Word document, at approximately the position where you would like it to be displayed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Typically your screen capture Snippet will displace your text in ways you do not want, and may actually appear somewhere completely different from where you were hoping to drop it. If this happens, simply drag (again) your screen capture Snippet as near as
 possible to where you would like to display it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Once your screen capture Snippet is near its intended position, mouse over your image and right click it to bring up the Word image options context menu.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>. In the Word image option context menu, mouse over “Text Wrapping.” In the fly out menu which appears, select “Square.” You will see your screen capture Snippet re-align itself so that text now wraps (or “flows”) around it.<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>. Now that the text is wrapping around your screen capture Snippet, you may want to re-align your image so that the text wraps in a different direction (to the right, left, center, etc.) To do so, left click your image once and select
 the <strong>Format</strong> tab from the top menu.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>. Click the <strong>Align</strong> icon, and select the alignment type (Left, Right, Center, Top, Bottom, or Middle) which you would like to use. The position of your screen capture Snippet will change accordingly.<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Once you have found the proper wrapping and alignment options for your screen capture Snippet, you are ready to save your document and celebrate your new found screen capture Snippet alignment knowledge. Enjoy!</p>

A simple way to copy a screen image to your Office 2010 document.</p>
<p>Office 2010 will have a simple way to paste an image from any open program window into a document or email.</p>
<p>On the Insert tab of Office 2010 programs there’s a new Screenshot option, click on that to display a gallery of the open program windows.</p>
<p><br />
<strong><em>Office 2010 - Screen Clipping gallery</em></strong></p>
<p>If none of the gallery items suits you click on Screen Clipping at the bottom. The Office app window minimizes and you can choose a screen area.</p>
<p>Whichever way you choose, the screen shot is pasted into your document as an image. Then you can move, copy, caption or edit the image just like any other picture in your document.</p>
<div>
<p>Office 2010 integrates taking ‘screen shots’ into </p>
<ul>
<li>Word</li><li>Excel </li><li>PowerPoint</li><li>Outlook in email editor</li></ul>
<p>This will be a boon for technical writers and sundry tech geeks. But regular people have a good use for it too.</p>
<p>If you’re asking for technical help there’s often the problem of accurately describing what you are seeing on the screen. Outlook 2010 has screen clipping available in the email editor so you can write a support question complete with snapshots of what you
 are seeing (error messages etc).</p>
<p>Office 2010 screen clipping doesn’t cover all situations. It can only grab images of static windows; you can’t get an image of a right-click menu or even a pull-down list or gallery from the Office 2007/2010 ribbon. In other words, Office 2010 screenshot
 does the basics but it’s no replacement for a more powerful tool like <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Here is a neat trick that I just used to copy images from a Microsoft Word 2007/2010 *.docx document.</p>
<p>I was given a Word document of a blog article to be posted on the blog. To get the text into the blog post editor (without extra html) is easy.... Just cut &amp; paste into Notepad.exe and then cut &amp; paste the&nbsp;plain text from Notepad.exe into the editor window.
 A little editing to add some formatting back and the text is done.</p>
<p>Now I needed to get the images from the Word document into the blog post editor. The editor needs the images saved as files which can be loaded.</p>
<p>I was about to right click on each image and copy it to the clipboard, then paste the image into my favourite image editor program (<a href="http://www.polybytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Polybytes Software - Home of PolyView">PolyView</a>) and save the
 files. But then I had an idea and though I would give it a try.</p>
<p>All the new OpenDocument formats (docx, xlsx, pptx, etc.) are actually zip archive files in disguise.&nbsp; So I renamed the docx to zip and opened&nbsp;the archive&nbsp;with
<a href="http://www.winzip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="WinZip Home Page">WinZip</a>. A quick look around the folder structure and the image files were located:
<strong>filename.zip / Word / Media / *.png</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;then copied the image files from the archive to my desktop and they were ready for me to browse to and insert from the blog&nbsp;post editor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Last step was to rename the zip file back to docx.</li><li>Voila!!! All done.</li><li>David</li></ul>
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong> It is easier to rename the extension of files when folder option “Hide extensions for known file types” is unchecked.</p>

Snagit is one of the world’s leading and most reviewed screenshot applications. Many tech and non-tech users like this program because it’s so easy to use, it has lots of practical tools, and its output images are top-notch.</p>
<p>Upon installing Snagit (on 9.1.3 and later versions), the program will let you choose whether or not you want it to be integrated with Microsoft Office. If you’re always grabbing screenshots and pasting them manually to MS Word or PowerPoint, it’s better
 if you enable the integration.</p>
<p>This way, you don’t have to constantly shift between two programs in order to capture and paste screenshots. You also don’t have to open and run Snagit if you capture screenshots using MS Office programs — a great convenience for you.</p>
<p>To use the Snagit tool, just open any Microsoft Office 2007 or 2010 programs. For this illustration, we will use PowerPoint.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Add-Ins</strong> menu and press <strong>Snagit</strong> (as shown below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is your first time using the application, you’ll be presented with this confirmation window. Click
<strong>OK</strong> to proceed.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to see this window again the next time you’ll access the Snagit add-in, just uncheck the
<strong>Show tip again</strong> checkbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, you can now capture any window or screen-part you want. The process of grabbing a screenshot is still the same. The red box will still appear.</p>
<p>For example, we would like to capture this webpage part. Just place the red box within this section and let Snagit grab it.</p>
<p>After capturing, the program will automatically paste the output image to your PowerPoint page — it’s that easy. This method saves you both time and computer memory resources because you don’t have to open the Snagit software itself.</p>
<p>Instead of going through several steps of getting several screenshots and manually pasting / inserting them to your PowerPoint presentation, you can do it with more convenience using this technique.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also apply this process in Microsoft Word and Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to access, update, and / or delete the integration between Snagit and Microsoft Office, go to the former’s
<strong>Tools</strong> menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, click Snagit Accessories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Accessories Manager</strong> window, you can update and / or remove Excel, Word, and PowerPoint’s assimilation to Snagit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To decrease the chances of program crashes and improve the capturing performance of Microsoft Office, you should update all accessories to their latest versions by clicking the
<strong>Update Now</strong> button.</p>

<p>Part of our work in PowerPoint 2010 makes the process of adding and editing images easier. Many of your pictures come from your camera or the internet. Another common source is your computer screen. Taking a screenshot and pasting it into the application
 can be tedious, because in most cases you really only want to show a portion of the screen.
</p>
<p>For Office 2010, we decided do something about it.</p>
<p>Introducing the <strong>Insert Screenshot</strong> tool. With just a couple clicks, you can insert a picture of any window, or you can take a screen clipping by dragging a marquee around the desired area. PowerPoint will then automatically place the image
 onto your slide:<br />
</p>
<p>Since the screenshot is really just a picture once it’s in PowerPoint, you can add shapes and annotations on top of it. You can even apply photo styles, corrections, and artistic effects. In this case a drop shadow is applied so that the picture appears
 to be floating above the slide:<br />
</p>
<p>You can also use the “Screen Clipping” button at the bottom of the Insert Screenshot drop-down to select any portion of the visible screen and convert that to a picture.&nbsp; For example, here is a screenshot of my Windows 7 taskbar:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The goal of this feature is to save you some time. It’s also available in other apps like Word and Excel. For those of you who didn’t previously know how to take a screenshot, now you have a simple solution. Enjoy!</p>

<p><em><span>(Note: We first published this post in 2010, but since then so many of you have looked it up that we thought we’d share it with you again.)</span></em></p>
<p>As we noted in the last post about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powerpoint/archive/2010/04/27/powerpoint-2010-insert-screenshot.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
inserting a screenshot</a>, a lot of the work for Office 2010 has been about improving workflow for image insertion and editing.</p>
<p>I’m going to show you how to use the new <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/office2010/archive/tags/Background+Removal/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Remove Background</strong></a> tool on pictures to make a slide like this:<br />
</p>
<p>The Remove Background button will isolate the foreground object in an image and remove the background elements. Here’s the original image of my skateboard:</p>
<p><br />
If you click the “Remove Background” button on the Picture Tools Format tab, you’ll enter the Background Removal contextual tab:</p>
<p><br />
You’ll also see that PowerPoint makes an initial guess about what to remove. In many cases this will be the end of the story, so you can just click “Keep Changes” and move on:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>This all depends on the characteristics of the picture and which object you are trying to isolate. When the guess is incorrect, there are a couple of quick steps you can take to get the result you want. First, drag the rectangle to fit around the object
 you want:<br />
</p>
<p>Then, click the “Mark Areas to Remove” button and draw lines over the unwanted areas, such as the wood floor. If part of the object you want is under the purple mask, then use the “Mark Areas to Keep” to make sure they aren’t removed accidentally:<br />
</p>
<p>In a couple minutes you’ll have just the areas you want, and everything else in the image will become transparent. As a final step, you may wish to use the
<strong>crop</strong> tool to remove transparent areas so that the bounding box fits tightly around the object. Since it’s just a picture, you can apply effects, rotation, and scale just as you would to any other picture in PowerPoint (notice how the shadows
 project only from the isolated skateboards):<br />
</p>
<p>This is a very powerful tool that opens the doors to a whole new realm of creativity. You’ll be pleased to find it in other Office apps such as Word, Excel and Outlook. Have fun.</p>

Snagit’s toolbar add-ins let you capture the screen from within many of the programs you use daily – without ever leaving the program or launching Snagit. Add-ins are available for most of the Microsoft Office programs, Adobe FrameMaker, and Firefox.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
With the exception of the Firefox Extension, the add-ins are built into Snagit. They are automatically installed along with Snagit, unless you specify otherwise during the installation process.</p>
<p>30 day trial download available.</p>
<div>
<p>Snagit and Microsoft PowerPoint</p>
<p>Create dynamic presentations using Snagit’s PowerPoint add-in. From PowerPoint’s toolbar, you can use Snagit to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embed Flash videos and play them directly inside your presentation slides. No more waiting for videos to download.
</li><li>Include interactive captures in your slides. Hover over an image or diagram to reveal extra detail or explanatory text.</li><li>Capture a Web page with all of the embedded links intact. Then, click a link to go directly online from your presentation.</li></ul>
<p>And Snagit can automatically fill a whole slide with a capture, eliminating the hassle of manually sizing the image to fit.</p>
<div>
<p>Snagit and Microsoft Excel</p>
<p>Snagit’s add-in for Excel lets you instantly capture logos, charts, graphs, text, and much more, and add them to your spreadsheets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture charts, graphs, or data that couldn’t otherwise be copied from PDFs, Web analytics software, or sales tracking tools.</li><li>Capture text and automatically place it in the appropriate rows and columns – no import wizard required.</li></ul>
<div>
<p>Snagit and Microsoft Internet Explorer</p>
<p>Use Snagit’s Add-in for Internet Explorer to capture and share anything you find online — images, graphics, logos, or Web pages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture a product description or image from an online store.</li><li>Capture a working Web page prototype, with links completely intact, to share with your design team.
</li><li>Capture an article that scrolls beyond the viewable onscreen area, and save it as a PDF file for easy retrieval later.</li></ul>

<p>This is a good start by Nokia but I disagree that everything is now perfect with the N97, it is performing better now which I think not only has to do with the latest firmware update but also the latest update to Nokia Messaging</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even still it is slow, the improved RAM management has come at the cost of proper multi-tasking, there is not enough space on the c: drive, and it's still not worth the premium sticker price (even without comparing it to the competition).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question to Nokia is: What are you going to do about resolving this for current N97 owners who have struggled through eight months of terrible user experience with this phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about providing a discount for people who trade their N97s in on the first Symbian^3 flagship device?</p>

<p>Well, I'm not sure about the "what they can do part", but from what I gather I think the new flagship would be using MeeGo, and not Symbian, as the rumormill has Symbian on the N80-00 (a concept phone), and on the X10 drawing board.</p>

<p>Yeah it made me happy to hear those words - great that someone admits that there is an issue, so for all the pple here with complaints we can rest assured that we were not crazy, and the ones that had no issues indeed have super low standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anssi's&nbsp;announcement might just be enough to restore my faith in Nokia; however, i won't walk into it with blind love. &nbsp;He could have hid behind some lower person on the food chain - it is nice to hear someone at the execute level tell it like it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am assuming that when he says it is all over he means there is a firmware coming out soon, I am not expecting too much as we all know the HW is limited - however well have to wait and see, so long as the phone and features work and are stable i will accept
 it with open arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is my core checklist:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Make Voice Calls &nbsp;(seems to be OK - except the Nokia tune)</p>
<p>2. Check Email using the default client (FAIL - IMAP currently is Broken, No HTML support)&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Surf the web&nbsp;occasionally - (Semi fail - it works, but not the best experience)</p>
<p>4. Use Skype (Semi OK - was hoping for that tight integration that was promised...but)</p>
<p>5. Play video (FAIL Real Player codec support is pathetic at best)</p>
<p>6. Maps and Navigation (WIN - Latest maps is awesome!)</p>
<p>7. SIP Calls (WIN - after a few user hacks Nokia Finally released the SIP client 6 months in)</p>
<p>8. Listen to music (music plays so i guess this works - the player kinda sucks)</p>
<p>9. Take Photos (Super Fail - my lens is sooo scratched the flash flare on the photos renders it&nbsp;unusable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am guessing the new firmware will not fix the mail, browser, video player or&nbsp;anything&nbsp;that changes the functionality of the phone - my guess is the new &nbsp;version will just be more stable with fewer crashes, and not address any of the omitted or broken functionality.
 &nbsp;I hope I am wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing i did not get is the testers in Norway (I am Norwegian FYI) - why bother with that, why not just hire a few employees to troll through theses forums - I am sure EVERY bug known to man is listed on here somewhere.....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This is a good start by Nokia but I disagree that everything is now perfect with the N97"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My understanding is that he is referring to the NEXT firmware that is&nbsp;coming&nbsp;out and that he admits that v21 sucks - although there is no specific mention of either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hoping he is not saying v21 is perfect - cause we know it is not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT - I just watched that again, and in reality I think Anssi is saying that v21 fixed all their issues, wow I might be wrong about a new firmware, it really is hard to tell. &nbsp;If v21 is the best Nokia has got for me - its my last.</p>

<p>And now lets discuss rebates, refunds or what ever it may be called, I've had the N97 for 7 months now 3 of which it's been away for repairs @ £40 PM this equates to £120 wasted as I was given the most basic of phones to use. Now that &nbsp;there's an admission
 of problems shouldn't nokia be offering something back as a good will gesture?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>agreed, but it's not just the time that the device has been away for repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased mine in June and my experience has included the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Seven months of unreliability (crashes, freezes, lost phone calls, etc...) up until the v21 update&nbsp;</li><li>Four months without Mac PIM syncing until bluetooth was fixed in the v20 update</li><li>One week without the device while away for repairs (scratched lens protector, unresponsive touchscreen, poorly isolated GPS antennae</li><li>Countless hours on the web researching fixes and workarounds for the buggy software</li><li>Countless hours hard resetting, formatting the mass memory, installing apps on e:, reloading media, reloading maps, etc... all to make up for the deficiencies in NAND memory</li><li>Countless hours with Nokia support trying to restore Ovi Store purchases after losing them due to hard resets including the hard reset done by the Nokia Authorised repairer</li><li>Eight months without the properly integrated Skype client that Nokia marketed the device to have (the recently released Skype client is not properly integrated)</li><li>Slow performance, still!</li></ul>

<p>What about hardware failures like low ram and low memory on c drive. and also the cpu is slowww :( can we get compensation??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be brilliant but crazy and most likely will never happen is that we pay little for an upgrade to symbian^3 on a similar n97 formfactor with improved hardware</p>
