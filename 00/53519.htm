<h2>            White Screen, Missing Explorer.exe etc. Please help</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>i'm getting a white screen upon windows 10 boot, i've tried system/startup repair, no luck. Same issue on safe-mode. SFC /scannow
 doesn't work and i can't open explorer.exe even through task manager, prob because it doesn't exist, Avast is apparently not compatible with the windows version all of the sudden and so on. I've even tried a full system restore but of course that just greets
 me with an error. This laptop cost me $1700 so all help is greatly appreciated, i can't afford this... virus, malware, rootkit or whatever, half my life is behind the computer tbh.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in advance</span></p>

<p><br />
============================<br />
<br />
If the System and camera will run on Windows 7 and there Windows 7 drivers for the camera.</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software<strong>"IF"</strong> there are<br />
any for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
<span>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
</span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
</span><span><br />
Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

<h2>            Using touchscreen as a separate mouse</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive seen this problem before but no real solution so far. I have a touchscreen that i want to use separatley from my main display. Now when i use my touchscreen for example outlook, whenever i press an email to show it my mouse moves from my main display.
 I wan't my mouse to stay on my main display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive tried programs like eithermouse and plural input, but non of them seem to work with a touchscreen and a mouse. Are there any solution to this? I basically want my touchscreen to act as a second mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>John</p>

<h2>            Updates KB973688 and KB954430 keeps failing, error code 643</h2>
                    I try to update the updates KB973688 and KB954430, they keep failing. I don't know why, but I tried to run Fix It, twice, it said it fixed the problem, it did not. The error code is 643. All other updates install, it is just these two updates.<br />
<br />
I have tried the stand-alone installs, and return an error like this:<br />
<br />
<u>Error opening installation log file. Verify that the specified log file location exists and is writable<br />
<br />
</u>This is weird. I have never gotten this error with an update before. I don't know what to do. I have no idea on how to fix this issue.<br />
<br />
PC specs:<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Home Premium, 64-Bit<br />
Intel Celeron processor<br />
Windows Version: 6.1<br />
Architecture: amd64<br />
PC: Compaq Presario CQ57<br />
Ram: 2 GB<br />
PC is up to date (latest update package is KB2750147)<br />
Hard disk total space: 269GB<br />
Hard disk space available: 67.9 GB<br />
Anti-virus software: AVG 2013 (free edition, up to date)<br />
Anti-malware software: MalwareBytes (up to date)<br />
<br />
I did a whole computer virus scan on the C:\ drive today, AVG has detected and removed five things, I tried to install the updates KB973688 and KB954430 about an hour after the scan was finished.<br />
<br />
Malware Bytes has detected nothing.&nbsp; I was running AVG and MalwareBytes at the same time, to cut the time of the scans in half.<br />
<br />
I get no messages from AVG saying it is a threat, nor is it blocking it from running.
<br />
<br />
My laptop is about almost a month old, Windows is not fresh, I have other programs on it.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading &amp; your help.<br />

<p>Hello Amal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printer issues can usually be resolved when you reinstall the printer driver. However, since this caused you to have issues when setting the custom paper size, we recommend to run the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027397/windows-fix-printer-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Printer troubleshooter</a> as an initial troubleshooting step. Click on <strong>Run troubleshooter</strong> from the link that we have provided you. If the issue is still the same, you can try to update the printer driver that you have reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on how it goes for you.</p>

<p>

            We have received an update, Microsoft and Epson have determined the cause of the issue and are working together on a solution. This problem is not related to the printer driver, so installing current or older print drivers will not resolve the issue.<br />
For now, we recommend checking this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/epson-printer-stops-working-on-windows-7-after/75d91d75-655c-4563-bedf-5c89e27444c1?tm=1510873965090&amp;auth=1">
thread</a> every now and then. Microsoft will provide an update as soon as possible. The thread provided specifically states Windows 7 but this applies to Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 as well.

<h2>            Xbox Stereo Head-set and Adapter, can hear game audio fully and clearly, Chat audio is not working</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>What accessories are you having trouble with? ---- The stereo headset, the official Microsoft one that retails for 79.99 was on sale 49.99 Canadian dollars, and comes with an adapter</p>
<p>Describe what is happening --- I can hear game audio perfect, when I press the controller button to increase game sounds it goes from quiet to full, however, for the chat it doesn't, I keep pressing the person symbol (for chat sound) until I can't even hear
 the game audio and than proceed to increase the volume to maximum. What makes it worse is there are 0 beeps that occur so I am thinking it may be the adapter as my regular headset (the one included with the console) works perfectly, makes beeps when lowest
 or highest volume is reached and allows me to chat and hear chat in perfect volume. The stereo headset's adapter does light up and the buttons do raise and lower game audio, but chat audio does not do anything, you can hear the faintest of voices and people
 can only here small whispers through my headset, I also can see the circle in the party moving so we can tell when we are trying to talk but it does not work.</p>
<p>I was in the preview beta dashboard, however removed it completely from my console as step one</p>
<p>I have updated the controller, did it before anything else, made sure all cables where properly plugged in and that headset and adapter where in as well</p>
<p>Made another update by going to settings-devices-controller-accessories-headset adapter and updated that as well</p>
<p>Power cycled Xbox one console</p>
<p>Unplugged the console and plugged it back in</p>
<p>removed adapter and headset cables and than plugged them back in, made sure everything was plugged in</p>
<p>Restarted console multiple times</p>
<p>turned kinect mic off in the settings</p>
<p>Reset Kinect data after reading the suggestion (I had scoured the internet for a solution to my problem)</p>
<p>Restarted controller</p>
<p>Raised volume on Chat audio and overall repeatedly</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help, I just got it an hour ago from the Microsoft store and since the support center I was going to call closed for the day 20 minutes I ago I will have to wait till tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are not in the preview and not running any preview updates, there is no need to post there.</p>
<p>*This happened to me but in reverse. &nbsp;I had the basic chat headset and one day in Sept. the mic stopped recording sound. &nbsp;I could hear chat but no longer speak to others. &nbsp;I assumed it was the headset so I began using the Kinect only and found out that the
 Kinect, the headset and my third party headset that is compatible with the xbox one all would not work.</p>
<p>During the October Preview I picked up the headset you have and after one of the preview updates they all began working again.</p>
<p>I assumed it was update related.</p>
<p>Sorry but perhaps another person will comment with a fix.</p>

<p>ok, a couple of details may help me narrow it down if anyone knows the answer</p>
<p>-does your headset adapter beep (like the basic headset does) when you reach max volume, because mine does not, it just makes a small static noise I can faintly hear when the volume is turned to max</p>
<p>-I use a rechargeable batter pack from Nyko (3rd party), do you think it could be a battery issue than? (My game sound works perfect, just the chat sound that doesn't work)</p>
<p>Thanks, and Thanks BlackSmurf, I will try with the preview dashboard update to see if that will fix my problem</p>

<p>Same issue here, turtle beach earforce z11. Game audio is fine for battlefield 4, and geometry wars, but no audio for pinball arcade or xbox dashboard sounds. No chat audio comes through the headset, but party and game chat members can both hear my mic.
 Just wasted $30 on a new adapter and its definitely not that.</p>

<h2>            Windows doesn&#39;t xbox batarang &#34;USB device not recognized one of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Malfunctioned USB Device, Windows doesn't recognize it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen this posted a few times...but i can never find a clear detailed answer that fixes the problem.
</p>
<p>The problem is when i plug in my wired xbox batarang controller into any usb port i get the message "USB device not recognized one of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and windows does not recognize it" My device then appears as
 "Unknown Device" with a driver installed correctly (although the driver didnt install correctly when i plugged the controller into one of the back slots). I've restarted my computer with the device still plugged in with the driver uninstalled, ive tried to
 find the proper xbox controller driver that i have installed (xbox accessories) but it always stays as an unknown device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not the ports themselves since i always plug my phone and headset into them in order to charge them...is it the controller itself? it has been dropped quite a few times. I've also seen people say "uninstall every little thing thats under the Universal
 Serial Bus controllers category in device manager" but i hate tinkering around with stuff i have no clear knowledge of and really...i dont think uninstalling everything under that will fix my issue...</p>

            <p>This error is usually an indication that there's a problem with the USB device or the USB port. Since other USB devices work fine on the USB ports, it could be the USB controller that might have gone bad. You can try running the Microsoft Fixit for diagnosing
 USB problems and check if that helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download it from the following link:<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_usb_diagnostics</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the controller is still not recognized, you could try plugging it to a different system to check if you get the same error on the other system as well. If you do, then it's a faulty controller and you'll have to replace it.

    <title>Restart function not working well. Normal shutdown and start up is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevew_459  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restart function not working well. Normal shutdown and start up is fine.</h2>
                    New HP DV7-7300.&nbsp; 2740 i7 processor and I installed a 840 Pro SSD. This machine runs well and is incredibly fast. Maybe too fast. I made a couple of mistakes early and had drive errors but it seemed to run well. Scheduled disk check and it would skip the
 disk check upon restart each time even though I did not hit any key. <br />
Also, half the time it does not re-connect the wi-fi on a restart and I been through all the troubleshooting and updated the drivers plus my other machine works fine.<br />
The wifi connects every time on a normal shut down and start up and the disk check functions if scheduled..<br />
<br />
I am thinking that because this machine boots so incredibly fast (like in about 5-7 seconds) with the SSD things just are not settling down or falling into place like they should on restarts.<br />
<br />
Normal starts are fine and the disk check worked.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I love the machine and it runs well but there is just something not quite right with the restart function. Any ideas would be appreciated.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            Go to Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; Power Options and on the left Change what the power options do.If the Turn on Fast start up has a check mark in it, remove it.&nbsp; This may slow down the boot to enable the drivers to work properly.

            I removed the check mark and did not notice a reduction in boot speed on a manual start. It still comes up to the desktop screen in a few seconds. It also semi-froze on the first manual start boot up today and I had to ctl/alt/del to get out of it. Drive
 shows no errors. This was before I removed the checkmark.<br />
<br />
I notice the fast start off option has no affect on a re-start and that is where the main problem is.
<br />
Appears that I may need to go back to Windows 7.&nbsp; I am hoping Microsoft would work with me on that if need be.<br />
The machine runs well if it comes up properly.&nbsp; Just don't do restarts. I am wondering if my SSD has anything to do with it. Just too fast.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;My Windows 7 machine which is a HP DV6 and is just about the same thing never has had so much as 1 issue except for a failed HD in 2 years.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Now since I unchecked that box I have had a chance to do a few manual shutdowns and start ups and now the wifi will take a minute or longer to connect most times whereas before it always connected immediately on a manual start . My other machine with win
 7 connects right away as is the norm with it.<br />
Re-starts failed to connect wifi as well.<br />
<br />
Just for your information. I don't mind helping out if any info does the windows 8 team any good.
<br />
I am sure it will get better as updates happen.<br />
<br />
I am going to clone this drive with another SSD because I am afraid the drive will crash and I won't be able to fix errors. I made a repair disk as instructed and it was useless when I had errors and it would not perform disk check at start up.<br />
I went back and cloned the factory HDD drive onto the SSD again a few days ago and that's where I am at now.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            I just installed the factory HDD and upon restart the wifi did not connect for over a minute. I cannot figure it out other than it is nothing to do with the SSD. All drivers and BIOS are updated.<br />
The wifi connected immediately when I did a normal shut down and start up with fast start on.<br />

<h2>            Windows Media Player freezes while playing a movie, but audio keeps playing.</h2>
                    While viewing a movie the video will freeze up and the audio will keep going. But when I double click on it the video will start again in the minimized form and the frames will speed up to the point where the movie was. But even in the minimized form the
 media player will still freeze up! The only thing that kinda prevents this from happening is when I move my mouse some it will stop it from freezing up. But sometimes the video file will still freeze up even right after the mouse is moved. Does anyone know
 what this might be?

<p><span><span>Hi
<span>Odin8989,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Does this happen with one type of file or with all the video files?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Which type of video files are you trying to play?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First try to
<strong>reduce the hardware acceleration on the graphic card</strong> and check if it works fine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click
<strong>Start </strong>, click <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click <strong>Appearance and Personalization</strong>, click
<strong>Personalization</strong>, click <strong>Display Settings</strong>, and then click
<strong>Advanced Settings.</strong>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click the
<strong>Troubleshoot tab</strong>, and then click <strong>Change Settings</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or provide confirmation.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;3. Move the
<strong>Hardware Acceleration slider</strong> <strong>until it is one notch to the right of None</strong>. This is the basic acceleration setting.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click
<strong>OK</strong> <strong>two times,</strong> and then close the window.&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;If the issue is resolved when you set the Graphics Hardware Acceleration slider to
<strong>None or to Basic</strong>, contact your hardware manufacturer to find out how to obtain and install the latest video driver for your video card.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you already installed the latest video driver for your video card, and you continue to experience graphics issues with
 the Graphics Hardware Acceleration slider s<strong>et to Full</strong>. However, move the Graphics Hardware Acceleration slider one notch to the left until the issue no longer occurs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> The
<strong>video codec</strong> that is required to decode and display the video may not be installed on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For example, if you are trying to play a file that was encoded using the DivX video codec and you do not have that codec installed on your
 computer, you will likely hear the audio portion of the file, but you won't see the video.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer third party website to download a compatible codec to play the video files. You may use your favorite engine to browse and
 download a third party codec<span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third
 Party Software is at your own risk.</span></span></p>

            Brother I've been having this issue for a while now and it's driving me crazy.<br />
I've never actually used Powershell myself, after copy + paste do I then close it? It doesn't appear to give me any confirmation.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just tried this, didn't work for me.<br />
<br />
I copy and pasted each individual line, perhaps I'm doing something wrong?<br />

            Copy and paste the entire thing as is and press enter. Its going to take about 2-5 minutes but it eventually stops. make sure your app is closed when you do this. It worked for me thanks OP!<br />

<p>
</p><p>After up-gradation&nbsp;of windows 10 to Windows 10 Anniversary Update (Version 1607) I found audio equalizer presets are missing. I have re-installed the latest driver but still same issue. I am able to play audios/videos and the sound output is default which
 I am not able to change as per my choice. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Could any body please guide me whether is there any way to overcome this issue. Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Snipping tool captures full screen instead of window</h2>
                    My Snipping Tool used to work fine, but now it can't tell the difference between full screen and a window. If I select Window for a snip and click on an active window, I always get a full screen snip. If I select rectangular snip, it snips only the rectangle
 I draw.

The problem occurrs with any window I try to snip.
<div><br />
<div>I looked at versions of the tool under its Properties, and the last backup was June 2011, likely when I installed Windows 7 Professional. That makes me suspect what changed its behavior was not an update to the tool. &nbsp;I run Kaspersky Internet AV and other
 add-ins that are purported to improve Internet safety. One of the add-ins is Safe Money, that limits certain things from happening such as the Snipping Tool working at all when viewing an Internet money site such as a bank. Possibly, when I left the site and
 Kaspersky released its blockage of the Snipping Tool, things did not return to normal.</div>
<div><br />
<div>How can I repair the Snipping Tool with the latest version? Will SFC do that, or do I need to use another approach? Suppose the issue is not the Snipping Tool code, but is rather some Registry setting. Similar question: can I reset registry entries that
 affect the Snipping Tool to defaults?</div>

<div>Unfortunately, my debugging was inconclusive. Before the clean boot, the problem survived reboots (not clean ones). After the clean boot, the problem disappeared. Then, I added back all services and then startup programs in stages, and the problem did
 not reappear. That means I have no idea what caused it; only that a clean boot apparently fixed it. But the good news is that it is fixed :)</div>

Well... mixed feelings on that one.&nbsp; ;-)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
At least the clean boot fixed whatever it was that going awry... but since you added everything the clean boot disabled temporarily back - that doesn't make a lot of sense.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Unless it is something you only run manually every so often.&nbsp; Any remote desktop type software installed (other than the default Microsoft RDC)?<br />

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exactly the same issue as you. Our common denominator is that we are both using Kaspersky Internet Security.</p>
<p>1) When I have a Kaspersky-secured browser for online banking opened, I get an error when I try to open Windows' snipping tool.</p>
<p>2) When no browser is opened at all, it is impossible to perform a window snip with the tool, always ending up&nbsp;to be the same as when I do a full screen capture. I found that I could work around the issue by not only disabling KIS but by litterally closing
 it (selecting "Exit" in KIS' taskbar menu).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps!</p>

            Hi MJ
<br />
<br />Microsoft would prefer to be able to provide Skype numbers to all countries in the world
<br />
<br />A Skype number is a local landline number . . .

<br />The problem is the local telecoms companies must provide Microsoft with local landline numbers so they can be used as Skype Numbers
<br />
<br />Some telecoms companies are unwilling to do this, sometimes a cost agreement cannot be reached and sometimes, in certain countries, this is blocked by local authorities

            More than likely due to cost, regulation and demand. Providing a service that requires a contract with ever local landline provider in every country in the world, even if possible/allowable, would probably not be very cost effective.&nbsp;

    <title>Re Brother Control Centre &#38; no Scanning facility. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bnaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re Brother Control Centre &#38; no Scanning facility.</h2>
                    I have an identical problem with the Brother Control Centre for my MFC-990CW. The icon shows in the Apps section of Widows 8, but clicking it does nothing! There doesn't appear to be anything behind the icon. I also note, though, that on the Brother site
 it says that scanning is not compatible with Windows 8, only printing. Something that I didn't find out until after I'd upgraded from 7. Doe anyone know how I can go back to 7, as I can't even find a System Restore facility on 8!

            <pre>Hi Zack
My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.

Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            Hey Zack.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The flash stick can be used to move files off the hard drive to storage only  
<br />
<br />First here are tips for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />For Version Updates you can save a lot of space needed to download the ISO on the PC by installing Media Creation Tool on another PC to download your licensed version or create bootable media, transfer it back to click to Mount ISO or open bootable media, right click on Setup to Run as Administrator which is the most stable method to change to the newest version.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            Hi Zack
<br />
<br />What size hard drive do you have on your system, is that a 32GB (29.1GB usable) SSD or do you have more storage on your system?
