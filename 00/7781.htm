<p><span>Hi AdamBlack2,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are using OneNote 2016 app, then you may try removing Windows credentials, see if this fixes the issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Sign out from Office applications and quit all the Office applications opened on your system. To sign out, open any Office application, let’s say Word, click
<strong>File&gt;Account&gt;Sign out</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Open <strong>
Control Panel</strong>&gt;<strong>User Account</strong>&gt;<strong>Credentials Manager</strong>&gt;<strong>Windows Credentials</strong>&gt;Delete all
<strong>MicrosoftOffice16</strong><strong>and MicrosoftOffice15</strong> credentials.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 23.25pt">&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/184d92ea-005a-4299-8a1a-386d88201dc0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/184d92ea-005a-4299-8a1a-386d88201dc0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 23.25pt"><br />
</p>
<p><span>After deleting the cached password, open Word and click
<strong>File</strong>&gt;<strong>Account</strong>&gt;<strong>Sign</strong> <strong>in</strong> and enter your Office 365 log in credentials. Now you can try opening the shared notebook in OneNote 2016 from SharePoint Online or OneDrive for business and check if you
 still get the same issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, please provide the following information:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Please provide the screenshot of Office 365
<strong>Product Information</strong>. To get this screenshot, open OneNote on the affected system, click&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&gt;<strong>Account</strong>, capture the screenshot of all the information mentioned under&nbsp;<strong>Product Information.</strong></span></li><li><span>Please check with the affected user if he/she can open the shared notebook in a different network.</span></li><li><span>Does the user who is unable to open the notebook in OneNote client app has the same permission on the shared notebook like the rest of the users?</span></li><li><span>Is this the only shared notebook which is giving the error? Try opening another shared notebook in OneNote client app.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            Without seeing the CSV, its hard to say what it mean, other than its a % and doesn't belong there. :)
<br />
<br />You'll need to edit the contacts to remove the character from the field - if you don't have a lot to edit, you can do this in a list view with in-cell editing enabled in View Settings, Other Settings. If you have a lot of contacts to fix, you can use a macro. I have a basic macro at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/contacts/bulk-change-outlook-contacts-file-as-format/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/contacts/bulk...</a> - changing it to fix the names is a fairly easy.

            Hello Tom
<br />
<br />Do you still have the CSV file?
<br />It could be strange character on those Contacts you uploaded.
<br />Could you check the ones that have the issue and see how are they created in the CSV file? The column of value of the cell for those Contacts might have some kind of special chatacter
<br />If you can share a screen shot of how the contact looks on the file and how it looks on Outlook would be great.

            <p>It's interesting that Kaspersky gives these issues but Avast for example does not. I've just installed Avast Security as a trial and it works fine. It makes&nbsp;me wonder what is the difference between the way these two products work. There has been an issue
 with Kaspersky not working with builds since before the first "official" release of Win 10 last July. A problem was flagged earlier this year with some insider builds but it looked as if it was sorted with the previous insider build.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kaspersky tech "support" is next to useless, they just trot out the same mantra "we don't support preview builds" hopeless really. Odd the Avast do - maybe they are more up to speed? A shame as the Kaspersky product is pretty good and probably the best of
 the pay for offerings, just regrettable that their development team is so behind the loop!</p>

            <p>Yes, I think Kaspersky's programmers might code more closely to each windows operating system,</p>
<p>because each version of Kaspersky usually only works for a specific version of windows.</p>
<p>This approach was good when Microsoft did not make too many major changes to the operating system.</p>
<p>However, with the extra fast pace of windows 10 builds and changes, Kaspersky's coders cannot keep up.</p>
<p>While Avast either codes more simply (or non OS specific) or has more programmers to make changes
</p>
<p>quicker or both.</p>

<h2>            Delivery address on envelopes print too far to the left</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 10, Office 2013. My printer is an Epson WF-3450. Lately, when I print envelopes, the delivery address prints too far to the left. I use the rear feed of the Epson to load an envelope.</p>
<p>I have called Epson tech support, and my drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>I received a self-addressed envelope that I mailed to a company in late November in which the address was placed correctly. I suspect the Windows 10 update that installed on my computer on 12-14-16 is the culprit.</p>
<p>As of now, I cannot print envelopes. I will have to print labels for them - not the professional look I was going for.</p>

                    Is there a way to setup excel to auto-populate a column based on reoccurring values in another column? &nbsp;For example, in column A I am using 3 values to show what stage our products are in: "Concept, Bench, or Launch" and I need Column B to auto-populate
 1 for Concept, 2 for Bench, and 3 for Launch. &nbsp;That way it will automatically update if I change the values in column A from Concept to Bench.

            This is easily accomplished with a <i>Helper</i>&nbsp;column that records the <i>

<br />

<br />
Note that C2 contains the formula,
<div>=B2&amp;COUNTIF($B$2:$B2,B2)</div>

<div>=IFERROR(INDEX($A:$A,MATCH(E$1&amp;ROWS($1:1),$C:$C,0)),"")</div>
<div>... which can be <i>filled right</i>&nbsp;to G2, then E2:G2 can be <i>filled down</i>&nbsp;as far as necessary. Note that the IFERROR() wrapper function (2007/2010
<i>only</i>) leaves a blank cell when no match is found.<br />
<br />
Any change to a value in column B will immediately result in a change within one or more of the E through G columns.<br />

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />You are correct, accounts set up as POP3 do not sync anything. It's just a one-way one-time download of the &lt;Inbox&gt;
<br />
<br />You have several options
<br />
<br />#1 - Log into your account using webmail (using your browser)
<br />or
<br />#2 - Configure the account as IMAP which does sync all email folders bi-directionally
<br />or
<br />#3 - Install the &lt;emClient&gt; email client and configure the account as an Exchange account

<br />Re: Subject of this thread "Mananging Exchange Inbox Without Outlook"
<br />
<br />Re #1 – Webmail login renders fail for &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; and Password. I know address and pwd is correct as it was successfully used to set up emClient at #3.
<br />
<br />Re: #2 - Setting up account as an IMAP account with TBird
<br />
<br />Re #3 – Installed emClient and successfully imported data from Tbird; its running but correctly won’t send e-mails because of the continuing Full Mailbox issue 
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Let's go back to the beginning. The subject of this thread is "Mananging Exchange Inbox Without Outlook" so am not all clear as what is going on. For reference, this is a Microsoft forum so if Outlook is not being used, not sure why the question is being posted here
<br />
<br />Re: #1 - Webmail login failure - that is something that you need to take up with the email service provider since there is evidently a problem with this account. Also, given that you identified the account to be from &lt;btconnect.com&gt; - how is this account configured as an "Exchange" account?
<br />
<br />Re: #2 - Configuring the account as an IMAP account would have no impact on what exists on the server. Only &lt;one&gt; email account exists but how (POP3, IMAP etc) it's accessed is a completely separate question/issue. IN short - you don't have a POP3 &lt;AND&gt; an IMAP account - you only have one btconnect.com account that needs to be configured in the email client accordingly. I don't use TBird so can't address specific steps.
<br />
<br />Re: #3 - Configuring the account in emClient would be no different then TBird in terms of POP3 or IMAP settings. You need to configure it as one or the other. Simply using emCLient does not provide &lt;Exchange&gt; access if the email server doesn't support it or to put it another way, can't configure an account as an &lt;Exchange&gt; account if it's not on an Exchange server
<br />
<br />The following are the Imap settings for a BTConnect email account as per the following website

<br />BTCONNECT.COM e-mail server settings - IMAP and SMTP

<br />#1 - My underlying point/question was that - if I re-configure my Thunderbird client from POP3 to IMAP I should then be able to delete files from my Inbox (on Thunderbird) and this (IMAP) would in 
<br />turn sync with my remote Inbox, wherever it is, and reduce its content to finally resolve the Full Mailbox issue; but perhaps a little naive on my part?
<br />
<br />#2 - However, having now outlined what I’m trying to do/achieve in more detail, primarily, ”access my remote mailbox and reduce its content” you may now decide take this enquiry a different direction.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Re: #2 - Not really going to change the direction and go back to the original response where the first option would be to log into your email account via webmail (your browser). 
<br />
<br />If you can't log into your account, then it's an issue that needs to be taken up with your email service provider.
<br />
<br />Re: #1 - Yes, if you configure your email account as an IMAP account, everything deleted from your &lt;Inbox&gt; will be removed from the server. You should also make sure that you remove everything from your &lt;Deleted Items&gt; folder
<br />
<br />Re: emClient - 
<br />
<br />Have just gone through the process of configuring both a hosted Exchange account and an Outlook.com account just by entering the email address/password with no issues. The Outlook.com account was configured automatically as an IMAP account so not entirely sure how (Exchange or IMAP) the account would be configured since your email provider is BTConnect and not Microsoft.
<br />
<br />In short, any issues with your account should be reviewed with your email service provider as the starting point especially if you can't log into your account via webmail (your browser)

                    Using the Find and Replace function, I am finding many times that it does not work.&nbsp; I am working with Contact data that has been imported from the web via a software tool that imports them into Outlook.&nbsp; From Outlook, I export the contacts into Access.&nbsp;
 Quite often, I want to delete certain words from the table.&nbsp; I am finding the Find and Replace function does not work.&nbsp; After highlighting the entire field, I click the binoculars button and enter the word to be deleted in the Find dialog.&nbsp; of course, Replace
 will be left empty.&nbsp; Access will return the message, "Microsoft Office Access finished searching the records.&nbsp; The search item was not found." This occurs when the word I am trying to replace is on almost every line in that particular field. In this case,
 the field is the Notes field, but this has happened in other instances too.&nbsp; What is going on here?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I am using Office 2003 with Win 7.

            <p>I was hoping there would be a way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example: I need an equation to average the totals in line 58 for each weekday (all of the numbers that take place on Mondays, one for Tuesdays, etc). &nbsp;The date is located in line one. Some of the totals in line 58 will be zero which means the equation

            <p>Another way, if you don't mind adding a row.</p>
<p>Insert a row below row 1 and in B2 put the formula:&nbsp;=TEXT(B1,"ddd") and copy to the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then in E64, formula is&nbsp;=AVERAGEIFS($B$58:$AE$58,$B$2:$AE$2,"Mon",$B$58:$AE$58,"&lt;&gt;0"). In F64, formula is the same but with "Mon" changed to "Tue" and so on.</p>

<h2>            Office Mac 2011&#58; Rounded corner picture box</h2>
                    Hi, i'm having a problem in that I can't add rounded corners onto pictures i import into word.
<div>You'd think it was quite simple but alas word is not that clever.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>You can create auto-shapes and then use the fill filters to add an image but then it distorts the image to fill the box disabling any crop functionality you'd normally have.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So other than creating the images with a rounded box in photoshop is there another way?</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Microsoft Word and Excel Continue To Shut Down With an Error Message</h2>
                    I'm having a real issue with Microsoft Office 365 Home Edition shutting down when I first open the programs.&nbsp; The message states that it needs to be repaired and gives you an option to repair or close.&nbsp; If I'm in the middle of creating a document it does
 not allow me to save it and abruptly shuts down.&nbsp; This happens at least 2-3 times a day before it finally allows me to work uninterrupted. Anyone else having that issue? If so, how can it be corrected for good?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;

            I would also recommend running the repair, and strongly suggest using the online repair as it's more in depth. You may also want to try running them in safe mode to see if they still crash.

            If running repairs does not work your next step would be to uninstall and re-install.
<br />
<br />VARIOUS UNINSTALL METHODS FOR OFFICE VIA: CONTROL PANEL / FIX IT / TROUBLE SHOOTER / MANUALLY 
<br />
<br />SIMPLE/ “SOFT” UNINSTALL SAVES CUSTOMIZATION SETTINGS, IN THEORY!
<br />Since day one, what became Office applications have had quality problems. So MS designed them to be “user friendly”. You can do a simple uninstall, from the Control Panel and the process leaves behind your configuration files, like Normal.DOTM for Word, and Registry Entries. The developers came up with a 4 step “fast and dirty” trouble shooting process for themselves and for users:
<br />.  Step 1, start the application in Safe Mode to disable addins.
<br />.   Step 2, do an Office Repair
<br />.   Step 3, un-install through the control panel then re-install The re-install picks up the exiting configuration information to save the user the effort of having to re-setup their installation
<br />.   Step 4, do a full uninstall-reinstall using the appropriate “fix-it” script.  This wipes all configuration information, on the chance the problem in is in the configuration files/registry. 
<br />
<br />This “soft” uninstall also plays a part in “upgrades”. During an upgrade do a simple unstall either manually or through the upgrade installer and the upgraded installation will pick up the existing configuration information making for a “painless” User Experience. That has been my experience with Office over a couple of decades.  Except now, I read in this article that this author had a different experience, Office 365 has been  sometimes losing his existing configuration. &lt;hmmmm&gt; You can read the details here under the subsection “My Settings Matter”:  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/29/office_woes/?page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/29/office_...</a>

<br />
<br />Method 1: Uninstall from Control Panel
<br />Method 2: Uninstall using Fix it
<br />Note: If you are using a 64-bit operating system, save the fixit tool on the system and then run it from the saved location. 
<br />Method 3: Remove manually
<br />
<br />Word has a long history of requiring frequent re-installs to “fix issues”. Therefore long ago it was designed to make uninstall/re-install “painless”.  They do that by NOT removing EVERYTHING. The control panel uninstall leaves various “configuration” files (like normal.dotm) and registry entries behind to be picked up by the next Word/Office install.  If the problem is in these configuration settings it would just be carried over. The “Fix It” tool in Method 2 wipes out everything
<br />
<br />Boot the computer before doing the re-install
<br />
<br />NOTE: one user reported still having problems even after running the documented uninstall. Their recommendation was after doing the delete:
<br />•	Open a command window as administrator
<br />•	Paste the following command:
<br />sc.exe delete officesvc
<br />•	Run it
<br />
<br />They reported this fixed their uninstall problem 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/uninstall-microsoft-office-2013-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/uninstall-microso...</a>  - This page is a “how-to” on using fix it and has screen captures of the whole uninstall process
<br />
<br />NOTE: BEFORE you uninstall, if you have an “Office 2013” bundle make sure you have your 25 character product key. If you have “Office 365”, make sure you can access the MyAccount page: 
<br />
<br />Note: 
<br />If you get Office Error Code 30068-4 (3) on an install after running the Fix It script
<br />An "Insider" suggested the following fix:
<br />.
<br />The reason for this error is the installer will remove everything, except the "ClickToRunSvc", which will be left in ZOMBIE state. 
<br />.
<br />The service will be listed in the services.msc console, but in a state that won't run or be enumerated.
<br />.
<br />Fix
<br />Make sure that all copies of Office have been uninstalled from the computer using the appropriate "Fix it" tool. If the problem continues, try this:
<br />•	Open a CMD window (using Run As Admin)
<br />•	Type
<br />sc delete ClickToRunSvc
<br />•	 Hit Enter.
<br />.
<br />Install setup should now run without issues.
<br />
<br />
<br />BACKUP IMPORTANT WORD FILES BEFORE UNINSTAL
<br />1.	Normal.dotm:  Stores formatted AutoCorrect entries, AutoText entries, keyboard shortcuts, styles, macros.
<br />2.	Custom templates you create (.dotm/.dotx files).
<br />3.	 Global Templates in the Startup folder
<br />4.	.acl file:  Stores unformatted AutoCorrect entries.  The easiest way to locate this file is to add an entry and look for the most current modified date in your search.
<br />5.	custom.dic file:  Words you add during spellcheck.
<br />Where these files are located depends on your version of Word and Windows.  The name of the .acl file also depends on your version of Word.  The template files can be found in File menu &gt; Options command &gt; Advanced option &gt; File Locations … button. 
<br />BACKUP AUTOCORRECT ENTRIES (2007+) 
<br />Also see: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/926927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/926927</a> 
<br />
<br />Jay Freedman has created a template that makes it easier to backup your Autocorrect entries.
<br />Download <a href="http://jay-freedman.info/AutoCorrect2007.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://jay-freedman.info/AutoCorrect2007.zip</a> and extract the AutoCorrect.dotm template from it into your Templates folder. While you are in the Templates folder, make a copy of your NORMAL.DOTM, it contains Autocorrect Entries that are formatted. Either open the template itself or make a new document based on it. It will automatically display a message box, in which you should click the Backup button. The macro will create a document containing all your entries in a table, and then opens the Save As dialog.
<br />After installing Office 2010, open the template (or a document based on it) in Word 2010 and click the Restore button. When prompted, locate the backup document. The macro will put the entries into the Normal template and/or the ACL file as needed.
<br />There have been some reports (such as this) that the Restore part of the template will fail when there are thousands of entries to process. If that happens, split the backup document into multiple documents, each with no more than about 1000 entries. If you have to split the document into several separate documents, each document must have the “AutoCorrect Backup Document” heading as the first paragraph, and the table must have the column titles as the first row.  (Technically, the macro only looks at the document’s first word, which must be AutoCorrect followed by a space, as a simple check that it’s probably a valid backup; and it ignores the table’s first row, although it could be empty.) Then run the Restore once for each of those documents—the macro never deletes any entry, it only adds new ones (or overwrites if there is an existing entry with the same name).
<br />Jay’s page also has ultilies for dumping AutoText entries from Word 2000-2003: <a href="http://jay-freedman.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://jay-freedman.info/</a>

    <title>Excel Pivot Table&#58; Outputting detail on multiple tabs - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel Pivot Table&#58; Outputting detail on multiple tabs automatically.</h2>
                    In older versions of Excel, there was a way of creating a data table per tab automatically, without the need to double click each value in the main pivot table.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me if this is possible in Excel 2007 and hif so, how?

            Please note that the phone has limited RAM. Are you running too many applications on the background or RAM eating widgets? This could cause hangups.

            You can't set a default zoom for Excel. however, you can create a worksheet template with the desired zoom, so each new worksheet will have this zoom level. To set the zoom level for more than one sheet at a time, select the sheet tabs and then set the
 zoom level via View-Zoom.<br />

<h2>            Outlook very slow to respond.</h2>
                    <p>Outlook very slow to respond. I have more than one copy of folders for the same email account {acct 1}. Folder structures are not identical.</p>
<p>I have a different email account (acct 2) as well with it's own file structure. When I send an email from this account (acct 2}, it isn't sent, but remains in the Outbox of the account (acct 1).</p>
<p>When I try to delete a group of emails from my (acct 1) Inbox, I get a msg "Outlook not responding". After a considerable time, Outlook does respond, the files go to the Trash folder and everything settles down.</p>
<p>How can I fix this?</p>
<p>I should point out, I'm using IMAP.</p>

<br />Why did I end up with two "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" account/file listing?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />You're on outlook 2010, so you should have a pst file in the profile, plus an imap data file for each imap account. The pst is usually not named with the email address though. 
<br />
<br />It's possible that you have an extra folder and its causing problems, but you'd have 4 folders - the default pst, then a duplicate for acct1 and the data folder for acct2.  
<br />
<br />You could try a second profile with only acct2 and see if it can send mail. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />To aid in  my explaining things, what is the precise name for the panel down the left hand side of the Outlook page where the file structure/s is/are displayed? 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Folder list or folder pane.

            <p>When you state <em>"determine whether they are within a certain percentage of each other"</em>, it would help to know&nbsp;<em>"a percentage of what"?</em>. Simple math would dictate that dividing one number by the other would approach&nbsp;<em>100%</em> as the number
 neared each other (from <em>0</em> to <em>100%</em> one way and from ∞ to 100% from the other way. To keep in one direction you could apply MIN() and MAX().</p>
<p>
</p><p>=MIN(a1, b1)/MAX(a1, b1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would approach&nbsp;<em>100%</em> as the two numbers became close to each other. To get the&nbsp;<em>percentage&nbsp;of difference</em> rather than the
<em>percentage of closeness</em> subtract that from <em>1</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=1-MIN(a1, b1)/MAX(a1, b1)</p>

            <p>The app has been installed on a microSD card, but this install has been unlinked from the phone. Is the data saved in the app on the microSD card? Or are the results saved in the cloud linked by the user ID? Is there any way to access this data by developer
 unlocking the phone or something alike?&nbsp;</p>

            Nope. The app data is deleted once you uninstall the app. Some apps however will restore the data if you reinstall the app again.

            <p>You can't extract the any data related to the app like that. Did you remove the SD card and are you using a different one now?
</p>
<p>Try installing the app, some apps have the user's data backed up in phone memory/cloud, if your app supports it, you could recover your past test results.</p>

<p>I cannot answer where it will be found on your phone's SD card. However, on my Windows 10 laptop, it is C:\Users\rsarg_000\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.NetworkSpeedTest_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\historyV1.xml.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are obvious bits of that path that may differ on anyone else's system, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With luck, this will help you find the history on your phone.</p>

    <title>window controls being intentionally hidden by design in Outlook&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scott_899  say:</h3>
<h2>            window controls being intentionally hidden by design in Outlook&#63; &#40;minimise, maximise, exit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I understand that the minimise, maximise and exit buttons are "greyed out" during multiple windows being open and that only the "active" window has these controls visible.</p>
<p>I also understand that this is not a fault and is a software design intention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find this to be highly annoying, as I wish to decide as a user how I use multiple windows, in which case I want all window contols visible at all times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to have multiple windows open during copying and pasting from my desktop screen into open email windows in outlook for example.</p>
<p>Although they are still still functional, "hiding the controls" is simply very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this please?</p>

            <p>Ok thank you for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem then that there is a "disconnect" between what users want to be able to do in a very basic way and the software design intentions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not logical or intuative to allow multiple windows functionality and then restrict the usablilty of that function by "greying out the controls"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user should have the ability to manipulate any window amoungst multiple windows in the order the user decides, leaving all window controls visible at all times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The controls are active at all times if you mouse over and click, so why hide them and make it difficult?</p>

            <p>Windows has become such a complex program that they cannot add all features for all users.&nbsp; With over 2.5 million lines of code they must concentrate on the features the vast majority of users would want and minimize all the others to keep the program responsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides you can only work on one window at a time and the feature you want can be accomplished with a single extra mouse click</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes I understand....so they should simplify it by removing those "lines of code" that just complicate the situtation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you can only work on one window at a time, users need the controls visible at all times on all windows in order to minimise but not close any of the multiple windows, in the order the user decides.</p>
<p>It just seems ludicrous to me to hide controls like that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically giving me multiple windows functionality - but taking it back by hiding the controls to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It certainly reduces the usability of the basic windows function in a very basic and annoying way.</p>

            <p>Below is what I mean. Yes they are functional, so why HIDE them - I need to SEE them. They are all "active" as far as I am concerned otherwise they wouldn't be there in the first place.
</p>
<p>Now, should I want to minimise one or both the middle windows temporarily as I often need to, the controls are made difficult to see??</p>
<p>We should not be having to click all over the place just to get windows to re light up window controls that should not be dulled or hidden in the first place.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, it counters the very functionality of the mulitple window function if you cant SEE it??</p>

<h2>            Office 365 for large families &#40;6&#43;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have been managing my family's email on Google Mail for quite some time and I would really rather move to Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 6 adults and 4 child accounts that I manage and each one has an email. Do I really need to go onto a business plan to support my family? That sounds a little bit of overkill and expensive. The lowest tarif that I can find would be £31 per month, that's
 over £370 a year. Google Apps&nbsp;Mail is free for me right now, but sucks. It just does not suck to the tune of £370 a year...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something between Office for Office 365 Home (max 5 users and £79.99) and Office 365 Business Premium (300 users and £370 for 10) which is more than double the cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the features of Office 365 Home, but for 10 users... my family is not a business... is there such a plan?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Using more than one account to manage</p>
<p>+using own domain for email</p>

<h2>            Incredimail</h2>
                    I cannot get Incredimail to be my default mail service. I have done everything to make it my default but nothing happens. When I want to mail something of my desktop, I get the message that no email is set up. Any ideas?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description I understand that you are having issues in making IncrediMail a default mail service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer to the mentioned steps and see if it helps:</p>
<p>
To configure IncrediMail as the default email client, simply open IncrediMail, click the
<span>'Tools'</span> menu, select <span>
'Options...'</span> and click the <span>'Make Default'</span> button.
<br />
<br />
If the 'Make Default' button is grayed out, yet IncrediMail still does not act as your default email client, please do the following:
<br />
<br />
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the IncrediMail Tray Icon (the orange envelope), located in the lower right-hand corner (near the computer clock) and select
<span>'Exit'</span>. </li><li>Open Outlook Express, click the <span>'Tools'</span> menu and select
<span>'Options...'</span>. </li><li>At this point, the <span>'Options'</span> dialog opens. Click the
<span>'Make Default'</span> button and close the <span>
'Options...'</span> dialog. </li><li>Close Outlook Express and open IncrediMail. In the IncrediMail main window, click the
<span>'Tools'</span> menu and select <span>
'Options...'</span>. </li><li>At this point, the <span>'Options'</span> dialog opens. Click the
<span>'Make Default'</span> buttonand close the <span>
'Options'</span> dialog. </li><li>IncrediMail is now configured as your Windows default email client. </li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

</p><p>Is your database split? If it was split, then you separate the data from the rest of your db.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even as is, can you not use a backup to replace the corrupted objects?&nbsp; Create a new db, import the table for your corrupted db and then import the other objects from a backup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you truly need the most recent versions of your objects, then your only chance, would be to try the undocuemented SaveAsText &amp; LoadFromText, but there are no garantees!</p>

<p>THIS IS SO STUPID!! YOU CANNOT TURN THE RINGER OFF!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF I AM USING MY SAMSUNG S7 WITH MY HEADPHONES IN AND A CALL COMES IN I GET BLASTED BY A SUPER LOUD, GENERIC SKYPE RINGTONE!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'LL BE DEAF INSIDE OF A YEAR!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old Skype allowed you to customize ringtones etc, you people need to fix this, it's just one thing after another, MSFT has absolutely ruined this app!! It's super duper counter intuitive to conference someone in (used to be EASY AS PIE) and then this
 volume blast, get some new people on the team here because honestly, whoever is working on this right now - destroyed Skype!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>That doesn't solve ANYTHING. I need to control the ringtone and ringtone volume IN the app - I don't want Skype to ring on my phone or my desktop, I just want a visual alert!! If I'm playing music on my phone or my laptop and a call comes in the Skype ringer
 is like 10x louder than the rest of the media!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm listening in headphones or playing via my speakers its SUPER loud and jarring, this can easily result in hearing damage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not cool. Skype was way better before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to be able to add any audio I wanted as my ringtone too!!! If I had that option now I'd put the ringtone as quiet wind or leaves rustling or just SILENCE!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody really needs to fix what y'all broke cause its awful now!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh AND i finally figured out how to conference someone in but I've yet to sort out how to remove that person from the conference in the event that they don't pick up, I get their voicemail or some such thing...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new interface is all very nice looking, clean lines and all but in terms of usability its just atrocious... Sorry but that's how I feel and I'm not alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh AND one more thing - what happened to the personalized voicemail greeting? This generic greeting is really lame!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the ringing sound, I'm afraid to say that there's no option to change it. Have you tried changing your presence&nbsp;status to Do Not Disturb? You will still receive a call but there will be no ringing sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For details on how to change your presence status, you may refer to this article for complete details:

</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the new Skype mobile version, when you make a conference call, all call will end if you click the drop call button, but for the new Skype on the computer version, you will be able to drop a call being initiated for each user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The automated voicemail is set&nbsp;to align all Microsoft products, since Skype is also under Microsoft's services.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With all due respect, that's a terrible "solution" to an annoying problem!! If I have Do Not Disturb on then other users will most likely see that and assume I'm not to be contacted so that defeats the purpose. Furthermore, I just set it to "Do Not Disturb"
 and guess what? MY PHONE STILL RANG!!!! What a joke!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be a way to turn the ringer off on both mobile and desktop versions, furthermore, there should be a way to set up custom ringtones like Skype had in the past. This looks like another case of Microsoft ruining a perfectly good app!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>AGAIN: If I am listening to music or other media and a call comes in, the skype ringer is 5x louder than what I am listening to!!! This is not only annoying it is potentially harmful to our hearing!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You guys need a better devs team working on this, its getting worse by the minute. Skype is getting more and more counterintuitive by the minute....</p>

<p>Calling version 2018.18.01.11) and the same on my Android. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Still doesn't work - can't mute the ringer, the fact that I should have to ask is a major RED FLAG - you guys have F'd this app up - it looks pretty compared to old versions but it's **** when it comes to functionality - the fact that there's no personalized
 ringtones and no personalized voicemail points to show crap things are in Skypeville.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You guys really need to get things sorted. People rely on Skype for business, a generic voicemail greetings is super unprofessional.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there were alternatives, I'd already cancel my paid subscription to Skype but as far as I can tell, MagicJack sucks, there's just not the many options, there are some but they each have their drawbacks....</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/939ce984-4af1-43f3-b549-84dd6f303384" title="OAKRG">
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid to say that the option is not yet available for new Skype 8.21. I suggest you to use
<em><strong><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">classic Skype</a></strong></em> where you can configure the ringer for each messages or call notifications.

<p>

    <title>Contacts do not download to Audi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nigel page  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contacts do not download to Audi</h2>
                    My Audi does not download the contacts from my Windows Phone 8, but my wife's Golf does! I've tried this with a Nokia Lumia 920 and an HTC 8X with identical results, so I'm pretty sure that it's not the phone. Interestingly, the Golf connects to my phone,
 then I get prompted to allow the contacts to be synched with the car, but for the Audi, the phone connects to the car and I never get prompted. This worked perfectly with my previous Windows Phone 7 device in both cars, but it looks like there might be a problem
 with Windows Phone 8 when the phone initiates the connection&nbsp;and any assistance or confirmation of a bug would be appreciated.

I have 2012 Mercedes E350 and am currently the owner of (no less than) the third Lumia 920 in four months. The first two phone downloaded the contacts into my car telephone quite nicely, but had problems with charging using the USB cable. Yesterday I received
 the third (3!!) Lumia 920 and this one does not download contacts into the car radio nor does it charge using the USB cable. At this point one correction: All three phones initially charged using the USB cable, but the moment I made the blue tooth connection,
 they've all stopped charging in the car.&nbsp;
<div>I am desperate for a solution since the iPhone I used to use had no such issues.&nbsp;</div>
<div>=&gt; Couple of hours since I posted this: I called Microsoft who said this is not their problem. Call Nokia. So I called Nokia and after some lightweight troubleshooting they asked me to reset the phone to the factory settings. I don't mind doing that except
 none of the downloaded apps, nor re-sized icons will stay the same. I basically have to start from the scratch.</div>
