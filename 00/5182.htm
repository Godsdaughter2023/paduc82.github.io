            You might be stuck then.....I've searched around the web a little and <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Other-Office-Tools/ABC-Amber-Text-Converter.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
there's some software (Amber Text Converter) that says it can convert pwi files</a>.&nbsp; You might download and try the 30 day trial to see if it will work for you.<br />
<br />
If you have a friend with a windows mobile device, you could copy the files to that device, then use ActiveSync to sync it to Outlook on an XP computer and you should be able to read your ink notes there.&nbsp; I don't think WMDC on a Vista or Windows 7 computer
 handles these files very well.<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for trying to help, I tried amber, but no luck, it says failure every time i try to open the pwi.</p>
<p>My friends all use Iphones and Android, actually, this rather annoying issue with having the pwi files and not being able to see them makes me think they might be right :)</p>
<p>i will try to find someone though, if you have any other suggestions, please let me know, and thanks again for the help!</p>

<h2>            Unlocking</h2>
                    Hi just noticed that Karim said that unlocking the phone by other means is illegal, how? What law says it it illegal to unlock your own property? From my understanding it would only be illegal to stop paying the mobile operator what they are owed from
 the contract you sign with them, no where does it say that you are not allowed use this phone on another network...

            The networks lock the handset to recoupe the subsidy they levy against the hardware. Its also to try and stop fraud.<br />
<br />
Most networks charge a fee to do this to offset their initial subsidy after the 12 month contract is up or normally a 3 month time has elapsed on prepay.<br />
<br />
The networks rely on you using their network, yes payiong the monthly fee , and making calls etc, as of course they are a business and need to make profit like all other firms.<br />
<br />
My way of getting round this is to go thro Carfone warehouse for my handsets as they all come unlocked, contract and prepay.<br />
<br />
Karim is right as the issue on unlocking is a grey area and is not deemed suitable to give advice etc on how to unlock fones.<br />
<br />
If a user changes the security code from the default to a new personall one then the handset has to be booked in to have it flashed etc to return it to the original 12345.

            And as for network locking - that still doesnt answer my question about what law says its illegal to unlock the handset via other means. I know the networks subsidise the price of the phones but there is no *legal obligation* for them to be paid back!!!
 You cant be obliged to do a lot of things with a pay as you go handset for two reasons: there is no written or verbal agreement signed by the owner, also if you dont register the handset then who will they know is responsible. If the phone is a bill phone
 then the networks are guaranteed their subsidy money back because even if you unlock a bill phone and move networks you will then be obliged to pay your minimum tariff fee. Networks cant tell if the handset has been unlocked and thirdly if the Carphone WH.
 provides phones that are by default unlocked then it cant be against the law as the law requires consistency; not for one customer to get free choice and for another not to....<br />
<br />
So again my question is: What law or trusted source says it's illegal to unlock your phone?<br />

            I believe one was referring to Contract Tarifs, and the other to Pay &amp; Go Tarifs...<br />
<br />
This topic isn't really asking for support though, which is the purpose of these boards...<br />
<br />
The complaint should go to the networks, as they lock the handsets - not Nokia.

            This has been discussed so much already on this forum. If you want a SIM free handset buy it SIM free, you will pay more than a network locked handset.<br />
<br />
For the lock code, it is there is case your handset gets stolen ans so as far as i know to get it unlocked you need to go to a repair centre with documentation to prove it is your own handset.<br />
<br />
If you have forgotten the code... well whose fault is that? If it needs reset due to a fault then i am sure that would be covered by the warranty.<br />
<br />
As far as I am aware there Nokia do not have a master reset code as that would make the whole security code pointless becasue how long would it be before such a code was to become widely available and completely negate the point of the security code.

            "whose fault is it if you've forgooten your code"-are you saying you've never forgotten anything important?<br />
<br />
And for the third time the question I posted was: "What makes it illegal to unlock your own phone?!" I already know phones are subsidised etc...but that doesnt necessarily make it illegal to unlock the phone by going to an unlock shop etc... So can someone
 just answer this: Is it *ILLEGAL* and if so what law? I am only asking because I was going to offer an unlocking service in my shop but I wont do it if its illegal, i am not looking for someones opinion about the matter, i just want to know is it illegal or
 not? and the reason i ask what law is because its very easy to come along and say yes its when it may not be....<br />
<br />
I have never heard of anyone being prosecuted for it and loads of places openly advertise the service....<br />

            Have you looked in all the fine print of contracts? I would think it would be in there somewhere, in which case the law will be breach of contract.<br />
<br />
Maybe the statement in question could have been worded alternatively, so it didn't mislead anyone like this. I don't see what the problem is really:<br />
If you need to get your phone unlocked - contact the network.<br />
If you object to having to get it unlocked - buy them SIM-free.

 I try to click, and if I simple try typing, nothing appears.</p>

            <p>Thanks Bob - that was a helpful explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I tried using Word online, but at present it's not accepting .docm files. However a box suggested I tried Microsoft's OneDrive, which I did. That could only open it as read-only, and suggested if I wanted to edit it, try Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was about to give up, when I was opening another folder, and saw the "Open with: Pages" option. Completely forget that comes with new Macs. I tried it, and that worked. So I can now open and edit these too. Work around is good!</p>

<p>I have a Nokia 6750 mural cell phone since Dec,2009 and I want to have it unlocked. However, the at&amp;t carrier does not have the unlock code of mine. Does anyone know how to get a unlock code for the Nokia 6750(Mural) phone?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            The only people who can unlock a phone are the people who locked it in the first place. If the phone is locked to the AT&amp;T network then only AT&amp;T can help you.<br />
<br />
Whether or not they're WILLING to help is another question. Either way round, nobody here or anywhere else other than AT&amp;T CAN help.

            After your 2 year contact with AT&amp;T is completed they will unlock it for you if you ask. It's the law. Prior to then it is a hit or miss depending on who you talk to at AT&amp;T. Some will but I think the company policy is that they should not.

<p>I called my carrier AT$T to request for unlocking code, the person (a man)&nbsp; told me immediately that I'm not eligible to unlock my phone and Nokia hasn't provided them with the code. I didn't give up and went to this site to get more help. The Chat Support
 Representative told me to contact the Customer Service at 1888-665-4228. The Service Rep (Michelle) was very helpful, and guide me on what to do. She asked me to call AT&amp;T again and put the call in conference (so she could assist me, if there is a problem).
 However, this time I was lucky, since the AT&amp;T Rep (Jessica T) was very helpful. She talked to me and assist me for almost 25 minutes, but it was all worth it since at the end I got my unlocking code immediately with the instruction how to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are right, it depends whom you are talking to in AT&amp;T, the first person I spoke to definitely, has no intention of giving me the code, by passing the bucket to Nokia.</p>

<h2>            Word 2011 Mac--Updating fields causes pictures to be copied and inserted just prior to their cross-references</h2>
                    <p>Hi all! I appreciate any help on this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am preparing a scientific manuscript in Word 2011 (Mac). In order to include high quality figures without blowing up my file size, I inserted all pictures as "Linked to file" without saving with the document. I have also used Word's cross-referencing system
 to automatically number and reference figures, tables, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I update fields in the document (part of saving to PDF or formatting my references), some of the figures are copied multiple times and appear before their cross-reference in the text. The surrounding text is then converted to the caption style. This
 doesn't happen with all of the figures, and it happens to different figures each time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea how to fix this. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Hi Cameron:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn your paragraph marks and field shading on, so you can see what you are doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Word standard toolbar you will see the "Show all non-printing characters" button (¶). &nbsp;Click it so that the paragraph marks and spaces appear in the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Word&gt;Preferences&gt;View and turn "Field Shading" to "Always".</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two things enable you to see where the boundaries of the items are,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you can see the caption numbers have gone grey, showing that they are active fields. &nbsp;If you select one and toggle the field codes you will see {&nbsp;
<span>SEQ Figure \* ARABIC }. &nbsp;"SEQ" is the type of field (a numbering field) and "Figure" makes this field a member of the "Figures" collection in the document.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you insert a cross-reference, Word will retrieve the text of the entire paragraph that contains the SEQ field that's a member of the Figures collection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Because you can now see where your paragraph marks are, you can now ensure that the caption and the picture are sitting in separate paragraphs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you right-click the picture and check that its Wrap Text property is set to &nbsp;"Inline with text" the picture will now settle in to the paragraph that contains it. &nbsp;If you want to have text flowing around
 the picture, you can leave the wrapping style the way it is; in which case a little Anchor symbol will appear at the top left corner of the paragraph to which the picture is anchored.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Either way, you need to ensure that there is a paragraph between the picture and the paragraph that is the caption: otherwise the cross-reference will suck the picture in along with the caption.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps</span></p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Thanks John!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply nearly got me the whole way. The final step was to ensure that the paragraph containing the figure was formatted with the "normal" style instead of the "caption" style. This had been mixed up in the process of deleting figures and replacing them
 with new ones while keeping the old caption in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are amazing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do you combine multiple email accounts when the &#34;change folder&#34; button is missing in Outlook 2010&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Coming from Outlook 2002, I was surprised to see in my fresh install of Outlook 2010, my multiple email accounts have been given each an unique inbox. I did an internet search for how to combine them to one inbox and sent items folder. Each time I get the
 same answer: use the "change folder" button in Account Settings' email tab. However, this button is not present where it should be according to screen shots and I cannot find it anywhere else.</p>
<p>So, is there a way to combine multiple email account to just one inbox and sent items folder? And what do I do with the .pst Outlook now makes for each email account if I just want one.pst file?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>PS</p>
<p>Problem appears on two machines with different licences and different OS's (XP &amp; Windows 7)</p>

<p>Which mail account types are you using?<br />
You cannot combine multiple Exchange accounts, IMAP accounts or Outlook Hotmail Connector accounts to go into the same pst-file.</p>
<p>You can deliver multiple POP3 account to a single pst-file, set a POP3 account to deliver to an Exchange account or set an Exchange account to deliver to a pst-file.</p>

            There is no one-button solution because Insider previews are full builds of Windows and you cannot "backgrade."&nbsp; That has always been the case with Windows.&nbsp; Go to your WIP page and click Stop Getting Preview Builds and you will be presented with a number
 of options for moving to a public release of Windows (currently build 15063).&nbsp; The best option at this juncture is the last one.&nbsp; It will suspend preview builds until the Fall Creators Update rolls out in a month and then upgrade you to that and end your participation
 in the Insider Program (on that device only).&nbsp; That is the only method that will preserve your apps, files, and settings as they are now.&nbsp; Other methods require a clean installation of Windows 10 Creators Update.

            A large part of the public is impulsive or believes "It'll never happen to me."&nbsp; Most don't read the instructions anyway. I don't mind helping a person of good will but not somebody who blames everything on Microsoft.

<h2>            Always ask before downloading file checkbox is missing</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to uncheck the box that says always ask before downloading this file for zip files so that they get saved automatically. The problem is on windows 7 64 bit, I don't even see that option on the Open/save/Cancel dialog box. How do I get this checkbox
 to show up? Also, I'm using internet explorer 8. Thanks in advance, I've been searching and searching for an answer and NOBODY knows!</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 doesn&#39;t respect Track Changes preferences</h2>
                    Word 2010. &nbsp;In each Word 2010&nbsp;document I change my editing preferences so that deletions and comments appear in balloons down the side of the document rather than strikethrough in the text itself. I find strikethrough looks very messy and confusing for
 readers and&nbsp;I am sorry it is the default setting in this version of Word. When I attach and email the document however I am told &nbsp;it reverts to strikethrough within the text rather than my preferences being kept. I have emailed documents to myself to check
 this&nbsp;and it still happens. It is not a problem opening a document from my computer - my editing preferences show up in this case. It is only an issue when I send&nbsp;the document&nbsp;to someone. Microsoft Help Desk has suggested it is an issue with my email provider
 - Yahoo. But I don't think so. Has anyone got any ideas???? i have tried clicking and unclicking 'document update' - and that doesn't change a thing.

            Track changes preferences are not set in the document, but on the user profile. They control the way any document opened is viewed. I suspect, that like screen resolution and the choice about whether or not to view non-printing formatting marks, whoever
 designed the program thought that those decisions were best left in the hands of the individual user rather than the document creator.<br />
<br />
I know that when balloons were the default it brought a number of complaints because the traditional markup method was to underline insertions and strikeout deletions.<br />
<br />
When you email people you can tell them that the changes are best viewed the way you prefer and give them instructions on how to change it if you want.<br />
<br />
You could even include a separate document with a macro that will change those preferences for people.<br />
<br />
By the way, although this is a Microsoft hosted forum, responses here come from your fellow users.<br />

<h2>            Two Outlook accounts, Chrome browser</h2>
                    When using Google Chrome browser, I can only log onto one of my Outlook webmail accounts. Opening another screen defaults to the same, already open Outlook account. &nbsp;I cannot open the other Outlook account simultaneously. &nbsp;I have to close the first Outlook
 account. &nbsp;Is it possible to have both accounts open simultaneously without using Explorer?

            <p>Hello AS_794,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your time for posting your concern here in the Microsoft Community.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow me to assist you on your query about using 2 Microsoft accounts simultaneously. In addition to<strong> MVP Ron</strong> and
<strong>MVP Brian</strong>'s post, I've simulated&nbsp;your issue and I&nbsp;was able to access 2 different Microsoft accounts at the same time when using private browsing for the other account. This is possible regardless what browser you're using as long as you're
 using private browsing (<strong>Incognito mode for Google Chrome or In-private browsing for Internet Explorer</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you can also try to add another Microsoft account to your primary account. We have an option in Outlook.com that you can receive and send emails without accessing your secondary account. To know more, refer to the Microsoft article below.</p>

<p>This type of addition is not necessary.&nbsp; In fact, it feels somewhat condescending to me.&nbsp; My preference would be for you not to add this to your posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also curious why you included a Canadian English link rather than the US English link, since this is the US English-based forum.&nbsp; Here's the US English link:</p>

            <p>This is extremely necessary.&nbsp; The Mail app in MODERN UI has this neat ability to add multiple account which are listed at the very bottom left corner and you just have to select which account you want to read and send email from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is absolutely necessary and I'm wondering why we don't have this in the Desktop IE Browser version of Outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agreed that logging off and logging in and logging off again to go back to the primary email account is a tedious task and takes time !</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instence I have my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account (PRIMARY) and my
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** account (SECONDARY)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like the MODERN UI, we could have both at the bottom left corner and just click the one we would like to use.&nbsp; That's all.&nbsp; If you select SECONDARY it'll stay in this one for each subsequent use.&nbsp; I would like to see this feature in Outlook.com in the Desktop
 version because in MODERN UI it's very interesting !</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would be tempted to ask why not just using the MODERN UI ?&nbsp; Well, if only both would have all the same features I would definitely use only the MODERN UI version but it's not the case.</p>

    <title>Why does MS need to be so intrusive regarding my browsing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does MS need to be so intrusive regarding my browsing&#63;</h2>
                    Why is MS spying on me? I had Edge open with 4 tabs, but was doing something else in IE, and I received a message from MS asking my why I was using IE and not Edge! That is way too Draconian and straight out of the book 1984!

            This really does not address my issue. Why is MS sending me messages while I am using a browser asking me why I am not using Edge? This is kind of scary. It is like there is real time monitoring of what is being used and then sending a message asking why
 this or why that. Is this really MS's policy and procedure? Is there truly no privacy at all while using W10?

            This is in response to an email inquiry regarding this question from MS. I have not received an acceptable answer as the only answer I received is that it is my choice as to which browser I use. I want to know why MS is asking me why I am not using Edge
 while it is open with multiple tabs, and using IE 11 at the same time while I am using it. To me, this is far beyond what someone could expect out of any company providing an operating system. Please explain to me and the world how MS can justify this kind
 of Draconian invasion of privacy! If MS can tell which browser I am using, what else are they up to in regards to my privacy? The pages I visit? How long I am at any given site? Who my friends are? What are they doing? Far, far, far way too intrusive. It makes
 me want to choose another operating system that does not use this type of scrutiny and who knows what MS does with that information and who they give it to.

    <title>Microsoft Planner Comments Disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Planner Comments Disappearing</h2>
                    <p>Why do comments made in Microsoft Planner keep disappearing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen this question raised by others over the past year and there has been no advice, guidance or solution to this problem provided.&nbsp; The only solution that has been offered is to use a different product, which I am disinclined to do as this would
 be a massive change across the whole organisation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance or help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cover the basics of what I see has been asked by you to others with the same problem;<br />
</p>
<p>1. The comments are not being deleted by anyone</p>
<p>2. The conversation has not been deleted from Outlook</p>
<p>3. This does not effect all comments and there is no way to predict which comments will be affected.</p>
<p>4. After a comment has disappeared other comments can be added and will appear.</p>
<p>5. When a comment is added a outlook notification will be received.&nbsp; Once the comment has 'disappeared' the comment in the outlook conversation will appear as 'No text message'.</p>
<p>6. The group currently has approx 25 members, therefore not huge.</p>
<p>7. Comments that have been copied and pasted from other sources seem to be effected more but this is not always the case in all instances.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">These are how the 'disappeared' comments will appear in Planner.</span></p>

<p>Hi Neska,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We totally understand the inconvenience caused by the problem and will try our best to narrow down the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, when we checked the comments for the tasks that are created newly and tasks that are present in past, we didn’t encounter the behavior explained at your end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, as you clearly stated the answers for some questions (appreciate for it), we would like to the answers for the following scenarios:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Does this problem occurs for specific task in a Plan or all task in a Plan?</p>
<p>b. Does the problem occurs to specific plan or all plans in Planner?</p>
<p>c. Does the comments disappears at any specific duration of time after it being posted?</p>
<p>d. When did this problem occurs to start?</p>
<p>e. Is this problem occurs only for specific members comments or comments posted by anyone (like random)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can understand the frustration about asking queries again without any suggestion, but these queries will help us to narrow down the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chitrahaas</p>

<h2>            WARNING&#58;  Check your WIP settings NOW.  RS4 flights about to resume &#40;probably this week&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>If you are thinking about opting out of Fast Ring, do it now.&nbsp; Right now.&nbsp; If you are thinking about changing around devices between rings, do it now.&nbsp; Right now.&nbsp; If you are waiting for more information about updating to the new edition of Windows, Windows
 10 Pro for Workstations, change to Slow Ring to prevent having to clean install the new edition.&nbsp; Did I mention that you should do these things now?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The blog announcement is in the FH at&nbsp;&nbsp;https://aka.ms/Kb56sq</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take note of this part of the announcement:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>Insiders in the Fast Ring and those who joined Skip Ahead will begin receiving the same RS4 builds at the same time."&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That is the merger of the two Fast Ring branches back into just Fast Ring.&nbsp; There will not be any more Skip Ahead for many months.&nbsp; You will have to apply for Skip Ahead all over again if you want in next time it is enabled.&nbsp; The fact that you are
 in Skippy now will not matter for next time.</span></p>

<p>Additional thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The elimination of the Skippy branch will probably be done the same way it was established.&nbsp; As you may recall, MSFT pushed an update to the WIP page that set up the Fast Ring options for "Active Development" and "Skip Ahead."&nbsp; That update was not done through
 Window Update but used the PushToInstall service so users did not see the update when it happened like they would have in WU.&nbsp; That was to ensure everyone was on the same page in time for the creation of the Skippy branch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is reasonable to assume that removal of the Skippy branch will be done the same way, probably by changing the Applicability key in the registry on all Skippy builds to read the same as the Active Development Fast Ring builds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is done that way you will not see the change since registry changes normally don't require re-starts and PushToInstall updates are done my the TrustedUser with its admin permissions and you will not be asked to allow the change.&nbsp; Also, PushToInstall
 updates cannot be blocked using the Show or Hide Windows Updates utility or delayed by using WU settings.&nbsp; The idea is to get all Fast Ringers on the same page by a certain deadline. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for the advisory from the team this week may be that tomorrow is Patch Tuesday and 16299.15 will receive quality and security rollups tomorrow.&nbsp; That will include Fast Ring, Active Development but not Skippy.&nbsp; From that point forward an RS4 build
 can be flighted to all Fast Ringers any time.&nbsp; Probably on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Yea, thank you for that addition. You had me puzzled for a while as I am still very much on Skippy.</p>

            Hi Stephen, I'm finding out how in depth this bitcoin stuff is but getting a handle on it and definately &nbsp;going to give it a go. Miners have gone from hashing blockchains with cpu -&gt; gpu - ASIC rigs, some still going solo (as opposed to pools) with a simple
 ATI Mobility laptop, and some with 6-Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics gpu rigs. I'm going to use original Bitcoin-qt client and cpu just to see if I can do it. But you are right, the algorithm is now more extensive to hash and requires high power for speed, all requiring
 high electricity (costs). That's the big guys though with the massive cloud servers like Amazon Azure (recently hacked just for mining usage) and of course Microsofts Azure servers. And it's legal with our own rigs. Now, if Microsoft starts a pool on Azure,
 I would def join, just need that bitcoin address and no doubt a fee.

<h2>            Installing MS Office 2010 on a computer with no CD drive</h2>
                    I just got a new laptop after my old one had a meltdown, and am trying to figure out how to install MS Office Professional Plus 2010 onto my new laptop (which has Windows 8). &nbsp;I have all four disks, which I bought as a student through my university. &nbsp;When
 I try to open a document up, I get the screen that says it's MS Office Home and Student (not sure if this is different than Professional Plus) where it asks if I've already purchased MS Office, or if I want to do the trial version. &nbsp;If I say I've already purchased
 it, and try to plug in my product key, it says my product key is invalid. &nbsp;If I click on the "trial version," it just sends me to the default google chrome start-up screen, stays there for about two seconds, then takes me to the start menu where all my tiles
 are. &nbsp;From reading the other posts, I think I'm supposed to copy my discs to a USB, then put the USB on my new laptop, but I just wanted to make sure that was right, and wondered if it mattered th

            Home and Student versions and Professional Plus versions are not the same and their keys are not interchangeable.<br />
<br />
You can certainly copy the Office 2010 disc to a USB flash drive and install from the flash drive, but if installing Professional Plus on a PC that already has Home and Student, uninstall Home and Student first or you will be beset by activation issues.<br />

<h3> geeknaveen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Vostro 14 3446 Touchpad not working in Windows 10 Technical Preview</h2>
                    <p>I am using Dell Vostro 14 Notebook and I updated my windows 7 (32 bit) to windows 10 yesterday. Since I have installed windows 10, I am unable to use my touchpad driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see the touchpad anywhere (programs, device manager).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I have tried in order to fix this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed touchpad driver from Dell website. Since windows 10 was not listed there, so I had to install windows 7 (32 bit) touchpad driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed it, but nothing changed. As some users have suggested to try it in compatibility mode (I have tried both win 7 and 8), it didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to install touchpad driver from synaptic website and some other sources as well, but none of them worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please guide me how to fix this problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi PoojaSingh3,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we add a document which has the same file name as an existing document in SharePoint library, it is expected the document cannot be added and there will be a notification "A file with this name
 already exists. Would you like to replace the existing one?" appearing. If we click Replace, the existing document will be replaced but the previous version cannot be saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand you want to keep older versions of the document, as workaround, you may try following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Before adding a new version of a same document to the SharePoint library, rename the existing document by selecting the document and click Rename in the ribbon, rename the file name, such as FileName
 v1, FileName v2. </p>
<p>(using this way, there will be several different versions of a same document in the SharePoint library)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Use <strong>Version history
</strong>feature of file. (using this way, there will be only one document showing in SharePoint library, you can use Version history to check other versions.)</p>
<p>When you want to update a document, update it by opening it via selecting it&gt;<strong>Open in Word online</strong> or
<strong>Open in Word</strong>. The new version will be saved. And you can check its previous version via click the 3 dots next to the document&gt;Version history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For detailed information, please refer to these articles:</p>

<p>Check the support site for the maker of your GPU card, if it is onboard you will need to check the maker of the motherboard as HP Pavilion is a series name not a model as HP has made a lot of different version under that series.&nbsp;

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check if your graphics adapter has dedicated video RAM or System RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check video RAM by opening Video adapter properties. The screenshot belongs to my video adapter Nvidia GTX 1050. It has got 4 GB of dedicated RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e33fa5bd-d7ae-4a21-a30e-9b6422fffe2d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e33fa5bd-d7ae-4a21-a30e-9b6422fffe2d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it has dedicated video RAM, you may not be able to increase it other than buying a new video card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is using part of System RAM, most probably you can increase it by getting into BIOS and increasing RAM amount there. Be sure this will steal from your main memory ( System RAM ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            How to change Publisher 2010 booklet format to read like a book&#63;</h2>
                    My monthly newsletter is formatted to print at a commercial printer, so the pages work when printed and folded. I need to create a PDF copy of the newsletter in booklet format that reads pages like a book. How do I re-paginate my document so that the pages
 are in the correct reading order?

            <p>Did you try File &gt; Save and Send &gt; PDF? When I try that I get individual pages in the correct order.</p>
