            Hi Luis,
<p><br />
-&nbsp;Is yours a 32-bit or a 64-bit computer?</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Here is the link to download the drivers for Genius cameras.<br />
<a href="http://www.geniusnet.com/wSite/sp?xdUrl=/wSite/productDownload/download.jsp&amp;ctNode=85&amp;mp=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geniusnet.com/wSite/sp?xdUrl=/wSite/productDownload/download.jsp&amp;ctNode=85&amp;mp=1</a></p>
<p>But, I don’t see the product on the manufacturer’s website. So, I would suggest you to check the compatibility of the device with the windows 7 Operating system using the below link.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 2</strong>: If the camera software is not compatible, you can try installing the drivers on windows 7 in vista compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />
Make older programs run in this version of Windows<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a><br />
</p>
<p><br />
Hope this information helps.<br />

<h2>            Sometimes my computer blacks out when I&#39;m using it.  </h2>
                    
<p>My computer has begun to blackout in the middle of me using it.&nbsp; Sometimes I'm in&nbsp;IE, sometimes I working on files.&nbsp; I never know when it will happen again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was told that it could be over heating.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;bought a cooling stand.&nbsp; It still blacks out.&nbsp;
 Could it be software or malware issues?&nbsp;</p>

<p>It could be many things including hardware, software and even malware - we'll check for most of that.&nbsp; It is most likely a hardware problem but that's hard to diagnose with what little information we have and remotely.&nbsp; Before spending money on a computer
 repair shop for a hardware (or possibly software) problem, let's troubleshoot the software issues and some of the hardware possibilities to rule them out (it's what I would do but then again, this is what I do for a living).&nbsp; If you prefer to spend the money
 to the time and effort (or these procedures are too much for you though most really aren't difficult if you follow the instructions), then by all means take it to a professional for service.&nbsp; The decision is yours.</p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information
 you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp;
 Here's how to use Event Viewer: </span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search
 box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each
 for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should do any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp;
 In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span></span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span></span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this you have to also be able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp;</span>Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you don’t have the disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the
 Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 100 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of
 some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook Data File cannot be opened</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user running Office 365 Pro Plus version 16.0.11425.20244. Her Outlook gets the message below. I set her up with a new Outlook profile. In 3-4 days the same happens again. Below is a list of steps were have tried that were not successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I deleted and created new Outlook profile. I manually deleted files in ..\appdata\local\microsoft\outlook before creating the new profile</p>
<p>2. Ran Office 365 full repair<br />
3. Restarted PC<br />
4. Disabled Outlook add-ons<br />
5. She is in the local administrators group</p>
<p>6. Confirmed the user has full access to the .ost file</p>
<p>7. Gave her ownership of the .ost file</p>
<p>8. The user gets the same message when running Outlook in Safe Mode</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8394686-078f-4db8-9e57-f0bf8a85055c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8394686-078f-4db8-9e57-f0bf8a85055c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only step I have not done is give her a new Windows 10 profile? Has anyone seen this happen before? I appreciate your help.</p>

<h2>            Dell 1135n Laser MFP Incompatible with Windows 10 2018-05 Update</h2>
                    <p>My 12-year-old Dell MFP has been working fine with my laptop for years.&nbsp; Suddenly when I tried to scan a document after the most recent Windows 10 update there was an error message that suggested the way to fix it was to turn the device on and off.&nbsp; That
 did not work and then I went to Settings and it showed that the printer was not setup completely.&nbsp; I clicked remove device and then add printer and chose the correct Dell model and compatibility mode but it did not install correctly.&nbsp; Then I went back to the
 original Dell CD with the driver and documentation and while running the setup.exe file there was an error message that Windows could not install the driver (there was a red x).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Dell web site but the FAQ did not offer a work-around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please suggest how I can get my Dell 1135n Laser MFP to work asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Well you can try and roll back or update the drivers in device manager. Or play around with a bunch of things that will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my success rate of almost 100% is to uninstall the printer software and re-install using compatibility mode, just like Dell suggests to do on their website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have drivers for Windows 7 and 8 which appears to be the same.</p>
<p>Make sure you get the proper one. 32bit or 64bit for your OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go here and download the package </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/dell-1135n/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/dell-1135n/drivers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go here and follow the instructions to install it using Compatibility mode. Be sure to disconnect it, uninstall the current software and restart PC first. I would actually try using windows 7 mode since windows 7 had less issues than 8 did.</p>

<p>Dear Seahawk 65:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't bother to reply to the first 3 Microsoft Community responses I received, because none of them read my posting or they would not have suggested fixes I already tried that did not work, such as running the Windows troubleshooter, which could not locate
 the problem, or going to the Dell web site and updating the driver, because Dell says the printer is so old it's incompatible with Windows 10 and I should go to the Microsoft web site and either get a fix from them or pay Dell to troubleshoot the problem at
 a minimum of $99 plus tax because my warranty has expired. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I posted the question I had reinstalled the driver in Compatibility Mode for Windows 8, which was the latest version OS available, and it did print a test page.&nbsp; However, it still is not working and in Windows 10 Settings, Devices, Printers and Scanners,
 all the parts (printer/fax/scanner/copier) read "setup incomplete because of a metered connection".&nbsp; This makes no sense because there's a USB cable directly from the Dell 1135 MFP to the USB on my laptop, so it's not supposed to be using Wi Fi in the first
 place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try everything again, but even the Dell web site wanted me to pay to download the driver, which I don't want to do.&nbsp; It may work when the original CD did not, but if you purchased a product I didn't think they could make you pay for an updated driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joan</p>

<p>Dear Seahawk 65:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the entire updated driver package from the Dell web site and reinstalled it again using Compatibility mode (after having uninstalled all previous Dell MFP software) and again it printed a test page and during the installation there was only
 a single error about a temp file that had a wrong parameter that could not be installed. Otherwise all 4 device software parts installed correctly.&nbsp; Once again, I detached the printer USB cable, started the laptop, reconnected the cable and tried to scan and
 there was an error telling me to turn device off/on and try again, which did not work.&nbsp; In Settings, Devices, Printers, all 4 parts show the error "setup incomplete because of a metered connection" and the Wi Fi box is not checked so it should not be attempting
 to print via Wi Fi anyway.&nbsp; I don't even know if this model MFP can print using Wi Fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try reinstalling using Windows 7 but I've wasted at least 3 hours with this already and will post again after trying the Windows 7 Compatibility mode.</p>
<p>

<p>Reinstalling the Dell MFP driver in compatibility mode using Windows 7 did not work any better than using compatibility mode for Windows 8.&nbsp; It gives the same idiot error messages about setup being incomplete because of a metered connection when there's
 a USB cable connected directly from the device to the USB port (I've also tried using all 3 USB ports on the laptop and the message persists for all ports).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would uninstalling the monthly updates going backward from June 2018, then May 2018, etc. work? The device was working fine just 10 days ago so it has to be some very recent software issue and I'm tired of wasting hours trying to fix a problem the idiots
 at Microsoft created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even own several hundred shares of Microsoft stock, so it infuriates me that these jerks force me to download updates for features I don't use (I don't play video games, own any king of Xbox or any other gaming device and don't own a smartphone either)
 that prevent my printer, fax, copier and scanner from working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please suggest something that will work because this is a RECENT problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>SOLUTION! &nbsp; Microsoft offers Windows Scan that can be downloaded for free from its store.&nbsp; Happily, it worked when I had my USB cable connected to my Dell 1135n MFP so I can stop wasting time reinstalling Dell drivers that don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The copier works anyway, and the fax I hardly use, so as long as I can get my printer and scanner to work I can function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The funniest thing is that when I click on all the Windows diagnostics for the Dell devices, they pass the tests even though they give error messages when I try to use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to try printing but I'm hopeful since I was able to print a test page.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As for Metered connection, you do have it turned OFF in </p>
<p>Settings&gt;&gt;Update and Security&gt;&gt;Advanced Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am not surprised, every Windows Update seems to cause more people more problems. They rush these updates before they should be released. They are more focused in bloating your system with all the advertising and finding ways to spy on you and your
 privacy and taking your control away from your own PC and trying to find ways to force you to use their cloud and online services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you know that in your Privacy settings, if you are not careful, they record every app you open and use on your PC. You can verify this on your online Microsoft account under activities. Pretty disguising.</p>

</p><p>I'm sorry about the hours and trouble you went through, but I'm glad you posted your troubles for all of us to read. I too had the exact same problem after Windows 10 updated their software.
<strong>"Scan"</strong> app from Microsoft website and it works very nicely.&nbsp; Unfortunately the quick scan button on my Dell scanner is useless now, but at least the Scan software from Microsoft is almost just as quick.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            print problems windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My printer - Epson BX635FWD - worked fine up until 3 days ago when it "disappeared".</p>
<p>I've run diagnostics which says the print spooler isn't running &amp; to re-start........when I do this it just stops again!</p>
<p>I've searched for and cleared any ".spl" or ".shd" files that might be clogging the printer.</p>
<p>[I've set the printer up on another computer (running Windows 10) and it works fine.]</p>
<p>I've re-loaded drivers from the installation disk &amp; the Epson site.(clearing the previous installation first)</p>
<p>Nothing appears to cure the problem.</p>
<p>I've read Gerry Cornell's post but can't find the M260142 information he referred to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer runs Windows 10 &nbsp; - &nbsp;64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>I'm going through the steps you recommend &amp; have come to "<span>Find the folder&nbsp;</span><strong>Spool/Spooler</strong><span>&nbsp;under&nbsp;</span><strong>C:/Windows</strong><span>/

<p><span>For anyone in the UK I use this skin company called XtremeSkins.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd mention them as all the skins I've previously ordered from them have been fantastic quality and feel amazing! Plus they are cheap and very fast on delivery, for a whole console wrap it's only £9.99 and they do phones and laptops etc too!!<br />
<br />
I've just bought one for my Xbox One S, lovin' it!<br />

<p>Hi&nbsp;Janskistar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I understand that you did not want to update the Skype version installed on your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be advised that the update in Skype is to fix the issues on the previous version. With the updated version, you can enjoy the new features and options in Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your account, can you please try to log out and log back in to your account?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To log out from Skype:</strong></p>
<p>1. Tap your profile picture.</p>
<p>2. Tap the <strong>Settings button or the gear icon </strong>on the left corner of your screen.</p>
<p>3. Scroll down and tap <strong>sign out</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sign back in to your account and please check if the information that will show up is still different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll look forward to your reply.</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;Janskistar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have logged in to Skype using your email address or Microsoft account, you will be routed to the live account. This is due to Skype and Microsoft migration.</p>
<p>However, if in case the second account has contacts that you do not recognize and it seems that it was being used by someone else. There is a possibility that your email address was linked to a Skype account, you may check if you received email notification
 that your account information was changed, or there are unusual activities on your Microsoft account. But to further assist you with this, you may check the private message I sent you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps, but if you have further questions and clarifications, feel free to reply to this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t uninstall Quicktime &#34;A newer version of Quicktime is already installed..&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows Vista Home Premium 64 bit with SP1. I was trying to update Itunes and was told that I needed to uninstall the current version and then reinstall. I have done this several times without any problems. This time when I was uninstalling It won't
 let me uninstall Quicktime, Apple Application Support or Apple Software update.</p>
<p>When I try to uninstall Quicktime I get the following message. "A newer version of Quicktime is already installed. This installation cannont proceed while the newer version of Quicktime is installed."</p>
<p>When I try to uninstall Apple Application Support&nbsp;and Apple Update&nbsp;I get the message "The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable"</p>
<p>I have installed the Revo Uninstaller and it has removed them from there but the Quicktime and Apple programs are still in my programs in my computer. When I try to reinstall Itunes it says I already have a newer version of Quicktime and won't let me complete
 the installation.</p>
<p>I am totally frusterated. Please Help.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Unmountable Boot Volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harrys23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Unmountable Boot Volume</h2>
                    Right, I have a Packard Bell laptop, and its been failing to start for the last couple of days. It gets to the "windows is starting up" screen, goes black and restarts itself. It continues on that loop until it just runs out of battery. I've pressed F8
 and tried every option, and the only thing that produces anything different is the"Disable automatic restart" option, but that just takes me to a blue screen saying "Unmountable Boot Volume". I've spent ages looking online to find a way of fixing it myself,
 because i cant have my laptop sent away for 21 days as i have exams before then. I've been able find answers, only i cant understand it because i have no idea what any of it means (I'm the complete opposite of an computer geek aha). Please can someone tell
 me simply if its possible to fix my laptop and if so, how?
<div>Thanks in advance</div>

<br />
Thank you for the quick reply, it's much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regarding software/hardware changes, and I don't remember making any changes to anything? I was just doing some revision, using PDF files from my documents.
<div><br />
<div>Where can i get the installation disk? I didn't get one when I originally bought my laptop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried the 'Start up from repair' and it just caused the screen to go black, and, at most, have a grey screen with a large cursor on.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for the reply.</div>

<p>
</p><p>Your forced me to upgrade on skype and then once it was upgraded I could not use it as the microphone was disabled due to a bug that you have not fixed. It is reported on your website as a bug but no practical solutions. I spent an hour of valuable time
 yesterday trying to fix it and could not use skype, resorting to landlines for calls and then today I had to pay our IT support to fix it. (a) why can't you get software right and (b) please can I bill you for the costs of my time and my IT support time to
 fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had similar significant upgrade issues with Windows 10 recently, having to reverse an upgrade and then rebuild the pst file taking many hours.&nbsp;</p>

            Try following -
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+I &gt; Privacy &gt; Microphone &gt; Let apps use my Microphone should be ON and Skype should be ON under Choose apps that can use your Microphone.
<br />
<br />2. Use Win 10 default Skype client (v12) &gt; Type Skype in Cortana and you will notice Trusted Microsoft Store App beneath Skype.
<br />
<br />If above doesn't come, install Skype from Microsoft Store. (Hence, you have choice of 2 Skypes on Windows 10 - v8 and v12.

            Thanks Vijay but it was a lot more complex than this to fix but the issue is the configuration change I had to make is an introduced bug by MS which is not an acceptable form of behaviour.

<h2>            Screen issues with dim affect and occurs after Windows update on the Computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Screen Problems</p>
<p>I have a Lenovo Ideapad Z500 running Windows 10.&nbsp; Sometime back an update came through that made the screen go very dim even though everything to affect this was turned up to maximum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw a link on one of these forums that said how to delete the update which I did and had instant success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mid December saw another update come through and the same problem has happened again, accept this time I cannot find the correct item to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone been able to overcome this problem recently.&nbsp; If so a post would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recovery partition or the access path to it may be corrupted.</p>
<p>You can't reinstall the recovery partition; that was imaged onto your hard drive by the computer/laptop manufacturer at their factory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can contact your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.
</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost, IF they still have them available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is how you should have been able to access the Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to how&nbsp;it was when new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Key/s to press at Boot to start the Recovery Process back to Factory Settings (new condition). Under each Manufacturer in the list below are the instructions in the respective links for you to follow on how to use their Recovery Partition</p>

</p><p>And if you do have a Manufacturer's Recovery Partition on your Hard Drive and you can Boot into Windows, you should be able to make your own Recovery Disks from it to reinstall the Operating System in case of Hard Drive failure.</p>
<p>Look under Programs &gt; your Computer Manufacturer's name &gt; then their System Tools or Recovery Software Headings for them, depending how it is worded.</p>
<p>If you can not find any reference to it, contact the&nbsp;Manufacturer for advice on how to make those Recovery Disks.</p>

<h2>            How to clean install windows 10 from usb drive  after upgrade to windows 10 already complete&#63;</h2>
                    I have upgraded to windows 10 using a purchased copy of windows home, when I did this it upgraded me from windows 8, not 8.1, although it said it would not do this- I was trying to clean install. Some of the same problems are there freezing login- I had
 with windows 8(I could never upgrade to 8.1- problems), now I want to clean install windows 10 after my upgrade to 10 using the usb I purchased. How do I do this?

            When you boot from the USB drive you need to select custom install and then delete all partitions and then continue. Because you bought Windows 10 I would input the key when prompted. That routine should give you a clean install.

<br />
Unlikely this is a Windows specific issue, although it could be something to do with the machine and/or a corruption.<br />
What NAS device is it?&nbsp; Do they provide any help/instructions/troubleshooting?<br />
For most you can merely map the drive...&nbsp; \\NASDEVICEIP\Share<br />

    <title>Why is my webcam flipped&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leonardoraffaelli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my webcam flipped&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a pretty old laptop Fujitsu lifebook. Two days ago i had the oportunity to upgrade from Windows7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I was gladly suprise knowing i could upgrade, so I did it. but now I'm facing a hard issue. My webcam shows my image flipped and i cannot find any solution to this. Skype is flipping it and i'm thinking the problem is caused by a lack of drivers or something
 similar.<br />
Fujitsu helpdesk already answered to me saying that nodrive will be released in the immediate future. Since I'm really using Skype in my daily tasks, can you please help me finding a solution?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Aswin, thank you for your reply and sorry for my late one.<br />
<br />
I actually downloaded the drivers but the main problem is that fujitsu didn't release any win10 compatible driver for my old shoe pc.... It's just a matter of luck.<br />
I followed your suggestion but i cannot fulfill point n 4. In fact i have no "windows 10" operative system on the drop down list. Anyway, unfortunately this method didn't work for me, so i'm still lookign for a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment this message is reported:</p>
<p>Device USB\VID_04F2&amp;PID_B213&amp;MI_00\7&amp;d7a637a&amp;0&amp;0000 requires further installation.<br />

            <p>If you are using a usb keyboard and mouse they may be causing problems (they did for me).&nbsp; I had to disable legacy USB support in my bios to get them to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are stuck at the primary boot level and your keyboard is not working and you have a old serial mouse and keyboard available, then by all means use them until you get win 10 running. ( I had to use my oldest stuff to get it going) Windows 10 seems
 to have a problem with USB devices on some machines. It's all about device drivers with win 10, and the way it is rejecting them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think it's the video card (...and I don't think that's your problem) then pull it, and set your bios to enable on-board video, and use that until you get 10 up and running... I had to do this as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had my machine hardware stripped down to a very basic level to get win ten to install, and then I fixed each hardware, and then each software problem one at a time until I got it running again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Command line option syntax error. Type Command &#47;&#63; for Help</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I'm having an unanticipated problem with a new Vista Ultimate 64-bit installation. I built a new PC using an ASUS P5Q Pro Turbo MoBo, a Q9650 CPU, 8GB DDR2 RAM &amp; a GeForce 8600GT video card.<br />
I installed Vista from the original DVD, I then installed the MoBo &amp; Video drivers from a CD. Next, I installed SP1 from a flash drive. I let windows install the rest of the updates from the Windows update site.<br />
I then instaled WinRAR from a flash drive. I started noticing that I was getting an error dialog from "jman" that says:
<br />
<strong>" Command line option syntax error. Type Command /? for Help</strong>." in multiple (3-4 each time) dialog boxes every time I right-clicked on an icon or a diretcory or a file in explorer or quick launch. I'm not saying the error message began when
 I installed WinRAR, I'm only saying I noticed it then.<br />
I wanted an image, so I installed Acronis True Image and made a backup.<br />
I googled the error message and saw references to Office 2000 &amp; Norton 2005. Microsoft's advice is: "</p>
</span>
<p><span>To work around this problem, modify the source path so that it does not contain any spaces.".
</span><span>I can't modify the source path because every time I try to access properties, I get the error messages.<br />
This doesn't make sense to me which is why I mentioned that I installed some apps from a flash drive which probably contained some spaces.
</span></p>
<p>Any suggestions??</p>

<p><span>Hello Jaze,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After reading your post it makes sense that the problem most likely began with the WinRAR installation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Since you have the media on your flash drive let’s try the most obvious solution; uninstall WinRAR.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Next, reboot the machine and see if you continue to get the error message.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you no longer get the error message I would recommend copying the install files onto the HDD and then running the install.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If however you are still getting the error message we will need to try and find out what is causing it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am including a link to a Microsoft Knowledge Base article that explains how to troubleshoot Vista using a “Clean Boot”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here is the link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><span>Work through these steps and let us know the results.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the problem is resolved, great!<span>&nbsp; </span>If not, let us know any error messages you receive, what applications seem to be related to the error messages, and as much detail about the failure as you can in your reply.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            Hi Charles
<br />
<br />Please explain this in more detail . . .
<br />
<br />Is there a search bar stuck to the top of your Desktop, that cannot be removed?
<br />
<br />If so this is more than likely a PUP called Web Bar, though it can be named **** Bar . . 
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager 
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find Wb. exe - on the right it should say Web Bar in the Description 
<br />
<br />Right click that and choose 'End Task 
<br />
<br />Does that get rid of this annoyance? 
<br />
<br />If so, go to Control Panel - Programs and Features 
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom of the list of installed Apps, then find and Uninstall Web Bar

    <title>Crackdown 2&#58; Project Sunburst - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xbackuphero  say:</h3>
<h2>            Crackdown 2&#58; Project Sunburst</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I am an avid Xbox 360 gamer, and I consider myself to be a completionist. Recently (July 27th, 2011) the Windows Phone 7 live game "Crackdown 2: Project Sunburst" was removed from the marketplace,
 and was closed down entirely - without noitce. I have only 175/200 gamerscore for the game, and I am unable to play it anymore. The lack of any notification or warning highly upsets me because I am no longer able to earn the remaining achievements. I understand
 it is against policy and "technically not even possible" (Xbox Live Customer Support Representative) to have a game deleted from my profile, or to be given the remaining achievements. Those two achievements are forever unobtainable and being a Microsoft customer,
 I feel this problem should be rectified. I realize that the game is gone, and nothing can be done to bring it back, but I would appreciate some form of justification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spend lots of time and money on my Xbox 360 and my Windows Phone 7; I'd like to keep it up too, but I no longer feel the urge to buy marketplace content or downloaded games due to this atrocity.
 The best (and apparently not even an option) solution, to me, would be to have the game Crackdown 2: Project Sunburst removed ENTIRELY from my gamertag/game history. This would not be that big of a deal; I am the owner of the gamertag, and I can verify it
 many times over. I am not trying to cheat or gain an unfair advantage in any way. I just simply cannot stand to have a game on my history that I cannot complete. Nor am I trying to steal a gamertag or cause trouble for someone else; this is my gamertag, and
 I want the game removed.</p>
<p>I will continue to place phone calls to customer support, post topics, and petition until I can have this situation fixed. I do not want to start a new gamer tag, unless all of my content (Marketplace purchases, etc) could be transferred from my current
 gamertag to a new one. I doubt that is even possible either. Please hear me out, and try to come to an agreement with me on this problem. I appreciate all of the things that I pay for on Xbox 360/WP7, and I would not like to stop spending and enjoying content.
 However, if this cannot be resolved, I am afraid that it must stop.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><em>Unfortunately as you are aware there is no way to remove titles from your game history if you have unlocked an achievement for said game, this is the same for everyone. I have not seen any news that implies this will change anytime soon.<br />
<br />
If a game has been removed I doubt they will bring it back so you can unlock 2 achievements.<br />
Just a friendly heads up but petitions of any kind are not allowed on the forums. And one last thing is DL content can not be transferred between gamer tags for any reason at all.<br />
<br />
I understand how upset you are about not being able to unlock these 2 achievements but there is literally nothing you can do to rectify it, as things stand there is no fix..<br />
