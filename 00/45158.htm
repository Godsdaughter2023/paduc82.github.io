    <title>Network error on startup after Win10 Creators update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Network error on startup after Win10 Creators update</h2>
                    <p>Since updating my pc with creators update I receive an error on startup - "unable to connect all network drives"</p>
<p>
</p><p>On checking, the pc is not connected to my home network as there appears to be an error with my ethernet adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to Device manager, it shows an error with the network adapter. I use the 'rescan for hardware changes' option and the error goes away. The pc joins my home network and connect to the internet without any further intervention. This happens on every startup
 now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should add that I have also checked for newer/better driver for the ethernet adapter, (Intel 82579V gigabit), I already have the 'best' driver.</p>
<p>This did not occur before the Creators update and nothing else has been changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening now, and how do I fix this?</p>
<p>

            Okay Jesta777, I got it.&nbsp; I found <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-networking/not-able-to-connect-to-internet/7897c0e4-4af9-4378-b3d4-91275226a5e3">
this</a> old thread about the same problem and one of the replies has the solution.&nbsp; Sushovon Sinha has the correct answer in those thread replies.&nbsp; He suggests downloading the latest Intel 82579v gigbit driver from
<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/47549/Intel-82579-Gigabit-Ethernet-Controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, but I didn't think this was necessary as you've already stated downloading it again didn't work so I skipped this part.&nbsp; There is an ADDITIONAL patch to update the NVRAM, THIS is the solution.&nbsp; Download that patch from
<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/22026/NVM-Update-Utility-for-Intel-82579V-Gigabit-Ethernet-PHY-Network-Connection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and unzip it.&nbsp; Open a command prompt with administrator privileges and open the folder unzipped from the patch labelled "Win64e", inside is a win64e.exe file, execute this file and reboot.&nbsp; Problem has not occurred since this patch after at least three
 cold boots and one restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm pretty sure this is the solution.&nbsp; Good luck with it.

<h2>            Call of Duty&#58; Black Ops 2 &#40;Disc Unrecognized&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Alright, So i noticed I'm not the first person to post this issue with this game.. I don't know if it has to do with the dashboard update or anything since I just bought Black ops 2 today! Just got home and wanted to throw down some Multi but alas... the
 disc is unrecognized.... This is the only game out of my.. 50 games that will not read. I also noticed there are a bunch of suggestions on how to fix this but none have worked for me so far.. and honestly I don't really want to try to do the whole don't use
 your HDD trick because I want to play multiplayer... and w/ that fix it's impossible.
<br />
<br />
XBOX PLEASE fix this.. like come on, thousands of people are complaining about this problem so it's obviously a firm/software issue. It's truly a pain getting home after spending nearly 100$ after taxes and not being able to play the damn game! Come on...
<br />
<br />
HELP ASAP!!!! otherwise I'll most likely return the game and pick it up for PC instead :s...<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>What type of Xbox is it? The original Xbox will sometimes have problems like this when playing new games. Since that game is new, and you are using it on the original Xbox, the Xbox can't seem to read the game because of the new disc layering, so it'll be
 harder to recognize the disc. I hope this made sense. Try bringing&nbsp; the disc to your friends house and play it on his/her Xbox, see if it works then.</p>

<p>That may be the issue but borderlands 2 and dishonoured read fine and load up within like.. 2 seconds :s lol so I don't get what would be the difference since dishonoured is pretty damn new as well xD.. ugh ya I'm lending it to my little bro tonight if i
 can't get it to work...Oh and I have one of the older xbox's the halo 3 special edition. This is the first game I've EVER had this issue with and i tend to buy new games every month... also halo 4 works fine :s..and so does the new assassins creed. Thanks
 for the suggestion though I really appreciate it :) </p>
<p>I just hope it's a software issue and an update is released soon... </p>

<p>Crap OPS 2. &nbsp;If they don't fix this soon I'm giving up on the franchise. &nbsp;Between lag, disc not reading and crappy spawns I'm getting sick of spending tons of money on a product that disappoints. &nbsp;Good game but fix it so I can play when I want!! &nbsp;BF3 still
 gets my vote for best 1st person shooter. &nbsp;If this is an xbox problem then Bill Gates needs to send me a rebate. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My disk did the same thing at first but after the 10th try it finally came on but the disk will stop spinning after it came on. At first I thought it was the disk because my other games have been working fine so I went to GameStop to get it replaced but
 the manager said it can't be the disk because it brand new but he said keep on trying until we recieve a patch for it but if it still continue to do it then he will have a new disk for me and I also have the original Xbox 360

<p>ya... it seems a tad odd... although think about it, why would Assassins creed 3.. Halo 4, Borderlands 2 &amp; Dishonored ALL work.. but the least graphicly impressing game.. black ops 2 doesn't? That's why &nbsp;I really don't understand people saying it's the xbox
 360. If it was because the old 360's gpu/laser can't handle black ops why would it be able to handle WAY more graphic intense games?? It makes absolutely no sense.. xD lol In my opinion it has to be a firmware issue, that's the only possible explaination that
 makes sense to me @ least. I finally did get it to work but I'm afraid to even shut off my 360 or put in another game incase it takes me another 100+ ejection times again lol... OH my game finally started working after I got my game replaced, I don't know
 if that had anything to do with it. It still took nearly 100+ tries with the 2nd disc but this time it actually worked.. where as the first one I must have tried 200+ times without any success.</p>

<p>its more than likely a problem with a disk than anything else. i would go back to whatever store you got it from and ask if you can get a replacement.

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 PC Receiving Push-Update Requests to UPGRADE to WINDOWS 10.  How do I stop this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'll try again.&nbsp; And Mr. Archak, the reason I'm opening a new post for this, again, is that apparently I'm incapable of accurately expressing myself in relatively standard American English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is a WINDOWS 10 E-Book.&nbsp; I want to be very clear, I AM ALREADY RUNNING WINDOWS10.&nbsp; I have been since August of 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am, intermittently and outside of my control, getting a dialog on my screen 'offering" an UPGRADE (not an update - I repeat this - NOT AN UPDATE) to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this happens, there is a folder dropped onto my hard drive related to implementing the UPGRADE and a shortcut placed on my desktop, neither of which were done with specific permission (I realize that my EULA for Windows probably allows them to put anything
 they want on my computer for any reason they want).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once, when this first started happening last year, I allowed this to run its course.&nbsp; I clicked the "yes - go ahead and upgrade my PC" button.&nbsp; I was told (by the process) that I didn't have enough hard drive space (E-Books have very small hard drives, or
 at least mine does) so I went to through the hours-long process of offloading all of my data and programs from the E-Book to CDs, downloaded the monster file, went through the install itself, manually located and reinstalled the drivers that Windows 10 didn't
 include, reinstalled my software, and reactivated my software licenses.&nbsp; That did not stop the requests to UPGRADE from occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Calls to Microsoft result in a walk-through of how to close the dialog, delete the shortcut, and delete the folder (and frankly, anyone who needs to be told how to do that probably shouldn't be operating anything more complicated than a fork and even then
 I'd consider filing the tines dull).&nbsp; I've repeatedly attempted to get MS personnel to stop focusing on the symptoms and focus on the root cause.&nbsp; Having spent more than 25 years in IT, I have some insight into what might be doing that, but only in a categorical
 sort of way.&nbsp; Something, either on my PC or at Microsoft, has flagged my PC as a target of the "Please upgrade to Windows 10" push process.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I haven't been able to get anyone at Microsoft to even discuss the question:&nbsp; What is it that identifies
 a customer's PC as being a candidate for UPGRADE to Windows 10 through the push process and how to I/we correct it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hearing buzz that Microsoft intends to push much harder to get people off of other O/S by the end of the month.&nbsp; What's going to happen when the option NOT to UPGRADE is no longer offered?&nbsp; My PC will effectively have been taken hostage by Microsoft.&nbsp;
 In legal terms, "Converted", although that implies that it was taken for a purpose and I CAN'T SEE ANY PURPOSE IN HOLDING MY WINDOWS 10 PC HOSTAGE TO UPGRADING TO WINDOWS 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think of myself as an uneducated person.&nbsp; In most circles I'm considered erudite, literate, and capable of expressing myself clearly.&nbsp; Despite this, and I'm assuming that the problem here is not a lack of language proficiency or reading comprehension
 skills on the part of Microsoft, I have failed to convey several points of fact to both Microsoft and the Microsoft Community.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; This is not an UPDATE that is occurring.&nbsp; I cannot provide a "KB" number (as I've been asked to do in an email exchange with a Community Moderator).&nbsp; This is an UPGRADE that is being pushed to me.&nbsp; If you're not clear on the difference between an update
 to an existing operating system and an offer to replace it with a new one, please become so before responding to this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Unless I wish to surrender practical access to my PC.&nbsp; I cannot boot to safe mode and see if it happens again as I have been advised to do by a member of the Microsoft Community.&nbsp; It might be days, it might be weeks, it might be months before it happens
 again.&nbsp; I don't have my PC on my desk as a paperweight.&nbsp; I use it to accomplish things.&nbsp; If I have not been clear enough that I do not have control over when the push upgrade request occurs, please understand that now and factor that into any response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)&nbsp; I am not posting details of my system configuration to the internet.&nbsp; I was asked to do this by a Community Member earlier in the history of this problem.&nbsp; I generated the file and I would be happy to send it to a specific person, but I'm not remotely
 stupid enough to blindly bare the details of my system anywhere.&nbsp; And I would like to know why, if this is necessary for diagnosing the problem, no Microsoft "Tech" has asked for it, ever..&nbsp; What do you know that they don't and why don't they know it if they're
 the paid help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp; I run exactly four software packages above the system itself.&nbsp; Open Office, Firefox, Thunderbird, and Final Draft.&nbsp; Nothing else.&nbsp; This is a PC that I use for professional purposes only.&nbsp; I've searched for the confluence of this problem and any of those
 software packages on Google and found nothing.&nbsp; If this is a third-party software problem, I can't find it.&nbsp; Yes, it's a possibility, but until I get an answer to the question, "How (specifically) does Microsoft target customer PCs for that push UPGRADE request?"
 I'm not willing to take it as a final answer.&nbsp; For one thing, I'd have to remove all of the software that I actually use on a daily basis and wait those days, weeks, or months for the UPGRADE push to happen again.&nbsp; For another, it smacks of buck-passing.&nbsp;
 Get me an answer to my question and verify that nothing on my PC indicates that I'm on anything other than Windows 10 and I'll consider it, although more likely I'll just trash this thing and go back to Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moderator - Please do not delete this thread as redundant.&nbsp; Even the automated bot thought this was redundant with threads asking how to stop requests from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.&nbsp; Obviously this is a different issue.&nbsp; I'M ALREADY RUNNING WINDOWS 10.&nbsp;
 But I did open two prior threads on this topc.&nbsp; If you need to delete any, delete my previous threads instead.&nbsp; It's something of a learning curve figuring out precisely how to "speak" to the community in terms that they'll pay accurate attention to.&nbsp; Don't
 punish me because of that curve.&nbsp; I'm just trying to get a problem solved.&nbsp; Evidently I wasn't clear enough in my earlier attempts.&nbsp;

            <p>Specificity!&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I did indeed find that I am running version 10240.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>A few questions before I attempt to fix this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; I there any way to get Windows to look at drives other than the C drive when examining my system for space for that massive download.&nbsp; I am 2GB short on my C drive, the drive is welded in place and can't be upgraded, and I am loathe to spend money on
 an external drive that will likely be unused for any other purpose.&nbsp; I do, however, have plenty of space on several addressable thumb drives plugged in through a USB hub and I have room on an SD card currently plugged into the E-Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; What happened to "This is the last version of Windows" that was being touted when the first upgrade offer was made?&nbsp; I have difficulty wrapping my head around this not being doable with proper updates.&nbsp; Putting customers through the massive download,
 complete replace process twice seems to me to be a strange option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)&nbsp; Short of doing another program-by-program uninstall, file-by-file removal, and folder-by-folder check for spare space, is there any way to quickly and efficiently remove everything from my C drive that isn't absolutely necessary for the basic operation
 of the computer for the purpose of doing the upgrade.&nbsp; Bear in mind, I need whatever I use to not only move the non-system stuff off the drive, but manage the process of moving it all back after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know here.&nbsp; I'll check back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forgot one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp; Once I've moved all of my stuff off C to allow for the massive file download, how do I trigger this upgrade to happen?&nbsp; I can't just move it all off and wait an undeterminate amount of time for this event to occur.&nbsp; I need this PC.&nbsp; I wouldn't have wasted,
 um spent, the money on it if I didn't.</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I receive your message I will reply and you can then attach files to the second reply. You cannot attach files to a message using the Contact details page.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The files requested are technical reports about how your system works and do not relate to personal data, which you naturally wish to protect. They may contain your machine name, your user name, and
 where software is installed. The files do not contain passwords, bank pin numbers, log-ons and complete product keys. It is for you to determine if that violates your privacy. You only need to leave a file in your OneDrive for the limited time necessary for
 the other party to retrieve the file. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Having requested thousands of reports in these forums over the last 5 years, I can only say that I have never encountered a complaint that an exchange of files has contributed to a
 breach of the users security and a loss of personal data. I am not an expert in computer security but breaches of security occur when a user allows direct access to their computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Access can be granted by the user knowingly allowing direct access or access being achieved by deception or trick though a camouflaged link in an incoming email or other communication.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you look at other threads you will find many other users sharing files, notably by those seeking help with diagnosing the causes of blue of death crashes. Exchanging copies of files is an extremely
 practical way to aid and expedite the finding of a solution to the problem the user has. You no doubt are aware that these are moderated public forums. Abuse of whatever kind in these forums is rigorously dealt with and those seeking to abuse others are excluded
 from using the forum. However, I have never seen the type of abuse you fear reported.

            <p>Yes.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; Both times.&nbsp; Both times I got a confirmation page with the body of the message.</p>

</p><p>No idea what's happening there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to system data, I'm happy to exchange it with you.&nbsp; What I'm not willing to do is post it to an unsecured file server with no control over who has access to it.&nbsp; I keep client files on my PC.&nbsp; I've been in IT since long before the Internet was a thing.&nbsp;
 I've seen companies I worked for who have lost data to intruders, but it's never happened to any computer I was responsible for and I don't intend to ignore my best instincts now.</p>
<p>

 have to figure out how to get it there.</p>

<h2>            Got 2 gamertags - do I need 2 xbobx live gold accounts&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Got 2 issues:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Somehow (don't ask how, I can't be bothered, just accept it happened) I've ended up with two gamertags, both with achievements, and I can't see any way to merge them. Has microsoft fixed this stupid problem yet or is it still basically unsolveable GRRRRR.</p>
<p>2) Ok, assuming there is no answer to (1), next problem is this. On gamertag#1 I have joined xbox live gold and paid my $10.95 a month or whatever it is, and now I'm having fun playing online. BUT, thats only good for some games. In other games I have lots
 of achievements and unlocks accumulated BUT they are under gamertag#2. Why doesn't my gold membership apply to both gamertags!? I thought the gold membership was for the console, not the gamertag? Can I use two gamertags on the one account and if so can someone
 please step me through it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Kachung</p>

<p>1. Unsolveable. There is no options to merge different accounts.</p>
<p>2. Gold membership is for gamnertag not for console! So if you want play online with both gamertags you need buy gold membership for both gamertag. If you have more than one gamertag you can always use FAMILY GOLD MEMBERSHIP PACKAGE! Gold membership for
 4 users (cost less than for 2 single memberhsip)!</p>

<p>I got the exact same problem!! So there is no way to fix this??? I mean if it doesn't work then I guess I can delete the one games tag that has the less achievements, and games played. I wish there was an easier way!!</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description, I understand that you need to upload videos to OneDrive using photo gallery without reducing the size. we are really sorry for the inconvenience caused to you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that the size of the file will reduce if you are trying to upload it to OneDrive using Photo Gallery. If you are using Windows 8.1 on your computer then I suggest you to upload video files using Camera Roll to avoid quality reduction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press Winows key + C and open Charms bar.</p>
<p>b. Click on Settings and select Change PC settings.</p>
<p>c. Click on OneDrive and select Camera Roll.</p>
<p>d. Select the option "Upload photos at best quality"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Please post back if the issue persists and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Hi Linda, the Facial recognition software is a 3rd party application
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features, find that application and uninstall it
<br />
<br />Check for the facial recognition software in your Startup apps:
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager 
<br />Click on the Startup Tab 
<br />See if that app is listed there 
<br />If it is, select it and click 'Disable' 
<br />Close Task Manager 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type msconfig and hit Enter 
<br />When the System Configuration dialog opens, click on the Services Tab 
<br />Check the box marked 'Hide Microsoft Services' 
<br />In the remaining list see if that app is listed there, uncheck any you find 
<br />Click Apply and OK 
<br />
<br />Finally, click your Start Button, type services and hit Enter
<br />Scroll down the list of services, look for the Facial Recognition app
<br />If you find it, double click it and if it is running, stop it. then set its startup type to Disabled

            If you have a new system with Windows 10 then you likely have Windows Hello. To turn off Windows Hello try the following steps.
<br />
<br />Open settings.
<br />
<br />Choose accounts.
<br />
<br />Click sign-in options.
<br />
<br />Under Windows Hello box click on Remove button.
<br />
<br />Now restart your system, and Hello should be disabled.
<br />
<br />If you have an older notebook which you upgraded to Windows 10 you may have a program called Fast Access.  There were some older versions of Fast Access that doesn’t work well with Windows 10. Launch Fast Access and choose the security tab and click on “turn Fast Access off”.

            If you are willing, I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<h2>            c&#43;&#43; runtime error</h2>
                    
<p>I just started a new computer with Windows 7. I use an old version of Autocad. It was running for several months on the new computer. Then I think after some critical updates to W7 the next time I try Autocad I get the error abnormal program termination
 C++ runtime error.</p>
<p>I tried restoring the system to before the critical updates and it still has the error.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what might be the cause or what I might try to make it run again. I tried repair to the Autocad install and that did the same error so I tried reinstall and the same error. I sure could use some help.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Could you provide me the exact error message?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let us run the sfc scan and check.<br />
To do this, follow these steps:&nbsp; <br />
a. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow.<br />
b. Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
<strong>sfc /scannow<br />
</strong>The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
More Information about SFC scan can be found in this document:<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any recent changes made to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps provided and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Try to boot your system in safe mode and check if the same issue occurs.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><strong><span>:&nbsp;If
</span></strong><span>the issue does not exist in Safe Mode then t<span>ry to set your computer in
</span>Clean Boot state.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</span></strong><span><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow
<b>Step 7</b> in the provided link to return your computer to <span>Normal startup mode</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also try to scan your computer from Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and
 other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded.
 To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting

    <title>Speech Recognition Select Command in Word 2013 Unreliable. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speech Recognition Select Command in Word 2013 Unreliable. Workaround&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A longtime user of Dragon, I have been using Windows Speech Recognition with great success. In fact, the error rate is absolutely on a par with what Naturally Speaking offers, at least for me. I am having one problem working in existing Word 2013 documents,
 however. (But it never occurs in fresh documents that I create from scratch.) Basically, what I'm doing in these documents is editing existing text and replacing it with new text. But inexplicably, as I go through documents, the 'Select'command will fail to
 work. Instead, it types out'select'followed by the words I've tried to select!<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on why this might be happening? Any potential workarounds for this behavior? It seems very odd given that both Speech Recognition and Word are Microsoft programs—I would expect them to work together seamlessly. There doesn't seem to be anything
 peculiar about the particular documents involved—the behavior happens randomly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help anyone can offer that might fix this.</p>

            <p>Krishna, nothing personal to you, but this kind of largely boilerplate response -- which Microsoft obviously encourages -- does very little to help in almost any case I've ever seen. Certainly not in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My drivers are up-to-date. Windows 10 is up-to-date. Your question about whether this behavior occurred before installing Windows 10 is pertinent, and the answer is yes, it did.</p>

            <p>Further information on the problem: it reliably occurs when attempting to make changes of wording in an existing document, AFTER I have have been forced for some reason to make any change by hand instead of purely using speech recognition. A single instance
 of manual change to the document will render all commands unreachable. Speech recognition simply replies to any command with 'What was that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will persist until the document and speech recognition are closed and reopened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bug in Word 2013? Bug in Windows Speech Recognition? Must be. But it must be one of long standing, since it was occurring under Windows 8 and 8.1.</p>

 you never know.</p>

            <p>wRuss, thanks for the tip. I'm eager to try this but this morning, first speech recognition wouldn't open at all! (Turned out the executable was still lingering in memory, so something WSR has in common with Dragon, unfortunately...) But then, once I got
 it open, the error disappeared. Couldn't make it show up on a bet. Next time, though, and I've no doubt that'll come sooner rather than later, I'll give your advice a try. Just hope it doesn't type out "refresh speech commands" (!)</p>
<p>

<p>I'm also an editor working with documents created by other people, and this same problem is happening to me with Word 2017.&nbsp;I can't get "select" or "go to" to function as commands. It types out the word instead.</p>
<p>I've&nbsp;tried the "refresh voice commands" trick someone else recommended and it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Pro and Registry permissions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard sheasley- ads  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Pro and Registry permissions</h2>
                    <p>Have a Windows 7 Pro computer that is having permissions and rights problems and not allowing the Registry to be edited. It could be related to a new user profile after a recent server migration, but not all the PC's running Win 7&nbsp; on the migrated network
 are experiencing this same problem. There is a line of business database that wrote a simple .reg file to allow some settings in their software. When the .reg file is opened it reports "Cannot import filename.reg: Error accessing the registry"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the folder and looked at the WIndows\system32\config files and verified they are not read only with the attrib -r command in an elevated Run as Administrator command prompt. I have also checked to make sure the User is listed as a local Administrator
 and the also checked some other permissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any other recommendations to resolve and troubleshoot the not being able to write information to the registry file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Hope this is in the proper topic as none seem to directly address rights and permissions</p>
<p>

Try booting in cleanboot adn try updating again.<br />

            <p><strong>Installing an app using Windows Desktop</strong></p>
<p>If you have a traditional desktop app you would like to use such as Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop, you can install your application from the Desktop app. Depending on the medium on which application is available, you might see different options on
 the Windows screen. For this example, we are going to install Microsoft Office from a CD.
</p>
<p>Insert the disc:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/desktop-app-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f03%2fdesktop-app-1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d318%26amp%3bh%3d190" /></a></p>
<p>The following popup menu will appear from the right of the screen, click on it to choose an action.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/image23.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f03%2fimage_thumb23.png%3fw%3d326%26amp%3bh%3d313" /></a></p>
<p>Depending on the options available, you can choose to run the application or open and view the files on the disc. Some applications might not present an option to Run the program, so you might have to ‘Open folder to view files’ and run the
 setup.exe file from there. Your options depending on the program you are installing from might be different.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/image24.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f03%2fimage_thumb24.png%3fw%3d331%26amp%3bh%3d281" /></a></p>
<p>Consult the documentation that came with your program for instructions about how to install it. Follow the on screen options to install your program.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/image25.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f03%2fimage_thumb25.png%3fw%3d330%26amp%3bh%3d280" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while the program installs. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/image26.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f03%2fimage_thumb26.png%3fw%3d327%26amp%3bh%3d277" /></a></p>
<p>Thats it, your program is now installed. </p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth</h2>
                    <p>I'm having some issues with bluetooth on my laptop. I have windows 10 and at the beginning everything worked just fine but after some windows update (like 6 months ago?) my bluetooth started to do some weird stuff. Nowdays it doesn't work until I manually
 go to devices manager and turn it off and then on again. Before I turn it off there's a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark next to the bluetooth icon. I tried re-installing the drivers but unfortunately it didn't help.
</p>
<p>It's a pain in the **** to go to devices manager every time I want to use the bluetooth. Does anyone have some suggestions on what might be causing the problem and how I can solve it?</p>

<p>The bluetooth still doesn't start up with the system though... But I noticed something else, when I go to the device manager and then click on bluetooth -&gt; properties, there's 'Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)'

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try doing a Repair Installation which allows you to keep the programs and data though redundant backups are always a good idea.<br />
<br />
How to: perform a repair upgrade using the Windows 10 ISO file<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085</span></a><br />
<br />
===========<br />
<br />
After the above :<br />
<br />
Code 43<br />
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/install/cm-prob-failed-post-start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/install/cm-prob-failed-post-start</a>
<br />
<br />
Create a Restore Point - Control Panel - System - on left side "Advanced system protection" - System Protection tab - Create.<br />
<br />
In Device Manager -&nbsp;Right Click the device - Uninstall - OK<br />
<br />
Restart the computer<br />
<br />
======================<br />
<br />
More troubleshooting methods :<br />
<br />
Check with your System/Motherboard maker and install the latest Bluetooth<br />
Drivers. Ask their support and in their forums about any known issues.<br />
<br />
Also update the BIOS and chipset drivers while there as they can also affect<br />
the Bluetooth operation.<br />
<br />
===========================<br />
<br />
Good idea to update all the major&nbsp;drivers :<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate&nbsp;device
<br />
drivers.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without
<br />
Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There&nbsp;may be so much system corruption that you will need to do a Clean Install (if the methods in my previous post&nbsp;do not help). Be sure to contact the&nbsp;System/Motherboard Maker's Support and Forums&nbsp;to see about known issues.<br />
<br />
If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement&nbsp;.<br />
<br />
Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10 <br />

            <p>hi</p>
<p>for any problem wirh your recovery drive contact your computer manufacturer</p>
<p>read the below&nbsp;information by <strong>michael murphy</strong> on the dos and donts for the recovery partion</p>
<p><span>"Your D: Drive normally is the Recovery Partition <span>and is about 5Gbs-19GBs in size</span>, that the Manufacturer put there,&nbsp;for your computer to put it back to factory settings in case of System Crash.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Contact your Computer Manufacturer on how to remove anything you have saved to the Recovery Drive, as it is their Recovery Partition, not Microsoft’s.<br />
<br />
It is not for you to save anything to; and it is not to compress and/or Index, Disk Cleanup, use for Backup, Defrag or have System Restore turned on for it.<br />
<br />
<span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span><br />
<br />
Ask the Manufacturer if you can make them, and how to delete/fix what has been done there."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>for your 2nd question</u></strong></p>
<p><span><span>there are a few steps that you can&nbsp;take on a regular basis to keep your computer running correctly and smoothly</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>make sure that you have the latest vista drivers for your computer which you can get from your computer manufacturers website</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>go to their website and look for a drivers and software download section</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>key in your model number look for the latest vista drivers then download and install them</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong><u>also run the sfc /scannow command </u></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, click<strong>All Programs</strong>, click<strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are
 prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<strong>Allow</strong>.
</li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>sfc /scannow</span></div>
The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>if SFC finds major problems that it can not fix you may have to borrow a Microsoft vista dvd not an acer HP etc recovery disk and do a repair installation</span></p>
<p><span>read the below tutorial on how to do a repair installation</span></p>

<p>The DBS doesn't seem to be a big deal...but the Gnasher does seem to be inconsistent! I can hard aim from point blank and get blown to ish...2 min later, hip fire from 15 feet and destroy the guy!? But then again, I'm also seeing ALOT of lag lately in the
 Beta...also alot of taking cover...glitching to another part of the map within a second...then glitching right back!? Did this about 6 times in a row on Thrashball today!

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring File History backup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History regularly backs up versions of your files in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders and the
<span>OneDrive</span> files available offline on your PC. Over time, you'll have a complete history of your files. If the originals are lost, damaged, or deleted, you can restore them. You can also browse and restore different versions of your files. For example,
 if you want to restore an older version of a file (even if it wasn't deleted or lost), you can browse through a timeline, select the version you want, and restore it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not obvious, what exactly causing this issue. Suggest you to reconfigure the File History from the scratch to see if it makes any difference. First, try to turn off the File History. Wipe away all files from the thumb drive by formatting it and then
 unplug it. Now plug-in the drive back and then try to configure the File History to see if it works correctly this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible, do check this issue by configuring the File History with different USB drive. This might give us the clue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

<p>The asterisk (*) and the question mark (?) are both <em>wildcards,</em> which can be replaced by other characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The asterisk can be replaced by any number of characters. For example, if you want to search for all the Word documents on your computer, you would search for *.docx</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question mark can be replaced only by a single character.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want an asterisk or a question mark to <em>not</em> be a wildcard, you place a tilde (`) just before it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case:&nbsp; &nbsp;*.` could represent (among other things) all files with a tilde in the file extension.</p>

I have not played it so I do not know if that's right though!. If not I guess its either L3 &amp; R3 (Click in the sticks) or the back/select buttons as they are the only other options.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p><span>This can be broken down to 2 causes:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – check with provider if it is required or not</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.<br />
<br />
Thanks</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p><span>Please try to resolve&nbsp;your concern by deleting the&nbsp;emails stuck in the Outbox.
<br />
<br />
To do this, click on&nbsp;<strong>Work&nbsp;offline</strong>&nbsp;(the globe icon)&nbsp;from the <b>Home</b> tab in Windows Live Mail, - then try to delete the messages. Remember to go back online after you have tried deleting the messages.<br />
<br />
After doing so, please try sending emails again. Let us know if problem persists.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</span></p>

            <p>Then you <em>haven't</em> applied Comcast's recommended settings. </p>
<p>Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the <em>Servers </em>tab, ensure that <em>My server requires authentication
</em>is selected.</li><li>On the <em>Advanced </em>tab, select <em>This server requires a secure connection (SSL)</em> for outgoing mail and change the port number to 465.</li></ul>
<p>When you've made these changes, click <em>Work offline </em>and remove any unsent messages from the outbox (below the account folders in the folder pane). Then close down WLMail and wait a few minutes before relaunching and testing.</p>

            <p>That shows that your settings haven't changed.</p>
<p><em>If </em>you have made the changes I suggested and <em>if</em> you are getting that error message after doing so, something is preventing changes to the account settings. What security software are you running - Norton, McAfee, Advanced System Care, System
 Mechanic etc.?</p>
