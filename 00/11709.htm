<h2>            Games</h2>
                    <p>Please help: &nbsp;I'd like to have few games for my kid on my E72, for example "High Speed 3D". I registered with the OVI Store, gave them my cell phone number and via SMS I have gotten the web link in order to download this game (and few others). OK, I downloaded
 the game (and few others), but now the system/cell phone asks me every time when my kid intends to use this game (and other games) to connect to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to be connected to the internet, so please help me how to get few games downloaded to my cell phone for my kid, just to use it when he wants it, &nbsp;WITHOUT being connected to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

<p>Thanks farby, but...no...no...no....I have tried OVI Store, I have tried your link, but what ever I download, which ever game I download, the "system/cell phone" asks for network connection, for server connection, for internet connection......for connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where did I go wrong? I know that some of my friends downloaded "car games" from OVI Store and now they can use it with no internet/server/network connection, but what ever I do, obviously I do have a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am educated, I am familiar with the "electronics", I know how to follow instructions, but I can not get/have these games downloaded for my kid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's start from the beginning in order to discover what's wrong, if this is OK with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

<p>Thanks farby for taking care.&nbsp; Well, the games from your link are NOT available for Nokia E72, so they advised me to go to „related“ games, so I went back to
<a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/21243?clickSource=browse&amp;contentArea=games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://store.ovi.com/content/21243?clickSource=browse&amp;contentArea=games</a> in order to download FREE car game High Speed 3D:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on photo</li><li>Connect E72 to the computer, OVI software is engaged, turned on</li><li>Click on “Send to mobile”</li><li>Computer OVI recognizes E72 as well as the game, transfer/download starts</li><li>Download completed</li><li>Finish download on your cell phone</li><li>Completed</li><li>Start the game…but……system asks for network/internet connection</li><li>If I enable network/internet connection on the cell phone, the game is available, if I refuse, I can not start the game</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens to ALL FREE Nokia games that I have downloaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, farby, since this link is NOT useful for E72, do you have any other idea? Also, it is my standpoint that if I downloaded “your” game, the system would ask internet connection, too, that is for sure, it “reacts” like that, in the similar way like supported
 games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is to be done, I need these games for my 8 year kid, I am rally sick of these Nokia cell phones, after the number of issues with the navigation, which IS NOT useful without expensive external GPS LD-4W, now I am facing this “games” problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously I have thrown 350,00 euro in the river, since now I hate Nokia, but I can not change it since I gave money for it. But, next time, I shall not make mistake, HTC is my next choice based on the experience of my friends who also switched from Nokia
 to HTC.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW have you tried anything from the earlier link I had pasted. Because anyways almost all the applications available at OVI store are developed by 3rd parties and not Nokia.. so downloading from other site will be equally OK..</p>

<p>Thanks, anyway, I hope that someone else will be able to help, since this is not supposed to be science fiction, oh God, this is just simple download of child's games to the cell phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, obviously, Nokia made it so complicated and they are doing their best to turn off and to drive away regular, as well as potential customers....this what Motorola did once upon a time....</p>

<p>I think that might be your problem right there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my experience, most (at least new) free games on Ovi Store require internet connection for in-game advertisements. So it is not an error, it is expected behaviour. Read the game description/instructions carefully, it should be told there&nbsp;if internet
 connection is required for playing the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want a version of the game that does not have in-game ads (thus, does not need internet connection during the game, unless it is an online multiplayer game or something), pay for it. Don't look for free games. Many of the free in-game ad games have
 also a purchaseable version that does not have the in-game internet ads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If those $ games still require internet connection, then you obviously have some configuration problem.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Case in point: Farby gave you the link to "High Speed 3D Free" car game, which I presume is the same game you have downloaded already? At the end of the game description it clearly says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><em>High Speed 3D Free</em></font></p>
<p><em>Get ready to take to the streets in High Speed 3D, finally the true street racing experience has arrived on your phone. With 20 tracks to race, 9 cars to choose from and a whole host of customisations there ’s plenty here for the petrol-head to tinker
 with. Real driving physics, insane drifts and nitrous boosts and some of the most visually stunning locations to drive around, High Speed 3D has it all.
<u><strong>In-game ads by innerActive (requires data connection).</strong></u> </em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yes,&nbsp;for example this particular&nbsp;free game requires data connection for&nbsp;starting and playing&nbsp;the game. That's how the game maker gets at least some money through ads&nbsp;for people playing their free(?) game. Same principle as&nbsp;like how Google offers people
 free(?) applications and services (Google, GoogleMaps, Youtube etc.), which are funded through online ads jumping onto your eyes all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I think there still are SOME free games which don't require data connection for in-game ads, but either they are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- short demo versions of full games (which in turn cost a few bucks), sometimes time restricted or can be played only for n times until the game deactivated itself</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- old **bleep** silly games which you wouldn't play even for free</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Nokia sponsored games (ie. made by Nokia, or Nokia has paid for the game maker). These are obviously the best free games, for example I recall some obscure nice puzzle game where you tried to get rid of flying symbols by dividing the screen (sorry I don't
 remember the name of the game, great graphics and music/sound effects in it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes Ovi Store also seems to have some campaigns, e.g. offering some full game free for some time. I recall downloading e.g. some Sonic Jump game for E66 last summer for free,&nbsp;which was actually quite cool game. Unfortunately the game disappeared there
 later, I haven't seen it since.</p>

    <title>&#34;Draw&#34; feature greyed out in Excel worksheet - Surface Book - - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#34;Draw&#34; feature greyed out in Excel worksheet - Surface Book - Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I am running Office 365, and am working on a tabbed excel worksheet. The worksheet is used to enter information for designing septic systems. There are 5 pages that require signatures, and I would like to sign them, on-screen, with my Surface Book pen. I
 am able to sign 2 of them, but not the other 3. I am working on a Surface Book &gt; Windows 10. I have the same issue with my Sony Vaio &gt; Windows 10 (up from W 8 &gt; W 8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two of the pages that I CAN sign show "IF(ISBLANK('Prelim Eval'!G131)," ",'Prelim Eval'!G131), in the formula bar, but so does the third one that I CAN'T sign. The referenced G131 is a signature blank that doesn't have anything in the formula bar, which
 is also a place that I would like to use my Surface pen to sign. The 5th page that I would like to sign is also blank in the formula bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just went back and found that I can unprotect the sheets and get the "draw" feature to work. This makes a little sense for the 2 with the blank formula bars, but I'm still unsure as to why I can't sign the 1 of 3 similar (formula in formula bar) sheets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I/should I unprotect the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>cells</strong></em></span> that I want to sign? I don't really want to leave the sheet(s) unprotected, as I tab between fields, and I think that affects that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The spreadsheet can be downloaded, if anyone wants to play with it from: www.septic.umn.edu/sites/septic.umn.edu/files/ssts_design_forms-advanced_042016.xlsx , or if you're careful about links, it's at the University of Minnesota Extension's website: septic.umn.edu
 &gt; Professionals &gt; Forms + Worksheets &gt; Basic + Advanced Design Forms</p>
<p>
</p><p>The forms were originally created several years ago, and I'm not sure if they have just been updated, or if the new ones started from scratch. I can go back to forms that were created in 2014 and I am able to sign them, where I need to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA for any suggestions/solutions to this!</p>
<p>

            I can unprotect the sheet, and then use the Surface pen, but I'm hoping that I can unprotect the individual cells, somehow, so I don't have to format and unformat each time I want to use the pen.

<p>I have an Excel spreadsheet that in Excel 2016 I have froze some panes, went into Format Cells -- Protection -- and un-locked certain cells, then protected the worksheet. When opened on iPad via Office 365 I can select and type in the un-locked cells but<br />
all the Draw options are grayed out. I need some of those cells to contain a signature. I want to keep the worksheet protected and only allow edits and signature in the un-locked cells so leaving it unprotected to activate the draw features is not a good option.
 I also want to keep the header frozen as worksheet scrolls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get it to work if I un-freeze the panes and when I protect the sheet make sure the "Edit objects" option was also selected (in addition to select unlocked cells as well of course). But if I freeze panes it stops working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get the Draw options to work in unlocked cells of a protected worksheet that is using the freeze panes feature?
</p>

<p>I have been working with a spreadsheet that requires some signatures, as well. I have to unlock the sheet - Format&gt;Unprotect Sheet - then I can highlight the draw features, sign the doc, then I Format&gt;Protect Sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to leave the cell unprotected, but I haven't been able to do that on this particular sheet, so I take the long way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has an inspection report that I have to sign, and they have done something which allows the signature on the required blank without the previous steps. That form can be found at: wrong link, see below. I don't know
 if looking at source code might help to figure out solution, but have at it, if you're more adept than me at creation of excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous link was not the form I wanted to link to. This is the link:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/wq-wwists4-31c.xls
 .&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Again, if you want to google to it, search "compliance inspection form" from http://www.pca.state.mn.us/ and the third result is
 an xlsx sheet, and that is the one that&nbsp; will allow me to sign the protected document, without unprotecting.</p>

                    <p>This has been going on for a couple of months and I am sick of it!</p>
<p>I have my junk email filter set to Exclusive, yet I continue to get these messages in my inbox and they already arrive flagged and pinned, which is probably what is causing it to not go to my junk mail box instead.</p>
<p>I receive dozens of these every day and I register them all as SPAM, but then I will receive the same messages again, but from another domain.</p>
<p>I have seen posts in other sites about this and no one has been able to provide a helpful answer.</p>
<p>How is Outlook allowing these emails to be automatically flagged and why is Outlook not applying my filters to these?</p>
<p>And no, this is not malware and has nothing to do with my computer. It is obviously being sent from spammers who bought my information from some other site and who are smart enough to know how to bypass email filters so these end up in my inbox instead of
 my junk mail box.<br />
Please help! There has to be a way to resolve this issue!<br />

In spam mail identification and/or junk mail blocking list, the blocking is email address or domain name blocking?<br />
May try to include domain name on the block list to see help or not

<p>Hi&nbsp;pedroVirgilio,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you connecting to your home Wi-Fi? Try to reset your router and then check again. You can also soft reset your phone by pressing and holding the power button for 10 seconds. Make sure your wifi is visible.</p>

<p>Thank you moderator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;We did reset,as a matter of fact we did a Master Reset....&nbsp; same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am wondering if there is a switch that should be on and isn't or off and it is confllictiing with something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this is my son's phone and he is at school where they have wifi everywhere but he can't connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He hasn't been home since he's got the new (used) phone so that we could't experiment with our router.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we were together this weekend at a restaurant that has wifi and i easily connected with my phone but he couldn't connect with his 710. It just says "searching ..."&nbsp; forwever.</p>

<h2>            Windows phone alarm</h2>
                    Why can't&nbsp;the dismiss and snooze buttons be made much larger and a brighter colour. When I wake up bleary-eyed in the morning it would really help. They could cover almost the whole screen. It seems a no-brainer like the recent change to put the camera
 button on the unlocked phone screen!

Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>About </strong>&gt; <strong>OS </strong><strong>build</strong>.<br />
2. Are you receiving a specific error messages or codes?<br />

<p>
</p><p>Same problem on my Lumia 950XL for me Shaira,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update right before the anniversary &nbsp;my phone restarts like 20 to 40 times a day</p>
<p>Depending on how I use it.</p>
<p>It can be when I slide down the shortcut down, in the middle of a call, just after sending a text, playing a game, reading news, playing a vides.... and a lot more different situations... so no real consistency in 'when' the phone restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I noticed is that it ALMOST never happens when the phone is plugged to the electrical plug (in the wall, not the usb-c cable connected to a laptop non usb-c).</p>
<p>
</p><p>to your questions :</p>
<p>1. Build... Phone is in French so I assume this will be the version for me : 1607</p>
<p>&nbsp;Microprogram is: 10.0.14393.189</p>
<p>2. No error or codes. The phone just either restarts, or just turns itself off, with a huge process going on that makes the phone sooooo hot ~60°C...; This is really bad !</p>
<p>3. Yes, as you can see, all updates (even the one from last week) are installed, w/o any error again.</p>
<p>4. Soft resets all the time to restart the phone when it's blocked, took off the sd card (that I never put back in) hard reset &amp; factory settings, Use of your Lumia recovery tool... all of those has been useless for my issue. Always restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you please have a great idea to help &nbsp;me please. It's been over a month now and I am starting to become crazy about this...&nbsp;</p>

            I also have the same problem here with my mothers phone, the phone is updated and all. shuts off randomly and there is no way to turn it up again except removing the battery. Sometimes at boot it crashes and restarts. This issue began today, also the battery
 gets drained a lot, according to the battery app the home screen has been using up to 40% of the battery in the last 24 hours.&nbsp; The phone gets hot but the&nbsp;battery is cool. No error messages or codes either.

            <p>I have done a soft reset, recovery not once but over 5 times. It didn't help. Now, at some point, I felt the battery was bad. the phone gets hot around the SD Card and goes off on its own. It sometimes shows a green screen and an alarming sound which is
 absurd. I have packed up the phone backed into its case.</p>
<p>I have called Microsoft support, nothing done. Annoying part is I saved up a lot of funds to buy this phone and I can't get a service center because I am in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this issue is resolved or hints given on what to do.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I FOUND&nbsp; A SOLUTION that worked 100% for me ! I replaced the battery with a new one !!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, Microsoft didn't help at all on that&nbsp;but I also didn't want to send&nbsp; my Lumia 950xl back for repair so... but reading a lot of forums I had the idea to change the battery...</p>
<p>What a challenge, again ! They are out of stock everywhere (eBay US/UK... Amazon US/UK/NL/FR, etc., Amazon DE is not shipping to France) a nightmare. But I had the chance to find a website from a real shop in the south of France that had just one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received my new battery last week end and I DIDN'T HAVE ANY REBOOT or any heating of the lower part of the phone, nothing. This fantastic mobile is 100% back on track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The truth is that it has been a month and 1/2 that this phone was driving me totally crazy and now I feel that I have a brand new phone.</p>
<p>As I was investigating the issue this summer, I made hard resets (that didn't change the initial problem of course) but now, this phone rocks, I loved it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft, consider my message &amp; share this with your technical team... and please also&nbsp;ensure your battery are available on external stores. This is at least the minimum !</p>
<p>
</p><p>KIndest regards, good luck you all, Lumia 950XL is the best phone !</p>

            Oh my God!! I have the EXACT EXACT SAME ISSUE! WITH EVERYTHING SAME. it is 100% charged before i go to the office, and sure to the reboots, dies in an hour. While charging, the reboots are almost not there. Other times if i slide the notification bar down,
 or open the screen lock fast, or listen to music and a notification comes,r movement, it restarts. It is terrible. Just hate it.

            <p>I would advise you get a new battery. I had same problem last year October. I had to get a new battery and it did the trick. Since last year, I haven't had the problem or had my phone restart.</p>
<p>I got my battery from www.rounded.com as Microsoft store doesn't have any advertised.</p>

<p>Inasmuch I would like to buy an original one which might be more expensive compared to those clones readily available on some stalls here in Manila, there are no official Microsoft distributor of accessories that&nbsp; we can buy here.&nbsp; Until late last year when
 Microsoft had an official stores here, they are not selling any accessories other than the display dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that firmware or OS update can resolve if the clone batteries are supplying less current the phone requires.&nbsp; What's more, heat dissipating specially when kept in your purse, is difficult to ignore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although Microsoft has ended for now their device support, I hope that MS can continue their support and maintenance services those Lumia 950/XL/550/650 phones.&nbsp; There is only one local official non MS service center here in the Philippines but are not selling
 any accessories (batteries) for that matter.</p>

<h2>            Filename svchst.exe detected on my system from Microsoft Security Essentials</h2>
                    <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is about my Microsoft Security Essential Program and the program detected that I have some files with filenames called svchst.exe exist on my system and asked me if I want to forward these files to Microsoft for further evaluation. So I clicked OK but
 then after 1 or 2 days, the same pop up screen appeared when I log onto Windows again and it ask me the same question and it said it detected the same file svchst.exe on my system and ask me if I want to forward these files to Microsoft for further evaluation.&nbsp;
 So I clicked OK again and these pop up screen will appear once every few days.&nbsp; So does that mean my computer is now infected with viruses.&nbsp; I tried to locate that file svchst.exe manually&nbsp; myself on my computer but the search results don’t show such a file
 exist on system.&nbsp; So I run a full scan using the Microsoft Security Essential program and then it show I have some Trojans on my system and I clicked CLEAN and the program remove it for me.&nbsp; But then later after a while when I reboot the Windows again, the
 same pop up screen will show I have that file svchst.exe exist on my system.&nbsp; Does is my system safe from that file already?&nbsp; How do I remove that file?&nbsp; Or that file is just harmless on my system?&nbsp; The problem only happen recently.&nbsp; Before, I have no such
 problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please help.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community. I'm pleased to assist you with your concern on your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my understanding, you want to retrieve&nbsp;your emails that were forwarded to an account that was set up by the hacker. If this is correct, please be informed that it is not possible to recover the forwarded emails from your account. What you can do is
 to disable the email forwarding option on your account to&nbsp;prevent&nbsp;other emails&nbsp;from getting&nbsp;forwarded again to a different account. Here are the steps on how to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>From your <font><b>Inbox</b>, click the <b>gear icon </b>found on the upper right corner beside your name.</font></span>
</li><li><span>Go to <font><b>More mail settings</b>.</font></span> </li><li><span>Under <font><b>Managing your account</b>, select <b>Email forwarding</b>.</font></span>
</li><li><span>Choose <font><b>Don’t forward</b>.</font></span> </li><li><span>Click<font><b> Save</b>.</font></span></li></ol>
<p>In addition to that, <span><font color="#000000">to prevent&nbsp;this issue&nbsp;from happening again, make sure to visit the Hotmail Help and How-to article below and follow all the steps provided there on how to make your account safe and secure from hackers.</font></span></p>

            I was also hacked.&nbsp; During the cleanup process, quite costly to an&nbsp;older person, &nbsp;I found the address to which my e-mails had been forwarded. I cannot understand how someone got into my account, authorized the forwarding of my emails and even changed the
 language to whatever they speak in Istanbul where they wanted funds sent to rescue me! Can I safely send a message to
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and expect to reach someone.&nbsp; If I can, can you trace it to the hackers! May, 2016&nbsp;

<h2>            Why is my phone so often not be able to Connect when it should from what I see on it&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>This happens to me all the time. Something must be broken inside of it as I've learned to just keep trying or even to turn the phone OFF &amp; then ON and usually it will suddenly be able to get
 to any website since mysteriously it is now 'Connected' even though all of the Settings are the same as before as are the Wi-Fi &amp; LTE data icons.<br />
This is aggravating as heck, obviously. :-(<br />
It's not a virus as this thing has done it ever since I got it from T-Mobile in a warranty exchange a year ago.<br />
The only reason that I didn't just return it is since this copy of Nokia Lumia 635 behaved somewhat better than the first one and also since it does this Won't Connect stuff only every few days and I didn't realize at the time how annoying that can be over
 time.<br />
But products are supposed to perform at least to some level, which neither copy of Lumia 635 that I've had has, in my mind. Maybe my expectations are higher than those in today's generation who are more used to imperfections in technologically based things.<br />
I've obviously becomes well aware over time of trying Soft Resets &amp; Hard (Factory)Resets and neither has fixed this deal.<br />
This thing has less than 1/2 and&nbsp;really only 1/4 of the acceptable minimum RAM that any current smartphone of any type has but even as little as I know about technology, I'm pretty sure that couldn't be the cause of this mess although it probably is what causes
 some of the other shortcomings.<br />
I've been a lifelong owner of a very small manufacturing business of wheels for racing go-karts, so I do know a thing or 2 about product design &amp; development along with quality standards and customer expectations.<br />
This happens anywhere I am, either out using LTE or 4G, in my house using our Wi-Fi and possibly the Booster that I bought trying to fight this deal, or in a public place that has free Wi-Fi. It simply doesn't matter so.<br />
Honestly, it can loose the internet and everything on the phone says it has 100% if it knew how to use it.</span></p>

            Do you mean to say that the phone fails to connect to internet even with LTE and WiFi available? If it is so, first make sure the phone is up-to-date. Then go to settings and verify that the date, time, region and language settings match with each other.
 Lastly, try clearing all history in Internet Explorer and try opening a webpage again.

<p><span>I live in southern California so we are on PST time zone, so all is good.
</span></p>
<p><span>You'll notice though something that might have something to do with this that I'd have no idea how to fix. In the 5th of the 6 images where it says
<strong>About</strong>, it lists <strong>2nd Nokia Lumia 635</strong>. That's because when I was having help setting this phone up and dealing with OneCloud, the helper on this site told me that if I hooked the new phone up by&nbsp;cable to my computer as soon as
 I got it and then renamed the phone, it would save an extra copy of something somewhere. I took him at his word and did it even though I don't use OneCloud, since I figured that I might want to be able to restore everything from the copy of it that OneCloud
 might have somewhere just in case the copy on OneCloud under</span><strong><span>2nd Nokia Lumia 635</span></strong><span>&nbsp;ever got screwed up with something that I did&nbsp;or it
 got&nbsp;infected.</span></p>
<p><span>But honestly, I don't even plug this phone in to this PC with the USB cord to charge it, let alone transfer files. I use emails into my outlook.com account to transfer
 DOCs and PICs so that they're available anywhere and my PC is my storage 'cloud'. I've never even gotten One Cloud to work and I've got another question at this site trying to get it to work right. See that at
</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/forum/odoptions-odmobile/how-do-i-reset-onedrive-to-sync-windows-phone/c14ff4dc-86dc-45af-91cf-8ac99dd3b14f">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/forum/odoptions-odmobile/how-do-i-reset-onedrive-to-sync-windows-phone/c14ff4dc-86dc-45af-91cf-8ac99dd3b14f</a>
<span><br />
I'VE "CLEARED HISTORY" PLENTY OF TIMES IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS AND OFTEN BEFORE THAT, AS I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIX THIS PHONE THRU HELP ON THIS SITE IN MANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT I'VE ASKED. I'VE EVEN HAD A SITE ADMIN DELETE A FEW AND SAY IT WAS A DUPLICATE QUESTION.<br />
I CAN'T SEE WHY "CLEARING HISTORY" AGAIN WOULD CHANGE ANYTHING.<br />
Maybe I should just give up but I've tried to convince myself to do that and trash this phone but I keep finding myself trying to fix it. That's just who I am.<br />
I've tried to have T-Mobile's T-Force support team on Facebook help fix this and we've done both Soft Resets &amp; Hard Resets and nothing has helped.<br />
I've also tried to get help in online chats with Nokia support and from the Tech Republic site The TR guys all laugh at me for having a joke of a phone.<br />
This phone that I really consider to be a junker also has issues with displaying m.facebook.com in weird partial screens (see other Question on that) and some weirdo problem every time I type in a Status on IE at m.facebook.com (see other Question on that).<br />
Also, sometimes it just randomly bails out of a Facebook Comment that I'm attempting to add a photo to and right when I tap the photo that I want it to upload, it goes back to some random page on Facebook that I was on a while ago and if I still want to make
 that Comment, I have to try to find it if I can remember enough about it to do that.<br />
Also, quite often the screen isn't responsive to finger taps, almost as if the processor or the RAM is too busy doing something else. The workaround on that is often to just refresh the IE page if I'm on Facebook&nbsp; or to go to to home screen and then to go back
 to whatever APP was misbehaving and start over.<br />
As little as I do know about techie stuff, I know that none of this should ever be happening on any product that is sold to the public.<br />
This model phone has a pathetic .5gb RAM when the least that any phone should ever have nowadays is 1.0gb and so many of them have 2.0gb or even 4.0gb like the Alcatel IDOL 4S that I hope to afford to get soon if there's any money left from my federal disability
 check some month.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Now open Store and see if there are any pending app updates, install them all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this still doesn't do the trick, open settings&gt;data sense and see if there is a data limit enabled or not. I am particularly not sure about the nomenclature, but there should be something called data saver. Disable data savings or anything like that.
 It may be capping your data usage even on WiFi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, a 512MB RAM phone will not preform up-to-the mark this days. The Facebook webpage consumes a lot of RAM and the performance is terrible on my old Lumia with 512MB RAM, but my new phone with more than 1GB of RAM performs better. Windows 10 Mobile
 that runs on the current Windows Phones perform much much better than Windows Phone 8.1 and you should consider getting a new device. The Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows is a beast of a phone and performs wonderfully with any task you throw at it.</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying to try to help me. I've been thru a lot with this phone in trying to make it behave.
</p>
<p>1. Although I've just recently been told elsewhere to try the Updates thing, I'll try it again. In Settings&gt;Phone Updates, it says<em><strong>Your phone is up to date. Last checked 14 hours ago
</strong></em>and I see <strong>☑</strong><em><strong>Automatically download updates if my data settings allow it.</strong></em></p>
<p>2. I opened Store and I don't know how to&nbsp;see if there are any pending app updates, but I see an orange box in the upper right with a [1] in it, so maybe that means that there's 1 update hidden somewhere that I could have it install?&nbsp;I clicked the ... icon
 and the tapped My APPs and it said 61 APPs. At the top it says <strong>NOT INSTALLED
</strong>followed by <strong>Paint Sparkles</strong>. I haven't a clue what that is or why it is there. Maybe that's what that orange [1] in the upper right was?</p>
<p>There aren't anywhere near 61 APPs shown in this list. I only see 19 so WTH? If I slide over to the HISTORY tab, I count 38 APPs on that list. Still not 61.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the first&nbsp;list I saw&nbsp;are <strong>7 AP</strong><strong>Ps</strong> that it has in a sub-list titled
<p><strong>WiFi Live Tile ------- Acquired: over a year ago</strong></p>
<p><strong>eBay ----------------- Acquired: over a year ago</strong></p>
<p><strong>_____ Not available - Acquired: over a year ago</strong></p>
<p>_____<strong> Not available - Acquired: over a year ago</strong></p>
<p>_____<strong> Not available - Acquired: over a year ago</strong></p>
<p><strong>_____ Not available - Acquired: over a year ago</strong></p>
<p><strong>Code Scanner------- Acquired: over a year ago</strong></p>
<p>I messed around with all 7 of these and could never figure out how to remove them from showing up on this list so I finally had to give up.</p>
<p>I still don't know how to do your <strong>"install them all"</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>I did just tap on the orange [1] and it popped OneDrive&nbsp;</strong>and says
<strong>These downloads have been waiting for more than a week. Action needed. [Tap here]&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This is GREAT since I just started another Question on March 5th about why my <strong>
OneDrive</strong> doesn't seem to connect my Windows phone and my Windows 10 pc to keep them synced. This might fix that. Cool. See

            <p>Oops, I didn't finish your suggestions earlier, so here I go:</p>
<p>1. Settings &gt; data sense, it says <strong>Current data limit&nbsp;-&nbsp;None specified</strong>. So I guess that is good as I don't have any problems with even coming close to any T-Mobile&nbsp;data limit issues.</p>
<p>Scrolling down I see <strong>Browser data savings </strong>is set to <strong>Automatic</strong>. The
<strong>other choices are Off, Standard or High</strong>.</p>
<p>I've looked everywhere and<strong> I can't find any Setting labeled anything like Data Saver
</strong>although I'd swear that I've seen that before somewhere. I couldn't find any help finding it on the internet. I looked in Wi-Fi, Battery Saver, Data Sense, Storage Sense, Network+ and Display.</p>
<p>So maybe there isn't a Setting for this or can you help me find it.</p>
<p>2. That Alcatel Idol 4S has been on my wish list for a few months now and T-Mobile has even dropped the price to $288. It has 4.0 gb RAM which is 8x what I have now. I've got to guess that it also has a way better processor.<br />
My son now works at a franchise Sprint store and he keeps trying to get me to switch to Sprint. But I can't stand Androids or iPhones. I'm a Windows guy and Sprint doesn't offer Windows phones.</p>
<p>I tried a T-Mobile Android Samsung J7 &amp; the free Outlook APP on it and I hated it. I took it back after a week even though they charged me some restocking fee of $50 or so. BTW, the Android Outlook APP wouldn't let you alter the Contact's Note section for
 some stupid reason. It would display one if it found one that had been made online at live.outlook.com or in a computer's Outlook.</p>

            <p>Are these Nokia Lumia 635 phones known to be really bad amongst anyone who wants to do anything more than just call or text or take photos or videos?</p>
<p>I realize that they are a lower end phone pricewise but I find it odd that if it was known to be somewhat of a joke of a phone, why would Microsoft do their business deal with Nokia and then only make what I've heard were pretty minor upgrades too slowly
 as the Androids &amp; iPhones took over the smartphone world, literally?</p>
<p>I've been a longtime Windows phone guy &amp; I had 5 Motorola MPx-220 flip-phones which were practically the prototype smartphones back before people had even heard of getting the internet or emails on a cell phone and nobody had heard of texting yet.</p>

            <p>Thanks but I'm not sure that I'm willing to go thru the madness of doing another Hard 'Factory' Reset on this Nokia Lumia 635. I've done it once on the first one with T-Mobile T-Force's online assistance and they're no fun to do.</p>
<p>It also is worrisome that the site link that you gave me would just have someone run the Tool and start the process without their even knowing about, much less doing, the steps you need to do to make sure that you can fully recover afterwards as far as restoring
 all of you Photos, APP installations, Docs, home screen tile setup, email accounts etc, etc, etc.</p>

            <p>The tool will install the latest available software on your phone and wipe the phone memory. Basically, you'd have to start over again, by installing the apps and all. But nothing on your SD card will get erased in the process. Also if your phone has syncing
 and backups enabled, the contacts and texts will restore after setting up the phone again with the same Microsoft account. You can always download the contacts+messages backup app from the store and backup them in your SD card and restore them after the reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go ahead with the reset, please refrain from restoring a full backup and start afresh. You'll be surprised to know that it mitigates a lot of problems by starting afresh.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Raw materials</h2>
                    <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've just downloaded the "Northwind sales web database" and it's almost perfect for what I want ... except 1 (major) problem&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is currently set up with</div>
<div><b>Customers </b>who make <b>orders </b>with multiple <b>products </b>- which is linked to the
<b>Stock inventory</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However the products I sell are made up of raw materials, e.g. I sell a cushion, which is made from 1/2 metre of fabric and a zip. Is there any easy way to add another layer (raw&nbsp;materials) within the products? So there are</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Customers&nbsp;</b>who make&nbsp;<b>orders&nbsp;</b>with multiple&nbsp;<b>products&nbsp;</b>made from multiple&nbsp;<b>materials&nbsp;</b>- which is linked to the&nbsp;<b>Stock inventory</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So if I sell 10&nbsp;<b>cushions&nbsp;</b>it&nbsp;currently&nbsp;adjusts stock levels of the "<b>cushion</b>" product to minus 10, but I want it to adjusts the the stock levels of "<b>Fabric</b>" minus 5 metres and
<b>Zips </b>to minus 10?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then when I buy new stock, it will be added to the zips and fabric not the cushion.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>... or maybe there is another part / different database I should download?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks, Sarah&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>p.s. I'm new to access - so hope that makes sense!</div>

            Sure. At a high level ... off the top of my head<br />
<br />
You need a couple of new tables.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Materials:<br />
material_ID&nbsp;&nbsp; unique number (mandatory)<br />
description&nbsp;&nbsp; text(?)&nbsp; (mandatory)&nbsp; (the descriptive name the material is known by, ie cotton, steel, 2x4 Spruce G1S etc)<br />
Color(?)&nbsp; text (optional)&nbsp; (is color important, I guess it is)<br />
quantity_in_stock&nbsp;&nbsp; number (mandatory)<br />
quantity_in_stock_units&nbsp; text (mandatory)<br />
<br />
<br />
Product_defined:<br />
product_ID unique number (mandatory)<br />

            What you are describing is called a Bill of Materials (BOM). This is not an easy thing to deal with. One question is whether your BOM can have multiple levels. So that a component of a product may, itself, be made up of different raw materials.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Also, what about waste? Your cushion uses 1/2 metre of fabric to make, but how much is left on the cutting room floor?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest doing research on Bill of Materials design to see how to setup such an app. You may also find templates to help.</div>

</p><p><strong>Quick Guide to Getting Rid of the Syskey Password Created by Fake MS Phone Support Scammers.</strong><br />
<br />
I recently had a friend fall victim to the SYSKEY Phone Scam on a laptop running Windows 10. &nbsp;After several hours of research I was able to come up with a suitable solution. &nbsp;So to cut down on the potential time and effort someone else might have with this
 issue... &nbsp;I'll list what I did to recover the personal files and then rid the affected machine of the SYSKEY Block.<br />
<br />
I am by no means an IT Professional, I'm just a guy with a basic understanding of computers and enough confidence to be extremely dangerous. &nbsp;That being said, research each and every step I've listed before you try it, and don't try it if you aren't completely
 comfortable with any aspect of it. You can very easily make some irreversible mistakes when you begin tinkering in areas of which your own personal knowledge is limited. &nbsp;That being said... here's a<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> rough step-by-step</span>
 of the process I used.<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Entered the affected machine's BIOS or Boot menu and ensured that USB was the first option and the Boot Mode was set to CSM.</li><li>Downloaded a copy of <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Rufus</a> to help create a boot-able USB drive</li><li>Downloaded a copy of <a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hiren's BootCD</a> ISO.</li><li>Downloaded a copy of Windows 10 ISO using the Media Creation Tool.</li><li>Used Rufus to Burn Hiren's onto a USB drive and plugged it into the affected laptop.</li><li>Powered on laptop and booted the Hiren's Tool.&nbsp;Selected mini Win XP, to boot up and run a micro version of Win XP.</li><li>Once inside Win XP I was able to copy all of the personal user data that my friend was wanting to keep from the corrupted Windows 10 file system&nbsp;onto an external drive/USB flash drive.
<em><strong>Caveat... Be sure to use a storage device other than the USB containing Hiren's as it can/will be used in the next step.</strong></em></li><li>With that done I then restarted the laptop, again booting up Hiren's. Choosing
<strong>Darik's Boot And Nuke</strong> (<strong>DBAN</strong>) tool, I then erased the HDD to clean up any lingering traces of the scammers handiwork.</li><li>Used Rufus again, this time to make a boot-able USB using the Windows 10 ISO I downloaded in step 4.
<strong>*</strong><em><strong>(you can re-use the USB containing Hiren's for this step, just know that it will be removed)</strong></em></li><li>Plugged that into the laptop and did an Express Windows 10 install and imported the recovered user files back into Windows 10.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Viola... A fresh Windows 10 install that has the original personal data and is completely free from the clutches of the SYSKEY Password Scam. &nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
I would estimate that the entire process as outlined above shouldn't take more than 2 hours, depending on the volume of info being processed. &nbsp;That's a fair improvement over the actual time it took me to research and compile the process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I'm fairly confident this process would work with other Windows OS... but I've only done it with the Windows 10.</em></p>
<p>

<h3> ycieters  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cross-references not updating in Word &#40;2010&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am editing a Word document (2010) with lots of cross-references. All cross-references are added as follows:
<b>References</b> -&gt; <b>Cross-reference</b> -&gt; <b>Insert</b>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the document is still under construction (content is added or deleted weekly), the cross-references need to be updated regularly which I do as follows:</p>

<p>-
<b>File</b> → <b>Print</b> (which takes me to the <b>Print Preview</b> and cross-references are updated automatically)
</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>-By selecting a cross-reference or selecting the entire document
<span>&nbsp;</span>-&gt; right-click -&gt; select<b> Update Field</b><span> -&gt;
<span>&nbsp;</span>-&gt; right-click -&gt; select<b> Update Field</b><span> -&gt;
<b>Update entire table</b></span></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><span>The issue I now encounter is that some cross-references get updated, and others don’t; all cross-references in the document are however
 entered in the same way (References -&gt; Cross-reference -&gt; Insert).</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Is there any other way to ensure that all cross-references get updated properly? Also, has anyone encountered this same issue and knows
 what the reason could be?</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Thank you</span></p>

<h2>            Excel 2010 keeps printing 1 cell per page&#63;</h2>
                    <p>All of my colleagues are having the same issue since we moved to Excel 2010, when I go to print the preview shows 1 page then click print and it changes to however many cells you have and proceeds to print 1 cell per page, I have tried all different configurations
 on the print settings without being able to gt 1 page per sheet. </p>
<p>Also occurs in both file formats 2003-2007 and 2010? and so eliminating a compatibility mode issue.</p>

<p>Hi Edmund,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not feasible to switch from Office 365 for Business to Office 365 Home. As they are 2 different plans, you need to purchase a new Office 365 Home if you need. You can also

cancel Office 365 for Business</a> subscription if you want. It depends on your requirements.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand your inconvenience towards this issue. I appreciate your efforts posting this query to Microsoft Forums and I will try to make sure the issue gets resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the suggestions provided in the link below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Where do I get additional support for My Account and Information issues?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oaccount-omyinfo/where-do-i-get-additional-support-for-my-account/182df1b3-4c80-42e7-8bc0-b4e041dbed6e">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oaccount-omyinfo/where-do-i-get-additional-support-for-my-account/182df1b3-4c80-42e7-8bc0-b4e041dbed6e</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You have mentioned while changing the password the phone number associated to the account doesn’t take text, hence I suggest you to select the option to get a call on the phone number listed in the account to receive a code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the link below to change the password.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Link has the information about two step verification process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two-step verification helps protect your account by making it more difficult for a hacker to sign in, even if they've got your password. Any time you sign in from a device that isn’t trusted, you'll be prompted to enter a security code.</p>

    <title>Cannot save normal.dotm because it was opened in Read Only mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clairmatin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot save normal.dotm because it was opened in Read Only mode</h2>
                    <p>I have been developing VBA code in Word 2010 for 4 years without any problems.&nbsp; I have about 10,000 lines of really useful code that help me get my work done by providing some powerful shortcuts.&nbsp; Witness many questions I have asked on this forum over that
 period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I built a new PC (Z97 chipset, Core i7 4790K, 16GB DDR3, Samsung 850 Pro SSD) and installed a retail Windows 10 on it. I then installed Office 2010, and moved my templates and documents across.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now every time I make a change to my VBA code and save my current document, I get a message that Normal.dotm cannot be saved because it was opened in read-only mode.&nbsp; I am forced to save with a different name, then exit and rename to normal.dotm.&nbsp; Quite
 a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What have I done or not done?&nbsp; Note that I require every change to my code to be available for subsequent documents in more than one template, so I assume I NEED to update normal.dotm.&nbsp;

            <p>What you've done, I think, is run into one of the many problems that Windows 10 causes for Office. There's a short list in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Known-issues-with-Office-and-Windows-10-28d56d84-c16c-4763-8eac-e51e05a37a16?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>, but we've seen many more in this forum and elsewhere. Yours is the first I've seen with that particular message, though. I expect that the Office developers will be busy for several months trying to patch these bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll suggest that, instead of putting that code in the Normal.dotm template, you put it in a template (or split it among several templates) that you store in the folder %appdata%\Microsoft\Word\Startup. Any templates in that location are automatically loaded
 when Word starts, and macro code in those templates are available to all documents and to code in document-base templates.</p>

<h2>            Lost formatting When opening MS Word document</h2>
                    <p>Dear Readers and Gurus, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened up a word document and formatted it to my specific parameters, typed in text, set page breaks, set up a titles and headings and even a table of contents and a reference page for a non-fiction book I want to complete. I saved the document the regular
 way - by File-save as-. When I opened up the same document, all of the information is there still, all of the formatting in the settings is still set, but everything is completely out of place. Instead of a 9x6 page view, it has a full page view and is applied
 to the entire document. Is there a setting that changes between saving the document, closing the document and reopening the document that is causing these&nbsp; - what appears to me as "zoom" features to occur? I would really like to get back to the 9x6 page view
 so that my words and setting stay the same. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Note that changing the zoom in Word 2013 changes all documents, because the zoom is no longer saved with Word files.</p>
