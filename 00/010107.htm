    <title>IE 11 not displaying Flash Videos on Web sites with Protected Mode On. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ocpocketaces  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE 11 not displaying Flash Videos on Web sites with Protected Mode On. &#40;nhl.com nor nfl.com&#41;</h2>
                    Ever since I upgraded to Windows 8.1 Pro I have not been able to view videos on sites like nhl.com and nfl.com. When I turn "Protected Mode Off" they load instantly. I'm scared of turning Protected Mode Off. I cannot seem to find the security setting in
 IE to allow Flash videos to automatically display without compromising my security. I know I had protected mode On when I was using Windows 8.1 Beta and everything worked. Have any ideas?

Hi,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This issue could be caused due to some incorrect security settings or if the certificate of the website has expired. In this case, I would suggest you to add the website to trusted website list and check if that resolves the issue. You can find more information
 about adding these websites to trusted websites in the section “Add or remove a site from a security zone” in this article:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Try these steps and let us know the results. We’d be happy to help if you need any further assistance.</p>

            <p>Okay so I took your advice and added <a href="http://videos.nhl.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://videos.nhl.com</a> to the safe sites list, and now of course I am able to see the videos. It's just really weird that Protected mode really takes over from watching any videos. Let's
 say I do a Bing Video search about 75% of the videos will not play within Bing in Internet Explorer. If I do the same thing in Chrome they all work. It's just a pain for me to add all of the sites to my trusted websites. I watch a lot of video on NFL, NHL,
 and Ducks.nhl.com. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I thought I have always had "protected mode" on before I updated to 8.1 Pro, but maybe I didn't. Of course now I constantly get the message down at the bottom of my window letting me know it's off. Sort of freaks me out.</p>

            <p>You may want to try this (This solved the problem for me.): </p>
<p>In IE 11, go to NFL.com. Select the IE 11 tools menu (gear icon next to favorites) and select "Compatibility View settings". In the Compatibility View settings pop-up, NFL.com should be in the "Add this website:" entry area. Select "Add". The site is added
 to "Websites you've added to compatibility view:". Both checkboxes are checked. (I don't know if they were previously, but in my IE 11, they are now checked.) Select "Close".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had the same problem with nfl.com and IE 11, although I am using Windows 7 Pro. I had been delaying installing IE 11 and did a couple weeks ago. Ever since, I could not view the nfl.com videos and could not view the banner that had the scheduled games&nbsp;and
 updated scores immediately beneath the nfl.com menu. </p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>Note to IE 11 Product Management: I was not getting a compatibility view icon/button in the address bar&nbsp;when I was viewing the NFL.com website, so I could not tell that there was a compatibility issue. Further, I did not know that the tool menu had a "Compatibility
 View settings" menu selection. I found it when looking for "Internet Options" when viewing

<h2>            Sync Pending</h2>
                    I recently created backup for all my outlook email accounts. However in those files the availability status shows as "sync pending" What does this mean and how do I resolve it? Thanks

            That shouldn't be a problem, as long as the pst is not open in Outlook. 
<br /> How large is the pst file? 
<br />Is it listed in File, Account Settings, open the account settings dialog, Data Files tab. If so, select it and click Remove. 
<br />
<br />As an FYI, you can have outlook.com export a backup of your mailbox to a pst for download  - Open Outlook.com's settings: Settings (gear icon) &gt; View all Outlook settings &gt;  General &gt; Privacy &amp; Settings.

            <p>There&nbsp;appears to be&nbsp;a more fundamental problem: InvoicesToClear is not a table that should be in a normal invoices application. Rather it belongs in a query. What you are doing would create duplicate data which can get out of sync. Problems lay ahead if
 you don't conform to the relational model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second: it appears you are abusing Group By and you're grabbing all possible fields. Rather such totals query should have 2 columns: InvoiceID (or whatever your PK is) and the DollarsToApply expression (note how I am avoiding spaces and other special characters
 which may cause notational complications). Then if you want your query to return additional columns, you use another query and inner join&nbsp;with InvoiceDetails and select them.</p>

            <p>Invoices to Clear is a table that is cleared of data prior to the query running (by a macro on a form). Then used to give the user only the needed data on a form which then updates the true Invoice database table</p>

<p>Aside from completely scrapping days of work anyother suggestions for correcting the error in the formula?</p>

            <p>Using a temp/scratch table has a lot of subtle overhead and related issues so I suggest you plan on eliminating that step sooner rather than later, regardless of how much effort was wasted going down the wrong road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you must forge ahead into a wilderness of issues, follow Tom's very sound recommendation of using two queries, one to calculate the value and the other to join that to the table's other fields.</p>

            <p>Oh no.&nbsp; That makes me really sad.&nbsp; I'm sure it does many other people too :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I clicked on your link, thank you.&nbsp; However I have to say I dont understand what it says.&nbsp; I'm not completely computer illiterate but close ;)&nbsp; I have no idea what a "ribbon" is and I am working with Office 2003 so insert tab and online picture buttons do
 not exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 2007 on another computer but find it so difficult to make the switch as it looks so different.&nbsp; Mind you it looks like I would have the same problem with 2007 too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish big companies would not make major decisions like this, running rough shod over us little (and generally older people).&nbsp; Makes me want to give up trying when I finally get used to something and then they "improve it" which generally means its less
 user friendly, has less functionality and costs more</p>

            What the link says is that MS has changed the US site to display instructions for uses of Office 2007, 2010 and 2013. They don't include instructions for Office 2003 because MS expects you to "upgrade" away from it ...
<br />
<br />
The "ribbon" is what you see in 2007 (and later) that "improves upon" &lt;sarcasm&gt; the menus you use in 2003 to access commands.<br />
<br />
The (several links) &lt;edit&gt; only one link &lt;/edit&gt; at the bottom of the article provides you web access to the "old" version of the clip art / picture site. I don't know how long it will continue in the old format, specifically:<br />
<span>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;<br />
</p>
</span>
<p>Or you can still go to this to search for images as you used to (for now). <br />

<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note: when I originally wrote the article, several of the other English localized sites had not yet been "improved", so they still worked the old way. I guess someone at MS read this article and used it to "fix" those sites specifically (or MS just "got
 around" to fixing them on their own time &lt;grin&gt;).<br />
</p>
&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
(<b>NOTE: </b>I had to update the article)<br />
<br />
In 2003 the equivalent commands are Insert menu &gt; &gt; Picture command &gt; Clip art command. That allows you to search for clipart.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/474c7e36-8bdd-47ce-b89f-ceaa51eb6291" /><br />
<br />
Yes, clicking on "Clip art on Office online" link in that search pane, will take you to the same "borked" search page you have been looking at<br />

<h2>            Bound Checkbox on continious from </h2>
                    
<p>I was attempting to use an unbound checkbox on a form...which thanks to the advice I recieved here...I quickly bailed. I have sense bound the check box to table ISRt![PO]. Now when I click the check box on the form only the checkbox I check is visually changing...which
 is good. The problem is I have a code that runs on click &nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub PO_Click()<br />
If Me!PO = -1 Then<br />
Me![MASTER MODEL].Enabled = True<br />
Me![MASTER CAGE].Enabled = True<br />
Me![MASTER SERIAL NUMBER].Enabled = True<br />
Else<br />
Me![MASTER MODEL].Enabled = False<br />
Me![MASTER CAGE].Enabled = False<br />
Me![MASTER SERIAL NUMBER].Enabled = False<br />
End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>As soon as I click the check box all of the fields that are supposed to be blocked are now enabled. I only want the field in the record selected to be enabled if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>There actually is only <strong>one</strong> Master Model control on the form, and only<strong>one</strong> Master Cage, and so on - each displayed many times. So changing the control's property changes all of the instances of the control!</p>
<div>The solution is to not use any VBA code <em>at all; </em>instead, open the form in design view, select the MASTER MODEL, MASTER CAGE and MASTER SERIAL NUMBER controls, and use the Conditional Formatting menu option (in 2003) or ribbon tool (in 2007) to
 make the control enabled or not based on the value of the PO control.</div>

<p>It sounds like your form is in continuous view.&nbsp; If so, that is the normal behavior when you use VBA code to set properties for an unbound control.&nbsp; There is&nbsp;only one control with one set of properties so a;; copies of the code appear the same.</p>
<p>The only way I know of to get the effect you want on a continuous form is to remove that code and use Conditional Formatting (Format menu).&nbsp; Use the Expression Is&nbsp; option on the three controls with&nbsp;the expression:&nbsp;&nbsp; [PO] = False&nbsp; with the Enabled property
 set to off.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a Nokia 3110 classic which has started not chargeing. Is it possible to charge it through the PC usb port please?</p>
<p>If I can it will eliminate wether it is the battery or the charger itself.</p>

<p>Your phone model did not support USB charging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to charge it via an USB port, you have to go for the Nokia CA-100. That is a charger actually. Because it could be the charger (Nokia AC-15), the battery (Nokia BL-5C), or even the phone itself – looking at the second-hand-market price of a Nokia
 3110 classic – did you consider to go for a new phone like the <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=1862&amp;idPhone2=5323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia 301</a>?</p>

            Thank you. I have had the phone for some years. It will not charge &amp; my Son suggested that I try and charge via USB. Trying to asatain whether it is the charger, battery or phone at fault. Had a look at new phones online but it is such a minefield! All
 I want is a easy to use phone with camera. The service in our house &amp; others in the road is poor so did wonder if a 3g may be better, not that I know what that is! Thanks for your help.

<p>3G is another network standard, using different frequencies and sometimes different cell towers. Therefore, the reception could be better if that&nbsp;tower gives better reception. Please, ask somebody&nbsp;among your&nbsp;acquaintances, when they visit your home, to show
 the reception bar of their phones to you – it is indicated as 3G normally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;Nokia 301 adds this 3G and chooses it automatically. Furthermore, a&nbsp;Nokia 301 uses the same operating system as your Nokia 3110 classic, just another version – therefore, its&nbsp;usage should be rather similar.&nbsp;But that is not easy to use, like your Nokia
 3110 classic was not easy to use. If you look for ease of use, please do me a favour and consider an Apple iPhone 4S. That is on sale in many countries right now. No Internet required if you do not like that. Its display is so crisp, you going to love it for
 dialling your contacts, reading your SMS, and showing pictures to your&nbsp;acquaintances.</p>

<p>If you provide your price range, we can provide&nbsp;better hints. However here in Germany, the Apple iPhone 4s is at 280€. If you are able to afford such a sum, I recommend to go for it because&nbsp;a&nbsp;mobile phone is the electronic device you carry with you all day
 long – and paying less money means paying more (time) easily.</p>

<p>As his previous phone was Nokia 3110 Classic, I believe that for him Nokia 301 you suggested before would be way simpler than an iPhone. If my father asked me for a phone easy to use, and if his previous phone was Nokia that sillysmillie has, I would suggest
 him a phone like Nokia 301. For someone that OS might be harder to use than iOS, but he is used to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, he said that he wants a phone easy to use,&nbsp;a one that has a camera, and, I guess, a one that could access internet. That's it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and sorry for jumping in like this, I just saw "Nokia 3100 Classic", and I got interested. :D</p>

<p>No problem, your are welcome! Normally, that what you are used to, is easier to use, yes. One of the reasons, I love to recommend the same operating system as used before or as used among the&nbsp;acquaintances. However here in this case, much has changed between
 the Nokia 3110 classic and a Nokia 301. Too much from my perspective. If you are interested in examples, I love to list some. Therefore we have a change which I value high enough for a real change – and better yet&nbsp;then too late.</p>

<p>I agree that much had changed, but structure of the menu and many other things are still pretty similar - if he wants to find some specific settings for the phone, it is somewhat likely that he will be able to find that on similar place where it was on his
 older phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I understood you correctly, but if I did - you are right. One way or another, he is getting different operative system with that new phone, and he will have to adopt to it. Therefore, it is indeed better to get a better phone at this moment
 - if he is able to. Asha phones for expample are having less options than Windows, Androd, or Apple phones, and it is very likely that at some moment he will get that feeling "damn, this phone can't do that". So, for that reason, it is better to give some
 more money for a phone that will have more of those options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, it does depend a lot of the customer - if he knows he will not miss those additional functions, he will not make a mistake by choosing a phone such this Nokia you suggested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hm, and yes, I see you suggest iPhone now and then, but if one wants to have a smartphone, he can choose a Lumia as well. I have seen they are also good, and they are not expensive either. There are many Lumia's which are cheaper than the iPhone you suggested
 as well, and with this phone one is able to see if he has a new email on his start screen, and many other&nbsp; useful&nbsp; stuff. Who knows, I may be one-sided on this matter as an old Nokia fan, but they seem to do all that important stuff.</p>

            Nokia Lumia 530? Sorry if that is a dumb question though.<br />
I haven't used that phone, but I believe you didn't make a wrong decision. That seems like a phone I plan to get for myself as well too.<br />
I mean, Nokia 301 is a good phone, but it's basic. Many might say "why do I need a smartphone, I only need a phone", but it is quite handy when one needs to read something - from a pdf document, or on internet, etc...

    <title>Ribbon is gone and options are greyed out in embedded Excel sheet in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ribbon is gone and options are greyed out in embedded Excel sheet in Word</h2>
                    I've got an embedded Excel sheet in a Word document. When I double-click on it the ribbon disappears and the right-click options are all greyed out. What
<span style="font-style: italic">should happen</span> is the Excel ribbon comes up and I can edit the spread sheet using Excel tools, click off and be back in Word.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure this is caused by some stupid key stroke as I was trying to undo a number of things and punched my keyboard in frustration at how slow the company computer is in my office...

<h2>            Fresh Win10 Install from Media Creation Tool, but can&#39;t update past TH2.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a SP3 and just reinstalled W10 today from USB. No problems with hardware or software, Internet is running fine, the computer's time &amp; date are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, checking Winver, I'm still on Version 1511 (OS Build 10586.122).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked Insider Hub App &amp; it knows I'm an Insider, Fast Builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked update history &amp; all are successful with latest being: </p>
<p>KB3001652 (installed 3/6/2016)</p>
<p>System Hardware Update - 1/19/2016&nbsp; (installed 3/6/2016)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this is a fresh reinstall I performed today. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I can't figure out why I can't update to any of the Redstone updates!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Send&#47;Receive Progress Dialog Box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> weaver15ca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Send&#47;Receive Progress  Dialog Box</h2>
                    <p>(PC..Windows7..Office 2013)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my Receive Mail set to every 10 minutes. Up until a few days ago, i was able to click Send/Receive in the ribbon and get an immediate delivery at any time. Now when i click Send/Receive, a progress dialog box appears but it disappears in a second.
 It took a few clicks and lots of concentration but I was able to see that the green bar is in constant motion, and there are two things in the list...one says Completed, the other says Processing. &nbsp;It looks like something sent to me is hung up and can't be
 delivered. But i have no way to Cancel Task because it doesn't stay on long enough to do it.</p>
<p>How can i empty the contents. For some reason, it doesn't seem to be stopping other mail from being sent immediately or received according to the time setting &nbsp;but nothing happens if i click the button (or F9).... just the progress box popping up and leaving
 immediately.</p>
<p>I would truly appreciate any help you can give me. Thanks.</p>

<h3> billtuttle  say:</h3>
<h2>            My outlook.com account has disappeared</h2>
                    <p>From reading other posts, it is clear this is not an&nbsp;isolated occurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, I&nbsp;received the following messgage:&nbsp; <strong>That Microsoft account doesn't exist. Enter a different email address or get a new account.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background: I have had an MSN account since before the millenium. I created a new outlook account when outlook.com was announced. I linked my old account to this new account. I have been using this new account for months&nbsp;to receive emails from both the old
 account and the new account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>YES: I did try to reset the password after the first message and recevied the following message:&nbsp;
<strong>The Microsoft account is incorrect. Please try again.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NO: I did not rename the account. I did absolutely nothing have to do with the account except use it to read and send email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NO: The account has not been inactive. I have been using this email account everyday since creating it months ago. Tuesday 12/11/12 everything was working fine. Out of the blue on Wednesday 12/12/12 the account disappeared. Must be some nurmerology god.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bill</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. It is incoherent to require someone who no longer can signin to their account to "signin" in order to tell you he can no longer signin.</p>

<h2>            Use of Microsoft Fill Effects&#47; texture for commercial Use.</h2>
                    <p>I am designing a cover for a book I am writing, and plan to sell. The only background I have found, which I cannot find anywhere else, is the one in Word 2007, under Fill Effects, Texture, Woven Mat. I just need to know if I can use that pattern for commercial
 use; since I am selling the book; and if I need to get permission to use it. And if so, who do I contact? I have not found any helpful information anywhere, except for some concerning clip art.</p>
<p>

    <title>I am currently being hacked via remote... and who knows what else - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I am currently being hacked via remote... and who knows what else</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys I installed windows 10 through bootcamp coming from a mid 2014 retina MacBook pro. Here is the evidence I have that I can think of off the top of my head and I'm sure you guys will find it fishy as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For context: I am pretty sure my neighbors are behind this so they probably have access to my wifi and any other shenanigans you guys might know about</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The trusted principal was someone named "trustedinstaller" and there was another user account called defaultuser0? or something like that</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I used the local security policy app to make sure only my account had access to and could do stuff to my computer because there was another user that I never created and as I was 20 minutes into making sure only I could control this computer my internet
 mysteriously stopped working saying that&nbsp;my settings were fine but&nbsp;there was a DHCP error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Even&nbsp;though I turned off remote computer and&nbsp;shared folder when I went to my firewall settings and clicked add an app&nbsp;exception area all the remote access and remote buttons were checked like proximity sharing. Also in my firewall rules all the rules
 were set to let all the remote type of stuff to go right on through.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. Freaking out I went back to my mac partition and found that all my remote settings on that drive too were enabled and actually I went through a tug of war of constantly unlocking my computer so I could make changes to it, only to find that 30 seconds
 later whoever is remotely screwing with me would change the setting back to their preference.&nbsp;For example, I would shut off guest accounts and turn off sharing and remote access, click the lock and then move on. 1 minute later I go back to my preferences and
 guest accounts are turned back on, sharing and remote access has been granted to an "unknown user" and there was also a slight flicker in my screen. Does this mean they were also doing screensharing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Oh yea I understand that this is a windows 10 forum, so you guys can ignore the mac related info if you'd like, I put it there to let you guys know someone is really screwing around with my comp and that none of this is just explained away by normal system
 processes. I didn't know this could be done but I think they also did something to my iphone6 plus. Today while I was driving it tried to join a wifi that I had never seen before or heard of.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I think of more details&nbsp;I will post. Thanks&nbsp;everyone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>What is not normal is I started taunting them by renaming the computer, you guys having fun, hey hows it going, made my account name BiGBait meaning big masterbaiter and as I was doing that all the windows that pertained to that suddenly closed. The only
 way they could do that was through remote stuff right? And another fishy thing just happened right now. I am typing this not on my home wifi but through my own personal hotspot in front of a starbucks in a parking lot and as the computer loaded I got an error
 message saying mme.exe.remote something failed and also surrogate com failed.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>As far as settings reverting it could just be Windows 10. I remember earlier builds had certain network&nbsp;settings defaulted and attempts to change them would either fail or be almost immediately reversed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can manage it perhaps you should take some screenshots (Windows key + Print Screen key)&nbsp;of various errors you've encountered and post them here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you don't mind losing any installed Windows Programs, you can "refresh" your PC from settings, which resets most of Windows to it's default, clean-install state, but retains personalizations (Wallpaper, Sounds, etc.) and your personal files. This
 will remove any rogue software and/or changes. You can also run a full Windows Defender scan,&nbsp;and if it makes you feel better, an&nbsp;"In Place Upgrade" (insert the Windows 10 drive you used to install it and run the upgrade process from the desktop.), which will
 fix any issues with Windows components not related to the preview and restore appropriate security policies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabling all remote access and RDP&nbsp;services from MMC (run&nbsp;"<strong>services.msc</strong>") effectively removing remote functionality from your PC and cutting perpetrators off from the pass (unless they rely on third party remote software, in which case
 this does nothing)</li><li>Reinstalling Windows entirely</li><li>Disabling the network adapter (preventing outside access) and changing firewall&nbsp;settings, services,&nbsp;and your security policy to the appropriate values (DO NOT REMOVE TRUSTEDINSTALLER)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As far as those users, that's normal. TrustedInstaller is a system account used for software installation and for protecting critical system files (hence the name). DefaultUser# is the default user account; It's what windows uses as a template for all new
 accounts. And Unknown, afaik, is due to lingering security information from no-longer existent accounts and also from accounts from "other" machines (for instance, old Windows installations or files from another PC on a flash drive or partition).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, if the screen dims momentarily, that means a screenshot is taken (via the aforementioned method) and has been stored in Pictures/Photos under the "Screenshots" folder.</p>

<h2>            Word 2013 won&#39;t save my paragraph formatting changes to the default template</h2>
                    When I open a blank document and start typing, the default formatting is applied.&nbsp; When I go to change this (eg paragraph and line spacing), then set that as default, it doesn't apply the next time I create a new document.&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp;

            Something is preventing changes from being saved to the Normal template. That something must be troubleshot separately.<br />
<br />
As a workaround, you can open the Normal template as a file and change the defaults directly for the file. Here's an efficient way: From within Word, press Alt+F11 to display the Visual Basic Editor. Press Ctrl+G to activate the Immediate window. Type<br />
<br />
NormalTemplate.OpenAsDocument<br />
<br />
and press Enter. The Normal template opens in a separate window (and you should now close the Visual Basic Editor). Change the defaults using the same steps as you did previously. Save and close the template. Restart Word.<br />

            Same here. The last email i received was on the 6. For the last 2 days and half nothing came through. Strangely I can send email. I have lots of free space on my account, i did change my password as well just in case. i have been sending to myself mails
 from different account and provider to test. Nothing came through. As i use it for work i usually receive 15 mails a day. Hope it can be solved fast....

            <p>Hi there,&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/33f7a80c-0f15-4ada-9b57-c3524a3db10e" title="danbailey1913">danbailey1913</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5f77ce04-117f-4f1c-a36e-b75f9264291f" title="ChrisL.C">ChrisL.C</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>I'm Wayne from Microsoft Support and I'll be assisting you on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that both of you cannot seem to receive emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, it is always best for users with receiving issues that they try to send a test email to their affected account. Please try sending a test email and let us know if you receive it or if you receive any error.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>-I would also need you to check your deleted folder see if the emails goes there. If the emails goes there, it's possible that the issue is with your email rules
 or junk mail settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>-It would also be handy if you try searching for expected emails using the search function in Outlook.com located in the upper left of your interface. Go search
 for email subjects, email senders you cannot seem to receive from to check if their emails were sent to a different folder in your mailbox.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>I strongly suggest that you check the following functions in Outlook.com as these might be the possible reasons why you're not receiving in your inbox:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Check your Email Rules</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>1. In your Outlook.com Inbox, click the cog icon beside your Profile name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>2. Click “Manage Rules”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>3. Delete the rules that might be preventing you from receiving your incoming emails.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Check your Junk Mail Settings</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>1. In your Outlook.com Inbox, click the cog icon beside your Profile name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>2. Click "Options".</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>3. Under Preventing junk email, click "Filters and reporting".
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>4. Under Choose a junk e-mail filter, choose the level of protection that you want, and then click "Save". If the Exclusive level was set, messages from senders
 not on your Contacts or Safe senders lists will have been sent to the Junk e-mail folder.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Check your Reply-to address
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>1. In your Outlook.com Inbox, click the cog icon beside your Profile name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>2. Click "Options".</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>3. Under Writing email, click "Reply-to address".</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>2. Select "Your From address" button.
</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>3. Click "Save".</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>If your issue persists, don't&nbsp;</span><span>hesitate to contact us back with the needed information
 so we can help you further in this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Remember that we are always here to help you.</span></p>

            <p>First, are you sure you have Microsoft Picture Manager installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, then you can browse to its location.&nbsp; Right-click on your image file.&nbsp; Select "Open with...", then "Choose default program...".&nbsp; Click on the "Browse..." button.&nbsp; Find the folder where the Picture Manager (or a shortcut) is located.&nbsp;
 Select that and click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, for Office 2010 the Picture Manager is listed in the Start menu:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Microsoft Office\Microsoft Office 2010 Tools/Microsoft Office Picture Manager</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can locate the program, it should be added to the "Open with" list so that you will see it there in the future when you right-click on an image file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
