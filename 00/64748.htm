            Yes, it is for Windows 10 also. But leave this, I have worked out a simple solution for you.
<br />
<br />1. Open your Notepad and save it as email.text
<br />2. Put required e mail in this and save and close it.
<br />3. Open Notepad, save it as email.vbs (for this you will need to choose All files in Notepad)
<br />4. Put following into it and save and close it.
<br />Option Explicit
<br />Dim wshShell
<br />Set wshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
<br />WshShell.Run ("cmd.exe /C clip &lt; email.txt"), 0, true
<br />5. Right click on this file &gt; Create Shortcut
<br />6. Right click on Shortcut &gt; Properties &gt; In the Shortcut key box, press the required shortcut key say CTRL+ALT+M
<br />7. In Windows Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Startup &gt; Right Click &gt; Open
<br />8. Copy the Shortcut of step 6 into this Startup folder
<br />9. Restart your computer.
<br />10. Now whenever you press your shortcut, this will copy this e mail to clipboard
<br />11. You can do CTRL+V then to paste

    <title>Screen Blacks out after login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dlowjw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Blacks out after login</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I bought a custom windows PC using my student Windows 7 64-bit Professional. I have owned it for about 3 months already, mainly using it for gaming and games development on UDK.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I started using it with a Sony TV at first and I had a few display issues with it after about 2 months+ in, my TV couldn't detect a signal input from it. So I did a few resets with the power button and it eventually works, then the problem started to become
 more frequent till eventually the "solution" didn't work anymore, which was a few weeks back. At this point, turning on the PC doesn't even boot at all. I didn't have and extra screen to test and since there was a PC show coming, I waited till today to get
 a new screen since I didn't had an urgent need for it earlier. Currently, on the new screen it actually boots up now, but then after hitting the login screen, type in my password, press enter, the welcome with the ring appears the screen goes back black again
 with no display (not even the mouse).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Solutions I have tried:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) Starting in safe mode</div>
<div>It works, able to login, then an error pops up telling me I have a blue screen (it only popped up the first 2 attempts of the many attempts I had), tried the following ways as well</div>
<div>1.1) Created a new user account</div>
<div>Tried to see if it was a profile corruption, same problem occurred with the new account</div>
<div>1.2) System Restore to earlier date</div>
<div>Problem still persisted</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, I actually managed to boot my main account once today outside safe mode after starting in safe mode and restarting the 1st time, but then the screen conked out within 5 minutes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2) Press F8 before Windows Logo</div>
<div>1.1) Used last known good config</div>
<div>Did not work too</div>
<div>1.2) Used System Repair to go to system recovery options</div>
<div>1.2.1) Used Startup Repair</div>
<div>Windows couldn't find a problem</div>
<div>1.2.2) Used Windows Memory Diagnostic</div>
<div>Did not work as well</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have yet to try using a windows CD to repair it since I returned the disc burned ISO disc to my friend (not using&nbsp;illegal&nbsp;copy, I had a CD Key only since it was a student copy from MSDN), will try it when I get my copy burned again, currently, anyone
 else has any other solutions i can try?</div>

            Hi, I tried method 1, and the temporary solution which was to disable the aero stuff works, after that I did a windows update, then after that I started IE9 to get chrome and update drivers but it black screen'd again upon startup of IE.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I then went to safe mode to download chrome, then I went back out of safe mode and tried launching both IE and Chrome, same thing happened with IE9, but Chrome was perfectly ok. I updated my graphics driver via Nvidia website (using a Nvidia Geforce 560
 Ti) then tried opening IE again, still black screen, also tried turning on Aero again, black screen right after i pressed start.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I already updated in method 1, so method 2 is kinda tried already</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tried method 3, but there were no programs to disable since i just tried reformatting my system partition.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any more&nbsp;solutions?</div>

    <title>What do I do if Windows 10 installer won&#39;t accept my product - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew williams&#8212;iynque  say:</h3>
<h2>            What do I do if Windows 10 installer won&#39;t accept my product key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought Windows 7 (full version) and installed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought Windows 8 (upgrade from Windows 7, and paid for via the upgrade installer) and installed that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since upgraded to Windows 8.1 Pro&nbsp;(and, of course, installed all the weekly software updates along the way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded a Windows 10 ISO and I'm trying to install it. When it asks for my product key, it won't accept either my Windows 7 or Windows 8 product keys. It always tells me, "This product key didn't work. Please check it and try again, or try a different
 key." I am copy-and-pasting directly out of my email receipt, so I know I am not making any typing errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, while the Microsoft Store shows my order history includes Windows 7 and offers downloads for Windows 7, it doesn't seem to have any record of me buying Windows 8. When I try to add a "guest" purchase using the order number and e-mail address,
 it says that it's not a valid order number. I made the purchase through Microsoft's own Windows 8 upgrade installer and Windows currently&nbsp;says it's activated, so I'm fairly certain I wasn't the victim of some scam. Yet, no record on my Microsoft Store account,
 and my key is not accepted by the Windows 10 installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a solution posted on this community and elsewhere about changing registry keys and such. My registry does not include the specified key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do now? How can I get the Windows installer to acknowledge my key?</p>

            I am running Windows 8.1, upgraded from a full clean install of Windows 7. This would be an upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, if it ever works. I downloaded the Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO</a>).
 I burned that ISO to a physical DVD. I run the setup executable from the DVD, and it starts up. It asks for my product key, but it will not accept either my Windows 7 (purchased full version via Microsoft Store online) or Windows 8 (upgrade purchased via Microsoft's
 Windows 8 installer) product keys. Windows 10 is not installed (neither clean nor custom install) because the installer asks for, and will not accept, my product key.

            That's ridiculous. &nbsp;I want to keep my copy of Windows 7 and dual boot until I decide whether or not to keep 10. &nbsp;I'd imagine I could install a second copy of 7 and upgrade that but why on earth should we have to go through all of this work just to clean
 install 10? &nbsp;Does Microsoft not learn from the past?

            <p>Any progress on this? How do I get my Windows product key to work with the Windows 10 installer? I purchased a full version of Windows 7, I used that key successfully when purchasing the upgrade to Windows 8 from Microsoft in the Windows 8 installer, and
 now I can't get the Windows 10 installer to accept either my original Windows 7 key or the Windows 8 key that came with the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect it has something to do with my Windows 8 purchase not showing up alongside my Windows 7 purchase in my order history in the Microsoft Store. I can't seem to add it to my order history as a "guest" purchase either; it won't accept the order number
 in my emailed receipt. Perhaps it is a part of some other database not included somehow? I really don't know.</p>

            I do not have a separate copy of windows 7.&nbsp; It came installed on my computer which has the Microsoft product key sticker on its side.&nbsp; When I enter the product key, windows 10 will not accept it.&nbsp; I did a clean install and don't have the copy of windows

            <p><em>Seriously! I got Windows 7, and windows 8 Pro. You offered an upgrade to W7, and even showed us how to create a Windows 10&nbsp;USB disk to do a clean install, yet, you forgot to mention that the keys for either older version won't work? Are you people for
 real? Windows 8 sucked, and Windows 7 worked fine. If it wasn't for your idiotic advice, I wouldn't be here. I used Windows 8 for all of a few months, so how about I trade its key for a windows 10 one? There's many of us that deserved as much after putting
 out good money for that piece of **** OS! I upgraded my whole computer after your suck-**** advice, in the hopes of a much speedier system, and yet now, I'm spending time on google, and the forums trying to figure out what, if I was, doing wrong. You'd better
 be fixing this soon! Lawsuit anyone?</em></p>

            <p>Sorry for not understanding, but what do you mean? Do I have to uninstall my Windows 7 and reinstall? What is the point of that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to put in my Product Key which I know is correct, but it won't let me. Keeps telling me the same as this fella. I had no problems doing the upgrade using a USB on my son's laptop which runs Windows 8</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating as I have multiple computers to upgrade -- I run a small business and this is taking FOREVER!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post some step by step instructions preferably with a 8 year old in mind as the reader -- not all of us are computer savvy and you sell to nearly everyone on the planet!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now I am being told I have to uninstall 10, find a disk from someone, reinstall 7, upgrade to SP1 then reinstall 10?&nbsp; What is going on here?&nbsp; Please let me know when Microsoft gets a work around up and running, as this is majorly inconvenient.</p>

            Hi Quin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click the HDD in Device Manager to Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall Driver.
<br />
<br />Then open Disk Management, scroll down to find the drive on the map, right click to Initialize and format:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/248980/how-to-partition-and-format-your-hard-drive-in-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/248980/how-to-p...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure to issue a Drive letter so it shows up.  
<br />
<br />If these fail test the hard drive to see if it passes diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>
<br />
<br />If not return to store.  You can also contact the manufacturer's Support to help test and RMA it if necessary.  There may be known issues.  We do see bad new SSD's and HDD's. 
<br />
<br />To Clean Install Windows on the HDD  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Does "etc." include using&nbsp; Win+Ctrl+Shift+B&nbsp; (more than once and with psychic pauses between the retries)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another "etc." should be trying to switch to Second Screen Only (Win+P End Enter).&nbsp; But to do that you need to have Narrator running so you can keep working even if you can't see something.&nbsp; For example, you would have to "see" the Keep this? prompt and
 be quick enough to press Tab Enter before it went back to PC Screen Only.&nbsp; Then you could try another Win+Ctrl+Shift+B.&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can confirm that the latest updates seem to have made it necessary to reinstall the drivers.&nbsp; That could be a challenge doing that just using Narrator.&nbsp; Fortunately in my case I can switch to my MWDA with Win+K Tab Enter and then see what I'm
 doing.</p>

</p>
<p>While I was using my surface pro 4, I was "surfing" the web on Microsoft Edge. I&nbsp; suddenly got this pop up that yelled "You have a malware!" I was confused. I didn't visit any websites I was just searching up "cute cat pictures". It asked me for my Microsoft
 Account password and My PC password and Username for the administrator. It also said if I do not give this information in the past 5 minutes. My pc will get "hacked" and they would shut it down to "protect their servers." I was really confused when I saw this.
 I ignored it the first time it came up. But then it came up again, and again. So then I decided I shouldn't trust it. And I reset my computer's data/memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done it before, A day ago. and I encountered the same problem. I suddenly couldn't open anything. I couldn't open settings, Cortana, etc.. The first time I encountered this problem I downloaded something that someone posted. But I do not recall what
 it was. It fixed the problem. And so I looked for it, and sadly couldn't find it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can someone Help me solve this issue?</p>

            Its unbelievable how many issues are in this release. Lets count them together:
<br />
<br />- Reboot loop on upgrade
<br />- Blank empty desktop after upgrading with error message - c:\Windows\system32\systemprofile\desktop is unavailable
<br />- Recovery partition low space showing up in Computer environment
<br />- Store app not downloading, requiring sign out and sign in
<br />- Corrupt installation - can't rollback or reset, requiring creation of bootable media on a working computer to initiate a custom install.
<br />- High CPU and Disk Usage
<br />- Settings app broken
<br />- Password not working on sign in
<br />- Requirement to make a PIN during OOBE with no opt out
<br />- Unable to remove languages after upgrade
<br />
<br />If you don't want to downgrade to Windows 10 1703, at least consider rolling back to Windows 10 1709.
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer..
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

<h2>            Cannot Change Display&#47;System Language in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you are doing well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Windows 10 for a while now, but yesterday a new update was installed and everything went wrong from there. First, my laptop's language reverted back to Danish (I had bought the laptop there but don't speak any Danish) and I cannot change
 it back. I keep asking it to Copy Settings to users but as soon as I change it, I check again and it's back to Danish. Second, my start-up used to be around 30 seconds and now it's around 2 minutes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate your help regarding this matter; especially the language issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance and have a great day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ahmad</p>

    <title>10Gbit Network Connection under Windows 10 1703 not properly working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> otto-peter  say:</h3>
<h2>            10Gbit Network Connection under Windows 10 1703 not properly working</h2>
                    <p>I'm having 4 different Workstations (also different configurations), each completely new installed Win 10 Pro 1703 with intel&nbsp;Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X550-T2 or&nbsp;Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540-T1(both are 10Gbit network Controllers).
 Since Windows 10 1703 network is not properly working(JUST WHEN 10GBIT CONTROLLERS ARE INSIDE), sometimes the network connection is disconnected (gets connected again after a couple of seconds), sometimes i get weird event-log (acpi errors, BROWSER warnings
 and so on). As soon as i remove those cards EVERYTHINGS WORKS - NO EVENT LOG ERRORS ALSO (ALL ERRORS GONE)!!! All drivers up to date, no additional programs installed, just plain windows with drivers. Intel hotline told me, it's a well known microsoft issue.
 Last but not least - when i install the last Windows 10 build before the creators update (build 1607) - EVERYTHING WORKS WITHOUT ERRORS ON ALL WORKSTATIONS - so it is 100% a WINDOWS 10 1703 problem!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help???</p>

<p>I wanted to give you an update on my investigation.&nbsp; To give you some context, I am in the Windows Networking Engineering team.&nbsp; We don't know of any bug linked to these LAN adapters.&nbsp; That doesn't mean there isn't one, but we don't know of one.&nbsp; You indicated
 that you spoke with Intel and Microsoft support and they said there was a bug.&nbsp; But I couldn't find one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get a similar LAN adapter, the&nbsp;Intel Ethernet Converged Network Adapter X540-T2.&nbsp; It uses the same driver as what you are using.&nbsp; I was unable to reproduce the issue on that.&nbsp; I am still working on getting the exact model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through a private thread you gave us some networking logs.&nbsp; Those logs clearly show the behavior you are describing.&nbsp; It shows that the Intel driver is reporting to the operating system the media is connecting and disconnecting in a loop.&nbsp; The logic for
 why this is happening is located within the Intel driver which we don't have access to.&nbsp; However we do work closely with Intel Engineers for these sorts of issues.&nbsp; They are currently investigating the logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is entirely possible this is still a Windows bug.&nbsp; That makes sense because you reported it worked before the update and failed after.&nbsp; Also this LAN adapter is used primarily in Servers.&nbsp; The Server edition of Windows did not receive a creators update.&nbsp;
 So if a regression is in Windows it wouldn't really be reported.&nbsp; I suspect the bug is the driver not liking some change we made to PCI or power management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I hear back from Intel I will let you know where things are at.&nbsp; As always we appreciate you reaching out and reporting issues.</p>

            On the Fujitsu Servers - same story!! Meanwhile i did the windows update on one workstation from 1607 to 1703 - in the first days i had about 10 disconnection/connection spread over a day. Now after a couple of days, the problem goes worse, now every 2-15min
 loss of connection.... no more calls/mails from ms/intel - still lost:-(

<p>Hope you remmeber my problem with the 10gbit network cards allways connect/disconnecting. I investigated the problem further and find out it is defenitely a microsoft problem. i bought 3 more networkcards, all 10 gbit/rj45 (1 asus,1 startech, 1 qnap) - all
 with different network chips (no INTEL, to be able addressing the problem closer). And on all network cards i'm getting the same problem - 10gbit network is connected and randomly it disconnects - then it reconnects immediately and after a while(range between
 some minutes to several hours) it starts again to disconnecting and so on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I testet now 5 different 10 Gbit adaptors (intel x510. intel x550 and the three from above - all rj45 connected, with and without 2 different 10 gbit switches on 7!!!! different machines/all win10 pro 10 1703) allways the same result - not proper working!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before win 10 build 1703 it worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please conntact me for further assistence/investigation - the problem is really annoying..</p>

            Hi drpaulmarsh,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Asnwers forum,<br />
<br />
It is possible that your CD/DVD drive have a corrupted driver or it has went bad.&nbsp; If you can, go to Control Panel &gt;System &gt; Device Manager and locate the CD/DVD drive in the list.&nbsp; Remove it from the list and reboot your computer.&nbsp; Windows will auto detect
 it and reinstall a new driver.&nbsp; <br />
Also check Windows Update for any new driver available.<br />
<br />
Test your DVD and let us know if it works,

                    I have Windows 7 x64. From automatic updates downloaded and started to installed SP1. Was told needed to reboot to finish installing, so I did. At restart I get this ""Fatal error C0190003 applying update operation 8385 of 117203 (amd64...)"". At each
 restart the Fatal error changes where it fails, at a different applying update operation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Have tried several things. 1) When tried to restore to an earlier point, it says there is no restoration points. 2) When I tried to start to last known good configuration, I get the same "Fatal error". 3) When I try to boot to any safe mode, system never starts,
 it is locked in the loading mode. 4) Tried to run repair but it says unable to repair.<br />
<br />
Of what I have read there is a problem when you have any extra languages packs installed and try to install SP1. Of course I have Hebrew added as an additional language pack.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to cancel the SP1 installation?<br />
<br />
Thank you for all the help in advance and have a good day.<br />

            I did go the the Recovery Console and tried Startup Repair, which was my fourth option, and it said it was unable to repair. I did allow it to send the information to Microsoft, so I hope it will help me or someone in the future.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice. Any other suggestions? Hope you are smiling.<br />

<h2>            Bing &#34;image search&#34; not displaying</h2>
                    Using Firefox/Waterfox - After selecting Images and typing in the request, I click the search and nothing show up in "Bing Images."&nbsp; The Size, Color, etc. appear, the blue hyper-linked search suggestions appear BUT... no images at all.&nbsp; Also, the size,
 color, etc. dropdowns don't work, can't select them or use them.&nbsp; The hyperlink suggestions work to new search results, but still no images.&nbsp; Best thing about Firefox/Waterfox is that my bookmarks, history, password, everything, is synchronized between three
 different computers and I don't have to do anything.&nbsp; I just wish IE had that ability.

            Mozilla confirms it's not an issue with the browser settings, as I have just went through a remote assistance session with a tech. So is there a chance that a useful solution will be offered here ?<br />

    <title>How do I change spacing between icons on the taskbar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jfe  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change spacing between icons on the taskbar&#63;</h2>
                    I have a small screen laptop.&nbsp; Because I want a decent number of programs on my taskbar for easy access, I chose small icons and no names, etc.&nbsp; Even so, the small program icons (when not in use) are spaced so far apart that there is little room to spare.&nbsp;
 New open programs quickly cause grouping and are hard to manage.<br />
<br />
Why does Microsoft put so much blank space between the unopened small icons?&nbsp; It's wasted space.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
More importantly, how do I shrink the space in between the icons?&nbsp; On Vista and XP you could slide the icons together to manage your space.&nbsp; How do I do this with Windows 7?<br />
<br />
Thank you!

            <p>Right after I posted that the space is really necessary I found the answer that the original question asked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can change the space between the icons (really the button size) by changing the "Caption Buttons" size in Window Color and Appearance. The default in my version of Windows (2008 R2) was 18. When I adjust it down the button size for the pinned icons get
 smaller and thus the icons get closer together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure if the path is the same in Win7 but in 2008 R2 you right-click on the desktop and select Personalize. Then click on the Window Color button (at the bottom of the window). The dialog that comes up should be titled "Window Color and Appearance".
 In the Item drop-down, select Caption Buttons and adjust the Size to change the distance between icons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have only tried a couple of sizes so too much adjustment may cause issues. Once you apply you may need to right click on the desktop and do a Refresh or even logoff and back on.</p>

            To clarify, the spacing between Pinned icons in Windows 7 is NOT the same as the spacing between the Quick Launch icons in Windows XP. In Windows XP, you are using a TOOLBAR to put icons in. &nbsp;The new "pin to taskbar" function of Windows 7 is NOT the same
 thing.
<div><br />
<div>So if you want the icons and spacing the same as Windows XP, you have to CREATE a new toolbar in Windows 7 and call it Quick Launch or whatever you want to call it (Windows XP already has this created for you, get it?)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Follow these directions to create the toolbar and youre set:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the taskbar, and select Toolbars|New Toolbar</li><li>In the Folder field, select a folder for the toolbar or simply paste ‘%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch’ if you want the standard items.</li><li>Make sure you toolbar is unlocked, right-click on the new toolbar, and uncheck Show Title and Show text.</li><li>Look to the left of your pinned icons and grab the dotted divider and drag to the right, past your new quick launch toolbar and drop.</li><li>Now grab the same divider and drag to the left.</li><li>Right-click on any shortcuts in the original toolbar, the one where the shortcuts are pinned to, and select Unpin from Taskbar.</li></ul>

    <title>Xbox Controller layout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tallteaser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Controller layout</h2>
                    
<p>Can anyone clarify something about Xbox controllers for me? Mainly regarding the position of the left analogue stick and the D-Pad.</p>

<p>I've been a PS Gamers for the last 15 years and never even touched an Xbox. Now, i'm wanting to defect and buy the Xbox One (been sitting in my shopping basket for 2 weeks) but the main thing stopping me is the controller.</p>

<p>10 years ago i suffered an injury, which meant i no longer had right-hand use for, so adapted to use it 1 handed and have done for the last 10 years.</p>

<p>Luckily on the Playstation controller, the left analogue stick was in the perfect position for my adapted use and the D-Pad was used on the rare occassion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My main fear and worry thats stopping me buying the Xbox One is that is the switched positions on the Xbox controller in relation to the PS controller.</p>

<p>Through anyone's experience with Xbox, can you tell me does the D-Pad have a function or is it a alternative for the left analogue stick functions? Have there been any 3rd Party Manufacturers that have released a 'playstation layout' Xbox controller in the
 past or is there a chance for the future?</p>

<p>The resulting conditions of my injury prevents me from going into a shop and testing the controllers for myself, my life is very limit now of what i can do. I really wish I don't have to spend £600+ on an Xbox One and games then find out i can never play
 the games.</p>

<p>Can anyone please help or give any advice?</p>

<p>Your medical condition is unique to yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of us, however well meaning, can actually confirm if the XBox ONE controller will work for you or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best thing to do is go into your local GAME and ask to give a couple of games a spin on the ONE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your reason for doing so is entirely reasonable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any new system and layout will take some getting used to but you ought to be able to get a bit of an idea by trying one out for yourself.</p>

<p>i appreciate that its unique, you could put you right hand behind your back and see what you can do lol but might take you a few years to adapt to it like i did.</p>
<p>trouble is i cant try one as i'm permanently housebound, so would have to buy one, get it delivered, test it , then cant send it back cos its been used.</p>
<p>all i need to know is ... as a 'normal' 2-handed gamer, Xbox One or 360, does the left stick have to be used for all games or can the D-Pad be used instead, or does the D-Pad used in addition with the Left Stick?
</p>
<p>then i can imagine how to use it one-handed.</p>

<p>Previous gen xbox controllers are very chunky so I think you'd have a hard time with it. There are devices out there that let you play xbox games with a ps3 controller and vice versa. Whether they work with the next gen consoles I have no idea. Only reason
 I know this is because I was thinking of getting one for my 360. I have very slender girly hands you see.</p>

<p>i've got big hands and long fingers so i was lucky i could use the left thumb on the left stick and the other 4 fingers doing the rest, on the Ps3 controller. with the position of the left stick on the xbox controller, i cant do that way.</p>

<p>The Xbox layout controller (thanks Sega Saturn!) is set for how hands should naturally hold a controller and really that old PlayStation layout is outdated although I'll give them credit that PS4's controller is surprisingly comfortable.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I've never had any problems with Xbox/Sega/Nintendo layout controllers, if anything it's just the D-PAD that was messy but that was hardly used anyway for the Xbox because Sega &amp; Nintendo always had it right.</p>

<p>The left stick and D pad are used extensively for different functions in most games. &nbsp;you would need use of both. &nbsp; Hope you find a solution!

here</a> its about Ben Heck who has created a xbox one controller for right handed gamers only and he has donated it to a charity called Able Gamers Foundation. I don't know if you could maybe contact him or the charity direct to see if they could provide you
 with a left handed controller. Good luck with it!! :)</p>

<p>Earlier today I was playing DBZ Tenkaichi 3 (PS2 game) on my PS3 60GB and I've gotta say that the controller isn't actually that bad but in comparison to an Xbox/Sega/Nintendo it is inferior.</p>

<p>Anyway, if the DualShock is up your alley then try to find a third party adapter to use it.</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone,</p><p><br /></p><p>I am trying to buy some DLC (Danny Way's Hawaiian dream)&nbsp;for the game skate 3 but can't.&nbsp; Every time I go to buy the DLC&nbsp;it tells me to add a payment method (which I already have added my to Xbox) so I go to add it but it can only add american stuff ex: billing info, card # etc. I also can't buy it from the microsoft website. i know its possible because canadian gamer VanossGaming has bought the DLC i want.&nbsp;It says my account is unable to make this type of purchase. Does anyone know how to fix this or at least know whats going on.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have the Xbox 360 disc and I use it in my Xbox one s.</p><p><br /></p><p>-Mac</p><p><br /></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to d<span>ownload the latest sound&nbsp;driver from the computer manufacturer's support website for the latest operating system (it may still be Windows 8.1) and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, install the same driver in compatibility mode for previous version of Windows.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a.&nbsp;Right click the driver installation file and select
<strong>Properties</strong> then tap or click the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b.&nbsp;Place a check in the <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for:

    <title>How to input Hong Kong Traditional Chinese on Win 7 English Edition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ramelec  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to input Hong Kong Traditional Chinese on Win 7 English Edition</h2>
                    
<p>I am not able to configure my new computer that is running Win 7 English Edition to allow input on HK traditional chinese.<br />
I am currently using a US keyboard layout.<br />
On most sites, I only can locate Taiwanese traditional chinese input, but not HK (cantonese) traditional chinese.</p>
<p><br />
Can you please help?</p>

<p><span>Hi Ramelec,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we troubleshoot the issue I need more information about the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 exactly happens when you try to allow Hong Kong traditional Chinese?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Where
 exactly are you trying to change to allow input on Hong Kong traditional Chinese? Is in on Internet Explorer language settings or in Region and language settings in control panel?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, you may access the link below and follow the steps in the article and check if you can change the input language.</span></p>
