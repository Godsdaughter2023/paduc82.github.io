<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Not sure where you're seeing 38/60 but tenure in general when it comes to Xbox LIVE is the amount of years that you've had a Xbox LIVE Gold membership.<br />
<br />
For example: If you created your account on January 1st 2013 you'd start with a 0 tenure. Now let's say you redeemed a 12 Month Gold membership card on that account on January 2nd 2013, your tenure will change to 1 when January 2nd 2014 rolls around. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>All of my margins have disappeared on most of my documents, they were there originally I just left them as the default setting when I started on them. Then one day I opened a few docs and they were gone. I have gone into page set up and changed them then
 saved them but when I close the doc and open it again any changes I've made have saved except the margins they have completely disappeared&nbsp;again so all of the text is right at the edge of each page, left, right, top and bottom.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I think you need to get off WordPad as using it as a word processor.&nbsp; Microsoft did some updates recently and I think WordPad was on the list for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this, copy your document files to Onedrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the web browser and go to http://www.onedrive.com and you will see your online storage page.&nbsp; Now, double-click on the document file you want to edit and the "Word" web app will load that file for you and you edit/print it from the web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft provided everybody with a Microsoft Account with a "free" Microsoft Office; they mostly don't know that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing to install and take up space on the tablet and it works fairly good.&nbsp; It also has Excel and PowerPoint web apps as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also "print" from the web site as well and it functions almost like a regular Microsoft Word program.&nbsp; It is limited in features but since you use WordPad, what features it has will probably be a plus.</p>

<p>Thanks for reaching out. I'm happy to assist with this question. Windows RT only install apps from the Store, if you can't find the app in the Store, contact the developer and check if they have any plans&nbsp;of having an app that is compatible with the Windows

            <p>Hi DeanLumibao,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manually cleaning out the Temp folder in Window XP is often a necessary maintenance step when the Windows XP Disk Cleanup utility fails to clean out the Temp folder automatically.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removing temporary files is a quick and easy task that can help save disk space and keep your PC clean of file clutter. Just follow the step by step directions below to manually
 clean out the Temp folder: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's how you can clear the temp folder:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Start</b> and then
<b>Run</b>. </p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the text box in the Run window, type
<b>%Temp%</b> and click <b>OK</b>. A folder full of files and other folders will appear.
</p>
<p>All of the folders and files you see in this Temp folder are no longer being used by Windows XP and can safely be deleted.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>To remove individual folders or files, hold down your
<b>Ctrl</b> key while left-clicking on each item you want delete. Release the
<b>Ctrl</b> key when you're finished. </p>
<p>To delete these items, hit your
<b>Delete</b> key or choose <b>File</b> and then <b>Delete</b> from the menu.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Confirm that you want to delete the files by clicking
<b>Yes</b> on the Confirm Multiple File Delete window that opens. 
</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you'd instead like to remove everything inside the Temp folder, choose
<b>Edit</b> and then <b>Select All</b> from the menu. </p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you're prompted that there are hidden files in this folder, just click on OK to bypass the message. A few hidden files hanging
 out in the Temp folder probably aren't important enough to worry about. </p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now that all of the files and folders are selected, hit your
<b>Delete</b> key or choose <b>File</b> and then <b>Delete</b> from the menu.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Confirm that you want to delete the files by clicking
<b>Yes</b> on the Confirm Multiple File Delete window that opens. 
</p>
<p>
<span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>After all of the files have been deleted you can close the window and empty your Recycle Bin, permanently removing the files from your PC.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

            Hey DeanLumibao,
<div><br />
<div>The Temp files are fine to delete. Once you posted the location you were talking about (<span>c:\windows\temp</span>) it all made sense. Here are a few good articles that will show you how to delete these files and more info on what they are:</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>Look those over and see if that does not solve your question. If you run into any issues just come back to this thread and explain what happened.</div>

            Deleting is not my questions and at least literate enough to that, but since i can't find someone that don't understand my point of view then i'll just use googling till it appears on their engine.

            <p>Hi Shahid,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern. In this case, I would suggest you to try the following steps from Powershell and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-register Windows Store by running the following commands in a CMD window started as Administrator:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Type <strong>cmd in </strong>run box, <strong>cmd.exe</strong> will be shown above -
<strong>right click</strong> on cmd.exe and select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>OK</span></strong><span> the UAC prompt if shown. That will open an elevated command prompt. (It will show Administrator in the caption.)
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Then enter the chkdsk command<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted </strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong><strong>$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

            I installed Windows 10 on another lap-top I have and I have no problems purchasing apps using my Microsoft account. I use the same Microsoft account on both lap-top's. With one lap-top I can purchase apps and with the other lap-top I cannot. Both have
 Windows 10 installed. The only thing I have noticed is that the apps on one lap-top are priced in US $ and the other laptop shows the apps price in UK pounds.

<p>got a 4 gig slim with kinect the system keeps beeping randomly at all times even when its turned off.<br />
Its the sound effect the system makes the beep when you turn it on...etc It beeps every few minutes no matter what I'm doing.<br />

<p>Is the system actually turning on and off when the beep noise goes off? Because it might be an issue with the touch sensor. In any case, you'll want to get that repaired.</p>

<p>Either way it's an issue with the sensor, if the XBOX 360 was turning off and then beeping (and not beeping while off) that would mean that the console is overheating but this is just some sort of weird touch sensor malfunction like LostButSeeking said.
 You'll need to contact XBOX Support for your region to setup a repair or you can do it yourself here &gt;
<a href="http://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://myservice.xbox.com</a>. If your XBOX 360 is under warranty it will cost you nothing, if it is not under warranty it will cost $99.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro RDP Multi-Monitor Access</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 Pro computer (Computer 1) running two monitors that operates correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to RDP from a Windows 10 Home laptop computer (Computer 2) into Computer 1 so that I can switch between the two monitors on Computer 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've established the RDP session on Computer 2 with the box "Use all my monitors for the remote session" ticked.&nbsp; I'm not sure how you switch between monitors on Computer 1 but moving the mouse across the screen doesn't switch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either I'm not holding my mouth correctly or this is a limitation imposed because Computer 2 is running Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>Can someone comment before I invest in an upgrade of Computer 2.</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be compatibility and limitation issues. Since you have two different operating system, one is Windows 10 Pro and the other one is Windows 10 Home, they may have different limitations and restrictions when it comes to using it in remote desktop.
 It might also be an issue with monitor spanning. You can check these articles and see if it can help you in resolving the issue:</p>

    <title>Windows Update Causes Startup Repair - which fails - TOUGH QUESTION - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathan sm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Causes Startup Repair - which fails - TOUGH QUESTION</h2>
                    Every time I run Windows Update and install an update, the system restarts and runs&nbsp;startup repair - which always fails.<br />
<br />
This is consistent and repeatable.&nbsp; I spent hours trying to fix this, as repair and system restore do nothing to help.<br />
<br />
I can boot to safe mode.&nbsp; If I disable all my USB controllers and restart, it will boot fine.&nbsp;I can then reenable USB and it works fine.&nbsp; I can reboot my system and use it as normal.&nbsp; There are no problems until another Windows Update comes out.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If I install 1 or 10, the same thing happens: startup repair, which fails.<br />
<br />
For reference, I've done this about 20 times now.&nbsp; I try a different thing every time with individual WIndows Updates (one at a time).&nbsp; I isolated USB by disabling everything I could in device manager and it booted fine.&nbsp; I then enabled one thing at a time,
 did an update and until I enabled USB, windows update worked nicely.<br />
<br />
This is obviously not a hardware problem because I am able to enable all the hardware and use it fine.&nbsp; The only catalyst is Windows Update: software.<br />
<br />
5 stars to the person that can solve this one!!<br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Win 7 BSOD&nbsp; ndis.sys stop error at splash screen.</p>
<p>I have a Win 7 BSOD that says: "driver irql not less or equal" -- it also says the error is with ndis.sys -- address 84B75/b02 base at 84B3F000, datestamp 4a5bbf58.&nbsp; The "stop" info is:<br />
0x000000D1 (0x00000004, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0x84B75B02).</p>
<p>I get to the Windows login screen and immediately go BSOD. I have no floppy drive and no other way to burn a CD and can't figure out how to get into the system to change any drivers. I cannot even boot to safe mode, in any form, from any of 3 drives in my
 system (2 older WinXP drives).</p>
<p>Is there a way to interrupt the startup so I can update or disable the conflicting driver? (the BIOS will not let me disable the NIC - which I am pretty sure is the problem source here)&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi JuanGrande,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to boot to safe mode, you may try to uninstall or disabl</span><span>e
 the network adapter drivers from device manager and check if it helps. While uninstalling the device from the device manager, make sure you follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click on Start.</span></p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Access Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Hardware &gt; Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Open Device Manager and expand Display adaper.</span></p>
<p><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Select the
</span><span>display drivers</span><span> and uninstall the device or disable the device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While uninstalling the device, make sure you place a check mark against "Delete the driver software for this device".
 Later download the latest drives for the network adapter and try to install it. </span>
</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>

<p>You can change the WLID of your Parent Account pretty easily actually. Just follow the steps in our sticky post and let me know if you have any issues.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply, sorry I have taken long to get back to you. Ok, so I went into my child's account, and have got to the point of "Change Windows Live ID". I wasn't too sure whether to proceed - if I put my email address in there as the new WLID, will
 that mean that it becomes the parental control one, or the child's account one? i.e. my child has their own WLID associated with the account, so I would assume that changing it would only change the child-WLID instead of the parental WLID. Man this is really
 difficult to explain! </p>
<p>To possibly make it clearer, my son's father is the current parental control WLID on our son's account. We have split up and he has moved out, so he no longer exists on our console. Would it have to be him that signs in with his gamertag, and then makes
 the change? I don't really want to bother him with all this, so if there is any way to do otherwise I would much appreciate it :)</p>

<p>Oh, you don't want to change the WLID of the parent account, you want to change the parent account altogether. That might be a little more difficult, as you'd have to log into the current parent account and select "Remove From Family". Then the child would
 be free to add to a different parent. Do you have anyway of using that account for a while to do this?</p>

<h2>            Ryse&#58; Random black and white noise screen</h2>
                    
<p>So I purchased the game online and had it installed without any trouble. Played it for a little over a week.&nbsp; While&nbsp;playing, this black and white noise screen appeared&nbsp;that lasted 3 to 5 seconds and return&nbsp;to the&nbsp;game. So far it only happened twice and only
 occurred when playing Ryse. Has anyone encountered this problem? Should I be concern or is there a solutions?</p>

<p>Perhaps I should clarify what I meant. &nbsp;It's actually this black and white static much like this video - [View:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E-MtJBAZvw]. &nbsp;When it happened... I could hear the static noise and the games at the same time. &nbsp;It only happened
 twice that lasted 3 to 5 seconds before returning to normal screen. I hope this isn't serious. &nbsp;Are there solutions to resolve this?

<p>Hey Longster,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having issues with Ryse.<br />
<br />
If this is the only game that is giving you this white noise issue, it sounds like your download might have gotten corrupted. I would recommend trying these steps:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/downloadable-content/uninstall-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall the game</a>
</li><li>Turn off your console by holding the power button for ~5 seconds </li><li>Turn on your console </li><li>Redownload the game </li></ul>
<p><span><br />
<br />
<br />
If you're seeing this happen in multiple games, it's possible that there is an issue with your console and you may want to
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/warranties-and-repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">set up a repair</a>.</span></p>

<p>I have had the same problem. It started occurring last month and is getting worse/more frequent. It happens during COD Ghosts or if I'm even watching a Bluray movie. Sometimes it doesn't go directly to the white noise screen that flashes, but it will just
 quickly flash static. I have checked the video connections and even tried different HDMI cables, and it still occurs. It doesn't matter what game I play whether it's from a disc or downloaded. The system has plenty of ventilation and it can occur shortly after
 the system is turned on. Unfortunately there is nothing online suggesting a fix so I came here to back you up that you're not the only one experiencing this issue.

<p>Hey there canveyman,</p>
<p>This thread is fairly old and the OP hasn't posted back in a while, so I would suggest creating a new thread detailing what you're experiencing and any troubleshooting steps you've already tried. That way we can cater our support specifically to you. Thank
 you!</p>

    <title>Xbox black screen. help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nolq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox black screen. help&#33;</h2>
                    Ok please help me! When I turn my Xbox one on it will pop up the green start screen. Which is good so far because I've been restarting it. When it's done it will pop up "Hi Jacob" just like usual. But, after that it goes straight to a black screen. Like
 I lost connection. But I didn't because if I hold down the Xbox button it will pop up the turn off console and turn off controller option. It will also respond when I say "Xbox" to my Kinect. But, still black screen. I don't know how to fix it and have tried
 everything I know. It'd be great to get this fixed before my night of playing with friends. Thanks.

<p>Try all these and see , if you haven't already...especially the one that boots it up in "low res"...</p>
<p>Confirm that both your TV and Xbox One console are turned on. </p>
<p>•Check that your TV is set to the correct input signal (HDMI). </p>
<p>•Check that the HDMI cable connection to your console is secure. </p>
<p>•Check that the HDMI cable connection to your TV is secure. </p>
<p>•Check that the HDMI cable is connected to the "out to TV" port on the console.
</p>
<p>•Perform a cold boot on your Xbox One console by holding the power button on the front of the console for approximately 10 seconds, and then turn it on again.
</p>
<p>•Reset your display settings. Here's how: 1.If there's a disc in the Xbox One console, eject it.
</p>
<p>2.On the console, press and hold the Xbox button for five seconds to turn off the console.
</p>
<p>3.Press and hold the Xbox button and the Eject button until you hear a beep to turn on the console. You will hear one beep right away and a second beep 10 seconds later. The power light will flash on before the second beep. DO NOT LET GO until the second
 beep occurs. </p>
<p>Note This will boot your console in low resolution mode (640 × 480). To reset this setting, go to Settings in the guide, select Display &amp; sounds, Video options, and then TV Resolution.
</p>
<p>4.If you are required to complete these steps on every boot-up, you will want to change your TV connection to HDMI as shown in step 3 in the next section, "Your screen is blank and you use an AVR in your setup." For more information, see How to adjust the
 display settings on your Xbox One console. </p>
<p>•Try plugging the HDMI cable into a different HDMI port on your TV. </p>
<p>•Try using a different HDMI cable to connect your console to your TV. </p>
<p>•Try connecting your console to a different TV. </p>

<h2>            Contacts do not appear on people app after installing Windows 8.</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am missing some contacts in Windows 8. Most contacts appear in my e-mail app, but none show up in People. Even worse, my groups do not show up so I cannot easily send e-mails to a list.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Vista PC that I upgraded to Win 8 Consumer Preview, but I kept using WLM. Then I uploaded my contacts onto Outlook.com (they are still there along with my groups). I bought a Win 7 PC and used Outlook.com. Then I upgraded to Win 8 this week.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There seems to be a conflict between my Outlook account and my Microsoft account. Brilliantly, I used the same username and password for both.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any thoughts? TIA, Ed</div>

            <div>Thank you for your rapid response. Like many I depend on my e-mail to work.</div>
<div><br />
No changes were made to the computer, aside from upgrading from Win 7 to Win 8. I tried all of the troubleshooting steps and it did not make a difference. When you say to update the settings in the app, to what are you referring?
<div><br />
<div>I am only using contacts from my Outlook.com account. My People page is empty. In Mail, some contacts do not show up when I type their name, but do show up when I type their e-mail address. Those contacts are not searchable from the charms bar. I have
 no access to my e-mail groups (they still show up on Outlook.com).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>

            My individual contacts are now showing up in People. Thanks!
<div><br />
<div>One big problem still remains: &nbsp;I cannot access my e-mail groups either in Mail or in People. They do exist on outlook.com.</div>
<div><br />
<div>One smaller problem still remains: In the e-mail app, some of my contacts cannot be found when I type their name in the "To" or "CC" boxes. They can only be found by typing the beginning of their e-mail address.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On outlook.com, when I click on To, CC, or BCC, my contact list and mail groups appear. Also in People on outlook.com, I click on "All" and it allows me to select from my various groups.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for the help. I really need my e-mail groups to work on Win 8. It is embarrassing to send business e-mails from an anonymous-looking hotmail address.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi, I wonder if you solved the Groups issue. I'm going crazy trying to get them to work on Windows 8 but I've been failing miserably. As you, I can still see them
<span>in</span> outlook.com or even in Outlook 2010 from the Office packages. But did you find a way to show them in the Contacts app or when you write an email from the mail app? THANKS!

<h2>            Coprocessor and Multimedia controller problems &#40;code 28&#41;</h2>
                    Hi all am new to the comunity here and have a very difficult question. Sorry if the grammar is bad I am Dyspraxic.&nbsp; Ok I have read and looked at many posts with problems similar to code 28 and with various problems to do with both the coprocessor and multimedia
 controllers.&nbsp; None of which have managed to solve my problem.<br />
<br />
I got my copy of windows 7 yesterday and installed it without problem. After years of suffering with the woes of vista I thought it was time to change. Ok once loaded up and installed I noticed the little icon saying no speakers detected so I went and made
 sure all the connections were in. No luck. Off for the first of many many visits to the device manager and the little yellow warnings on the Other devices subsection. Both my coprocessor and the Multimedia controller have messages about the drivers not being
 installed or info available on them.&nbsp; I have been to realtek to get new drivers and nothing there seems to work as the messages say they are installed. Off check my sound card and update those on the dev manager. That updated the drivers there no problem adding
 to my confusion.<br />
<br />
I have changed the bios to make sure the onboard is working and changed it. This got rid of the problem of saying the speakers were not plugged but there are still the warning messages about the coprocessor and multimedia controllers not working. I have tryed
 and tryed to get the helped to find drivers and nothing is working. Visits to websites have failed to be productive.&nbsp; I even went as far as removing my creative sb from the pc as some have mentioned. This got rid of the both the co processor and multimedia
 controller altogether from the device manager, Still no sound there as well. I then proceded add back my sb and also back to the device manager and thier associated messages of good will to me and all mankind. Can someone please help me I am very frustrated
 and at a total loss as to what to do despite all the many great posts people have provided on other threads. Have tryed again and still no luck am getting desperate for help.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            Hi <strong>Coyg,</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
We would like to get a little more information from you to help troubleshoot your issue.&nbsp; Please answer the following questions as best you can.<br />

For Code 28 you need to Uninstall and reinstall the driver<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In order to troubleshoot this issue you may goahead and uninstall the drivers manually and then reinstall the drivers and check for the issue.<br />

            Thank you for getting back to me. In answer to your questions in order.<br />
A) The computer maker is evesham<br />
B) I have uninstalled and installed the drivers several times with no effect on my problem<br />
C) I have an amd athelon64 x2 6000 processor<br />
<br />
I have followed through with the advice provided to no effect. It seems to get stuck when I go to device manager and then on the coprocessor and audio controller when I click scan for hardware changes I get the message installing device driver software and
 then shortly followed by a message saying it is unable to install. If i manualy click update driver software I get the message windows was unable to install my coprocessor and with a similar message for the audio controller. I have been to the maker of my
 motherboard asrock and also to realtek to check and try to install anything that might be of help with no success.
<br />
<br />
The audio servies are set to automatic and functioning.

<h2>            Help with my HD smart TV.</h2>
                    So I still have a PlayStation 2 but I'm going to purchase a Xbox 360 (I only have slow cell phone internet) and I use the three prong white, red, yellow cords but I recently bought a HDMI adapter for the PS2 and when I plug it in and turn it on it gets
 darker. It doesn't do that with the three prong. I've turned the brightness all the way up but then it just washes the color out. It also does this with my Blu-ray player too. Anybody know why or how I can fix it?
