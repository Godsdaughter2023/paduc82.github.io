            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions and suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I tried twice to load Windows 10. Once through update and once from a clean installation.</p>
<p>2. I didn't get any error messages except the last one that said Windows 10 had failed to install.</p>
<p>3. I did download the Creation Tool and I did use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since sending my initial request I have decided not to install Windows 10 yet. I will stay with 8.1 for the time being, it works for me and I don't really have anymore time to spend on this new operating system. I have already spent too much time trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for you help. &nbsp;Richard&nbsp;</p>

            <p>yes, I have also scanned them with avg on a different machine and they seem fine. I guess I'm looking for a&nbsp;way to confirm if they are being misidentified by windows defender or if I actually have a virus on my pc that is infecting the files as they are
 downloaded (I assume that is possible)</p>

            <p>Interesting.&nbsp; The first file is immediately detected and deleted&nbsp;while downloading when IE 11 apparently passed it to MSE on Windows 7 for scanning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second file not only downloaded, but I was able to copy/paste the executable within the zip to a folder and scan it successfully with MSE with no malware found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So not sure what's contained in the first file that the definitions don't like, since I'm unable to download it completely.&nbsp; However, either the second file's status has changed or there's some other difference between MSE and Defender on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The technical description does indicate that the detection&nbsp;was automatically analyzed and based on what&nbsp;it does when it gets on a PC.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&lt; EDIT &gt; I wouldn't necessarily consider this mishandling or a false positive, it's more a matter of what exactly the files do that might make them dangerous and whether you wish to accept this risk.&nbsp; Unless you know and trust the developer, provider (download
 site) and understand fully what the purpose of these files might be that could potentially&nbsp;trigger a detection, I'd be wary of using them.</p>

</p><p>Since most legitimate software has vastly different characteristics, comes from known publishers, has high adoption rates, shares much in common with earlier versions of the software, etc... users should be warned when a certain file or application is found

            Yes, that appears to be a better description of their automation than I've seen before.&nbsp; Based on where these files came from, they may be older applications that haven't been very popular recently or they might actually contain either dll or other embedded&nbsp;subroutines
 which are also found in malware.

<p>I don't know&nbsp;why microsoft&nbsp;team didn't create RSS Feed Reader&nbsp;in alternative of Google Reader.. We mostly like the services of Microsoft Like New&nbsp;Outlook &amp; People&nbsp;(in future Calendar &amp;&nbsp;Sky Drive) but moreover, If possible Microsoft can prepare solution for
 RSS Feed&nbsp;Reader so, we can completely move from Google Domain to Microsoft..</p>
<p>Because now,&nbsp;If we move from Microsoft from Google, We&nbsp;have Mail,&nbsp;People&nbsp;(Calendar &amp; Sky Drive in Future).. But still we need to depend on Google for Our Reader &amp; Bookmark...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Hope this may help to the team to explore on this arena..&nbsp;</p>

            Indeed. News feeds is an important feature that should be included in outlook.com .<br />
<br />
Microsoft Office Outlook application features such a function as well as other mail service provider like Google (Google Reader). This is natural as News feeds is a standard way for many users to stay informed without hunting the news. I believe that a next
 logical step for outlook.com is to feature a News reader bringing RSS/Atom to its cloud services eco-system.<br />
<br />
The more Microsoft denies that the longer the users will hang on services like Google's GMail.<br />

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 710 Mac Update</h2>
                    I have a MAC and am trying to update my Nokia Lumia 710. I downloaded Windows 7 Connector like I was told, but once I connected my phone to the computer, it only gives me the option to sync but not to update my phone. Any suggestions?

    <title>Opera mini problem &#40;unable to install&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dar1us  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opera mini problem &#40;unable to install&#41;</h2>
                    Hello guys!<br />
<br />
<br />
I got a problem and it's very frustrating since, I can't install opera mini at all. Because, first my phone tells me: 'Opera M...' already exists. Replace version 4.01(0) with version 4.01(0). Since I don't have opera mini installed, it informs it's installed
 even it isn't. When I try to continue, I get: unable to install<br />
<br />
I went personally to the Nokia store and the sales person gave me an advice like: ''You should uninstall all your apps, hard reset and then update'', also told me that there is some hidden folders, apparrently opera folder or something. I played with X-plore
 and deleted all my folders (memory card &amp; phone memory). Tried again installing opera mini, nothing changed. I did this, but no sign of relief for me. I'm giving up hope, since I dislike the S60 browser...<br />
<br />
<br />
So what's the case here, do I have a virus or something?<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S Has anyone had this problem before?

Not really. Maybe it's a combination of the macro and your file... and Excel...<br />

Add a regular module to your file, copy all code below into that module and save the file. What happens when you run "Splitbook_New"?<br />

<h2>            MSE - Is it any good&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I know this or similar has been asked before, but is MSE on W7 any good as an Anti Virus product nowadays?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm asking this because in the UK, Which ( consumer association ) has recently run a test of Anti Virus products and MSE has not done well. In recent tests its scored in the high 70's and has&nbsp;been recommended as a Best Buy. In this test its dropped to a
 not recommended 48% ( The highest free package scoring 72% ). </p>
<p>
</p><p>The highest score in the test was for a paid AV protection service at&nbsp;83%. They take a lot of things into account in the final score: installation, configuring, actual protection, ease of use, performance impact,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which even say that Defender on W8 and W10 is better and scores 68% and says -
<em>quote</em> "But now Microsoft has begun scaling back investment on it ( MSE ), it scores just 48%".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So can anyone shed any light on this as myself and quite a few others I know use MSE and so far its scored reasonably well in most tests including past Which tests. I know some test sites&nbsp;have always not rated it,&nbsp;but now more and more it seems to be failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft seem to claim its just 'base level protection', whatever that means. But base level protection that low is, I would have thought, no protection at all. Whats the point of protecting a system by less than 50%?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Base level protection that low is likely to do more harm than good. Its likely to make the spread of malware easier and give a false sense of protection. If MS don't want to offer decent free AV protection then they should just quit the market and leave
 it to the companies that do, OR offer a product that's worthy to be installed. Poor virus protection will give a false sense of security, esp to unskilled PC 'Joe Public' users, who will think they have done the right thing by sticking with the in-built MSE
 tool from MS, when it fact more and more it looks like they/we are leaving ourselves at risk by using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, does anyone have any info to defend MSE? </p>
<p>Are these recent tests including the Which test all wrong? </p>
<p>What is the MS base line? ( Is it that they don't protect until the malware is more than three months old?, or they don't detect new stuff until its infected more than 25% of PCs? - what does 'base line' mean? )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any constructive comments welcome, but info actually from MS or the MSE support team would be very nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
Which Antivirus to buy?
</p><div>
<p>I am speaking from a great deal of experience.&nbsp; I support 150 client computers.&nbsp; I have been doing this for 14 years.&nbsp; My clients NEVER have infections.&nbsp; I want to emphasize that the
<em><strong>only products I will use or recommend are strictly an ANTIVIRUS product</strong></em>.&nbsp; Any product that is called complete protection, Internet security or deems itself to be a comprehensive security product is prohibited on my client computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I install only one product in my client’s computers.&nbsp; My support comes as a condition that they use that and only that product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not&nbsp;use any product that claims to make your computer run better.&nbsp; Virtually all of them are either bogus, themselves an infection, or put your computer at risk. Remove everything that claims to be there to prevent infections or claims to make your computer
 run better, with the singular exception of just one antivirus product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a controversial topic, but your choice of AV software may be something you want to take a 2nd look at.&nbsp; I suggest you visit this web site to get a sense of which AV software does the best job, depending on what kind of user you are:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.av-comparatives.org/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a non-profit that has been around for a long time and I trust their results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you interpret these results, keep in mind the difference between a product that detects 95% and another 99% of infections, is actually 5 times more likely to allow an infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until last September, the only AV software I would allow my clients to use was Norton Antivirus.&nbsp; Please note well that that is not the same as any other Norton product such as 360 or Internet Security&nbsp; September 2014,&nbsp;Symantec (owner of Norton) decided
 they would no longer sell an Antivirus-only product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a lot of research, I decided on <em><strong>Bitdefender Antivirus 2015+.&nbsp;</strong>
</em>I have installed it&nbsp;114&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;those PCs and there has never been any kind of a&nbsp;problem or any infections, and this has been over a course of about 15 months now.&nbsp; It is a better product than Norton.&nbsp; It is not expensive. It uses very little of the computer’s
 resources.&nbsp; One of the things I like most about it, is it silence and unobtrusiveness.&nbsp; Especially if you silence its “Wallet” function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My clients know well that if they install any “Internet Security” (IS) product, I will not work on their computers until it is removed.&nbsp; I learned the hard way that the other components in these IS products (other than the AV itself) cause more problems
 than any benefit they bring and mostly work by shutting down the Windows component that does a very good job of that particular task anyway.&nbsp; The problem was that when I started to work on a computer with an IS on it, I could spend hours trying to diagnose
 the problem, only to discover that by removing the IS product, the problems became much clearer and easier to solve.&nbsp; The IS product&nbsp;will actually hide the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, this is a controversial topic and you will find a lot of very strong different opinions.&nbsp; I just know that mine is based on a pretty large sample over a long period, and these are typical home Windows computers.</p>
<p>Note well.&nbsp; You should <strong><em>never have more than one protection software installed</em></strong>.&nbsp; Always ensure that you completely remove any and all protection software packages before installing a new one.&nbsp; That includes software that may have
 come pre-installed on your computer when new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot fully remove most any AV software by simply using the standard Windows 7 uninstall tool.&nbsp; Most of the majors also publish a “removal tool” that gets the rest of it.&nbsp; If you do not completely remove it, it will cause very hard to understand and
 diagnose problems.</p>

            <p>'Canadian Tech', thanks for the comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A version of Bitdefender finished in a highly recommended 2nd place in the review I'm referring to, so definitely one to consider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd seen similar comments when you assisted others, so its all useful info.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center">---</p>
<p>
</p><p>But was I was hoping for is more specific information, hopefully but not necessarily from Microsoft themselves, regarding MSE, like:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Has it 'dropped off' over the last year or&nbsp;so?</p>
<p>* Is it still offering a decent level of overall protection?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>* What is meant by 'base line' protection exactly? ( To me acceptable 'baseline' should mean it protects against all known virus/malware attacks, not allows some 30% of them through. Baseline, to me should mean perhaps&nbsp;the program is&nbsp;missing other extra
 items like O/G and I/C email scan as its sent or received&nbsp;maybe, or lacks certain options like setting up of a programmed auto full scan in idle periods etc )&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's another reasonably recent review from 2015 - <a href="http://www.alphr.com/microsoft/microsoft-security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.alphr.com/microsoft/microsoft-security-essentials</a> - "in our tests Microsoft Security Essentials was still compromised by 32% of threats." and "We wouldn't trust our PCs and our data to Security Essentials - and frankly, neither should you.".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I've read enough to decide to move on, but why would MS really allow this to happen? I mean, what can it do other than p**s people off, and make them choose non-MS products whenever possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on MS please comment. If MSE on W7&nbsp;is now really that bad, don't pretend about this 'baseline' nonsense, just do the decent thing and correct it or withdraw it!&nbsp; A bad Antivirus program is almost as bad as no Antivirus program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One final thought, if someone advertised "Wordpad" as a 'basline' word-processor, how many companies or people at home would accept it and use it for writing large documents or novels etc? You wouldn't, you'd get a free fully functioning word processor OR
 buy MS Office perhaps for serious work. So in the case of Anti Virus, if baseline seems to mean what these test results are implying, who would want to seriously use it to protect their PCs? Or am I missing something?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Free doesn't and shouldn't mean bad.</p>

            <p>My advice is to follow the results of tests at <a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>If you are looking for an opinion on Microsoft's MSE, I can tell you this.&nbsp; If I am approached by a person who has it installed, my first action is to remove it.&nbsp; In my opinion it is one of the poorest available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AV software is like tires and brakes on your car.&nbsp; NEVER use anything but the best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please pay close attention to my recommendation that you never install software that claims to be a security solution.&nbsp; I will not allow anything but only ANTIVIRUS software on my clients' computers.&nbsp; The rest of the stuff in those so-called security packages
 basically duplicates and disables built-in parts of Win7 which work just fine.</p>

<p><em>-</em> I tend to agree with that now. That's what I meant above by "So in the case of Anti Virus, if baseline seems to mean what these test results are implying, who would want to seriously use it to protect their PCs?".&nbsp; MSE seems to be so bad now,
 why is it being made? To help to the spread Malware?</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><em>"Please pay close attention to my recommendation that you never install software that claims to be a security solution."</em></p>
<p>- No trouble there, I never have and never will. I just want AV. Well, I also use a backup on-demand ( not real time ) scanner. Firewall etc is Windows own.</p>

            <p>Though I could dig around to provide you with links to&nbsp;the various information posted by Microsoft around the time that the original questions about the meaning of "Baseline" protection hit the net, I feel this is pointless since those unable to find them
 often&nbsp;actually do need better protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key reason that Microsoft started using this term to describe their protection is that they had never intended to completely replace or try to put the 3rd-party security vendors out of business.&nbsp; Their entire intent was to provide a baseline from which
 all other security products could be judged, since the complexity and lack of true protection provided by many products at the time was simply pathetic.&nbsp; By creating a simple, but effective protection product themselves they hoped to force the other products
 to improve and provide real protection, rather than the more common method of the time of selling "features" instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, during this time Microsoft also learned that a large part of the true issue was the 3rd-party testing, which since much of it was tied to the security vendors who either paid directly for their testing or advertised in the publications associated
 with the testing sites, made the testing itself questionable due to conflict of interest.&nbsp; At first Microsoft attempted to pass these tests itself by following the testing groups rules, but eventually they realized that much of the testing was done using invalid
 batches of samples (old or corrupted) and in truth often didn't represent the real distribution of malware which Microsoft knew were most prevalent from their own malware collection telemetry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The end result was that Microsoft finally decided to stop playing the "testing game" and instead focus their money on the real prevalent malware.&nbsp; They knew this shift in focus would cause exactly your type of question, but since they didn't wish to "win"
 an anti-malware sales war and so put their better 3rd-party security partners out of business, they made the change in direction anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terns of true protection, none of the people I have using either MSE or Windows Defender on later versions of Windows have ever had significant issues with malware,&nbsp; However, most of the people using these systems are either relatively intelligent and/or
 don't have children or other less mentally capable people using their PC.&nbsp; This is important because the Microsoft security doesn't provide protection from certain adware and other software products that typically prompt a user during the installation of other
 often "free" products.&nbsp; Avoiding these is usually easy if you actually read rather then just press OK, but quite a few&nbsp;people&nbsp;a few do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disagree with Canadian Tech's preference for antivirus only, since this issue with adware and other less malicious junkware has grown to be a much larger problem for most everyday users.&nbsp; However, if he encounters mostly more intelligent users like I have,
 this may not be a&nbsp;common issue for him either.&nbsp; It's also clear from a quick review of the Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2016 product that it's far more than basic antivirus protection, so he probably just doesn't recognize that practically none of those simple
 AV products have existed for several years now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In over a decade of using both MSE and Windows&nbsp;Defender on various systems I've only experienced the occasional piece of drive-by malware on some less reputable websites, with browser hijacks being the only type that got past MSE since it leaves those to
 the browser security&nbsp;and they can typically be closed with an AltF4 or similar method.&nbsp; Between MSE and the Windows built-in security I've never found a reason to pay for any protection since using Norton up until 2005, when Windows Live OneCare first became
 available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The valid reason to use another product as I already inferred, is when children or other less capable people may be using the computer.&nbsp; In the case where there may be&nbsp;less care or recognition that even lesser malware such as adware might be attempting to
 install, it may be valuable to find a more aggressive product than MSE with a broader range of protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only you can judge whether this level of protection is required, either through your own past experience or your understanding of the others who use the PC in question.&nbsp; I've personally never needed this, but have considered it in cases where older children
 have been involved.&nbsp; To this point though it's never been required and MSE along with limited user accounts for children have been sufficient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that those attempting to sell 3rd-party products including most of the testing groups have no reason to clarify why Microsoft is termed baseline protection, so the Internet is filled with confused and invalid statements about this.&nbsp; Only those in these
 forums with both the MVP moniker and a background in the Consumer Security specialty from that award program are commonly aware of the specifics above, and sometimes not even these.&nbsp; I know this from a stint as an MVP from 2007 to 2012, always involved&nbsp;with&nbsp;the
 Consumer Security related products and Product Mangers at the time.</p>

            <p>You're right Canadian Tech, I removed a reference to them to reduce confusion, but by implication from my discussion of testing groups I've included them as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The AV-Comparatives group is the one and only testing group I have any respect for, since they include a clear statement in their full reporting&nbsp;of the fact that their testing results should only be used as one portion of the decision regarding which security
 product to use.&nbsp; Though due to the complexity of testing modern security products their own scoring techniques have become complex and confusing as well, they at least reduce this to a simple set of final results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no need for such testing results, since I have decades of computing and security experience and education in my background, as well as having access to the developers of OneCare and MSE for several years.&nbsp; I know this isn't possible for most others,
 so the test results are all they have available.&nbsp; However, that's why I try to explain why I choose to use MSE/Defender myself in these posts and why I have little faith in the results of most testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no experience with Bitdefender, though it has a good reputation in the industry and so if it seems understandable to someone trying it out, I'd have nothing to say against it.</p>

            Over the years, various AV vendors have refused to participate in AV-Comparitives testing.&nbsp; Norton (Symantec) is one of them.&nbsp; If you dig deep enough, they mostly drop out of the testing when they do not like the results.

            <p>I meet the person responsible for the MSE testing program at Microsoft one year, from which I learned some of the hidden issues that testing could cause.&nbsp; This also factors into my disinterest in these tests, since in an attempt to pass them with high marks,
 the security products often have to "design to the test".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why Microsoft left the testing paradigm, since the resources in both developer and definitions analyst's time were taking away from the true improvement of current malware protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I see that what you term as "strictly an antivirus product" may be what I describe as less complex, since it was this&nbsp;complexity that could often occur with certain security suites full of "features".&nbsp; This is why many moved away from the Norton
 products after Symantec acquired them and began to combine them with pieces of other products they'd also acquired.&nbsp; My own reason for leaving was that at the time the Norton product couldn't fully perform updates without Administrator privilege, so I switched
 to OneCare which allowed this on a PC protecting multiple teenaged users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So though I don't know Bitdefender's history, if it also is simple to use today&nbsp;and avoids the feature trap, that generally means they understand the issues and lack of true security this often creates.</p>

    <title>Problems with Inserting Addresses and Envelopes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> being joe mcguire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Inserting Addresses and Envelopes</h2>
                    <p>When I use my Insert Address button in a letter (using my letter template)&nbsp;or other Word document to insert a Contact (from Outlook)&nbsp;I get pretty much exactly what I set up in AddressLayout in QuickParts&nbsp;(That's what it was called in Word 2003), namely the
 following (without the leading spaces): </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {&lt;PR_DISPLAY_NAME&gt;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}{&lt;PR_TITLE&gt;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}{{&lt;PR_COMPANY_NAME&gt;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}{&lt;PR_POSTAL_ADDRESS&gt;}</p>
<p>And I get "Snively Whiplash, Chairman, Dewey Cheatham &amp; Howe, 123 4th Street, Anywhere, MA 12345" (sometimes also "United Stated of America," apparently in case the Postal Service forgets where all the states are, but that's a different issue).&nbsp; If there
 is no title or company name those are omitted without leaving a blank line.&nbsp; So far so good.</p>
<p>But when I insert the same contact's address with the Insert Address button in Mailings, Envelopes, I don't get the same thing,&nbsp; Instead I get "Snively Whiplash,&nbsp;123 4th Street, Anywhere, MA 12345."&nbsp; No Title and no Company Name.&nbsp; What's with that?&nbsp; Is there
 a separate AddressLayout for envelopes?&nbsp; I don't remember having this problem in Word 2003.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Another oddity with Mailings, Envelope: When the window appears there is already text&nbsp;where the address is to go:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Heading 1:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Heading 2</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>[More text]</span></p>
<p><span>These are style names, of course, but they are just text, all single spaced, no leading spaces.&nbsp; That's exactly what prints out if I don't change it.&nbsp; Shouldn't that little window be blank until I put something
 in it?&nbsp; This happens only with my letter template (LetterTemplate.docx) which includes a style for EnvelopeAddress.&nbsp; If I do it from a blank document that window shows up empty.&nbsp; Perhaps that's a clue.&nbsp; Any ideas here?&nbsp;
</span></p>

            Word will attempt to grab any text that looks like it may be an address, so it will pick up short consecutive paragraphs. It will also apply any manual formatting included in those paragraphs. If you want to be sure it always grabs the right address, select
 the address first. To cut out this step format the address block with a unique style (I always use 'Inside Address' which was an old Microsoft standard that has stayed with me)&nbsp; and use a macro to grab paragraphs in that style e.g.<br />
<br />
Dim oPara As Paragraph<br />
Dim oRng As Range<br />

Whether or not the insert address option inserts the Country seems dependent on the format of the address in Outlook contacts. If the country is displayed in Contacts it will be when the address book is used. This seems somewhat haphazard in practice.<br />
<br />
It is probably simpler to use a macro to insert the address either at the cursor (as below) or to a bookmark or docvariable in the envelope template. This is more or less what I do in my add-ins, but in

    <title>Testing WP8 apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattj415  say:</h3>
<h2>            Testing WP8 apps</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm relatively new to programming and was hoping to get some really basic apps going in WP8, written in C#/Monogame (not to be published!). I have a Windows 7 PC so that rules out the emulator, and knowing my coding, anything I make is likely to be VERY
 broken for the first dozen attempts. My question is, if I run my app first time (through Visual Studio 2013) on my device (Lumia 535) and it's dangerously buggy, is there any chance it could seriously and permanently damage my phone?</p>
<p>I want to make sure I still have a usable phone at the end of it all!</p>
<p>I was tempted to put this on the MSDN site, but I was slightly concerned I would be out of my depth with the pros...I can put it there if it's better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Matt</p>

            I am going to say it is better to ask on MSDN. However I'll try my best to answer it anyway. First, visual studio will debug it first so if any bugs are found then it won't be installed onto your phone but a more immediate thing is that you can't create
 windows/windows phone 8 apps on a windows 7 PC as the basic requirement for windows and windows phone 8 sdk is windows 8.

<p>The easiest way is to drag the tab by the Favicon back to up to the toolbar. Look at the picture below where the black circle is take your mouse pointer and drag it from there.</p>

            I would do this by using the Project Manager in VBA to drag the form into a temp file. This creates a copy in the temp file. Now rename it there and then drag it back to the Normal file.

            You're using it as IMAP, correct? There are a couple of ways to fix this - the fastest is to delete the gmail data file and let Outlook rebuild it - but if you have folders for calendar and contacts in it (labeled 'this computer only') you need t export the contents first. 
<br />
<br />You can compact it - right click on the account name in the folder list on the left and choose Data File Properties then Advanced. Click Compact now. It may take awhile. 
<br />
<br />To solve the problem in the future without deleting mail, go to File, Account Settings, open the account settings dialog. Double click on the account and lower how much mail is synced. The older mail will stay on the gmail server.

    <title>Unexplained bullets that I can&#39;t delete - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unexplained bullets that I can&#39;t delete</h2>
                    I'm editing a document that has some unexplained bullets, which I can't delete.
<br />
<br />
I've selected Format / Bullets and Numbering, and I see that None is highlighted, which suggests these may not be normal bullets.
<br />
<br />
They're not regular characters, which I can highlight and delete. <br />
<br />
I've tried to backspace over the bullets, which normally allows deleting bullets. But that just deletes the preceding paragraph mark and joins the current paragraph with the previous one.<br />
<br />
I've tried Decrease Indent, but that has no effect.<br />
<br />
I suppose I could apply a new style, which would probably not take too long. (It's a list of references, extending over several pages.) But I'm puzzled and curious, and I'd like to figure out what's really happening here.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            What you're seeing are non-printing characters which indicate that some form of
<b>Format&gt; Paragraph - Line &amp; Page Breaks</b> has been applied to the adjacent paragraph. They do not print &amp; are visible only when the non-printing characters are displayed. Use the

            <p>A "bell curve" usually means a chart of the probability density function for the theoretical normal (Gaussian) distribution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get a bell curve in Excel, use the Average and StDev worksheet functions, &nbsp;enter X values in a column and Y values in an adjacent column on the right where the Y values are NORMDIST(X,mean,stdev,FALSE), select the X and Y numerical values, and create
 an XY (Scatter) chart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, you actually may want a "histogram," which is a column chart showing frequency of data values in intervals of the X data. Excel has a Histogram tool in its Analysis ToolPak. Or, you could use my free Better Histogram add-in, available at&nbsp;</p>
