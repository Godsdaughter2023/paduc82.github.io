<h2>            Which .Net Framework should i install&#63;</h2>
                    I'm in safe mode right now :( <br />
wanna format my notebook now but i wonder as a home user (windows XP-SP3) which version of .Net Framework should i download?
<br />
<br />
i don't even know what is it for! <br />
cuz right now i have alot of versions installed and don't wanna make the same mistake after installing a fresh windows
<br />
so should i download "Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5 Service pack 1 (Full Package 231MB)" or v2 is enough???<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Do you have any programs that are not working right now? You need V: 1.1 for XP, but you only need the others if you have a program that requires them. If you try to use a program that needs a specific version of .NET Framework, it will let you know which
 one it needs and you can download it at that time. <br />
<br />
While .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 is a full cumulative update that contains many new features building incrementally upon .NET Framework 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, it does not replace them. IOW, each version is independent of each other.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: If everything is working right now, don't install any version other than 1.1.

            AFAIK, .NET Framework 3.5 Service pack 1 does not replace earlier versions, but does update them. Source:<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/959209<br />
<br />
That said, it does not include V: 1.1 and also, AFAIK, Windows XP will not run without .Net Framework 1.1. That version should be on your installation disk though. The lack of any other version should not keep XP from starting.

The way that is worded, to me it sounds like previous versions are still needed. Specifically:
<em><strong>building incrementally upon.<br />

Again, I wouldn't bother loading any .NET Framework until you come across a program that needs a specific version. Otherwise, it's just wasted space.<br />

Are you sure that this is a "cumulative" update that contain every "previous" .Net versions?&nbsp; It was posted on the Usenet newsgroups before that the .Net "levels" are independent and depending on the "third party" software that requires .Net, you might need
 every versions.<br />

My opinion quoted. I do not think this replaces any version. You still do not need to download any version if you don't have a program that requires it to run.

            <p>I took it to a store as suggested. The technician ran some diagnostics and confirmed what I already knew, that there were yellow discoloration&nbsp;around the perimeter of my Surface 3 screen. He said the glue holding the glass to the display screen was changing
 color because of heat. What heat I do not know. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it was out of warranty, I could do a exchange for $220. This is clearly a manufacturing defect. The unit is only 15 months old and this should not be happening.

<h2>            Sick and tired Upgrades&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I cannot take it any more!!! Return to work my computer this morning and all my applications and files were closed. I thought it was MY COMPUTER.</p>
<p>The constant upgrades were Microsoft unilaterally decides to upgrade MY computer shutting down applications and files that I am still working on. &nbsp;Please tell me that there is something that I can do about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When changing the time there is also a limit. According to Microsoft I could not postpone for more than 12 hours.</p>
<p>Why can't you develop a reliable operating system instead of constantly patching this thing?</p>

<p>In the Windows 10 Creators Update, you delay updates for up to 18 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also disable the Windows Update service, but I don't recommend it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try using Active Hours and Restart Options to manage your Windows Update installations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can also upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which lets you pause updates up to 35 days.</p>

    <title>Netflix stopped working after updating to the new app. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sakal nachash  say:</h3>
<h2>            Netflix stopped working after updating to the new app.</h2>
                    
<p>I updated to the new Netflix app, and since then I have not been able to watch anything. The app will not launch properly, so I have to force close it and re-launch it several times, then eventually it will load to the screen where I can select a title,
 however no matter what title I choose, it loads to 25% then hangs for a while, then pops up a message telling me that there was a problem playing that title, and to either try again later, or select a different title. This happens with every title. So. I contacted
 Netflix support, and this was the "service" I received.</p>

<div>
<div>Netflix Morgan
<div>Thank you for chatting! My name is Morgan, who am I chatting with today?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>You
<div>My name is ******.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Netflix Morgan
<div>Nice to meet you ******! How can I help you out today?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>You
<div>I have not been able to watch Netflix on my Xbox for a couple of days now.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Netflix Morgan
<div>That is definitely not good. But i am sure I can help- no worries. Do you get any error codes or messages at all?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>You
<div>Since the update I get the message "We're having trouble playing this title right now. Please try again later or select a different title". It tells me this no matter what title I select. It will only load 25%.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Netflix Morgan
<div>I see. That is not fun... I do have to do some digging into this for you- but while I am, how has your week been so far besides this?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>You
<div>Let's just stick to the issue please.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Netflix Morgan
<div>No problem. So for that exact message these are the steps we have <a href="https://signup.netflix.com/Watch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">Click Here</span></a> We are not saying your xbox is bad or your internet either. But there is a communication issue between the device, the network and our servers. Doing all of those steps will get that kink off of our line and
 you will be back up in no time</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Netflix Morgan
<div>Now doing those steps will disconnect us- so before you get started let me know if you have any questions</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>You
<div>I will attempt these steps and see where I am after that.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Netflix Morgan
<div>Sounds like a plan ******! Before you do those- did you have any other questions for me today by chance?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>You
<div>Not at this time. Thank you.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Netflix Morgan
<div>You are more than welcome- always a pleasure :) I Hope you have a great night and a wonderful week! If you need us again- we are here 24-7 And one more thing, if you wouldn’t mind, please stay online for a one question survey.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I disconnected from the chat, and clicked on the link. There were no steps at the link provided, it was a link to the Netflix signup page.</p>
<p>So, before connecting with Netflix "support" again, I thought I would try Xbox support, even though I was sure the issue was not the console, but the new app. After troubleshooting with the Xbox support rep resetting the network connections to default, testing
 the connection, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, nothing worked. After exhausting all if the options with troubleshooting the Xbox, he confirmed my suspicions that the blame is to be placed on the new Netflix app since I am still able to play my games
 in multiplayer, I can watch streaming video in other apps, etc.</p>
<p>So, then I brace myself for disappointment and contact Netflix "support" for the second time. This is the "professional" I had to deal with.</p>

<p>Quick question ****** are you hardwired directly to your modem?</p>
<p>2 hours agoYou</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>2 hours ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>Okay what my tech guys have concluded is your internet connection is actually what's causing this problem as its very weak so every time your device tries to connect to our servers your internet connection keeps fluctuating.</p>
<p>2 hours agoYou</p>
<p>This started happening after I updated to the new app a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>2 hours ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>What I'd like you to do for me is go to your account and select playback setting for me and tell me what it's set to?</p>
<p>2 hours agoYou</p>
<p>One moment.</p>
<p>2 hours ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>Sure</p>
<p>2 hours agoYou</p>
<p>Where do I find an option for playback settings in the app?</p>
<p>2 hours ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>Actually ****** I need you to do this on your computer</p>
<p>2 hours agoYou</p>
<p>It is set to "Auto".</p>
<p>2 hours ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>Okay could you set it to low and try playing a title on your xbox once more for me?</p>
<p>2 hours agoYou</p>
<p>One moment.</p>
<p>2 hours ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>sure</p>
<p>59 minutes agoYou</p>
<p>It took me to the black screen asking where I wanted to go, but no option to select anything, None of my buttons or directional sticks or button worked. I then exited back to the Xbox home, then launched the app again. This time it took me to the title screen.
 I selected a title, it loaded to 25%, then gave me the error again "We're having trouble playing this title right now. Please try again later or select a different title."</p>
<p>59 minutes agoYou</p>
<p>Same result for a different title.</p>
<p>56 minutes ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>Okay this is really bad ****** is seems your device is having some serious connection problem when you are trying to connect to our servers what I'd like you to do is type this link in your browser netflix.com/clearcookies. so you can clear your netflix
 data and try again for me, i'll be right here</p>
<p>54 minutes agoYou</p>
<p>I attempted to go to netflix.com/clearcookies, however I was redirected to<a href="https://signup.netflix.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://signup.netflix.com/home</a></p>
<p>54 minutes ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>Did you type it in this browser?</p>
<p>53 minutes agoYou</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>52 minutes ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>Okay ****** you definitely need to give your ISP a call so they can give your internet connection a boost so you can get the internet connection speed you're paying for</p>
<p>51 minutes agoYou</p>
<p>I have tested my network speed, it is fine.</p>
<p>50 minutes ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>I totally understand ******, but on our end we are seeing a fluctuation in your internet connection when you're trying to connect to our app, I really want to get you up and running</p>
<p>48 minutes agoYou</p>
<p>Why then has this only started happening after the software update? My other streaming services are working fine.</p>
<p>47 minutes ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>This definitely could also be the problem some data might have been updated that shouldn't have been did you mention this when you called xbox?</p>
<p>47 minutes agoYou</p>
<p>What data exactly?</p>
<p>46 minutes ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>Data that as to do with making netflix run properly, data that was on your first software</p>

<p>Data that was on my first software? What does that mean?</p>
<p>44 minutes ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>Okay each device and applications as specific data written for it, I'm just grasping at straws right now as I can't figure what's happening with your device</p>
<p>44 minutes ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>Have you tryied downloading the lastest version of the netflix app?</p>
<p>44 minutes agoYou</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>That's when this started happening.</p>
<p>43 minutes ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>I'm so glad your a reasonable person.:)</p>
<p>42 minutes ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>One more thing ****** could you double check just once more if you're sign in to your xbox gold account ?</p>

<p>39 minutes ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>I know right.</p>
<p>38 minutes agoYou</p>
<p>Where do we go from here?</p>
<p>37 minutes ago<b>Netflix</b>&nbsp;Sashoi</p>
<p>I do believe your next option would be calling xbox right back and let them know that you've been having this issue based on the new software update and they have the tools to update your xbox back with the original application</p>

<p>Here's what I've been doing. Delete the Netflix app (and related files). Reboot the Xbox. Download Netflix again. Attempt to start it (THIS WILL FAIL). While sitting on the error screen, reboot my router. Try again, this takes you to sign back into your
 profile. Then the stupid thing works. SOMEBODY FIX THIS APP!!!!</p>

<p>I had the very same problem, it turns out although the Netflix app was showing up as downloaded when I went to watch anything it would only download 25% them I would get the message saying unable to. Play at this time please try again later.. I eventually
 realised that I had not completely downloaded the full app (even though it looks like you have) &nbsp;I only had about 48 mb of storage space available and the Netflix app needs 51 mb. &nbsp;So I deleted the app and a couple of other games I no longer use. When I was
 sure I had enough storage space I downloaded it again and it worked no problem.. Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Hotspot will freeze Settings window for an extended Period of time and COM Surrogate &#40;dllhost.exe&#41; stops responding</h2>
                    <p>Since Installing windows Updates for windows 10 a few days ago I have been unable to start the Mobile Hotspot feature. It stops responding for about 5 minutes and then stops trying to connect.&nbsp; Also when ever I go to the current active connection in Network
 Connections , right click -&gt; Go to properties -&gt; Select sharing -&gt; select to allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection -&gt; click OK, Network Connections window freezes and COM Surrogate (dllhost.exe stops responding. I
 have to end the task through the Task Manager and Restart the Windows Explorer Window containing the Network Connections to be able to navigate back to that location. I have tried Updating and reinstalling the drivers and updating all drivers but the issue
 persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Can I do now to fix this?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes you should keep the internet connected when installing Windows 8. However if the<br />
previous install was an upgrade then I bet something kept in the process was the real<br />
culprit as that does happen.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you did some good troubleshooting!<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays!<br />
<br />

<p>it's not terribly loud but can be heard from 10 ft away when the room is quiet. Have seen several similar issues of people posting something like this even back to years ago.</p>
<p>Is this a reason to issue a repair or normal? I just got it 3 days ago and might just return it to the store.</p>
<p>Thanks very much in advance for any help.</p>

 it. he said he changed the password accidentally so I tried it and it recovered some new acct name that hasnt even been set up! I paid for the "Blackninja48" acct so I dont want to loose it! We really like this account because we have friends on it that arent
 on our other "robodeem" account. PLEASE HELP!!</p>

<p>Actually scratch that I've had a plunder of Bungie.net myself and found you can't do those sorts of things you describe to your WLID and/or XBL account on there. Hence I suspect your Blakninja account never had anything changed or there's something we're
 not being told. If the WLID and/or&nbsp;had been changed it would have to have been on the console and you'd have had no problems logging in.</p>

<p>My son was on bungee to try to get a symbol next to his profile name on halo reach, he said that he got it now but we cant figure out the acct! The original password that was for the "Blakninja" acct says that we dont have permission to access or something
 like that now. So bungee does affect your Xbox acct in some ways. he said that when he went on with the email, he deleted something that was set up because he said someone had set a bungee on his email, so after deleting that he proceeded to make a new one
 to get his symbol. but how can there be more than one acct on 1 email address?? this other free xbox acct is on that email now so what happened to our "Blakninja48" acct? And the money I payed for it? Is there a way to ask someone from xbox how to fix my issue??</p>

<p>Something's really not adding up here and I think it's whatever your son deleted that's causing the problem. Bungie.Net is setup in such a way that all you need to do is log in with your WLID and password (they call it a .net passport but it's the same thing)
 and you're fine. &nbsp;As such everyone who has a WLID already has a Bungie.Net account .You definately can't alter your WLID or XBL account while you're on there (I went through the site with a fine tooth comb) so dollars to donuts it's the deleted something that's
 the issue. </p>
<p>Call support and they should be able to help you. </p>

<p>Wait if he only deleted the account from the console then you should just be able to recover it with the original WLID and password or whatever he changed the password too. Give that a go first.</p>

<p>Get this, I just got off the phone with xbox support and my issue is very rare! The rep I talked to had only seen 1 other instance like this!! It turns out that Both the "Blakninja48" acct and the other random free acct that I talked about are both linked
 to the one email!! Obviously you can only have one gamer tag per email so they are considered corrupt now and my "Blakninja48" acct cant be saved! They have canceled the acct because they have no way to fix or remove a tag from the email! So they are having
 a team look at the issue and will get back to me within 48 hrs! Then will send me a token for the remaining time left on the acct! I told them I wanted extra time added because this is a problem that isnt my fault and that they obviously have a loophole in
 the system somewhere!! I guess I'll wait to see what they give me for all the trouble and annoyance this has caused me.... &nbsp; I thank you for your time and hope to maybe meetup with ya online sometime!! Thank you very much for the help!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 1809 Applocker issue - Calculator being blocked by default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickdangleton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1809 Applocker issue - Calculator being blocked by default rule</h2>
                    &lt;p&gt;Since updating some machines in our enterprise to Windows 10 1809, AppLocker's default rule for Packaged App Execution is randomly blocking Calculator intermittently. We only have the default rule for Packaged App Execution being enforced, which allows
 all signed packaged apps to run, yet if I view the event log for AppLocker when the problem occurs, the event id that is logged clearly indicates AppLocker is not working properly. Instead of being filled out with details about the app, everything is blank.
 The RuleID is a series of zeros, the RuleName is blank, and on the general screen where the name of the app should be listed, it just says (blank) " was prevented from running" without the app name. The strangest thing about the issue is that if the user waits
 and tries again later, it will start working again - without even rebooting or logging off. Looking at event logs, it is probably working 99% of the time, it just randomly does this 1% of the time then returns to normal.

    <title>Win10 tablet 1803 upgrade space issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> syuanca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 tablet 1803 upgrade space issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Win10 tablet which has build in 2G RAM and 32G build in flash memory. I install another 32G SD memory. The tablet only has one Micro-USB port. In general, the USB port only for power charging. When upgrade Win10 to 1803 version, it needs more
 extra disk space, SD memory space is not an option for 1803 upgrade, have to use external USB drive. Then, my problem comes, during the upgrade, the USB drive has to always stay there, there is no way I can connect USB power cable and 1803 upgrade will take
 couple of hours, therefore, upgrade process will always interrupted and failed because of out of battery power.&nbsp; Is there anyone know how to solve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            Hi SyuanCA, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage  ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 and then turn off Automatic Updates - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next 2 years of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>Hi DaveM121</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your detail answer. Keep reinstall OS to follow Microsoft’s annuel upgrade is not a good practice for Windows’ tablet user. I think this maybe one of the reason people choice iPad instead of Window’s tablet. Microsoft wants to keep large uninstall
 options on all platforms, but require reinstall for 16G/32G tablets on each major upgrade, that does not make any sense to me. Suggest MS to give a special configration build for small tablet user. Tablet user may not need too many uninstall and restore options.
 Besides, Windows should also utilize the SD card option, mount SD storage as soon as possible when device boot up, therefore, user also can use SD storage duing upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>Completely reinstall Win10 on my 32G Dell 5830 tablet is too painful to me, after few time upgrade test, finally I found a way to sucessfully upgrade 1803 version on a sigle USB port table without reinstall. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstall all none default applications from you tablet.</p>
<p>2. Uninstall all none default Windows store apps.</p>
<p>3. Use Win10 disk free utility to free previous windows system file and other space you can free.</p>
<p>4. Turn off tablet hibernate mode by:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-enable-or-disable-hibernate-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-enable-or-disable-hibernate-in-windows-10/</a></p>
<p>Once you turn off hibernate, it will free a big hibernate file from your main storage.</p>
<p>5.Goto control panel/system/Advanced system settings/Performance/setting/Advanced/Virtual memory, uncheck “Automatically manage paging file size for all drivers”, then, select “no paging file”, (i select Custom Size and set 200M).This will reduce virtual
 memory size from main storage device.</p>
<p>6. After reboot, you can try to upgrade 1803 again and win10 will not ask for external USB storage for your upgrade. You can use the only USB port as power source during Windows upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem solved!</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />The keyboard shortcut is there, by default.
<br />
<br />You can use the Windows Key + Space to display the language menu. Then, press the same keys until you select the language you desire.
<br />
<br />The shortcut is activated automatically when you've more than one language installed.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<h2>            Unable to remove a language from Windows 10 April 2018 Update &#40;version 1803&#41;</h2>
                    Since installing the Windows 10 April 2018 Update (version 1803), I'm unable to remove a language from the Preferred Languages list in Settings, or from my keyboard language options.&nbsp; How can I remove these languages?

<p><span>If you add a secondary language to Windows 10 version 1803 that shares the same base language as the Windows display language, neither language can be removed.</span></p>
<p><span>For example: If English (United Kingdom) is the current Windows display language, and you then add English (India) to the Preferred languages list, afterwards neither English (United Kingdom) nor English (India) can be removed from the Preferred languages
 list.</span></p>

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> The most notable effect of having multiple related languages in the Preferred languages list is additional entries in the text input selector. You can remove unwanted language

<h2>            Questions About Skype Numbers</h2>
                    <p>Moving to Germany. I have AT&amp;T service, and I need people in the U.S. to be able to call me as a U.S. number. I have had that phone unlocked. I would like to use that phone in Germany as a Skype phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I purchase a Skype phone number, what is the cost TO ME when people call me on this number?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I have to have service for Germans to be able to call me. Is all of this possible on the same phone, or do I need to purchase a new phone in Germany?</p>

<p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/946a649c-21ed-47c9-9709-8b2497e5cb24" title="AmyCollins1972">

<p>
</p><p><em>I have AT&amp;T service, and I need people in the U.S. to be able to call me as a U.S. number. I have had that phone unlocked. I would like to use that phone in Germany as a Skype phone.</em></p>
<p>This is not possible: Skype does not support what the telephone industry calls "inbound number portability."&nbsp; In other words, we can not transfer into Skype, for use on our Skype accounts, any land line or cellular numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as your phone supports using the Skype app, and you will have a good data plan for those times you use Skype and are not on a WiFi network, no problem otherwise with using Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>If I purchase a Skype phone number, what is the cost TO ME when people call me on this number?</em></p>
<p>No cost to you at all other than the price of the Skype Number subscription.</p>
<p>For those who would call you, try to find a Skype Number closest to the location where most of your callers would be located, so they incur little if any toll call charges when they call you using your Skype Number.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Also, do I have to keep service with AT&amp;T so that I have service to the phone.</em></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Now that you have unlocked the phone, you can choose service from any carrier that works with your phone's frequencies.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>Additionally, I have to have service for Germans to be able to call me. Is all of this possible on the same phone, or do I need to purchase a new phone in Germany?</em></p>
<p>No need to purchase a different phone as long as the new carrier's SIM card (which is what your new German mobile number will be programmed into) works with your phone and is on coordinating frequencies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Although you did not ask, I ought to mention that you should study the Skype Help FAQ articles on call forwarding, Skype Number, and subscriptions so you can make informed decisions about how you want this to work.&nbsp; While this should appear as simple as
 snapping your fingers together, there are variables to consider as well.</p>
<p>

<p>Elaine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very helpful. One thing I am not understanding, so I am going to ask a new (but similar) question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I take my unlocked AT&amp;T phone to Germany, purchase a SIM card with a German number, and then get a United States Skype phone number for people in the U.S. to call easily? I would shut down my AT&amp;T service. So I would have one phone with a German number
 that is Skype compatible and could receive Skype calls made to a U.S. phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it only possible to purchase a new phone in Germany with a Germany number and then set up my Skype phone number for U.S. residents needing to call me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can tell you know exactly what you are talking about. I just didn't understand it completely. Thank you so much for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amy</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: Research which carrier you might want to use in Germany to ensure that the phone is compatible with the wireless carrier's systems!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see no reason to continue a US-based wireless service plan overseas - the roaming fees and extension of calling plan costs (roaming) are prohibitive (read: expensive).&nbsp; That said, some US carriers have made their plans more cost-effective.&nbsp; Yet, if you
 are moving to Germany permanently, I still cannot justify retaining a US-based cellular plan or service.</p>

</p><p>1 No changes where made.. Only standard windows 10 updates</p>
<p>2 I use a local account &gt;&nbsp;<span>When i go to settings &gt; My info&gt; It says MATT DAMON &gt; local account &gt; Administrator</span></p>
<p><span>3 I tried using the account '</span>Girlfriendsname'. And in here account it just works right away. I dont even have to fill in the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So it probably has to do with my account &gt; I guess the difference in the computer user name (HP) and my Windows local account name: Matt.</span></p>

<p>Hey Mike P. What do you mean with 2 accounts are broken? You mean 2 user accounts in W10 are broken or something else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I beginning to think it has indeed to do with my user account. A solution would be using a different user account, but i rather keep using my standard account.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen&#47;Freeze Error from Recent Windows&#47;Trend Micro update&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
This issue has been going on for a couple of weeks now.&nbsp; I'm on a Gateway with Vista.&nbsp; What usually happens is that I'll get a blue screen error (different things, sometimes memory, sometimes no label), and then when I turn the computer off and on, it'll restart
 with a prompt to restart in safe mode.&nbsp; Usually, once it's restarted, it'll run for some amount of time, and then crash again, either with another blue screen or else just going black.&nbsp; Sometimes it can't even get restarted without having another error.<br />
<br />
What I've tried:&nbsp; Starting in Safe Mode and then using System Restore to reset the settings to two weeks or so ago (this worked for several hours this afternoon, but obviously now I'm having the same problem again).&nbsp; I've deleted a bunch of files (game downloads,
 mostly) to clear up room in the memory.&nbsp; I saw that Windows Defender was having a problem with MacAfee, so I tried diabling that.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
After the first couple of times this happened, I would get a pop-up after Windows restarted saying that a recent update might have caused some compatibility problems.&nbsp; I thought it was a Trend Micro update that was mentioned, but it could have just been one
 of the security updates from Windows.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea what this error could be or what could be causing it?&nbsp; I will try to post more specific information if/when it comes up again.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Do the restore again and IMMEDIATELY after reboot set Windows Updates to CHECK FOR UPDATES BUT<br />
LET ME CHOOSE WHETHER TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL THEM.<br />
<br />
Then do this and leave this set - <br />

How To Disable Automatic Driver Installation In Windows Vista - Drivers<br />
<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</a><br />

<br />
Then if Windows Updates Suggests a Driver just HIDE it and look manually (see below)<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now run Windows Updates and tell us which ones are trying to install. If you want you can install them<br />
one at a time to see which is causing the issue. Except DO NOT install ANY drivers, just tell us which<br />
if any and then HIDE them.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
Also try to determine if Trend has a role - can you disable its updates temporarily or just disable it<br />
altogether as a test. Just do not download or visit strange site for a time.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are multiple factors to consider should you encounter high disk usage issue on Windows 10. There's a possibility that the issue is caused by a misconfiguration with one of the installed programs. That being said, we'll need more information to properly
 address your concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far? We'll need this information to avoid repeats.</li><li>What is the make and model of your laptop?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Have you installed the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Update Windows 10">latest updates</a></strong> for Windows 10?</li><li>What is the <strong>OS Build</strong> of your Windows 10 system? Click the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Start</span> button, type <span style="font-weight: bold">About your PC</span>, press
Windows specifications</span> to find this information.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For now, we recommend performing the instructions outlined in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Tips to improve PC performance in Windows 10">support
 article</a></strong>. The link has tips on how to improve PC performance in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also advise performing a <strong>clean</strong> <strong>boot</strong> to isolate which program is possibly causing the high disk usage issue.
<span>A <strong>clean</strong> <strong>boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you use your Windows 10 laptop. You can find the steps on how
 to perform a <strong>clean</strong> <strong>boot</strong> from this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">
<strong>article</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE</span>: Please go to the section: <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">
Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span> to boot the PC in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Please respond back with the results.</span></p>

<p>Sorry for not responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I made my original post. I did two things and since they were done at about the same time, I do not know which resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a windows update that failed to complete and I restarted it. That lead to not only that update, but others in the queue to get installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I found a tool on HP's website that checked my drivers on the HP laptop and it found that the driver for my disc controller was out of date. So I updated the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the driver update, the windows application that indicates if a device is running and the state of the driver for said device, indicated that the driver was up to date during my initial attempts to resolve the issue. I suspect there is some discontinuity
 between HP and Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as stated previously, it was one of the two steps above, but not sure which was the magic bullet.</p>
