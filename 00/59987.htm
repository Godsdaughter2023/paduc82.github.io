                    <p>When I try to turn my computer off I get the message that Outlook isn't shutting down and for me to go in and shut it down.&nbsp; How do I do that and why is that happening.&nbsp; If I walk away and think the computer is shutting off I will come back the next day
 and the message is still displayed.</p>

            Try going in to task manager and ending the task if that doesn't work try clicking the button at shut down that says force quit.

<div><span>3. Write (for example in Notepad) a 1-line text file:</span></div>
<div><span>DIR %1 /O &gt;LPT1:</span></div>
<div><span>Save it as "printdir.bat" in the "Send To" folder.</span></div>
<div><span>Then, to print list of files in any folder, right-click that folder and select Send to | printdir.bat</span></div>

            <p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This issue might occur if the network settings are corrupt on the network adapter. Most probably, the network is identifying the connection, but, it’s unable to connect due to unappropriated permission for the network services.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if the network location awareness service is started and running in Automatic (delay) mode. Follow the methods:</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Follow the steps to disable the network adapter, restart the service for network location awareness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refer to the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-nz/windows/enable-disable-network-adapter#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and follow the steps to know how to disable network adapter.</li><li>Press <b>Windows+R </b>keys and type “<b>Service.msc</b>”. Hit <b>Enter</b>.</li><li>Locate<b> Network Location Awareness </b>service and right click on it. Select
<b>Properties</b>. </li><li>Under <b>General </b>tab, choose <b>Start </b>for the service status. </li><li>Again, select <b>Automatic </b>or<b> Automatic delay </b>from the drop down menu under startup type.
</li><li>Click on <b>OK </b>to close the window. </li><li>Enable the network adapter. </li></ul>
<p>Check if the issue is resolved, when you restart the computer. If not, you might try to verify the same in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode with the networking</a>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>The issue might also occur due to permission issues for the network list hierarchy under Registry. Follow the steps to reset the permission and check if it helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <b>Windows+R </b>keys and type “<b>regedit</b>”. Press <b>Enter</b>. </li><li>Navigate to the following location:</li></ul>
<p><b>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Right Click on <b>Network List</b> folder and select <b>Permission</b>. Select
<b>Advance </b>option.</li><li>Choose the box which says “<b>Replace all child objects permission entries with inheritable permission entries</b>”. Click on
<b>Apply</b>.</li><li>Again under <b>Security </b>tab, select the services such as <b>NlaSvc</b> and
<b>Netprofm </b>and select<b> Full Control</b> under the <b>permission </b>tab.</li><li>Click on <b>Apply </b>and then <b>OK</b>.</li></ul>
<p>Restart the computer and check if network is getting recognized at the taskbar.
</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, you can refer to the following steps to back the registry files on the computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Windows and R key to open the run box.</li><li>Type ‘regedit’ and press Enter from the keyboard.</li><li>Open the file option on the menu bar.</li><li>Click on Export and save the file with a name on the desktop.</li></ul>
<p>If you want to restore the file, you can do so by double clicking the file that you have saved on the desktop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For reference, you can follow the steps mentioned in the link to try and fix the issue:</p>

 OS since Millenium.

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Google Chrome app has a part of it that is called <strong>Profile.</strong> It stores all the changes you made on your Chrome browser such as bookmarks, themes, settings, and so on. When the
<strong>Profile</strong> gets corrupted, the browser won't be able to launch properly or it will open, however you'll only see blank pages just like the one you're experiencing right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be able to resolve this issue, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Google Chrome.</li><li>Click <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7e85f98-c850-4076-8b77-c72e62d8c717" height="24" width="24" />at the top right corner of your Chrome browser.</li><li>Click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Show advanced settings...</strong> located at the bottom part of the page.</li><li>Scroll down to the bottom part of the page, look for the <strong>Reset settings</strong> button and click on it.</li><li>It will prompt you a message about the reset. After you've finished reading, click
<strong>Reset</strong>.</li><li>Close Google Chrome and try to launch it again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Another option to resolve this issue is to uninstall and reinstall the Google Chrome browser from your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the solution above works.</p>
        </p>

                    Hi Guys
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem will come on intermittently and sudden. I'm using Modem <b>Huawei HG863</b> , wireless router
<b>D-Link DIR 615 N router ,&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>Wireless adaptor TP-Link <b>TL-WN727N. </b>I'm using a desktop loaded with Window 7 x64 Home Premium.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Network gets disconnected while surfing the net / playing games / watching movies etc. The network icon on the right bottom corner will have a Exclamation mark with yellow backing on it. Click on it , it show me that currently connected to my network and
 under it says limited access. Try to disconnect but can't, it will take forever to disconnect.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Check the network information , it show me that i'm connected to my network but a red cross between the line to internet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tried to restart/shut-down the computer but it will just hang at the shut down page for like 10-20 mins before a beep sound is heard then from there its restart my computer.</div>

            <p>Hi Teck, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong></div>
<div>I’d suggest you to update the network adapter drivers on your computers and check if that makes things better.<br />
<div>1. Open <strong>Device Manager </strong>by clicking the <strong>Start </strong>
button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>System and Security</strong>, and then, under
<strong>System</strong>, clicking <strong>Device Manager</strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</div>
<div><br />
2. In the list of hardware categories, find and expand the <strong>Network Adapters
</strong>and select the Bluetooth device driver that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.</div>
<div><br />
3. Click the <strong>Driver </strong>tab, click <strong>Update Driver</strong>, and then follow the instructions. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</div>
<div><br />
For further information, visit the below mentioned link:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a><br />
<div>If you are not able to update the device driver through windows update you can visit your computer or graphics card manufacturer website and download &amp; install the latest driver. Or Contact your system manufacturer to get it done.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong></div>
<div>As a test, boot into <strong>safe mode with networking </strong>and check if the issue is reproduced.<br />
<br />
<strong>Start your computer in safe mode </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a><br />
<div>Select <strong>Safe mode with Networking</strong> in the Advanced startup options.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            I tried both.
<div><br />
<div>Method 1 , all my files are up to date according to window's own update driver as well as the manufacturer website. But the problem still surface intermittently so i tried method 2.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 2 i only tried a few hours(3-4) and problems didn't surface during this period of time</div>
<div><br />
<div>After using method 2 , my connection lost problem seem to fade away without doing any troubleshooting. Can you suggest what is the possible problem that causes this lost of connection? Btw i swap my kb dongle with my wifi adaptor and both still work.</div>

            <p>Hi Teck, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>As the network connection works fine in the safe mode, this reflects that there is possibly any third party program service that is intermittently blocking your connection, as there are only necessary Microsoft services are started in the safe mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to try the following methods in order to diagnose your issue further.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>Try to clean boot your system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" under more information to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>If you still have the same issue after Method 1, try to temporarily disable the anti-virus program installed. To do so refer to:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Disable antivirus software</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div>Reboot your system after disabling the security software and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Post back your results for further assistance.</div>

            Not opening with app tile. Opening with icon from desktop monitor , which is same icon we have used with previous Microsoft operating systems. Now, this is with desktop computer at work.my Hotmail account opens without need to sign in. For another person
 to sign in to their Hotmail account, they must 1st sign out of mine
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>At home we open with tile marked e,which is internet explorer windows 10 version. This is on hand held pad devise. The result is the same. Hotmail account opens when we enter h, tap the Hotmail.com that pops up in browser box, and Hotmail account opens
 instantly without the need to sign in.</div>
<div>I believe I have my accounts linked at home and at work through windows 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On other computers , not using windows 10,none of this happens or is an issue.</div>
<div>
<p>Hope this is an adequate explanation</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might happen when the passwords are saved by the browser and if you have checked Automatically sign-in option during login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial step of troubleshooting, I suggest you to sign out from your outlook.com account, which is logged in the browser and check when you login next time, whether it is getting logged in without prompting for email ID and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Internet Explorer, I suggest you to try method 1 and if you are using Edge browser, try method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Reset Internet Explorer.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the link below to Reset Internet Explorer<br />

<h3> michaelbollhoefer  say:</h3>
<h2>            BAD_POOL_HEADER Crashes in Windows 10 Every Day on Dell Precision 7510</h2>
                    <p>Its driving me crazy! &nbsp;I have contacted dell and there first response was that it was the accelormeter for the dell free fall sensor. &nbsp;However, I disabled it, uninstalled the drivers and program, and even downloaded the windows 10 update removal tool and
 blocked windows update from being able to reinstall the driver and its still causing me problems. &nbsp;It happens at minimum once a day, sometimes multiple times a day. &nbsp;It most often happens when I am not even sitting at the computer. I thought it was from the
 computer failing to go to sleep properly when away but I disabled sleep mode and it still persists. &nbsp;Here is a screen of what I see when I view the crash dumps in BlueScreenView. I have updated the drivers from dell's website multiple times. &nbsp;I updated to
 the latest versions again today and still having problems.</p>

            I worked with Dell and we narrowed the issue down and they have also have issued an internal white paper and the culprit was Dell support assist. As soon as I uninstalled it, the crashrs sropped. &nbsp;So, if you have a dell precision with the new Xeon mobile
 processors, for the time being you need to remove Dell support assist from the machine if you're getting bad pool header crashes.

            Hi Ray.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would enable System Restore only on C, configure it for 5-10% or more if you can spare it to have more restore points saved and for longer.  
<br />
<br />It's good to check back there regularly because some Windows Updates and Version Updates are turning it off, and Version Updates will always delete all points.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Well simple answer is  you need at least 300 megabytes (MB) of free space on each disk that is 500 MB or larger.
<br />
<br />    “System Restore might use between three and five percent of the space on each disk. As the amount of space fills up with restore points, it deletes older restore points to make room for new ones. System Restore doesn't run on disks smaller than 1 gigabyte (GB). 
<br />
<br />So, if you want more system restore points, the more space you can give, the better.

<p>Thanks for that information. I have now only C: enabled but the indicated capacity is only 118GB and one Restore point takes over 70GB, or about 60%.

            Ray, a System Restore point shouldn't take that much space.   It's just a snapshot, not an image backup.  What is telling you that?
<br />
<br />If you want you can store a backup image to the HDD using free Macrium which is best:    <a href="https://reflect.macrium.com/webtutorial/How_to_create_a_disk_image.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://reflect.macrium.com/webtutorial/How_to_...</a>

<h2>            Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter driver problem.</h2>
                    Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter driver problem.I think all was fine until my router broke and I installed a new one. Then I cointer to connect wirelessly. I reset the wireless connection on the printer, but got an error message when trying to connect
 laptop and printer on WiFi. I have an Acer 5523 which I note a previous query from November related to the same laptop. Anyway, I went into control panel to check the printer was showing, only to find an exclamation mark on my laptop. I ran troubleshoot and
 was give the message about the missing driver for Virtual WiFi. Now I am unable to get my laptop to connect to my hub wirelessly. If you can help please give full instructions. I am not a techy but do have some friends who could probably help with instruction.<br />

            <p><span>Hi Shirleywilson,<br />
<br />
1. What is the exact error message that you get?<br />
2. What is the make and model of the printer?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1<br />
</b>I would suggest you to uninstall the drivers for </span><span>Microsoft virtual wifi miniport adapter from Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>, type
<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong> in the Start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Locate
<strong><span>Network adapters</span></strong> and expand the same.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Select the Microsoft virtual wifi miniport adapter, right-click and select
<strong><span>Uninstall.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>d. Restart the computer, if prompted.
</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;<br />
Drivers should get installed automatically after restarting the computer. <br />
<br />
<b>Method 2<br />
</b>I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />

            Thanks, tried uninstall virtual miniport but as soon as i restart my laptop, it comes back still faulty.<br />
I cannot connect to my printer, and am unable to download any driver updates for some reason. I have scanned for viruses. When I try to download a driver update, I get a blue message about a problem that i cannot read because it goes so quickly and the system
 restarts asking me which mode i.e safe etc. i want to restart in. When restarted, I get an error message telling me something caused windows to shut down unexpectedly. I tried to update Atheros WiFi adapter AR5B93 and keep getting told that installation could
 not complete. HELP<br />

<h3> &#193;tilat. g. miguel  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Make This PC Discoverable&#34; switch missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am setting up a WLAN with 3 laptops, all from the same brand and model Compaq CQ-21, all running Windows 10 version 1607 build 14393.1358. Further updating is down the road, but I have been stumbling on Windows Update going on for hours or whole nights
 and doing pretty much nothing. But that's another issue. Right now, the problem is: with only one of them, strangely enough, the&nbsp;"Make This PC Discoverable" switch has suddenly gone missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure I did have that option before, and for the very same WiFi SSD, but upon tweaking options, resetting network configs and trying to get that one laptop to share files as a "server" to the other "client" machines, I came across the need to set this
 up again, without success. The switch was not there anymore, only the autoconnect and metered connection switches were listed/available. I was even more annoyed by the fact that a web search of this issue got me nowhere feasible - i.e. I was left with restoring
 or freshly installing the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My actual goal was to convert the network type from Public to Private, so I tried something else: going for the homegroup config, as I know that that screen has a link to "Change Network Location". That's when I got angry, for this too had changed and the
 link was not available anymore. It only said I could not set up a homegroup as the type of the network was not right (Public).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out a way to edit the corresponding registry key (on the web) and have the Private status "forced". Also, I went to the advanced sharing options, where discovery and auto set of network devices were properly on. Doing so enabled me to set the homegroup,
 but I still had issues with not being able to share folders on the network. Heck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to go through the windows troubleshooter, where I was asked if I'd like to reset the network configs and reboot (still don't understand why windows 10 says it's only rebooting after 5 minutes, oh well, I guess I'll wait). Been there, done that,
 no good. Tried also windows Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status &gt; Network Reset (link below that page). Changed nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I deleted the registry profile for my wifi ssd (all of them, actually), configured it all fresh, went with the troubleshooting for the homegroup, skipped the network fix request and eventually got asked if I wanted to change from Public to Private.
 After that, it seems all is going well, but I still don't have the&nbsp;"Make This PC Discoverable" switch back where it belongs and I am pretty sure that is going to bother me again in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most similar, descriptive and promising &nbsp;though disappointing - thread I came across was this:</p>
<p>http://hfboards.hockeysfuture.com/showthread.php?t=2000947</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems and the screenshots the OP presents are exactly my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any help getting that GUI switch back. Please give me any input.</p>

            <strong>There is no doubt</strong> that you're infected with a Virus, but can send a screen shot?.<br />
<br />
What were the last steps taken before this happen?<br />
<br />
Regardless, please run Windows Defender (or your own Anti Virus), update its Virus Definition, and Run a full PC scan.<br />
<br />
<strong>Expectation</strong>: After the Virus scan, it not definite that the files will be recovered, not even if you use System restore, since basically they are destroyed. I would also suggest you to minimize your relationship with the Internet until the
 PC is cleaned from threats.<br />
<br />
<br />
Update me when done.

                    Following an upgrade to Windows 10, I tried to do a reset which failed, unfortunately the automatic roll-back also failed with the resulting blue screen comment "inaccessible boot file". Microsoft support desk were helpful, but eventually I was advised
 that the only option was to download the recovery image. However, no matter which computer,&nbsp;browser or internet connection I can't download the recovery image. I just go to a blank page. Microsoft have tried but haven't come up with a solution. What am I doing
 wrong? I've tried to download on Windows 10 machines, Windows 7 and even Windows Vista!

<h2>            After waking from Sleep mode Edge, the store, Cortana, weather, and news apps all error</h2>
                    <p>First off sfc reports no problems and when I restart the system all the apps function as they should. However after I put the machine to sleep and then wake it Edge reports the error "Hmm, we can't reach this page.", the store errors with "0x80072EFD", Cortana
 "something went wrong", weather "An error occurred", and news "An error occurred" . I scanned with my anti virus the system is clean. I uninstalled the anti virus and the result is the same. I do not have any proxy settings enabled. Chrome, firefox, internet
 explorer, steam, and skype all connect to the internet just fine. Windows event log does not report any errors regarding this issue&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I generally don't use Edge but the weather app and news app are convenient&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Tried your suggestion and unfortunately the troubleshooter did not find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the problem is being caused by a system used by this group of apps that selects which network adapter to use. After I reboot the machine, the Local Area Connection / Ethernet adapter is correctly selected but when the Ethernet adapter is put in
 low power mode and disconnected during the sleep and woken up that same system determines there is no adapter or is selecting one that was uninstalled or disabled.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Tinker Game on Windows 10 - Games for Windows Live Product - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> averagerelic9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Tinker Game on Windows 10 - Games for Windows Live Product Key Required</h2>
                    <p>I have the best game in the history of mankind, none other than the genius "Microsoft Tinker" installed on my laptop (operating system: Windows 10, 64-bit). Unfortunately, the "Game for Windows Live" forces me to log in and then asks for a "Product Key".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, there is nowhere I can buy a product key. Please help me find a product key or a way around this issue. Had I known I cannot continue to play Microsoft Tinker on Windows 10, I would have never upgraded from Windows 7 (the most beautiful
 and most efficient operating system of all time). I am very close to forcing a factory reset on my laptop with the hope that I can play my absolute favorite game of all time, Microsoft Tinker again. This game is so amazing that I have no words to describe
 how much I loved and enjoyed playing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imagine Mr. Bill Gates comes to your office and asks you "I want to play Microsoft Tinker on Windows 10, how can I do it? And oh, by the way, I need this done today!". Please don't tell me that you wouldn't solve the problem for him. I expect you to treat
 me the same way. I am willing to pay multiples of the price for the game to be able to play it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not reply with any generic troubleshooting methods and do not refer me to other so called related threads or discussions on similar topics. I have done an exhaustive research on the topic and no solutions have been posted so far. Based on the replies
 to other questions, I have almost no hope of finding a solution here. I have tried chatting with multiple assistants from Microsoft online and via phone and no one has even gotten close to remotely being helpful. Posting this question is the only thing I had
 not tried yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I highly respect everyone at Microsoft and really look forward to the moment I can play their best creation, Microsoft Tinker, once again (and then never stop!).</p>

            Hi AverageRelic9,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Was the game running earlier without product code or has this problem surfaced all of a sudden?

            The game worked fine on Windows 7. I remember back then, I had purchased the game, but I'm not sure where from or if they gave me a product key for it or if it was automatically entered when i opened the game to play. All I need right now is a valid product
 key for the game to enter and play. The other problem is that I'm not sure if I was using Windows 7 today, would the game still work or it has completely been discontinued. Now, since all the game files are on my computer and the game opens and I can even
 go to level 01 page on each set, I'm sure there's a way to get around the product key problem and play it. Please help me find a way. Thank you.

            <p>Could you explain what you are trying to do. Do you want to make a backup of personal files only or make a new system image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to make a system image you will need to use file history in desktop mode. Search File History and choose the one with the screen not the one with the gear next to it</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to make a file back up only you first need to enable file history and select the drive you want to make it too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I usually recommend making a separate partition for your files that way you can restore the image if you need to and it will leave the current files as is. You can use file history to back them up to, I do.&nbsp;IT may&nbsp;not make sense because you will have
 3 backups but you really don't</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, you have a file history backup and an image. The file history data gets lost or ruined and you need to reimage the PC Now&nbsp;when you use the image it will overwrite the old data and you have no current backup data&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Screensavers being deleted when downloaded from specific website.</h2>
                    I download screensavers from newfreescreensavers.com&nbsp; My McAfee security says the site is safe.&nbsp; They will stay on my screensavers program until I got back into the program.&nbsp; If leave it alone it runs the downloaded screensaver.&nbsp; The screensavers go into
 my control panel, but when I try to delete them it says that they are already deleted.&nbsp; I let McAfee support go onto my computer remotely and they said it is not them.&nbsp; I am running Windows Insider Builds and I have left several feedbacks for them and gotten
 no response.&nbsp; If it is my Insider Build I am going to quit it.&nbsp; But I want to make sure.&nbsp; I ride downloading with Edge, Chrome, and Explorer and it does the same thing.

            Good day! I apologize that you are having this issue and I am hoping we can work through it and fix it.
<br />
<br />Just to make sure it's not actually mcafee, I would go into a clean boot of your PC:
<br />Clean boot: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />After that, disable mcafee from running as well as any other anti-virus software, then download the screensaver. 
<br />
<br />The only thing that would be auto-deleting files is a virus scanning utility putting it in quarantine more than likely. Check your recycling bin.

            Hi Taylor.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we have solved many problems over the years by having them uninstalled.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />2) Run a full scan with the most powerful on-demand free scanner Malwarebytes: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.
<br />
<br />Then check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you want to keep Malwarebytes as an on-demand scanner then you can disable its Real Time trial version in it's Settings &gt; Accounts tab.  
<br />
<br />3) If you cannot uninstall the screensavers in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, then go into C:\Program Files to find the program's folder, take ownership and delete it:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks, Greg for answering me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the malware program and ran it.&nbsp; There were 62 items quarantined.&nbsp; I tried to run the SFC \SCANNOW but it won't run.&nbsp; My account is listed as an administrator.&nbsp; I tried right clicking on the command prompt to run as administrator but it still
 won't run.&nbsp; I tried to download the screensaver and it downloads but I no longer have a screensaver program. Now, what do I do?</p>
