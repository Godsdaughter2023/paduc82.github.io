<h2>            Server returned error&#58; &#34;Login to your account via a web browser to verify your account.&#34;-Outlook blocking POP retrieval or forwarding by Gmail</h2>
                    <p><strong>Server returned error: "Login to your account via a web browser to verify your account</strong>."</p>
<p>Outlook blocking POP retrieval or forwarding by Gmail.<br />
<br />
POP worked before the migration of Outlook. Suddenly, one cannot setup this POP mail retrieval of Outlook (Hotmail) to Gmail. &nbsp;In other words, in the past, one was able to configure Gmail so it would retrieve Hotmail email.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Using the default settings in Gmail no longer works, neither does the custom server configuration as shown in the Outlook.com POP settings.<br />
<br />
The issue is that Outlook.com is blocking Google Gmail's authentication. A history in Outlook's recent activity shows the attempt to sync but Outlook.com is blocking it. There is no way of changing this even after "verifying your account". The setting in Outlook.com
 is ENABLE for POP forwarding.<br />
<br />
This is another frustrating bug in Outlook.com. I mean, Look at this forum, you can't even compose or edit a message without microsoft garbling the text. The final post doesn't reflect the post when using in another browser after you edited it. The other of
 course if that filters aren't working in Outlook, but that's already been discussed with no solution. Please inform Microsoft Outlook engineers of these issues.</p>

    <title>Outlook POP3 Settings Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karim434  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook POP3 Settings Problem</h2>
                    <p>I use Microsoft Outlook on my desktop to download and send E-Mails through my old Hotmail account. This has suddenly stopped working (following the mandatory conversion to Office 365).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing the settings to: outlook.office365.com (port 995) and&nbsp;smtp.office365.com (port 587). That didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the old Windows Live settings: pop3.live.com (port 995) and smtp.live.com (port 25). That works for the outgoing server, but not the incoming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not very good at this sort of thing, and would really value some help from anybody who knows how to solve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Karim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my outlook.com email accounts had the changeover a few days ago.&nbsp; [Hotmail, outlook.com, ... - the MS email systems&nbsp;are all the same apart from their names]</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set up Outlook 2007&nbsp;for the new system very easily &amp; quickly.&nbsp; I don't know what Palcouk means by
<em>limited options</em> as everything is working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; The first thing you have to do is, if you have the Outlook Hotmail connector installed, remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; Go online and log in to your email account [webmail] - in other words, ignore Outlook 2007 for a moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; Click on the icon for account settings [the gearwheel] then, in the items listed on the left-hand side,&nbsp;select the POP entry.&nbsp; It used to look like this</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a092621-7b57-44d3-aa1e-efba8ade08f5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a092621-7b57-44d3-aa1e-efba8ade08f5" /></a></p>
<p>But now looks like this [notice that the title bar now says Outlook Email]</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c46e5d2c-fdc6-4570-9b47-d9003a77cb6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c46e5d2c-fdc6-4570-9b47-d9003a77cb6a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; It initially had default setting <em>Let apps and devices use POP</em> - <em>
No</em> so I changed that to <em>Yes </em>and saved the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5&nbsp; I then logged out and returned to Outlook 2007 on my computer.&nbsp; I went to Tools, Accounts, Email, &lt;select the relevant email account&gt;, Repair, Next and let it run through its test &amp; adjustment procedure.&nbsp; The account then started working correctly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6&nbsp; I have not set in the new pop &amp; smtp settings shown in the screenshot above.&nbsp; I still have pop3.live.com &amp; smtp.live.com and [in More settings, Advanced] I still have pop 995, SSL, SMTP 25, encryption TLS.&nbsp; I'll leave them alone until problems occur or
 I'll set up a new email account entry in Outlook 2007 using the newly recommended settings and see how they behave.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>7&nbsp; I also had a look at the article <a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/outlookcommigrationinfo.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook.com migration changes - What do I need to know and do</a>&nbsp;but the only difference was that they suggested it would be easier to delete the original Outlook 2007 email account and create a new one instead of just adjusting the existing one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Denis</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Blue screen errors</strong> can be caused by both hardware and software issues. The
<strong>Kernel Security Check failure</strong> error is usually caused by memory issues, virus infections, or compatibility issues. The
<strong>First boot phase</strong> error that you're getting means that there's an issue while the initial settings are applied. See this
<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/resolve-windows-10-upgrade-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for information regarding Windows upgrade process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For possible resolution, we suggest that you refer to <strong>PaulSey...'s</strong> answer in this

<h2>            Microsoft Teams and OneNote</h2>
                    I have noticed that Teams and OneNote keep adding in members, in my case, students, from earlier years. They appear in Teams and in Class Notebook. There is probably about a month or two (haven't really timed it) before they reappear after I have deleted
 them. Note that I delete them from both Teams and OneNote. I have a shared ownership with another teacher of the classes; I wondering if they are being synced back from this teacher. Thanks if you can help.

<p>Hello BanksyDownUnder,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Teams keeps adding in members issue, my thought is, may be there’s someone added these student back to Class Team. By searching, I found that Team members can add other members to a
<strong>public team, </strong>you can view this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/assign-roles-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. If this team isn’t public, according to my test, members can still add other members, but the request will firstly be sent to Team Owner to approve or decline. You may check if there’s any related request email in your Inbox:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8081a893-5065-429c-b7f6-8b50226e92ba?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8081a893-5065-429c-b7f6-8b50226e92ba?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I suggest you may need to run
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Audit log</a>&nbsp;(or conact admin to help you) to see if there’s any Teams related activity in these days:
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a68b3de-a706-4ea7-a11c-9dea59012f75?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a68b3de-a706-4ea7-a11c-9dea59012f75?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi Anna; thanks for your reply. I am almost 100% certain that students wouldn't be adding students from past years back. It is happening across all classes. The conversation in Teams says that 'student A and sixteen others joined the team' (I won't put
 their actual name in).

<p>Hello BanksyDownUnder,</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. Have you run the Office 365 Audit log? Usually, if there an unexpected behavior or activity, we firstly recommend customer to check the logs, this feature have many activity conditions
 related with Teams so admin can choose from and check details. May I know if there’s also not any related activities listed after run Audit log?</p>

<p>Hello BanksyDownUnder,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To look into this issue, we need to collect related log to analyze the team activities, without which it is hard to locate the root cause. We are sorry for the inconvenience this issue caused to your work,
 and would like to collect following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. A full screenshot of “<em>student A and sixteen others joined the team</em>” symptom including the most recent time and date it happened.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Generally, if someone added a member, the notification in Class team will display
<em>“*** has added *** to the team</em>”. Please login Teams Web Version and check whether this team is private or public:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0db5abd1-2144-4198-bc10-862b6048f48c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0db5abd1-2144-4198-bc10-862b6048f48c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Please confirm with one of these added members about how he was added back to a specific team. Is it that someone share the team link with him to let him join in?</p>
<p>4. Please involve your Office 365 admin and let him run Office audit log to see one Team activities, such adding member activities can be found by audit log and then we can see the detailed information about
 it. If there’s no related activities, issue may be related with server side. Could you please share the activities information (if any) with me in Private Messages:

<p>My tab is there in every documents I create, no matter which templates they are based in. If I delete the tab from Normal.dotm, it disapears from all docs and templates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to save a tab to only&nbsp;a specific template?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>João</p>

<br />
Respectfully, I disagree. It is true to say that they can't be saved to a template through the User Interface of Word. They can be saved by editing XML. See http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/Customize_Ribbon.htm. This is certainly beyond the effort expectations of
 most Word users and is unreasonable compared to the ease of customizations in earlier versions of Word, but it can be done. http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/Customize_Ribbon.htm<br />

                    I've had a zune since the beginning and gone through at least three. I haven't had a computer for the last five years and I have been updating my zune as a guest on others computers. I now have my own laptop with zune on it. It shows my zune is linked
 to my account and everything works except connecting zune to microsoft. I can't get zune pass or anything then I see that i'm supposed to pay for something to make iy work? Not cool. I have to pay 30 bucks just to connect and then puchase a music pass? Why
 make us pay twice? I will still use my zune but screw your 30 dollar software just so we can spend more money on music. Can you fix this and make me a customer again?&nbsp;

                    I have exchange, gmail and iCloud email accounts that were all working fine on my Mac Outlook 365 until the latest updates. &nbsp;Now, the iCloud account returns a message that I cannot log in. &nbsp;I've triple checked passwords and been in contact with Apple.
 &nbsp;No fix, so referred back to Microsoft. Is anyone else having this issue?

<p>Hi Knar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the private message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, there is a workaround to fix this issue. You need use the <span style="font-weight: bold">
App Password</span> to instead of your iCloud account's password. Please follow the below steps to try again:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Delete</span><span> the iCloud account on the Outlook for Mac client.</span></li><li><span>Login to the iCloud web server: </span><span><a href="https://www.icloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.icloud.com/</a>&nbsp;</span><span>with your Apple ID and password.
</span></li><li><span>Choose</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> Settings</span><span>, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Manage</span><span> under </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Apple ID</span><span>, and then type your Apple ID and password again.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;You need check if you open the 2-step authentication. If so, clicking </span>
</span></li><li><span>Add your iCloud account back to Outlook client: type the email address with _@icloud.com and use this
<strong>App password</strong> as the password, and then </span><span>click</span><span>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Add</span><span>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>May I confirm this way can be worked for you? Please feel free to let us know at your convenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Michelle, thank you very much for taking the trouble to help.</p>
<p>The issue was browser agnostic, and I did clear cookies &amp; cache. I did not need to check the server status as, eventually, Microsoft tech support identified that it was a system-wide issue, and overnight it has been fixed.</p>
<p>Again, many thanks.</p>

            If you obtained the software through your school, it would probably be best to ask the school about the issue.

    <title>LG G4 email attachments not downloading or even opening - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dt85  say:</h3>
<h2>            LG G4 email attachments not downloading or even opening</h2>
                    <p>I have a &lt;5 month old LG G4. Shortly after the most recent update that was pushed to my phone I cannot download email attachments, regardless of extension. PDFs and XLS are what I most commonly need to download and save to my device. I called my provider,
 they were useless, I called the retailer who sold me the phone, they didn't help, I called Microsoft Canada, they said since I can get the attachments on my pc browser it wasn't their issue. I called LG Canada and after 45 minutes they said they weren't sure
 what the problem was so I sent it away. It has come back (7 days later) and was supposed to be fixed and it still doesn't work. I've tried opening it on the native email app, and on the outlook app but attachments won't download. Any suggestions or thoughts?

            It looks like there have been updates that were pushed and seems to fix the problem. Hopefully your issue is fixed as well Chris. Good luck!

    <title>Make An Existing Word 2007 Form Fillable - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Make An Existing Word 2007 Form Fillable</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just received a new form that was created in Word format, but whenever I try to type text in the fill lines, the lines themselves begin to move with each press of the keyboard, and it causes subsequent lines to move also - thereby, screwing up the whole
 form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This form looks as if it was created to print and fill by hand. I tried using the developer tab to add text boxes, etc., where the fill lines are, but the text boxes themselves screw up the original format as well by pushing adjacent text / lines out of
 their original intended places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, I can't figure out how to type text on the fill lines without destroying the original formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried saving the form as a PDF, but my free reader (Tracker Software) does not offer an editable text option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only other option is to upload the PDF to an online service that permits adding text to fill lines, but these forms are of a sensitive nature and I am concerned about privacy.</p>

            <p>As you say, the form was almost certainly not designed to be filled on a computer. &nbsp;As a result you have three choices:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Print it out and fill it in by hand</li><li>Use CTRL+a and then CTRL+c to copy the form and then in the header of a new document, use Paste&gt;Special to paste it as an image and set it to appear behind the text, resizing it as required, and then after exiting from the Header\Footer Pane, subject your
 self to the fiddly process of inserting text in the required places by adjusting the space before\after paragraphs</li><li>Create a new form from scratch.</li></ol>

<p>Thanks, Doug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like I don't much options outside of finding and downloading an open-source pdf editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for option two, I'm not completely sure if I understand your instructions. Are you saying that I should make a new form from copied and pasted parts? The header is slightly bigger than Word's preset parameters for what it's worth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm computer literate, and I took a course in Office 2007 some years back, but creating fillable forms sounds daunting.</p>

    <title>Save as in Word 2016 from Word 2010 Results in Empty File - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyberamazon54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Save as in Word 2016 from Word 2010 Results in Empty File</h2>
                    <p>I am getting Word 2010 files from another member in my team, but I am using Word 2016. When I do a Save As to give this file a new name (so that I can retain the original file in the workflow), two things are happening.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I get a repeated Save As window popping up. I key a new file name and select a new folder location, click Save... process repeats, and it just won't STOP!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, my new file/location can be found in Windows Explorer, but when I open the file, it contains a single blank page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is happening and how can I overcome this issue? Thanx in advance for any help!</p>

            <p>I've actually encountered this with 2010-format documents where I had inserted text from 2003-format documents. I had to save the new document in the old 2003-format otherwise the Save As dialogue kept showing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My theory is that something from the old documents couldn't be converted properly into the new file format. Is there any Smart art in the original document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you convert the document to the new file format before you hit the Save as? I know that if you don't Word converts it when you save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you perhaps make a copy of the document before opening it? Would that solve the issue for you (even though it is not the way it should be)?</p>

            <p>Nette, TYSM for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No SmartArt in document. Some balloon shapes used as call-out tips in the doc. This document has only three pages. I am not seeing anything that I think should be unusual in the contents. Mostly text but with a few JPG inserts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried saving a copy of the file before opening. I have converted the document before saving. "Maintain compatibility with previous versions of Word" is checked in the Save As window. I am choosing "Save as type:" to be "Word Document (*.docx)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I actually did was make a copy of the file and then rename it to what I need it to be now and moving it into a different folder before opening it. I have clicked "Save" (Ctrl + S) a few times while making my revisions to the file, and even then, I have
 had to deal with a repetitious pop-up Save window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing is working. Sitting here... aGAIN... watching the Save As window pop up repeatedly. And this time, the Save As window popped up AFTER I had done a Save, so I didn't even initiate that one! Word is working alone in this! LOL!</p>

            <p>I could not roll back to Windows 7, however I found this great info that helped me restore Microsoft money 2004. Sounded risky but I took the chance &amp; it worked! Windows 10 still operating smoothly.</p>

            <p>Seems that a lot of us were not considered.&nbsp; I use Money 2007 and have the same problem.&nbsp; Tried changing registry form 9.11.10240.16384 dropping the last digit as advised in both the Version and W2KVersion, but it did not work.&nbsp; Noticed that there is a svcVersion
 11.0110240.16384.&nbsp; Should that be changed to 9.11.10240.16384?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a clue how to contact Microsoft and have them respond with a fix since so many users are still using Money.&nbsp; It still is the best financial program around.&nbsp; Microsoft goofed in not continuing it and promoting it.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the instructions at</p>
<p><a href="https://microsoftmoneyoffline.wordpress.com/2015/07/28/windows-10-compatibility-with-microsoft-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://microsoftmoneyoffline.wordpress.com/2015/07/28/windows-10-compatibility-with-microsoft-money/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there have been some reports that Money only opened once after the registry edit, but that updates from Microsoft on Aug 11 or 12 (normal once per month updates) fixed that problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it was generous of MS to release Money Sunset Plus, which didn't require validation, but Money was last sold in June of 2009 and online services and assisted support ended on January 31, 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd recommend that you try Quicken or another personal finance program and run it side by side with Money for a while to get used to it. At some point, Money will die, be unrepairable and leave you stranded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don</p>

<p>yes it will not work, I rolled back to Windows 7 from windows 10 then it worked again.</p>
<p>the roll back to Windows 7 took about 20 minutes </p>

<p>Update Update</p>
<p>I was going to do the registry&nbsp; alteration that has been suggested in these forums but I had to re download windows 10 as I had rolled back to windows 7.</p>
<p>the new download installed and would you believe it Microsoft Money 2004 UK edition worked fine
</p>
<p>WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING TO THE REGISTRY</p>
<p>
</p><p>they must have done something in the newer download </p>

</p><p>I actually had decided to refresh windows and installed latest kb.&nbsp;&nbsp; Videos and youtube now play in ie and edge.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have a new finding.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have soundblaster sound card and connect to soundbar on SPDIF.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soundbar is connected to SPDIF, suppose to output on digital output, but always&nbsp;output on speaker even there is nothing connected to speaker connectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 now I&nbsp;noticed if SPDIF is set to default device in windows audio, the same&nbsp;youtube will show the same black screen,&nbsp; when speakers is set to default device&nbsp;videos will play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know this is a bug with creative or ie.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not happen to chrome.&nbsp;

<h2>            Outlook 2007 - To Do List Displaying &#34;Cannot Display Folder&#34;</h2>
                    Win 7 - Home Premium - So all of a sudden, my To Do List in Outlook 2007 errors with "Cannot Display Folder."&nbsp; All other aspects of Outlook 2007 seem to be working.&nbsp; I'm also getting the following synchronization error:

            <p>After a day and a half of self-trouble-shooting with the help of web links, I resolved my issue but not after backing up all my outlook files, both data and structure files.&nbsp; What I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; - Several SCANPST.EXE runs on both the Outlook.PST and the Archive.PST files.&nbsp; More than once is needed to fully resolve all errors.&nbsp; I did 4 runs each.&nbsp; To No Avail.&nbsp; It didn't correct my specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) - Thought mailbox size might be an issue so I archive anything older than 12/31/13.&nbsp; To No Avail.&nbsp; It didn't correct my specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) - Tried several of the command line switches including:</p>
<p>Cleanreminders, Cleanviews, ResetToDoBar - To No Avail.&nbsp; It didn't correct my specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) - Tried the&nbsp; MFCMAPI.exe - To No Avail.&nbsp; It didn't correct my specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) - Deleted all old reminders/appointments - After doing a refresh on each.&nbsp; Someone suggested displaying each and then hitting ESC cleared their problem&nbsp; which was related to mine.</p>
<p>To No Avail.&nbsp; It didn't correct my specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) - Renamed my Outlook.pst and Archive.pst files, copied them to an external hard drive and reloaded a copy of each that I made on 2/8/14.&nbsp; To No Avail.&nbsp; It didn't correct my specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) - Tried building a new profile - To No Avail.&nbsp; It didn't correct my specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) - Finally as I was preparing to do a Clean Install, I copied all my *.OST files to an external hard drive and then deleted them from my Outlook directory.&nbsp; I then launched Outlook and guess what?</p>
<p>My can't display folder error disappeared along with all my reminders reappearing.&nbsp; Suddenly everything is working again.&nbsp; It took all of less than 5 minutes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Editorial:&nbsp; While I dearly love Microsoft and their products, and the value that the Microsoft Community provides,&nbsp;after spending 40 years in&nbsp;a Customer Service Organization for a Fortune 500 Transportation&nbsp;Company, I'm truly appalled that Microsoft does
 not have a one-stop, end all, be all, "FREE" problem resolution center for people like me who have now lost approximately 20 hours of my life which will never be reclaimed trying to FIX a single product problem that vanished as quickly as it appeared with
 the deletion of 10 files.&nbsp; Perhaps Bill Gates can undertake this assignment with his return to Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you to "bxcrwlly". I've been working on this for a month. While my problem was slightly different, I was able to utilize what was tried by "bxcrwlly".</p>
<p>I had two copies of my Outlook.pst file in the same folder. Once I verified that they were the same file and did a safety backup, I eleted the copied file and after a re-boot of Outlook, everything worked as it once did. I agree with the "Editorial form
 bxcrwlly".</p>

<h2>            Computer Freezing my Powerpoint Presentation</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 and using the newest PowerPoint program by Microsoft. &nbsp;I need the Slide show to plan continuously 27/7. &nbsp;I am using a new computer and periodically the PowerPoint presentation stops running and the task bar pulls up with no real
 explanation why. &nbsp;I have disconnected the computer from the internet turned off every notification and auto update I can think of and this keeps happening. &nbsp;I have the presentation set to loop and it is playing as a PowerPoint player. &nbsp;

<h2>            Excel 2011 Save As tab delimited txt file with quotation marks</h2>
                    How do I get a tab delimited txt file from Excel 2011 that lacks the quotation marks around each entry within the txt file? Do I need to use another program to strip the quotation marks from the txt file?

            I've just found a better fix. Take the tab delimited txt file created by Excel that has the quotations marks at the beginning and end of every LastName, FirstName and open it in TextEdit. Then use TextEdit to Find each quotation mark and replace all with
 a delete. Save the file and use that saved file in the AppleScript script.

<p>
</p><p>This ain't no social nicey-nicey discussion.&nbsp; This is bleeding serious and if straightforward answers aren't provided here to keep this from escalating into a bigger problem than it already is&nbsp;it will become a headache and pain in the butt for me and very

            <p>Yes, that may have been too harsh toward the moderator that made that decision.&nbsp; Or moderators, if it was a team decision.&nbsp; I'm afraid this whole business has me a bit on edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details?&nbsp; I can do that, but I have to walk a fine line here, because this happened right smack in the middle of another rather difficult situation that may also have legal edges to it.&nbsp; That Microsoft plumped themselves into the middle of that is just bad
 luck for them.&nbsp; This whole business has become quite complicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the exchange of email correspondence this involves is with our group's registrar and the email message that I sent, that then had that '<strong>something</strong>' stuck into it had this line -- and I think I have to provide the full sentence, because
 context shows you that I was not referring to an actual letter or package -- this line:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Sending private information via regular post or Federal Express is one thing, but to demand the use of email transmission, which is far from secure, and placing a deadline of three days is unconscionable.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So that is the sentence that triggered the next event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just after I sent that email letter to the registrar I see that I have some kind of FedEx text box that reads like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Where's your package?</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Track your package at FedEx</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">It looks like the tracking number is 201403040819.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a little image of a truck before the first line; the second line is in a purple style font, a little large; and there's a bogus tracking number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that is all nonsense, isn't it?&nbsp; That one sentence in which I used the vocabulary "Federal Express" indicates nothing about my actually using FedEx.&nbsp; And I don't refer to that company anywhere else in the letter and not even anything further related
 to regular mail.&nbsp; And certainly nothing about packages or anything about needing to track anything, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">There is also a link to FedEx within that '<strong>something</strong>' and I want to indicate that I think that is all some tricky kind of advertisement for FedEx dressed up as a public service type of thing.&nbsp; But I suppose that
 Microsoft will state what they did was supposed to be a sort of special service for me.&nbsp; And you, if it happens to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then we have this from a spokesperson I am assuming is authorized to speak for Microsoft, and I am quoting from an IBT article from early 2013.&nbsp; (I don't know if I am allowed to put the link to the article here.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">A spokesperson for Waggener Edstrom Worldwide, which handles Microsoft’s press, emailed the following statements regarding Outlook vs. Gmail, taken from Microsoft's Scroogled.com website:</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">“Outlook.com only scans the contents of your email to help protect you and display, categorize and sort your mail appropriately,” the statement said. “Just like the postal service sorts and scans mail and packages
 for dangerous explosives and biohazards, Outlook.com scans your mail to help prevent spam, gray mail, phishing scams, viruses, malware and other dangers and annoyances.”</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Finally, according to Microsoft, here is what Outlook doesn’t do:</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">“Outlook.com does not go through the contents of your sent and received email messages in order to display targeted ads. ... Outlook.com does not go through the contents of your incoming email from other email
 service for the purpose of targeting ads. ... Outlook.com does not through the contents of your entire inbox for the purpose of targeting ads.”</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So what happened to me clearly falls into the opposite of what they have told us.&nbsp; Microsoft's software
<strong><em>did</em></strong> use content to then input a targeted '<strong>something</strong>' into my email message.&nbsp; And I want it clear here, that '<strong>something</strong>' is in the message, between the subject line and the body of the letter.&nbsp; It is
 actually <strong><em>in</em></strong> the message.&nbsp; I've never seen anything like that in some ten years of using this company's products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then one must consider that now FedEx has some part of my email message on one of their servers, because Microsoft didn't come up with that tracking number, right?&nbsp; That is the job of FedEx.&nbsp; So now we consider that some part of my email message was sent
 from the Microsoft computer to a second company -- FedEx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You reckon the terms of agreement include something like Microsoft can send any part of the content of an email message in our inbox to another commercial entity?&nbsp; I seriously would doubt it.&nbsp; That wouldn't be just a can of worms, it would be like a whole
 field of worms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there it is.&nbsp; Any questions?&nbsp; Anyone. </p>

            <p>So about 11 hours ago, my morning, I plopped myself down with some of that old style equipment some might remember as the pen and paper and was trying to figure out what I was going to ask in this thread.&nbsp; My notes basically are indicating I was wondering
 how long I should wait for an answer here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this evening, my time, I decide to do something about those thoughts from this morning, but first I checked my email account and !Wow! a SURPRISE!!&nbsp; Billy Gates and his Microsoft gang weren't ignoring me at all.&nbsp; I should be ashamed of myself for thinking
 they were.&nbsp; Here is the copy of a so sweet message of concern they sent me on the 15th, my time.</p>
<p>

</p><p>So folks, how sweet is that&nbsp;of Billy and his gang?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I may be so bold, though, there does seem to be one small, teeny-tiny small problem.&nbsp; The ball was already in your court, Microsoft.&nbsp; I suspect the line judge would rule the email message y'all hit back to me was over the line -- a foul.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you try a second serve, please?&nbsp; Be careful.&nbsp; Second foul and I think you lose points.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I have been asked to look into why the topic title that is the focus of the letter from Microsoft is different from the topic title of this thread.</p>
<p><br />
Firstly, I'd like to thank the person that brought that to my attention.&nbsp; I was in a hurry on the evening of the 19th, my time, and had not noticed the difference.</p>
<p><br />
Besides the problem of my not paying proper attention to that detail, there is the problem that Microsoft sent that letter for a thread that had already been deleted.&nbsp; That was the first thread on the same subject, but it was not in the proper sub-forum and
 I deleted it in favor of the thread we now have here.&nbsp; I obviously wouldn't know why Microsoft's software sent me a letter focusing my attention on a thread that no longer existed, but I assume that was just a glitch in their system.</p>
<p><br />
Then my brain glitched because I jumped to the conclusion the letter had to be about the only thread up on the topic.&nbsp; I didn't pay close enough attention to details.&nbsp; I hope y'all will excuse me for that error.</p>
<p><br />
And this discovery means I need to turn back the clock to my notes on the morning of the 19th, my time.</p>
<p><br />
I have to again wonder how long is long enough when waiting for an explanation from Microsoft about why their actions do not match their words.</p>
<p><br />
The ad from Microsoft last year aired on television screens and other devices that is of particular concern to what happened to me here in 2014 contains this line of text as the ket point of contention:</p>
<strong>"We don't go through your email to sell ads."</strong></p>
<p><br />
My case makes that statement from Microsoft completely and unequivocally false!</p>
<p><br />
They <em>did</em> go through my email message and zeroed in on the words FederalExpress and then placed an ad inside my email message.</p>
<p><br />
I want to emphasize that again -- the ad was placed <em>inside</em> my email message.&nbsp; Possibly y'all would like to see a screenshot?&nbsp; I'd have to blank out certain private information to be able to post the screenshot, but why would that even be necessary?&nbsp;
 Microsoft knows they do it.&nbsp; They can't possibly state that my case is a glitch and I am the only one that has been targeted in this manner.</p>
<p><br />
And I sure hope Microsoft isn't going to try and insult our intelligence by stating that is not an ad.</p>
<p><br />
So why can't we see a response from Microsoft explaining what's up?&nbsp; Right here, where the problem has been brought to light.</p>
<p><br />
Why hasn't any member of the Moderation Team asked Microsoft to respond here?&nbsp; I can't believe we cannot find cases throughout these forums where some Moderation Team member or one of those
<em>other</em> team members indicated they would use their influence or connections to focus a Microsoft employee's attention to a given problem.</p>
<p><br />
Maybe the members of the special-status groups/teams here feel this isn't a worthy issue?&nbsp; That I am just blowing smoke up everyone's you-know-what.</p>
<p><br />
Well, if you are not part of the solution, you might be part of the problem.</p>
<p><br />
By the way, I also think that false advertising is against the law.&nbsp; And I think that one has been on the books for a few decades.&nbsp; So if Federal Express paid Microsoft to allow Federal Express to put a link to their company and that bogus tracking number in
 my email message, then it is advertising for Federal Express and that makes the claim of not going through our email to sell ads a real whopper!</p>
<p><br />
Folks, this just can't be allowed to stand.&nbsp; There is strength in numbers and if we don't climb off of Apathy Mountain and start making these Internet companies follow some rules of good behaviour the Internet companies are just going to keep pushing and pushing
 and soon these companies will be able to do just about anything they wish.&nbsp; The lawmakers don't seem to give a hoot, so maybe we need to do the hooting ourselves for our own protection.&nbsp; Do you really want to pass these sorts of problems along to your children
 so <em>they</em> have to go up against the millions of dollars these companies have to beat down us poor common folk?&nbsp; Is that fair to your children?</p>

<p>Geez, seriously, man you need to chill it down a few levels. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a rest with the children sorting things out, that is a bit out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Playing nice with others in the playground would get you a lot further, then the strike and attack mode.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your extreme level is way too high, chill it down a FEW degrees.&nbsp; Think big bag of ice times 10 and then you are on the right track.&nbsp; Pounding a big stick to get attention will cause all to tune out.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post the screenshot you mentioned earlier, then we can see what you have been going on about, otherwise you are just spewing hot air.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let's see what the fuss is all about and chill a bit.</p>

            <p>I have blocked what I think can be a problem for privacy concerns for the company to which this letter was&nbsp;sent as well as information about myself and another person noted in the letter.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that folks don't think this is some sort of trick and is not real.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if the Microsoft company wishes to see the correspondence without the information blocked out so they can see for themselves this is no trick, I have no problem with that and will so inform all parties involved in that bit of business.&nbsp; I view this
 as important enough to force that other company's hand on this and if they wish to take me to court over that permission being granted to Microsoft, too bad.&nbsp; They screwed up rather badly themselves, so if they want that dragged into court fine by me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to again point out one of my posts above&nbsp;where I&nbsp;quoted the line&nbsp;that most likely&nbsp;triggered this whole mess.&nbsp; You won't see that line in the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might also state again that the ad only shows when I view that email correspondence and not when it is sent to someone else.&nbsp; The ad is just targeting me.&nbsp; And I checked that just a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh yes, never mind that "tracking number" because it is bogus.&nbsp; That's no privacy issue there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshot and it has a timestamp:</p>

<p>The &nbsp;screenshot shows a real message, not a fake one,&nbsp; so I feel Microsoft should tell us why they are doing this after they advertised there are no ads.&nbsp; Can't have it both ways, Microsoft, either you are or are not doing this.&nbsp; Time to let us know why
 they are showing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know where the FedEx link will take me, please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you considered doing another test email and include FedEx in a sentence &nbsp;to see if it happens again?&nbsp; I think it would be a good idea to try.&nbsp;

</p><p>You will see that I tried to show the connection to the "ad" in the email.&nbsp; I might also include at this time the information that I have not yet contacted Federal Express to ask about this fake tracking number and what part they have in this, but I am going
 to.&nbsp; This is not just a Microsoft matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea about testing the use of FedEx in another email message seems like a good idea, but right now time is an issue.&nbsp; I'll get to that idea a little later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea in your first paragraph that Microsoft has to/should answer to this situation I will also address later.</p>

            <p>About Microsoft, though, I think I had better post here that two events with my email account have taken place in the past few days or so, the second just a short time ago, that some could make the case that I am being harrassed by some employee or employees
 at the company.&nbsp; Of course, I have screenshots and the last event just a few minutes ago is/was really weird.&nbsp; The first a few days ago I will be asking about when I have time, but it was not as weird as the lastest incident.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, both incidents can be brushed off by Microsoft executives as just nonsense worries&nbsp;on my part, but as I have been keeping detailed records of all my accounts for a number of years and neither of the incidents have happened in the past -- well, weird
 is the best choice of vocabulary at this time.&nbsp; If some employee has taken it upon themselves to harrass me, I would appreciate it if it would stop.&nbsp; I am quite sure the executives would not approve of such actions as it really does leave a bad image after
 it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is all some really strange coincidence, I'll apologize up front for being suspicious.&nbsp; But I will state again that I do have the screenshots, so it is not my imagination.&nbsp; And the first incident a few days ago, which did generate an emailed response
 from Microsoft happened in front of a person that felt right off it was harrassment.&nbsp; I can't help what that person felt or how that person might relate the incident to his reading audience.&nbsp; I asked him to keep quiet about it, but he wasn't happy with that
 request.&nbsp; As I have already stated, I'm going to ask about it here in a new thread&nbsp;when I have the time.</p>
