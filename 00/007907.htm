<p>Hi Fullerru,</p>
<p>I am doing exactly the same thing right now but with Word 2007. If what you are trying to do is the same then you can find the instructions for Word 2003 here:<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2125459_create-custom-screen-tip-microsoft.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2125459_create-custom-screen-tip-microsoft.html</a></p>

    <title>How to create a shared cloud for multiple accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ofer kleiner  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to create a shared cloud for  multiple accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have recently raised a small business company and decided to work via the office365 and one drive cloud.</p>
<p>all our "office" is on the cloud as well on our laptops.</p>
<p>we are 2 users - each one has it's own account and password; and therefore each one of us has it's own cloud / one drive = 1TB under his license</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to have/ create a common / shared area on the cloud in that way when we create a folder/ file, we both will be ale to access it (any one with his own account) and have a full control....edit, save, delete etc....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that possible? we will be good also if only part of the 1TB of each onedrive from both of the users will be allocated for this purpose...like 250GB of each one that will give us in total 500GB shared resource.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea is to manage our work like we have a local physical server so then anyone in the organization whom has permission can access this "server" on the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>Ofer</p>

<h2>            htcs620 and outlook synchronise</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I hope someone can help. I have an htcs620 and a desktop running outlook 2007 under XP. I have loaded Activsync, but then my problems start. I am not given the option of choosing MS Outlook to sync with, instead I chose contacts and calendar.
 Then Activsync goes straight into trying to sync with the HTC. After an hr it is still trying to sync, so I abort and nothing is being syncd. I delete and reload Activsync and try again - same story.
</p>
<p>What is going on? Is it that my first sync takes a long time or am I doing something wrong? I had no probs with my sony ericsson sync, and that worked very quickly 1st time. S why cant I get this to work?</p>
<p>thnx in anticipation</p>

            For dragging you need to hold the area in Title bar where your title is appearing or login name is appearing (means the area where no button / commands are appearing in the title bar) Dragging from other places is not supported.

<p>
</p><p>After seeing the multitude of similar complaints about the XBox Music experience on WP8, I decided to try to make a single list that summarizes many of the key issues. If you feel strongly about Microsoft correcting this experience, please feel free to add
 a post below. If this list grows at all I will try to keep it updated in the original post.<br />
<br />
Like many other users I am frustrated by the removal of key features that were available and worked properly in the Zune software. Many of the issues below reflect this.
<br />
<br />
If you feel strongly about these issues, please cast your vote to keep Zune (or a re-branded Zune-like substitute) as the media manager for WP8:

<br />
<strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">UPDATE - 1/15/13: </span></strong><br />
<em>Eli M. from Microsoft responded to this thread on Page 23. He thanked us for the support and feedback, and said the team would provide updates as they became available. He announced that the WP Desktop App had a new version, though most users on this thread
 were able to discern no improved functionality. </em><br />

</a></strong></p>
<p>- Device only sorts albums by Name, not Date (WP7 devices sorted albums by date). Can we have an on-device option to choose? Any other sort options (i.e. sort by Album Artist) would also be very useful.
<br />
</p>
<p>- Cannot delete entire folders on phone at once (i.e. delete an entire Album, Artist, etc.) – can only check off and delete individual songs. WP7 did at least allow for the manual deletion of complete albums, playlists, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpmusic/issues-with-xbox-music-on-wp8-podcasts/62860e0d-ffa2-4f41-99e8-68d4e311a620">Podcasts</a></strong></p>
<p>- Few, if any options, for Podcast management. Many podcast features stripped from WP7. Syncing Podcasts is difficult and often does not display in Podcasts section, similar to issues syncing with Playlists.
<br />
</p>
<p>- Not possible to add Podcasts to the Xbox Music+Video hub by RSS url. Used to be able to add to WP7 using the Zune software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Podcast playback position forgotten by device when switching to any other app that uses volume control (i.e. YouTube).&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Occasionally volume control in Podcasts ceases to function (though continues to work in other apps that use volume), requiring a device reboot or other odd workarounds.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpmusic/issues-with-xbox-music-on-wp8-metadata/e47cf2b8-c28f-4e00-a67a-198418dbafbc">Metadata</a><br />
</strong></p>
<p>- <em>"Connect with XBox Music"</em><strong> </strong>option in Settings: if ticked on, this option will often completely overwrite existing user-defined metadata (i.e. album name, artist name, artwork, track listing, etc.) with incorrect info, for instance
 the wrong artist, track names, etc. In some cases it is even splitting albums in multiple parts. There is no option to only fill in missing info, as there was in Zune with WP7.
</p>
<p>(<em>edit: more on this specificly at this </em><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpmusic/why-does-xbox-music-hub-not-respect-metadata-and/9c213044-0c62-45d6-89b1-6010081498c3"><em>thread</em></a>)</p>
<p>- Even with <em>"Connect with XBox Music"</em> option ticked, Album/Artist Artwork often does not download where missing, or wrong artwork is downloaded.
</p>
<p>- WP8 device does not recognize any metadata for Multiple Discs, Song Ratings, Release Date, etc from existing music collections. Albums with multiple discs display tracks in order of 1,1,2,2,3,3, etc. instead of 1,2,3,1,2,3, etc. WP7 usually correctly recognized
 all data, and accurately reflected (synced) metadata between device and PC. <br />

</a>
<div>- "Syncing" functions are very basic - virtually non-existent&nbsp;compared to the rich sync experience in Zune or even iTunes.&nbsp;<br />
<p>- No icon indicating if media is currently on device or not. Have to navigate all the way back to the home screen of the app and click on a whole different subset of folders to see what media is on your device.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>- No manual syncing or management of Playlists. Cannot generate auto-playlists, like in Zune.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- No visible folder hierarchy in navigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Very few options to actually manage media library. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpmusic/issues-with-xbox-music-on-wp8-wp8-desktop-app/0444e5b6-8baf-48b1-ad55-8fde45be23e7">WP8 Desktop App</a></strong></p>
<p>- "Syncing" functions are very basic - virtually non-existent&nbsp;compared to the rich sync experience in Zune or even iTunes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Can transfer Playlists, but they show up empty on device. </p>
<p>- Can only transfer at Artist/Album level, not Song level.</p>
<p>- Nothing to indicate what media is already on device or not.<br />
</p>
<p>- Software needs to scan entire media library every time it is launched.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- If syncing to micro SD card, there is often a bug displaying multiple instances of the same song, even though there should be only one on the device.
<br />
</p>
<p>- UI is totally spartan, lacks any sort of helpful options or organizational tools, such as seeing song ratings (or songs for that matter) and only syncing songs with positive ratings. Cannot use this software to manage actual media library on PC, alter
 metadata, etc. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpmusic/issues-with-xbox-music-on-wp8-subscription/bff78056-b17b-44a5-bfa7-5913e367f308"><strong>Subscription</strong>
</a></p>
<p>- Cannot transfer subscription content from Zune Pass to WP8 device - understood this is because these two systems use different DRM, however re-downloading previous Zune subscription content through XBox Music is a nightmare. XBox Music downloads incorrect
 music, including tracks that were never part of user's library. It also downloads doubles of non-subscription DRM-free songs that are already on user's PC, as well as any songs that the user once had in their subscription folder even if they deleted them long
 ago. <br />
</p>
<p>- WP8 devices don't seem to understand the difference between locally stored content and subscription Cloud content in many instances - music player often stutters while searching for Cloud content, even though the content is stored locally on the WP8 device.
 Other issues include "unable to play" error messages for DRM-free content that should work.
<br />
</p>
<p>- Cannot rate streaming XBox Music content.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp8-wpmusic/slow-music-playback-performance/915dd3e6-9c08-44f8-bbe5-3d57404f5650"><strong>Performance</strong>
</a></p>
<p>- Sluggish delay (approx. 2 seconds) when navigating music library, skipping songs, loading songs, etc. on WP8 device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Huge lag when using Play Music (shuffle all) button on device (or generally when playing large numbers of tracks) - audio plays after 5-10 seconds, but actual device completely locks up (becomes unresponsive to all touch/hardware input) for 30-60 seconds
 before regaining responsiveness. </p>
<p>- When shuffling all (or, again, when playing large numbers of tracks), there is a delay (approx. 2 seconds) when skipping tracks.</p>
<p>- Performance issues seem to be made worse when music is stored and read off of expandable memory (making the addition of expandable memory options to WP8 a fairly useless feature). However issues are still present (to a slightly lesser extent) when reading
 music off of internal device memory. <br />
</p>
<p>- Note that NONE of these performance issues existed on WP7, even when playing the same large number of tracks all at once, and/or using the shuffle all function.

            <p>I support and confirm all of this except for the last two points in the performance section (since I don't see it, but some people do). Sheesh, I didn't even realize multidisc sorting got broken (yet again!) until you mentioned it. So now we have Windows
 Media Player, a specific view in the Zune software (collection&gt;music&gt;songs, sort on album) and WP8 that can't do multidisc sorting of albums properly.</p>
<p>A mention of&nbsp;the <a href="http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions/suggestions/3342058-continue-to-use-zune-for-media-sync-in-wp8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
suggestion</a> to bring back Zune should probably go somewhere, which solves a lot of syncing problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My <u>personal</u> take: Scrap the desktop sync app and make a Zune 5, rebranded if needed to support new Xbox Music. It supports the syncing functions of Zune 4.8 and Windows Phone 7 (so this includes Music, podcasts, videos and auto-backup of camera roll/saved
 pictures/screenshots to the computer,&nbsp;update play counts, update song ratings&nbsp;and WiFi sync).&nbsp;Also have a&nbsp;one-click button to upgrade the DRM/redownload everything in the Subscription folder to match the changes made to Xbox Music.</p>
<p>Sync app for Windows RT is needed. Keep it.</p>
<p>Those who hated Zune still have the option of manual copy/paste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love the expanded selection of music that Xbox Music brought (and yay more artist pictures!) but it's really frustrating to have to remember to download a copy of new music to Zune on my PC and a copy on my phone separately. :(</p>

            Much appreciated on the support. I think your reaction reaffirms my reasoning for creating this thread - that being there are so many individual complaints in separate threads that people are not even aware yet of all the issues together (I'm sure there
 are things I haven't noticed yet either). <br />
<br />
You're probably right on the performance issues - I do believe this may be specific to me or my device (Nokia Lumia 822). I will leave it up for a while and see if anybody responds to those points.
<br />
<br />
Very good point on the suggestion to bring Zune back - I had meant to include that originally but forgot to copy the link.
<br />
<br />
It seems most people are in agreement that the best option would be to simply re-brand the Zune software as XBox Music, and use that as the desktop sync application. I wholeheartedly agree with all your suggestions in your personal take. I don't think anybody
 cares what it is called, as long as it functions just as well as the Zune software. I'll put it this way:<br />
<br />
iPhone users have one piece of software (iTunes) that lets them listen to music, download music, manage their music collections (whether local or cloud), truly sync (not just transfer) media AND playlists with their device, and manage files on their device.
 We used to have this software - it was called Zune. The "replacements" do not even come close to matching the functionality we used to have.

            I'd also add, in regards with XBox Music connection turned on, that not only does it override the artist, album, song metadata, it overrides it with WRONG information at times. &nbsp;Worse case scenario, it incorrectly identifies the artist and/or album name,
 so everything about that album is 100% wrong. &nbsp;And other times it "splits the album in half" because on some songs the artist name is different. &nbsp;Example: &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Artist: &nbsp;Seventh Wonder</div>
<div>Album: Mercy Falls</div>
<div>Contains Tracks 1 - 15.</div>
<div><br />
<div>XBox Music will override with incorrect info. &nbsp;So now there's "two" albums because of incorrect artist names in some songs:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Artist: Seventh Wonder</div>
<div>Album: Mercy Falls</div>
<div>Contains Tracks 1, 3, 5</div>
<div><br />
<div>Artist: 7th Wonder (incorrect spelling of the band name)</div>
<div>Album: Mercy Falls</div>
<div>Contains Tracks 2, 4, 7 - 15</div>
<div><br />
<div>This happens to several of albums in my music library with other artists.</div>

            Thanks a lot - I've updated the master list with a couple additional notes to include the specifics you've suggested.
<br />
<br />
Come to think of it I did also have this issue with album, which was split into two separate albums labeled Disc 1 and Disc 2. For whatever reason it kept the Album Artist info, but changed the Contributing Artist on each track to the actual track name. And
 for me in this case the changes are permanent - even deleting the album from the WP8 device and re-adding it while
<i>"Connect with XBox Music"</i> was ticked off did not correct the info. I even tried using my ID Tag editing software, but the tag shows correct on my computer. It seems XBox Music has simply decided that this album is as it is telling me even though the
 metadata says otherwise. <br />

<p>The only beneficial feature that comes from Connect to Xbox for me at this point is artist pictures, which I discovered I could still download by going to the store, choosing an artist, then downloading a random song from them. This adds the artist picture

Thanks for the info. I can't speak for other music services, however this was not an issue using the Zune software. As stated in the above posts, the Zune software had a feature you could tick to "only fill missing information". If you had this option ticked
 the service would not alter any existing metadata - anything you had filled in would remain as you intended. It would only complete empty fields, such as downloading album artwork for an album you did not have artwork attached (it would not overwrite existing
 artwork if you had it). There is no such feature on XBox Music to only fill in missing info - it is either all or nothing, however the "all" option is essentially unusable for the reasons described.

Thanks a lot, and thanks for contributing to the discussion here. <br />
<br />
Not that I am happy this is happening to you, but I am somewhat relieved to know that I am not the only one experiencing the performance issues described.<br />
<br />
If you have not yet experienced the metadata overwriting, and also your background artwork/smart DJ functions are not working, I'm guessing you may not have the
<i>"Connect With XBox Music"</i> option ticked on under the Music settings on your device, as that setting manages all those things. Not that I'm suggesting you tick the option on - beware the metadata overwriting!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this and all of the other issues have prevented me (and it seems many others) from enjoying my WP8 very much. I am currently not using it for Music at all - instead of I've resynced all my Music to my old HTC Trophy running WP7.5 (which works
 perfectly) - so I am using the Trophy as an MP3 player and separately I'm using my Lumia 822 as a phone, which is pretty ridiculous. What a terrible drag. I am truly hoping Microsoft can correct these issues in the near future. I did not enjoy the media management
 experience on Droid either, so the only option if this doesn't work is to switch over to an iPhone environment (if you knew me at all you would know how desperate I am to even consider switching over to Apple).

Ditto. &nbsp;I have had the exact same issue. &nbsp;Although it is local content it seems to be attempting to stream it on my awful T-Mobile coverage and causes stuttering.

<h2>            Cannot install Office Home and Student 2019 and Outlook 2019 on the same PC</h2>
                    <p>I have a friend who recently purchased the retail version of Office Home and Student 2019 and then, after activating it, realised it didn't contain Outlook. They went and bought standalone retail Outlook 2019 but are now presented with a message saying "We
 can't install. To install this product, first uninstall the following product(s) and try again. Microsoft Office Home and Student 2019 - en-us".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can they not be installed together? They are both retail copies of the 2019 version of the software - it doesn't seem to add up that you can't install them both on the same machine.. We now have a copy of Home and Student and a copy of Outlook that are
 both useless! I have tried uninstalling and re-installing both, trying one before the other etc but still the same - if I install Outlook first, I then can't install Office!</p>

            Just to add to this - I can install Outlook 2016 alongside Office Home and Student 2019, so it definitely specific to Outlook 2019. It also is not 32/64bit related as I have tried both versions. Seems to me that Microsoft have blocked being able to install
 2x 2019 products at the same time?!

<br />
<br />My name is Vladimir. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I'm sorry to hear that.  I can imagine that must be frustrating, but if you want to install and run more than one version of Office on the same PC, here on this Microsoft article are some tips to help you avoid most set up errors:

<p>Hi Vladimir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that information using Google (I have my "Have you Googled that?" badge already, thank you) and it does not relate to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use the same 'version' of Office and Outlook (assuming that '2019' is a version) and, as I already stated, I tried to install both pieces of software in both orders (Outlook then Office followed by Office then Outlook) and I've also tried
 both 32/64bit versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional information regarding the apparent incompatibility of these current Microsoft products would be gratefully received.</p>
<p>

            As I wrote, I already tried that but it didnt work. I just now&nbsp; rendered inactive all my outlook add ins and that seemed to have fixed it.&nbsp; now i need to know what add ins are okay to leave inactive and what if any are required.&nbsp; I'm also getting a not
 complete error message on my searches so i dont know what that is about.

<h2>            Office 2004 for Mac update 11.6.0 cannot find software to update</h2>
                    
<p>Office 2004 for Mac is installed on an Intel-based iMac, with most recently installed update of 11.5.6.&nbsp; MacOS is 10.4.11.</p>
<p>I've downloaded the file &lt;Office2004-1160UpdateEN.dmg&gt; and started the update process several times, all &nbsp;with the result that the Installer cannot find the software to update. &nbsp;I've erased the dmg file twice, and downloaded a fresh copy, also twice.</p>
<p>Any other user or Microsoft support person had this experience, and found a way to resolve it?</p>

<h3> n.connors  say:</h3>
<h2>            Could I drop my web hosting&#47;domain account after migrating email to Exchange server&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Over time I've accumulated a bunch of separate services for my business, i.e. MS Office (download version), OneDrive, Backblaze cloud backup service, FatCow web hosting, etc. I'd like to streamline as much of this as possible so I'm thinking of the Office
 365 business plan with Exchange. I only use the FatCow account for my domain name and email (I had a website but took it down). If I migrate my domain over to Exchange for email, could I then cancel my FatCow account, or do I need to keep that (or some other
 service) to keep my domain name alive? According to whois, I own the domain name, but I don't know all the technical aspects of how this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, and sorry if it's a common question.</p>

<p><span>Thanks for choosing Office 365.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to continue using your custom domain as a suffix of your email address, you need to have ownership of this specific domain. I don’t know
 how FatCow works, but if you hosting provider is not FatCow, you can cancel the FatCow account and then use Office 365. Also, I have some articles talking about how to use custom domain in Office 365 for your reference:</span></p>

<h3> christopherlaw62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Legal Pleading for MS Word 2013</h2>
                    The 28-line legal pleading template available in MS Word 2013 is&nbsp;in 10-point type.&nbsp; The courts require 12-point type.&nbsp; When I convert the template to 12-point type, the single - and double-spacing is thrown off and the text&nbsp;no longer lines up with the
 numbers down the side of the page.&nbsp; I've tried setting the line spacing to "Exactly" and entering 22pt, the same spacing as the numbers in the margin, but to no avail.&nbsp; Short of purchasing software, do you have any solutions for setting up a permanent template
 that will not require line adjustments?<br />

            Why not change the point size and line spacing of the line numbers to match the document body text? I'm assuming this is the pleading template with the numbers in a text box anchored to the header?

            <p>Whether you can do this or not will depend on how cooperative your printer is. I would guess that you are more likely to be successful if your printer is one that feeds envelopes crosswise rather than lengthwise, but in either case, what you would have to
 do is set up the return address in the top center of the envelope and then feed the envelope upside-down (with the flap on the side that will be printed).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your printer takes envelopes crosswise, you are more likely to have success if you set up a document such that you can feed the envelope bottom edge first, with the flap open (the flap is less likely to be damaged--or the print crooked--if it's the trailing
 edge).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even commercial printers hate to print return addresses on the flap because the paper handling is so difficult, but they do print them with the flap open, feeding the bulk of the envelope first.</p>

            I agree it's all down to the paper handling of the printer, and more to the point the quality of the envelopes themselves. Some are especially prone to destruction in the printer mechanism, but another possibility if the printer accepts envelope lengthways
 is to use two passes ... or you could put the return address on the front as Word intended :) For that

            <p>I was assuming two passes in any case, if the OP wants to print a delivery address as well. What I was envisioning was printing a supply of envelopes with return address on the flap (as opposed to having them commercially printed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>By and large, the desire to have the address on the flap often arises with formal invitations, such as wedding invitations. For this purpose, a suitable (and perhaps superior) alternative is to emboss the address. A&nbsp;hand embosser can be purchased that permits
 interchangeable plates, and the plates can be rotated to emboss either envelope flaps or the letterhead of stationery. Hand-embossing the envelopes is time-consuming, of course (if a great quantity of invitations is purchased, it's probably more practical
 to have the envelopes commercially embossed), but less nerve-racking than mangling expensive envelopes in an intractable printer.</p>

            If you run the envelope through with the flap open and the straight edge (bottom of the envelope) leading (i.e., the "top"), the return address will be right-side-up. It is the delivery address that will have to be upside-down.

    <title>Windows Defender Disk Usage 100&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rahul deshmukh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender Disk Usage 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft, is anyone listening? Windows Defender needs to be fixed. It basically renders a PC useless. Instead of protecting me from virus and malware attacks&nbsp;it has become&nbsp;the&nbsp;virus infecting my PC.&nbsp;How so? With it turned on my disk is permanently pegged
 to 100%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I care it is going into a loop or whatever its internal problem is. No! That is Microsoft's problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what kind of SLA Microsoft has its in its fine print. But I bet it would not stand in court. Any software that basically trying to destroy my PC (Yes, you are reducing my hard disk life, potentially causing me to lose critical data) is probably
 illegal regardless of what the SLA says. </p>

            No, it did not help. Disk is still 100%. Nothing was found by Microsoft Safety Scanner. Anyway, it seems like a bait and switch, nothing, I mean nothing should use up 100% of disk space, whether it finds some malware or not. Defender is the malware that
 I am trying to get rid of at this point.&nbsp;

<h2>            Corrupted PowerPoint Themes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to assist an end user of mine. I am unsure of what to do next. They have PowerPoint 2016 installed on their computer and use an enterprise license. Recently upgraded to a windows 10 from 7. When editing a power point they have saved, it appears
 that some themes completely mess it up. So much that nothing it recognizable. When changing it from one theme that is causing issues to another, it fixes everything and shows the presentation correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were able to confirm that this might be a corrupted theme by opening another known good PowerPoint and changing themes around. Some of them are causing issues, others are good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we have done is re-image the computer, ensure Office 2016 is the latest version and patched, and even uninstalled and reinstalled Office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open to suggestions.</p>
<p>

<p>I'm assuming the themes you're referrring to are the default Microsoft themes that come with Office. If so, I have to guess that you didn't completely uninstall Office, or the old themes would have been removed. FWIW, this kind of issue is common in Windows
 when you upgrade an operating system under existing software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, try an Office Repair:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Start button, then on Settings, then on Apps.</li><li>Click on Microsoft Office 2016, then click on the Modify button.</li><li>Selection Online Repair and click on the Repair button.</li><li>Allow the process to complete, restart the computer, then see whether the themes are working correctly.</li></ol>
<p>If that still doesn't help, here are 2 methods of uninstalling completely before reinstalling:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isumsoft.com/it/uninstall-office-2016-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">2 Ways to Completely Uninstall Office 2016 in Windows

<p>Chris, it'd be helpful if you could post screenshots of one or two of these slides as they're supposed to look and as they look when the different theme has been applied and messed up the formatting.&nbsp; It's hard to diagnose unless we can see exactly what
 "messes up" means.</p>

            This collapsed-text problem has shown up here a couple of times in the last month. If you select the text in the top screen and apply Arial or Calibri, does the text stay collapsed, or does it become readable?

<h2>            outlook syncs with hotmail calander in outlook, but in windows live I don&#39;t see my appointments made in outlook en neither in my windows phone</h2>
                    I did all the steps in outlook (with the connector) to sync outlook calender with windows live. In outlook, I see both calender (outlook) and live synchronized, but if I go to windows live calender (web) I don't see that it synchronizes. neither does it
 sync with my phone. Please help, this problem has been bothering me for months now!!

            <p>I think the&nbsp;part you are missing is to make your Live/Hotmail folders the default Outlook contacts and calendar folders. Right now you have two sets- the Outlook ("Personal") folders, and the Hotmail/Live folders.</p>
<p>Copy any contacts and calendar items not already in the Live/Hotmail folders into them, then, in Outlook, select&nbsp;Tools &gt; Account Settings.<br />
</p>
<p>Then, in the “Account Settings” pop-up box, select the Data Files tab, your Live account, and then “Set as Default”<br />
</p>
<p>A dialog box will pop-up warning that you are changing the default folders. Select “OK” and restart Outlook.</p>
<p>Now you have one set of data folders to worry about- the Live folders, which are also doing the duty of your old Personal folders.&nbsp;Any new appointments will go directly into the Live/Hotmail folders and sync, rather than the unsynced Personal folders.&nbsp; The

    <title>How to reset security questions in MS Dynamics 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to reset security questions in MS Dynamics 365</h2>
                    Our company currently works off of MS Dynamics 365 and we are set up with the password self reset function but what if a user cannot remember their security answers? Our administrator currently has the ability to reset the passwords but how does a user
 reset their security questions? Is there a self reset function for the user to change the questions and answers once logged in or is this something that needs to be reset on the administrative side? Thank you!
