<h2>            Move Incoming Emails Sent to Alias to Different Folder</h2>
                    <p>We have a few people in our company who have 1 or more aliases assigned to them. How do I set them up so that anything sent to their alias is moved to a different folder than their primary inbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to create a rule, but I can't seem to single out emails sent only to the alias. And once the rule was applied, and I tested sending to the alias only, it still went to the primary email and didn't flag it as being sent to the alias at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We really just need to see whether something was sent directly to the primary email or sent to one of the alias emails assigned to the primary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove MDM iOS APN Certificate</h2>
                    
<p>i'm setting up mobile device management for a client in office 365, and in the area where you upload the certificate obtained from the apple website when logged in with the apple id, we uploaded the incorrect file by mistake.</p>
<p>when going to the mdm area in the office 365 admin, as per the following two screens, i can't find how to delete the apn certificate for ios, it only allows to upload a new one.</p>
<p>how can i delete the one i uploaded and start again?</p>

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>It is not feasible to manage the APN certificate from Office 365 portal.&nbsp;We would suggest that you post in the
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/home?category=microsoftintune" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Intune forum </a>for professional assistance as MDM is powered by Microsoft Intune. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Moreover, you may ignore the incorrect file and go through the set up process again to upload the correct APN certificate and see if it helps.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Vincent</p>

<h3> redandwhite1874  say:</h3>
<h2>            My family</h2>
                    <p>Today i have bought my teenager a Windows Phone; however she cannot really use it online due to the age restriction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have logged into My Family to try and fix this but cant.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I log in via my Xbox account details which uses a non windows or microsoft&nbsp; email address.&nbsp; I then add my daughters new
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***' account information and it takes me to a page where i see my account and her account but no 'Fix it' option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this page it says she may have to log onto Xbox live to accept the terms and conditions.&nbsp; This seems strange as she has never had any Xbox account.&nbsp; However i have tried to do this and it leads me to a stage where i need to add my Xbox account for parental
 control.&nbsp; At this stage it then uses language which suggest i am trying to set up a new xbox account and i have stopped the process as i dont want to risk my current set up and billing etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice would be helpful, i may be wrong in highlighting the Xbox angle ? but to me it seems to account for the lack of a 'Fix It' option at the main My Family page.</p>

<p>Thanks for writing on the Windows Phone 8 forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are asked for setting up My Family when you try to download apps and games the causes can be two:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>You haven’t inserted the necessary information into the Microsoft Account related profile.
</li><li>You are still not officially an adult, so you need to ask your parents to set up My Family and put your Microsoft Account under their control.
</li></ol>

<h2>            Access filter main form by an entry on linked subform</h2>
                    <p>A table "items" contains records of lesson worksheets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the server, it is accessed by numerous teachers, who each have their own Access front end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Teachers need to index their personal favourite lessons, so a local table is linked to the remota data table to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A form shows the data table, and a subform on it shows the local data. The box "favourite" when checked in the subform changes as records in the master are scrolled. In other words, the link works, and I can also print a a list of favourites. What I cannot
 do is filter the subform to see all the favourite lessons. One can of course only filter the Main form.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to filter the subform and see the matching records in the masterform. I assume this should be easy once you know how, but no explanation I have seen could ever be described as easy and I have not undersood any of them, even though I am
 reasonably competent in Access.</p>

            Thanks for the prompt response. Unfortunately, I cannot make it work. On the Northwind example, if you click the filter sign it allows you to filter the&nbsp; orders table, not the main salesman table (as far as I can see).<br />
<br />
For most of my fields on my main form, which is linked directly to the main table, I just put the cursor in the field and use the large filter sign at the top left of the screen. This filters the main table. What I need to do is to be able to do the SAME for
 the subform but see all the records of the main table for which there is an entry in the field of the subform.<br />
<br />
I appreciate that I may be being dense, but the Northwind sample does not work for me. I click on the filter sign on the orders subform and this filters the orders, not the salesmen who have PLACED an order for the product I want to filter.<br />
<br />
I suppose one could attach a query to a button to select those salesmen who have placed an order for a particular product and then open a duplicate form using that query - I haven't tried this but suppose it might work. However, it is obviously clunky and a
 bit weird. There must be an easier way!<br />

            You might like to take a look at FindRecord.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file includes illustrations of how to filter a parent on the basis of a value in subform's recordset.&nbsp; Two approaches are demonstrated; one filters the parent form only, the other filters both the parent and subform.&nbsp; The code for the former
 is:<br />
<br />
Private Sub cboLastname_AfterUpdate()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const MESSAGETEXT = "No matching records found."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
As you can see, the essence of this is that a subquery to which the IN operator is applied is used to filter the parent form to those rows where the primary key is in the set of values returned by the subquery, which is restricted on the value selected in the
 combo box.<br />
<br />
The second example, which filters both the parent and the subform, does the same with regard to the parent form but also includes additional code to filter the subform:<br />
<br />
Private Sub cboLastname_AfterUpdate()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const MESSAGETEXT = "No matching records found."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FROM ContactProjects WHERE ContactID = " &amp; ctrl &amp; ")"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Nz(ctrl, 0) = 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' turn off filter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.fsubContacts.Form.FilterOn = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(DLookup("ContactID", "ContactProjects", "ContactID = " &amp; ctrl)) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' filter form to name selected in combo box<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Filter = strFilter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' filter subform to selected contact<br />
&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.fsubContacts.Form.Filter = "ContactID = " &amp; ctrl</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.fsubContacts.Form.FilterOn = True</strong><br />

            <p>Thanks. Trying option A), do I assume the following?<br />
<br />
1) This code is put in the After Update section of the "event" box in the "Properties" form for my SUBform?</p>
<p>
</p><p>B) My subform is based on a table called "links", the field of which that I want to filter is named "FAV" and the MAIN form is entitled just "2". It is not clear to me how to substitute my names in the code below, where there are three elements: ProjectID,
 ContactÜrojects and ConntactID<br />
<br />
<strong>strFilter = "ProjectID IN(SELECT ProjectID " &amp; _</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FROM ContactProjects WHERE ContactID = " &amp; ctrl &amp; ")"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried looking at your zip file FindRecord.zip, but on opening the form in design mode I could not open "Properties", and so the relevant code was hidden.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            1.&nbsp; The code goes in the AfterUpdate event procedure of an unbound control in the parent form, usually a combo box, analogous to the 'Filter by Contact' combo box in my form.&nbsp; In my case the BoundColumn of the combo box is ContactID, but the combo box
 is set up to hide this column and show the contact names.<br />
<br />
If you are unfamiliar with entering code into a form's or control's event procedures, this is how it's done in form design view:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the form or control as appropriate and open its properties sheet if it's not already open.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the relevant event property and select the 'build' button (the one on the right with 3 dots).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Code Builder in the dialogue and click OK.&nbsp; This step won't be necessary if you've set up Access to use event procedures by default.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The VBA editor window will open at the event procedure with the first and last lines already in place.&nbsp; Enter or paste in the code as new lines between these.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; In my case ProjectID is the name of the primary key of the parent form's table, and the corresponding foreign key in the subform's table.&nbsp; ContactProjects is the name of the subform's table.&nbsp; ContactID is the column in ContactProjects on which the filtering
 is to be applied.<br />
<br />
Note that in my case The ContactID column is a long integer number data type.&nbsp; If the column on which the filtering is to be applied is a text data type it would be necessary to wrap the value in literal quotes characters, represented by a contiguous pair of
 quotes characters in each case, as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strFilter = "ProjectID IN(SELECT ProjectID " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FROM ContactProjects WHERE ContactID = """ &amp; ctrl &amp; """)"<br />
<br />
And similarly elsewhere in the code where necessary.<br />

            <p>Dear Ken ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to get this to work, which makes me astonished, and very pleased. I have actually done a fair amount of "programming" with Access, including designing an entire working and fairly complex application for a language school, but this filtering from
 a subform required coding I was of course not capable of. So a big thankyou. I feel as if I should pay you something, as this was the last piece in a database jigsaw I am preparing for another school tor teachers to share archived resources. (It is a personal
 project and not a commercial one - I am just a teacher interested in databases.)<br />
<br />
One thing I would like to remark on. You and other writers - being so familiar with them of course - often refer to combo boxes as if they were easy, but in my experience they certainly aren't. For example, consultants say "use a combo box to do this or that",
 but in fact there are quite a few ways to set up a combo box and I find them quite confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I created a new one with a VALUE LIST rather than referring to any field (there is in fact no relevant field to refer to). And I ASSUME that the box passes the value entered to the coding that you supplied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OTHER point is another conceptual one. The way this is working, there is a SUBFORM on the master (and obviously linked to it) with a single field into which a user can put a number to index a file on the main table,&nbsp; but one ALSO needs a combo box to
 do the filtering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, achieving the desired result requires TWO elements embedded into the master form: A) the subform for entering data and B) a combo box for FILTERING it. In other words (again) you cannot have a SINGLE box to do BOTH things as you can on the
 masterform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that make sense? In any case, it works, which is all I really care about! As I said, I am not sure how to thank you adequately!</p>
        </p>

            Those of us who answer questions here do so entirely on a voluntary basis, and are more than happy to do so if it helps others gain experience, so don't even think about any need for payment.&nbsp; The only thanks we need are knowing that we've helped.<br />
<br />
As regards combo boxes these by and large are used in two situations.&nbsp; Firstly to insert a value into a column (field) in a table.&nbsp; This is a bound control, and is used where the values come from a defined list.&nbsp; A combo box can also be unbound, and used for
 things like searching for records by selecting a value from the list.&nbsp; You are absolutely correct in thinking that these must be separate controls; you can't use one for both entering data and searching for records.<br />
<br />
In cases where the values are immutably fixed in the external world a value list is appropriate; days of the week or months of the year are examples.&nbsp; Where the values are not fixed sets, however, a value list should not be used, even if you think the values
 will never change.&nbsp; You should always get the values from a table.&nbsp; Otherwise you would be encoding data as part of the object definition, whereas a fundamental principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle (Codd's Rule #1). This
 requires that all data be stored as values at column positions in rows in tables, and in no other way.
<br />
<br />
In your case, the values would be stored in a separate table named Favourites say, with a column Favourite designated as its primary key.&nbsp; The combo box's RowSource property would then be:<br />
<br />
SELECT Favourite FROM Favourites ORDER BY Favourite;<br />
<br />
In this case the primary key of Favourites is a 'natural' key, but that assumes that the values are distinct.&nbsp; A table of cities, for instance,&nbsp; cannot have the city name as its primary key as city names can legitimately be duplicated; think how many Springfields
 there are in the USA!&nbsp; In a case like this the Cities table would have a 'surrogate' numeric CityID primary key, using an autonumber, and a non-key column with the city names&nbsp; The combo box is then set up to hide the CityID column and show the names.&nbsp; If the
 same name appears more than once in the list, however, you would not know which to select.&nbsp; To cater for this you could return other columns' values in the list.&nbsp; You'll find an example in DatabaseBasics.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file, if you go to the <em>'Retrieving data from the database'</em> section you'll see that in the right hand part of the form is a combo box to search by city.&nbsp; When you drop the list down it comprises not just the city name but also the
 region and country in which the city is located, so Paris, France can be distinguished from Paris, Texas.&nbsp; The value is concatenated from three separate columns in the RowSource as follows:<br />
<br />
SELECT Cities.CityID, City &amp; ", " &amp; Region &amp; ", " &amp; Country AS CityLocation<br />
FROM (Countries INNER JOIN Regions ON Countries.CountryID = Regions.CountryID) <br />
INNER JOIN Cities ON Regions.RegionID = Cities.RegionID<br />
ORDER BY Cities.City;<br />
<br />
Another way is to use correlated combo boxes in which you progressively select the country, region and city in three separate combo boxes, the first two being unbound.&nbsp; You'll find an example of this in the
<em>'Building the user interface' </em>section. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The form has a 'View Code' button which enables you to take a look at the code in the form's module.&nbsp; I would not expect you to understand how the code works at first sight, of course.&nbsp; As Richard Feynman is saying to his students in the quote below my signature,
 you have to understand how things work before you can make them work.&nbsp; My little demo is designed to give a brief introduction, but it really is a question of doing the homework.&nbsp; There are plenty of resources freely available online, but I would still recommend
 getting hold of a good general purpose book on Access, one which comes with its own demo files which you can work through methodically at your own pace.<br />

            <p>Thanks - obviously a lot of homework to do ....... this stuff really does go deep.<br />
<br />
As I said, I got this to work thanks to your help, but I have ONE last problem as explained below:<br />
<br />
To summarize:<br />
<br />
A) I have a table “items” with the following fields viewed by a form (I have greatly simplified the number of fields)<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PIC = a link using the web browser control (primary key) to look in the folder where the actual worksheets lie.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;TITLE = a textfield describing the worksheet<br />
<br />
I want to find a way for multiple users to enter a number from 1 to 5 in ANOTHER table (on the same form as for "items" to indicate that a particular file in “items” is a favourite.<br />
<br />
So, there is table <br />
<br />
B) called “links” which has these fields:<br />
<br />
PIC = as above in A)<br />
ID = a user ID<br />
FAV = a number field where a user can put from 1 to 5 to indicate mark a particular file in “items “ as a favourite (the 1 to 5 rating is an extra complication - it would perhaps be easier to leave it at 1 (=yes). Or a checkbox would be more elegant, but I
 am not sure how this would work with a combo box)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "links" table would more elegantly be placed on the server, not on the local front end.<br />
<br />
I need to be able to filter the FAV field in “links” and see ALL the records in “items” which the particular user for which the user has placed a number in FAV in “links”.<br />
<br />
Using this procedure you posted, I managed to make this work, but only for ONE user. I need to find a way to have the user of the front end enter into table B (via the form combining "items" and "links") BOTH his or her ID AND the “favourite” rating so that
 even using a single copy of the front end the favourites are individualised.&nbsp; I assume this is possible somehow.<br />
<br />
To summarize, assuming we have several front end copies of Access, then each individual user needs to be able to input his or her own favourites. At the moment, I can mark a file as “favourite”, but it is favourite for EVERYONE.<br />
<br />
You could of course have multiple copies of the front end, each “belonging” to a particular user (and each user on a network would se his or her personal copy on the desktop), but I imagine a programmer would shudder at such a clumsy arrangement!<br />
<br />
Here is the code you posted and which works as described above, but not for individual users:<br />
<br />
Private Sub Text2093_AfterUpdate()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const MESSAGETEXT = "No matching records found."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strFilter As String<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.ActiveControl<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strFilter = "PIC IN(SELECT PIC " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FROM links WHERE FAV = " &amp; ctrl &amp; ")"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Nz(ctrl, 0) = 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' turn off filter<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            First a few general points:<br />
<br />
1. I would not recommend that the PIC column be the primary key of Items.&nbsp; It is a candidate key, and as such must be uniquely indexed, but a 'surrogate' autonumber ItemID primary key would be more efficient<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Do not use the generic ID as a column name.&nbsp; I know you'll find it done in some of the Access templates, it is not good practice due to the ambiguity which it creates.&nbsp; Always use more specifically descriptive column names which describe the attribute represented
 by the column, in this case UserID.&nbsp; Use the same name for the primary key of the referenced table and any corresponding foreign keys in referencing tables.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; The use of upper case for column names will make any SQL statements confusing as the usual convention is to use upper case for SQL key words (Access defaults to this).&nbsp; For table and column names I always use CamelCase, or you can represent a space by an
 underscore character.<br />
<br />
What you have is a many-to-many relationship type between users and items.&nbsp; This is represented by a table which resolves it into two one-to-many relationship types, i.e. your Links table:<br />
<br />
Links<br />
….ItemID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
….UserID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
….Fav<br />
<br />
This table is 'all key', i.e. its primary key is a composite one of the three columns.&nbsp; In addition to referencing Items it is referencing a Users table.<br />
<br />
To return a result table of all of each user's favourite items is merely a matter of joining the tables, e.g.<br />
<br />
SELECT Users.UserID, FirstName, LastName, Pic, Title<br />
FROM (Users INNER JOIN Links ON Users.UserID= Links.UserID)<br />
INNER JOIN Items ON Links.ItemID = Items.ItemID<br />
ORDER BY LastName, FirstName, Title;<br />
<br />
To return a result table of each user's favourite items ranked as 1 for instance would merely require the query to be restricted on the Fav column:<br />
<br />
SELECT Users.UserID, FirstName, LastName, Pic, Title<br />
FROM (Users INNER JOIN Links ON Users.UserID= Links.UserID)<br />
INNER JOIN Items ON Links.ItemID = Items.ItemID<br />
WHERE Fav = 1<br />
ORDER BY LastName, FirstName, Title;<br />
<br />
You can of course reference a parameter in place of the literal 1 value.<br />
<br />
To return a result table of all of a specific user's favourite items the query would be restricted on the UserID column:<br />
<br />
PARAMETERS Forms!YourFormName!cboUser LONG;<br />
SELECT Users.UserID, FirstName, LastName, Pic, Title<br />
FROM (Users INNER JOIN Links ON Users.UserID= Links.UserID)<br />
INNER JOIN Items ON Links.ItemID = Items.ItemID<br />
WHERE Users.UserID = Forms!YourFormName!cboUser<br />
ORDER BY LastName, FirstName, Title;<br />
<br />
Where cboUser is an unbound combo box set up as follows:<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT UserID, FirstName &amp; " " &amp; LastName FROM Users ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can concatenate the names so that the last name is first, which would be better with a large list of names as it allows the user to enter the initial characters of the last name and progressively go to the first match as each character is
 entered:<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT UserID, LastName &amp; ", " &amp; FirstName FROM Users ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
By binding a form to an amended version of the above query:<br />
<br />
PARAMETERS Forms!YourFormName!cboUser LONG;<br />
SELECT Pic, Title<br />
FROM Links INNER JOIN Items ON Links.ItemID = Items.ItemID<br />
WHERE Links.UserID = Forms!YourFormName!cboUser<br />
ORDER BY Title;<br />
<br />
And placing the cboUser control in the form header, you then merely need to requery the form in the control's AfterUpdate event procedure with:<br />
<br />
Me.Requery<br />
<br />
An alternative approach, and the one I'd recommend, would be to use a bound parent form, in single form view, based on Users and within it a bound subform, in continuous forms view, based on a query which joins Links and Items, the subform being linked to the
 parent form on UserID.&nbsp; The subform would contain a combo box bound to ItemID from Links, set up to hide the bound column and show either the Pic or Title values, whichever you prefer to select an item by.&nbsp; Whichever you use the other can be shown in a bound
 text box in the subform, with its Locked property set to True (Yes) and its Enabled property to False&nbsp; (No) to make the control read-only.&nbsp; A form/subform like this would be the obvious set-up for entering users and their favourites.<br />
<br />
By placing the cboUser control in the form header you can then navigate to a user with code in its AfterUpdate event procedure:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Const MESSAGETEXT = "No matching record"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.ActiveControl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(ctrl) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Me.RecordsetClone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .FindFirst "UserID = " &amp; ctrl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not .NoMatch Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' go to record by synchronizing bookmarks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Bookmark = .Bookmark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox MESSAGETEXT, vbInformation, "Warning"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
This will take you to the selected user, whose favourites will be shown in the subform.<br />
<br />
If you wished to filter such a form to those users who have selected a particular item as one of their favourites you would do as in my demo, but the string expression to filter the form would be as follows:<br />
<br />
strFilter = "UserID IN(SELECT UserID " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "FROM links WHERE ItemID = " &amp; ctrl &amp; ")"<br />
<br />
The control in this case would be an unbound combo box with a RowSource such as:<br />
<br />
SELECT ItemID, Title FROM Items ORDER BY Title;<br />
<br />
All tables should be on the server.&nbsp; Each user can enter their own favourites simply by navigating to their own record in the form.&nbsp; Separate copies of single front end can be used by each user, without the need to tailor each to the individual user.&nbsp; If you
 do not wish users to see other users' records then the form should be based on a query which restricts its result table to the current user's record only.&nbsp; This can be done by giving each user a password, which is stored in a column in Users.&nbsp; In the form's
 query this column can then reference as a parameter a control in an unbound log-in form in which the user enters their password.&nbsp; This form should be hidden, not closed, when the bound form is opened.<br />
<br />
Be clear, however, that a set-up like this does not constitute 'security'; it merely controls the normal day-to-day operation of the database.&nbsp; Any half-competent user could easily access other users' records if they so wished.&nbsp; If you anything like real security
 a lot more would be required, but even then Access is not a suitable product where true security is needed.<br />

            <p>Dear Ken</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a phenomenal post; possibly the most informative, thorough and helpful information I have ever seen in a forum like this. Lots to think about, but I will attempt to redesign my application along the lines you mention - and it has inspired me to try
 to follow your Feynman philosophy a bit better. One can do a great deal in Access without writing much code, but of course a lot more WITH it, and that is my ambition.<br />
<br />
Once again, many thanks<br />
<br />
CS.</p>

            I'm using Airtel 3G and on paper they support upto 21Mbps and I've never heard anyone saying they've got to that limit when downloading, browsing can be blazing fast. Using my E7 as a modem on a linux box I get 600Kbps download speed and it is not 600K
 all time. If you've purchased USB dongle from your provider you might get higher speeds when compared to a Phone modem. 4G is not available in my country.

<h2>            Excel Issue with setting permission on allow users to edit ranges</h2>
                    I have issue setting permission on "allow users to edit ranges" under review menu. I can add the permissions to set range to be editable by a specific people and click ok. But when i go back into the same I see those permissions disappear. I have older
 sheets where I setup range permissions in the past and it worked then. But not on these new documents. I tried to use the old sheet which has already some permissions but when I try and add new and save it all disappears including new and old. I tend to now
 believe there is a bug in that which is causing this issue. I tried and reinstall all O365 apps to see if it fixes it but no luck. Please suggest if I am doing anything wrong or anyone else have this issue.

<h2>            Does anyone know how to copy the values out of a subform &#40;in datasheet view&#41; to the clipboard using Access VBA&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just need to know how to copy because i will be manually pasting into another application.&nbsp; I am asking this question because whenever I manually copy the rows i need out of my subform, the column names/headers are automatically copied.&nbsp; I only need the
 values.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to get rid of the headers or to programmatically copy via the press of a button on my form?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, </p>
<p>[frmInvoices] is the name of my form.</p>
<p>[subfrmInvoices] is the name of my subform</p>
<p>[FAM #] is the primary key in my form</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in some of my records, there is no data in my subform.&nbsp; In others, there may be 20 rows of information.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I tell Access via VBA to copy every row in my <em><strong>current</strong></em> subform &nbsp;to the clipboard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or, am I doing this all wrong?&nbsp; Is there an easier way?</p>

            To the best of my knowledge, Outlook 2013 has no folders with those names. The folders are usually Sent Items and Outbox. However, if you're using an IMAP account, the server will determine the names of those folders. In fact, with an IMAP account, there
 probably won't be an Outbox.

<p>I had the names of the folders wrong. My <em>Sent Items</em> and <em>Outbox</em> folders are missing. Everything else I mentioned is still the same - emails I attempt to send are, instead, being archived and will not send.</p>

<h2>            Use of keyboard within internet search engines. - Cannot use the number keys within the search box</h2>
                    I upgraded Windows&nbsp; 7&nbsp; to a Fujitisu life book t1010. After doing so, when using any internet search engine, my keyboard cannot use the number keys in search boxes, or other forms of data entry. I have to use Num Lk and then the embedded numbers in the
 alpha keys&nbsp;&nbsp; J=1,k=2, and in any case cannot use upper case characters such as the at sign, parantheses, per cent etc. This happens in all of the search engines I use--opera, firefox, safari. However, in prgrams such as word pad, I can enter all of these keys
 in text. I have used new keyboard drivers and updates for the HID and standard keyboard drivers. He3pp

            <p>Hi JerBobAnderson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What exactly happens when you type numbers in any search engine?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How long have you been facing this issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To type the numbers, the Num Lock should be on.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you use the onscreen keyboard to make sure that the issue is not related to system keyboard.</p>
<p>Refer the section “<b>To use a numeric key pad in On-Screen Keyboard</b>” in the article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Type-without-using-the-keyboard-On-Screen-Keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Type-without-using-the-keyboard-On-Screen-Keyboard</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If onscreen keyboard works fine, it means the issue is related to the keyboard. Follow the below steps to troubleshoot the keyboard issue and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also check for
<b>FN key</b> on keyboard. You may also contact the manufacturer for further assistance on the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

 in on a different pc, (creating a new profile for that user) and start outlook (or word or any office app), it starts its first time setup with the installer, but fails.&nbsp; I then get the following in the application log:</p>

<p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; (I was actually waiting for an alert that someone replied, but never got one, otherwise I would've responded yesterday!)</p>
<p>I can try to uninstall and reinstall office, but I have a feeling that's not going to solve my problem.&nbsp; Also, I have hundreds of computers I'd have to do this to, (including citrix servers) so I don't know how feasible that will be.&nbsp; After trying multiple
 things, I have found that when I log on with a user with a redirected application data folder for the first time on a different computer, it does not seem to create all the registry keys under HKCU.&nbsp; Like I have above referencing HKCU\Software\ODBC, that key
 doesn't even exist, including just about every key under the Office key.&nbsp; I could have a gpo set to create these values, but I think that may be a hoaky solution.&nbsp; Also, this makes me think that maybe other application keys aren't getting created as well,
 so I may have this same issue with other applications eventually too.</p>
<p>Things I have tried so far, are:</p>
<p>- Give the user local admin rights</p>
<p>- move the share to another server (the original one was on a 2008 cluster and we're using dfs)&nbsp; This different server is a straight standard share now</p>
<p>- give the user full control of the base directory on the server that's created when the app data folder is created (ie \server\share\user\application data)&nbsp; Gave user full control at \user and propagated down from there</p>
<p>- tried all combination of options from within the folder redirection gpo itself</p>
<p>I don't understand how redirecting application data could affect this, as the HKCU key is created from the default user ntuser.dat file.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>Are you convinced this is happening as a result of application data folder redirection? I ask because I am having this problem on a PC in an environment where we have never attempted to do application redirection. I will post back if I find a fix that doesn't
 involve a full uninstall/install.</p>

            Well, the fact that it works fine when I'm not redirecting the folder tells me that that's the problem.&nbsp; I can take that test user, turn off the redirect gpo, reboot, and login and all the registry keys create fine and outlook (in particular) starts fine.&nbsp;
 When I redirect it back, log in, I can clearly see that not all of the keys in HKCU are being created.&nbsp; Remember, this is only for a user logging in to a pc for the first time.&nbsp; If they already have a profile on that pc, and i enable app data redirection,
 it works fine.&nbsp; So something is telling me that there's a problem with windows creating the reg keys for that first time when that folder is redirected.&nbsp; I guess I don't understand why, though, since all those keys are supposed to come from the ntuser.dat
 that's in the default user profile.&nbsp; That's why I thought it was a permissions thing, but I tried giving that user full control of everything I could think of.&nbsp; (I guess I could've tried domain admin,

                    <p>I had just finished writing my 1500 word essay that was due and as I went to upload it into the online submission portal I realised that I had no internet connection (at this stage I had not saved my document since it was a measly 200 words). So I pressed
 the save button (which now I realise won't&nbsp;save unless I have an internet connection due to it saving to one drive) and shut my laptop down. Upon turning it back on and gaining an internet&nbsp;connection again I went to open the word document and found that it
 had not saved. I went searching for over half an hour and could not find my completed essay and when I auto recovered the document it was only my original copy of 200 words.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my question is, is there any way in which I can locate my finalised&nbsp;1500 word essay?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<strong>More email settings</strong>. Then select <span>
<strong>Group by conversation and pre-load messages.</strong> In Conversation settings select
<strong>Show messages individually</strong>. You could also try selecting <strong>
Don't pre-load messages</strong>. I suggest you try one option at a time. Again, I don't know if this will work, but it can't hurt.</span></p>

<p>Resolution. K1 licenses do not support EWS which is needed for Salesforce to sync to Office365.</p>
<p>You need to upgrade your K1 license to the Business Essentials license to enable the sync</p>

<p>I think the problem is more of a display problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The text you send includes non-ASCII characters, so it's being sent in UTF-8 encoding (where non-ASCII characters are sent as a combination of two or more characters).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know where you are reading the recevied message (phone, computer), but for some reason it is not correctly interpreting the text as being in UTF-8 format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the problem could be that your e75 is not indicating correctly the format (enconding) of the message when it's being sent, or your SMTP server is doing some conversion, or your Exchange server is doing some conversion, or or or ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you could view the message as-is (source), you could post the headers here, as this may help in identifying the problem..</p>

<p>How do I change the UTF-8 encoding?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the e-mail looks fine the phone display but when the reciever get the e-mail it looks strange... and its only the swedish letters that are strange.</p>

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>The e-mails that you send from your E75 are already encoded with UTF-8 (at least if they contain non-ASCII characters).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is either being cause by an incorrectly set e-mail server (not likely), or by the e-mail client (or web browser) that you're using to read the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've just tested sending an e-mail from my E75 (using an ovi account with Nokia Messaging) containing various non-ASCII characters (ä, ö, ñ, etc.) two different accounts (one of them was read using Lotus Notes, the other is a webmail account), and both display
 everything correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can, send yourself an e-mail containing swedish letters to an e-mail account where you can view the e-mail in "source" form, and check if you see the following lines in the header:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"</p>
<p>Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't see exactly that, please look for lines in the header that begin with "Content" and post them here!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may help also if you post details of how you are reading the e-mail (webmail, and if so, which browser; or an e-mail client, and if so, which; operating system, language of OS, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Cut &#38; Paste problems - Word to Outlook 2010 email</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I try to cut &amp; paste formatted copy &amp; images from Word into an email using Outlook 2010, the layout gets messed up. I've tried every option in the File/Options/Mail/Editor Options/Advanced Cut, copy, and paste section but nothing seems to work.
 Below is an example. The Word doc on the right shows the copy with two images lined up properly. When I cut &amp; paste it into the email, it changes/loses the formatting/layout. Any suggestions??

            <p>Hi Girish,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most cases, the images are inserted into Word using the Insert/Picture tool. I tried every combination of settings available (Keep Source Formatting, Merge Formatting, Insert/paste pictures as Square or In Line, etc.) and it still doesn't format like
 the Word document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, once I cut &amp; paste into the Outlook email, I can cut &amp; paste from there back to Word and it puts it back into the proper formatting/layout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For background: I handle employee communications at my job, and people send me Word docs that need to be then emailed to all employees. I used to be able to simply cut &amp; paste from Word into an email and it would retain the layout. But once we switched to
 Outlook 2010, that no longer works and I have to manually recreate the document &amp; layout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think it might be something to do with the default margins of my email??&nbsp;Or perhaps settings in Word?? Many thanks for any additional advice!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teri</p>

<br />
<br />The information is more than helpful. I tried several web browsers, I am not the web master for the site. 
<br />
<br />The site is not working on your computer and its not working on my devices either, if you put two and two together, common sense would obviously suggest the site has a problem.
