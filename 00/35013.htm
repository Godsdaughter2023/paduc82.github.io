<h2>            How do I delete DLCs &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>how can I delete DLCs of a disc game I don't own anymore ?</p>
<p>If there is no icon in the 'Ready to install' list I can't manage the game saves and/or DLCs anymore.</p>
<p>So is there a way without reseting the whole console or deleting all games in the HDD section to delete them ?</p>
<p>thx</p>

<p>Hello EXLEX</p>
<p>I have had a look on the Xbox One to see if there is a way of deleting DLC without a the game it's a yes and no for some games.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">-</span></p>
<p>(Season Pass Method)</p>
<p>If you owned the Season Pass for the game you may be able to mange the DLC within the Season Pass by doing the following.</p>
<p>Go to the Store, Search for your Season Pass, Then click Manage.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">-</span></p>
<p>(Demo Method)</p>
<p>If the game has a demo download the demo, as it is installing go to the queue and manage the game and see if the DLC is there because some games use the demo as a direct upgrade so you don't have to download it again.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">-</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The last method is borrow the game from a friend then delete it, but apart from that I don't think there is any other way to deleting the DLC apart from Factory Resetting.</span></p>

<p>Hi, matthewiag,</p>
<p>thx for trying to help but I have been that far as well. ; ) &nbsp;:(</p>
<p>For real how could it be, that this change for the worse from 360 to Xbox ONE wasn't corrected yet.</p>
<p>There are 2 suggestions on the feedback site since 2014 but nothing happened ! (<a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/253802-home-xbox-guide-and-settings/suggestions/6060657-data-management-similar-to-360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LINK1</a> ,

<h2>            account swap - very frustrating&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>What a frustrating (and hysterical)&nbsp;experience!!!</p>
<p>I have a win 8 comp that links to account A.&nbsp; I have an xbox that links to account B.&nbsp; Can I just move my xbox gamertag to account&nbsp;A online?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I have to do it through the xbox.&nbsp; But I can't do that either because account A already has a free account
 associated to it.&nbsp; So I download account A onto my xbox.&nbsp; I create a new account online (account C) because this is what the how-to on xbox's official website says I should do.</p>
<p>But guess what!&nbsp; I can't switch it over because i now have to wait 30 DAYS from the time i downloaded the profile onto my xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then when I went to go to support and chat about the issue online, it logged me in as the new account - account C.&nbsp; And because it did that, it did me the favor of creating another free account on account C... so now I can't use account C as a temporary
 place holder for account A so I can get account B switched over.&nbsp; confused?</p>
<p>Yeah me too... but more so, I'm confused as to why this is so hard? </p>
<p>I am now waiting in the 40 minute line to chat with someone in support to actually fix it so I don't have to wait 30 days... but in the meantime.... my question for this forum&nbsp;is simple:&nbsp; why are you relying on users to do a computer programming swap 101
 with three place holders and an xbox controller keyboarding task&nbsp;for something that should be as easy as point and click online?&nbsp; Win 8 uses these accounts now too, right?&nbsp; This is not a problem that is going away, let's anticipate and make it a bit easier,
 no?</p>
<p>lol ridiculous</p>

<p>update: i have been told that there is no way to circumvent the 30 days... i said i can't link my win 8 computer to my xbox until i do that, am i supposed to wait a month? &nbsp;the reply:</p>
<p>Joe: I'm afraid that is correct. It seems like you understand the principles of changing Live IDs between xbox profiles, but unfortunately there is no way to get around that 30 day security feature.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I can imagine the frustration but just as additional info, the 30days wait time is likely there as a extra security measure to prevent other people that get a hold of your account (hackers/phishers) to quickly move the gamer profile to a different Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>Not that this will help you at this moment, but it is at least something that could be a reason for the 30 days...</p>

<p><span>This is a requirement, not of Xbox LIVE, but put in place by the security folks at Microsoft Accounts. The nice folks at Xbox have to use that system. This is, BTW, a Microsoft Account issue; the

<p>I have posted this issue with several different microsoft forums and support groups so that they are all notified. &nbsp;They have all pointed fingers to the other teams. &nbsp;lol
</p>
<p>it is the curse of combining single-sign across different development teams. &nbsp;I have no doubt they will fix the bug (which is what it is) once they realize that seamless and ease-of-use are equally important in the competitive market they are now in.</p>
<p>Security needs to make sense. &nbsp;When you implement because of fear over actual occurrence, you cut functionality and quality without reason. &nbsp;Considering I have to enter a code that is emailed to me everytime I log in through a different computer, I think
 there are other ways to secure this functionality without a 30 day wait period haha.</p>

<p>I have had almost the exact same issue. &nbsp;I have not used my Xbox in 2 years, as I have not had a television. &nbsp;So that my post does not get confused with yours I will name my accounts numerically instead of alphabetically.</p>
<p>My Xbox live account uses an email address (Windows Live ID 1) that I have not used in over 4 years. &nbsp;Because it has been so long since I used my Xbox, in the mean time the interface has changed a great deal. &nbsp;When I did last use it, there was not an option
 to swap gamertags and accounts. &nbsp;So my only option was to make a *new* gamertag (Gamertag 2) to associate with my new email (Windows Live ID 2). &nbsp;After very little (or perhaps no) time using it, I decided it would be too much of a pain to start over in every
 game I own so I continued using Windows Live ID 1 instead.</p>
<p>2 years later, I got a TV and hooked up my Xbox. &nbsp;I also have Windows 8, and besides wanting consistency of accounts, I want to use Smart Glass which is automatically signing me in with my main email (Windows Live ID 2). &nbsp;I updated the Xbox software and
 looked up on the internet the steps for changing it to my newer account. &nbsp;I got on the Xbox to switch Gamertag 1 to Windows Live ID 2, but it would not let me because Windows Live ID 2 was associated with Gamertag 2. &nbsp;I tried to find a way to delete Gamertag
 2 and was unsucessful so I thought I would just assign it to a dummy email first, then proceed.</p>
<p>Since I was not using Gamertag 2, I had to download it to the Xbox first. &nbsp;So of course after doing that I could not do anything else, which I soon found out was because of the 30 day waiting period. &nbsp;So in 30 days, only then can I move Gamertag 2 to a dummy
 email. &nbsp;Then I get to wait ANOTHER 30 days before putting Gamertag 1 on Windows Live ID 2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Since I was not aware of these limitations from the start (it's not like they advertise it) I deleted my account from the Xbox (locally only) before adding the other
 one; I thought they may conflict. So when I am ready for the last step I will have to redownload it an wait YET ANOTHER 30 days. &nbsp;Total of 90 days. &nbsp;And that is assuming that I do the next steps the very days each of the 30 day periods expire.</p>
<p>I called support, and the tech was extremely polite, apologetic, and as helpful as he possibly could have been, however he said (and I believe him) that there was nothing he could do. &nbsp;He just did not have access to any way to change it.</p>
<p>This is a HUGE inconvenience. There is no point playing on an account I intend to delete in 90 days, so after 2 years of not using my Xbox at all, essentially I have to wait a MINIMUM of another 3 months before it is worth playing on again since I deleted
 the other account and cannot redownload it. &nbsp;There is no reason to put customers through these kinds of exercises in futility.</p>
<p>I do understand the potential security risks, and I am glad for the heightened security. &nbsp;However, there should be some way around this in extreme circumstances if you can absolutely prove your identity. &nbsp;If they don't trust the judgement of the technicians,
 put it on the shoulders of supervisors. &nbsp;Make me send a copy of my driver's license. &nbsp;Use something like Goolge authenticator, send me a text, ask me what color my mother's childhood best friend's dog's collar was. &nbsp;But don't just deny an honest customer the
 ability to do what seems like it should be a simple task because of the dishonest ones.</p>
<p>They have lost my money. &nbsp;I was really looking forward to playing on Xbox Live and planned on buying a Gold subcription, but I don't think it is worth the trouble of taking extra steps every 30 days for the next three months before I can do it. &nbsp;My bank's
 website doesn't even hassle me this much.</p>
<p>That's all I got. &nbsp;I am very frustrated by this and I am going to bed. &nbsp;Goodbye Xbox, hello [insert competing console here].</p>

<p>Update: &nbsp;I would just like to add that since my last post, my Hotmail has (once again) been hacked for the purpose of sending spam to random people in my contact list. &nbsp;Great job Microsoft, make the customers wait 90 days as a security precaution, despite
 the fact that it is ineffective. &nbsp;I think they are working against the wrong enemies here. &nbsp;They don't seem to be making the hackers' lives any more difficult, just ours.</p>
<p>You know how many days you have to wait to buy a gun? &nbsp;5. &nbsp;That's right. &nbsp;Not 90, not 30, not even 15. &nbsp;So I ask the question, how much (ineffective) security do we really need?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The application you are using is the one which is downloaded through the Microsoft Store. That version does not have the option to turn off the Automatically Start Skype. You have to use the standalone version which is downloaded through this link:
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To uninstall what you currently have and install the standalone one, you have to open your Settings from your Start Menu, go to Apps and Devices and find Skype under the list of applications, then choose on Uninstall/Remove.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version downloaded through the link I provided should have the option to turn off the Automatically Start Skype using the steps above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know the updates. </p>

    <title>JW LIBRARY APP - NOW WORKING on windows 10 &#40;64 bits&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            JW LIBRARY APP - NOW WORKING on windows 10 &#40;64 bits&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just posting here to mention that JW library - while at first not launching - now works fine on a PC with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my first install, the JW App correctly downloaded but seemed unable to go further than opening the JW start logo and show the "loading wheel" ....forever.</p>
<p>Reading forums I first thought it could be a profile or disk problem but my Station works with no trouble with other software.</p>
<p>Plus with my SSD disk It boots in few seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the only second step I took *and the last needed one was from the SEARCH Menu :</p>
<p>- looked for the "Magnifying Glass" on the far left bottom:</p>
<p>- reached for the JW Lib App Icon, Right Clic on it with your mouse.</p>
<p>- Opened the APP SETTINGS</p>
<p>- Pressed the RESET button. (&nbsp; On windows10 it shows one button, down this setting s "page")</p>
<p>...waitted.</p>
<p>and that´s the problem was solved.</p>
<p>The JW library opened this time up to the Menu where I coudl start downloading the Bible, and than other literature.</p>
<p>One thing, is depending on your connection, it might take a while before "things" start to display so one as to be patient..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thats all, hope it serves as many as possible.</p>
<p>Good use to all !</p>
<p>

<h3> delaneysullivan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD on Startup&#40;Driver verification&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Recently my computer started getting alot of BSOD crashes while in use, after looking up some of the errors and stop codes I concluded that faulty drivers were at work and completed the 4th option on this article:&nbsp;http://smallbusiness.chron.com/scan-corrupt-outofdate-drivers-29427.html&nbsp;</p>
<p>After completion it required my PC to restart, now on startup it crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried inseting a windows 10 recovery disc and preforming the starup repair only to be meet with a message saying starp up repair error. I've tried all the solutions listed in the following post and none so far have worked. https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-driver-verifier-bsod-loop-how-to-get/1d205a9c-181d-45e6-9122-79d03a5147f5</p>

<p>Hi I suggest you create a media creation tool, which you can use to repair or reinstall Windows. Let me know how things go!</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The tool will walk you through how to set up Windows 10 on your PC.
<ul>
<li>If you don’t have a license to install Windows 10 and you have not previously upgraded to Windows 10, you can purchase a copy of Windows 10, see
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-10.</a></li><li>If you previously upgraded to Windows 10 on this PC and you’re reinstalling it, you don’t need to enter a product key. Your copy of Windows 10 will automatically activate later using your digital license.</li></ul>
</li><li>When Windows 10 is ready to install, you’ll see a recap of what you’ve chosen, and what will be kept through the upgrade. Select
<strong>Change what to keep</strong> to set whether you would like to <strong>Keep personal files and apps</strong>, or
<strong>Keep personal files only</strong>, or choose to keep <strong>Nothing</strong> during the upgrade.</li><li>Save and close any open apps and files you may be running, and when you’re ready, select
<strong>Install</strong>.</li><li>It might take some time to install Windows 10, and your PC will restart a few times.
<strong>Make sure you don’t turn off your PC.</strong></li></ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hi ALHicks,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It’s great to know that you are using Windows 8 and thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As per the description, the Windows update is stuck on the screen “Preparing to Install” while installing the updates for Windows 8. I can definitely help you with this issue. Let me have a clear understanding of the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are you able to boot into the computer now? Or are you still on the same screen?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What are the KB numbers of the updates that have failed to install and what are the error codes shown?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you done any recent change on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you have any third party security program installed in the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you try any troubleshooting steps to fix this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>6)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What Internet Connection are you using? Is it a Wired/Wireless connection?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To find the KB numbers of the updates that failed to install, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press “Windows Logo” + “W” and type “Updates” in the search box.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>B.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on “View update history” on the left pane.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can also check the article:<b> </b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>How will I know what updates have been installed? </span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-update-faq</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This will show you the name of the updates that were installed successfully and the updates that have failed to install. I request you to make a note of the failed updates and reply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This might be due to some conflicting programs in the computer. Let’s try these steps and check the result.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are not able to boot the computer (If the computer is still on the same screen of “Preparing to Install”), then I would suggest you to reboot the computer manually by holding the power button and then try these methods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This troubleshooter is an automated tool which will check the windows update components in the computer for any known issues and then provides the details and on how to fix them. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Type “Troubleshooting” in the search bar and press “Enter”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In the “Troubleshooting” window, click on “View All” on the left pane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on “Windows Update”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on “Advanced” and then click on “Run as Administrator”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click “Next” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now, check the issue. If it is still happening, then let’s temporarily disable the security program in the computer (If you have installed any) to avoid any interference.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: </span>Temporarily disable the third party security program. (If you have installed any)</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have installed a third party security program, then I request you to contact its technical support to temporarily disable the program and then check the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it
 as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, then let’s place the computer in clean boot and then try installing the updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3: Install updates in Clean Boot.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Perform a Clean Boot</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Display driver removed after installing windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Display driver removed after installing windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Lenovo G580 model 21057. It came with windows 8 but i updated it do windows 8.1.Last evening fed up of the notification that read 'your pc is compatible with windows 10 upgrade now',i installed windows 10 from windows 8.1. All stuff was compatible
 including all drivers so i happily upgraded my pc. After an hour or so windows 10 was installed with all things working (mousepad,wifi,ethernet,display,etc). Yes display too (bcoz it created problems for some people) but when i tried to increase or decrease
 my brightness it didn't work. I went to device manager -&gt; display adapters. To my surprise the only driver was listed as 'Microsoft Basic Display Adapter'. Can you help for where my original driver that was Intel HD Graphics 4000 went ? I tried to update it
 by right clicking -&gt; Update driver software -&gt; Browse my computer -&gt; Let me pick and installed the only driver there. After installation everything became too big so i went to control panel -&gt; Display -&gt; Change Display settings to reduce resolution. But there
 i got other 2 suprises. Firstly,the resolution option was blacked out ! Second, the display was Generic Non-PnP monitor instead of previous Generic PnP monitor ! Please help me with this ! Or can i update Microsoft Basic Display Adapter such that it can work
 like my previous driver (increase/decrease brightness, change resolution,etc). I don't want to go back to windows 8.1</p>

<p>
</p><p>I understand the frustration when things don't work as expected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo G580 is currently not compatible with Windows 10. I would therefore request you to install the drivers in compatibility mode and then check if it helps.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can right click on the driver file, then click Properties &gt; then click the compatibility tab.

<h2>            Command and Conquer First Decade Download Error</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been trying to download a store-bought copy of c&amp;c first decade to my laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using a 13-inch non-retina MacBook Pro (2012, 2.9GHz Quad-Core i7, 8GB of RAM, 750 GB HD, INTEL HD 4000 graphics) with a Windows 7 partition that I made with Apple's Boot Camp Assistant. I don't know if all the drivers I had to install to get Windows
 to work on my laptop have anything to do with the error message I have been getting.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am in my 3rd time trying to install it and it always gets stuck at: "C:\... \Data\Movies\Training_Final_00s.bik" &nbsp;and the error is "Data error (cyclic redundancy check)." The component is "Generals" and the file is "D:\data12.cab"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really hope someone can get back to me soon!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you so much!</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the issue on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided, it looks like you get the cycle redundancy check error while installing a Command and conquer game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The error message “<strong>DATA ERROR (CYCLIC REDUNDANCY CHECK)”</strong> means that the operating system cannot read or write the data correctly. This can happen if the CD/DVD has damaged information or the data downloaded is corrupt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to download the file to a different location and then try to install it.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also contact <strong>Command and Conquer</strong> support for further assistance.</span></p>

            Thanks for your response!<br />
<br />
I have a few questions. So currently im downloading it to the 'Documents' folder. For example, do you mean that I download it to the desktop or another location besides the 'Documents' folder?<br />
<br />
If nothing works would you recommend that I go and buy a new disc?<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

            <p>I believe I did get it to work. Instead of saving all the download files to your documents folder try saving it to the desktop. When I did this it worked for me. I no longer have my MacBook (fortunately) and I got a gaming PC that can handle anything I throw
 at it. Let me know if it works or not and I can try to guide you from their.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Audio for headset not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I installed to the new version of Windows 10. At the same time I also ran a program called DriverPack Solution, which updated a few of drivers, including RealTek HD Audio Manager. I have no idea what caused it, but the audio for my headset does not work.
 It works on speakers from the monitors, but not the headset. I tried to check if the problem was the headset, but it works fine on my brother's computer. I also have a sound card, more specific the Sound Blaster Z-series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the problem was the updated drivers from DriverPack Solution, and tried re-installing the old one, but it still didn't work. So it's either a driver updated from DriverPack, or it's the new Windows version, or it's some incompatibility with a new
 driver and my sound card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I now try to re-download the new Audio HD Manager it keeps looping the installation. I have completely uninstalled it about five times, and it still loops, even though I go to driver manager og deletes the Audio thingy from there. No idea what's
 happening, but I know I can't use my headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's of any interest it's the Sennheiser G4me Zero, the old models, when the headset were about 300$. Believe they got 150 ohms instead of 50 or whatever the change was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any solutions, tips or anything else that can help, please post here, as I'm becoming mad from frustation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

However, the arrow pointing up equals transmit (Tx) data, and the arrow pointing down equals Receive (Rx) data.<br /><br />Could you post up the make and model of your modem along with your wireless router.<br /><br />Could you also tell us how you've setup your console, to connect to your gateway. Whether wired, or wireless, is your console connected directly to your gateway, or do you use an additional networking device between your console and your gateway?</p>

<h2>            profile not loading correctly</h2>
                    Since google earth, along with google chrome was installed, my computer has been going hay-wire. It started with one of the users logging on to find that her windows mail was gone &amp; it shows profile not loaded correctly, logging on with temporary profile.
 my profile was fine. I put windows mail back on two times, each time it would take it away when logged off. I deleted user &amp; put back in again, wich seem to fix the problem, then it went to my profile&nbsp;and started the same thing with me. I made a new administrator
 user, and deleted both our users, then put them back in again. That seemed to have worked........, for about five days! now it seems to be starting over again. help!! I am not computer savy.

<p>Or you can try a system restore to the date this all started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
System Restore points are automatically created when the following actions occur:</p>
<p>
In order for System Restore to work you must have 300 MB of free space for each hard disk that System Restore is monitoring. System Restore will also use up to 15% of the disk space on each disk that it monitors. As hard drive space runs out, older restore
 points will be deleted as newer ones are created. It is also important to point out that you must be logged in as an Administrator in order to use System Restore. Now that you understand the basics of System Restore, you should continue to the next section
 to learn how to use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Restoring Windows Vista to a previous State</p>
<p>
In the case of a problem on your computer that cannot be solved by normal means, you can restore your computer back to a previous working state. To do this you need to start System Restore so that you can choose the restore point to restore. If you are currently
 having problems starting Windows Vista, you can use System Restore from the Windows Recovery Environment. Instructions on how to do this can be found in this tutorial: Using System Restore from the Vista Windows Recovery Environment.</p>
<p>
If you can log into Windows Vista, then you should follow these steps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Important Notice</span><span style="font-weight: bold">:
</span><span style="font-style: italic">That System Restore affects Windows system files, programs, and registry settings. It can also make changes to scripts, batch files, and other types of executable files on your computer. Thus, any recently installed programs,
 updates, or changes to configuration will be lost if you use System Restore. However, make note that System Restore does not affect personal files, such as e-mail, documents, or photos, so it cannot help you restore a deleted file.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You will now be at the System Restore screen as shown below in Figure 1. From this screen you can specify the restore point that you would like to restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
By default, Vista will already have selected the <span style="font-weight: bold">Recommended restore</span> option. This restore point is one was made after a new program, driver, or update was installed. If you would like to use this restore point, you can
 click on the <span style="font-weight: bold">Next</span> button to start the restore process. On the other hand, if there is a more recent restore point that you would like to restore you should select
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
2. List of available restore points</p>
<p>
You should select the restore point that you would like to restore and press the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Next</span> button to start the restore process. Vista will display a Window showing your selected restore point and asking you to confirm that this is the one you would like to restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
3. Confirm the selected restore point</p>
<p>
If you would like to select a different restore point press the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Back</span> button. Otherwise you can press the <span style="font-weight: bold">Cancel</span> button to exit System Restore or the
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
4. Second Confirmation</p>
<p>
If you are sure you want to do the restore, then press the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Yes</span> button. Vista will now log you off of the computer and start the System Restore process as shown in Figure 5 below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
5. Restoring a restore point</p>
<p>
When the restore has been completed, you computer will be restarted and when Vista boots back up it will be restored to its previous state. When you log in to Vista for the first time after the restore, you will see a message showing that the restore was successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
6. System restore was successful</p>
<p>
If there are any problems with your computer due to the last restore, you can revert back to your previous settings by going back into the System Restore Utility and selecting the
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>7. Undo the last System Restore</p>
<p>
Your computer should now be working properly again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using System Restore from the Windows Recovery Environment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Manually Creating Restore Points</p>
<p>
As said previously, it is also possible to create manual restore points as needed. Popular reasons to create manual restore points are when you have your computer set up perfectly and would like to save the state in the case of problems in the future. To create
 a manual restore point you need to follow these steps:</p>
<p>
You will now be at the <span style="font-weight: bold">System Protection</span> tab in the System control panel. This tab allows you to enable and disable System Restore as well as make new manual restore points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
8. System Protection tab</p>
<p>
To create the manual restore point you should click on the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Create</span> button. When you press this button a prompt will appear asking you to provide a title for this manual restore point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
9. Enter title for manual restore point</p>
<p>
Type in a title for the manual restore point and press the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Create</span> button. Vista will now create a manual restore point, and when completed, display a notice saying that it was created successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
10. Manual restore point was created</p>
<p>
Now that you have completed making the manual restore point you can close the System window.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Let us know if these steps resolve your problem.&nbsp; I hope the information is useful.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>

                    I have a bluetooth keyboard (Logitech diNovo Mini) that won't work in Win7 RC. When I try to pair it, it just keep on searching for devices, but won't find it. If I turn on bluetooth on my mobile phone, Win7 finds it at once.<br />
<br />
The keyboard works fine in WinXP, and it also did work fine with Win7 beta.<br />

    <title>sticky keys, shortcut keys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dsthall  say:</h3>
<h2>            sticky keys, shortcut keys</h2>
                    I believe this is something associated with windows 7- it never happened until I upgraded to 7...whenever I am typing, many combinations of keys open new tabs, open my pictures, start underlining words, zooms in or out, open browsing history, delete the
 entire page I have just written, etc.&nbsp; I am a fast typer, and am quite accurate.&nbsp; One example is whenever I hit st quickly, it opens a new tab.&nbsp; How do I turn this off? I have searched, and have found the "sticky keys", but turning that off doesn't make a
 difference.&nbsp; I can't type a few sentences without doing things- in the process of writing this email, it started underlining words, moved my cursor to the search tab, and opened my browsing history.&nbsp;
<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'll throw a couple persoanl observations out there.</p>
<p>1) TouchPads are EVIL. A slight brush of your thumb when typing fast and you are opening tem things! If you are using a laptop with a touchpad, diable it for a bit and see if that stops the odd behavior. If it does, get a nice USB mouse (wired or wireless)</p>
<p>2) Speaking of 'Wireless'. Wireless keyboards can have a lag. This can cause odd issues. I just had a change mine out because of similar issue.</p>
<p>3) The system is running slow...just not keeping up. Make sure that you don't have many thing open at one time. Though Windows can multitask well, your hardware might not be able to keep up the pace! Check the Notification Bar in the lower right corner of
 Taskbar. There should only be a few things running. If you have more than 6 itens, I would see which ones you can eliminate.</p>
<p>Here are the basics: Network, Speakers, Anti Virus, Safely Remove Hardware, Battery(laptop), Outlook(if that is what you use).</p>
<p>4) Make sure you have the latest drivers for your Computer.&nbsp;Mouse and Keyboard to start with, but everything else as well. Go to your computer manufacturers site to make sure you have the latest versions.</p>
<p>5) Check System Performance by opening Task Manager. Right-click the Taskbar and select it. Look at the Performance tab. If it is using a LOT of system memory and/or CPU, you should look at Processes to see what is using&nbsp;it all.</p>
<p>6) Windows 7 should run good with 1GB RAM, but if you have a lot of programs running, you will really be taxing the system.</p>
<p>I hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Bedrock Nether Conversation failed, need to reset it.</h2>
                    <p>Hey, can't find an answer or similar problem anywhere. I have my Xbox bedrock map converted from 360 and despite reseting the nether, then converting, it has retained the 1:3 Overworld to Nether size ratio rather than the 1:8.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any advice on how to remedy this? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Mojang was no assistance but thought I'd follow xbox's advertisement for using the support forum.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't done so, I recommend posting this same question over on <a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.minecraftforum.net/</a>&nbsp;and even on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Minecraft subreddit</a>&nbsp;to get more exposure on those community sites since you will get answers from other players who are more familiar with Minecraft's gameplay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the basis that the world did not convert correctly, have you done basic troubleshooting on both of your console's? Like
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/console/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clearing the system cache on the Xbox 360</a> and a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hard reset on the Xbox One</a>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't play Minecraft myself so I'm not familiar with the conversion process but take a look at this support article and make sure everything is done correctly:

            Just to add to the above, the worlds are seperate, as in they are in different .mc files. It is possible for the to easily get corrupted especially during conversion.

 Farsi and u can install it on almost any version of XP with Service Pack 2.0.</p>
<p>You can get LIP for Farsi from this link:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have no Internet connection on my PC (other devices fine), when I troubleshoot I get the error message "windows 7 could not automatically detect this network's proxy settings". I'm using windows 7, has been working fine for over a year. Have tried similar
 threads but no joy. &nbsp; Tried restarting computer and router, resetting winsock, enabling and disabling the network card, ticking and unticking proxy settings boxes in LAN settings. Not sure what my IP address is, would love someone to talk me through some options.
 It's a wireless connection that works fine with other devices, I'm posting from my iPod.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help! Been like this for days, and I do all my work through the PC... It's driving me nuts.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Thanks.</div>

                    <p>I have a Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse paired on both my Dell XPS 15 L521X and Asus VivoTab Note 8, both running Windows 10, and the following behavior occurs on both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can successfully pair and discover the device, and it functions fine. But if I shut down the mouse and bluetooth on the computer, then turn it on at a later time, the device does not automatically reconnect. Instead, I must first unpair the device, then
 re-pair it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open Show Bluetooth devices upon a shutdown, I do see that the device is still paired. However, when I turn on the mouse and hit the bluetooth pairing button on it, it does not reconnect, although the indicator light is flashing, suggesting its discoverable.
 Only after I un-pair and re-pair does it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center installed on both devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get these devices to connect with the Sculpt Comfort Mouse when discoverable without having to un-pair and re-pair each time? Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks! I got a new mouse (it was just under warranty) and this one seems to work. So, it seems like it was a hardware issue.&nbsp;</p>
