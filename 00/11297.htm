<h2>            Changing the language of Microsoft Office for mac</h2>
                    Dear experts,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just got myself Office 365 and even though I chose English as a languege I wanted the whole thing to be in, I guess because I paid with a Russian card the system automatically assumed that I need it in Russian. How do I change it?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thank you</div>

            You will need to&nbsp;download the English version. Some sites are&nbsp;downloading the .exe version instead of Mac version. If you experience this problem,&nbsp;<span>use one of the following links (2011- 365 Mac, 14.3.8)&nbsp;</span>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mobil on Lumia 635 &#40;512&#41; Through the insider program</h2>
                    <p>I have a 635 (512) &nbsp;and it has been updated to 10586.218 through the insider program. Does anybody know&nbsp;what our friends at Microsoft will do about this phone?</p>
<p>Will it have to be reverted to 8.1 or will it just stay at 10585.218? </p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>it isn't stupid. the insider program is a program to test the next versions of windows.</p>
<p>you're not getting the next version of windows, so you shouldn't be using insider builds anymore. any feedback/telemetry from such devices is useless. the objective of this program&nbsp;isn't to "give windows 10" to people.

<p>Than I used the Windows Update Advisor after version 1607 was released mid of August.</p>
<p>
</p><p>on my Lumia 640 I already got build 14393.82 a few days ago but for the Lumia 635 I did not get &nbsp;this update till now.</p>

<p>Update 15.03.2018 : since a few weeks I got Version 1607 / Build 10.0.14393.2007 (released in January 2018) on my Lumia 635 with 512MB RAM.&nbsp;<span>This seems to be the last update we may get.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Lumia 635 with 512MB works good (but not as fast as my Lumia 640) and I recognized that some applications stopped working, I guess due to out of memory issues.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>My other Lumia 640 LTE is now on Version 1709 / Build 10.0.15254.248 and hope to be updated also in Future (as long as possible)</p>

<p>Could be. However, it could be a hardware failure (some component could not be started) or even a SIM failure (SIM does not react the way it was expected). In any case, either go for a local and official Nokia Care Centre or a new phone.</p>

<p>I doubt that you will be able to re-install device software using Nokia Suite in it's current state and you would need to visit Nokia Care facility for this to be attempted.</p>

<h3> pajamastowork  say:</h3>
<h2>            where is the insert drawing canvas command for word 2011 on mac that exist on windows based word&#63;</h2>
                    I am accustomed to using Word on a PC. &nbsp;Not sure why more things aren't consistent in office between the two platforms -- frustrating at times.
<div><br />
<div>Anyways, where is the insert drawing canvas command in word 2011 for mac? &nbsp;I use it frequently in Office 2010 on a PC. &nbsp;(insert -&gt;shapes -&gt; New Drawing Canvas)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have some old word files with the canvas intact so it seems it is at least compatible with the mac side. &nbsp;Did they remove the insert command? &nbsp;Also,&nbsp;I noticed the "smart art" shapes seem to have a canvas like surrounding but they have such specific flow
 chart graphics that aren't really useful to me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If the canvas command doesn't exist anymore is there another way to group text images? I'm hoping there's another way than the group command--it doesn't really change size well. &nbsp;I liked the way that the canvas could be resized and preserved spatial relationships
 between object.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance</div>

            In Word 2011, there is no separate command. &nbsp;When you insert a drawing object, the Drawing Canvas is created automatically.
<div><br />
<div>However, the bad news is that you will see that MOST of the capability for drawing has been removed from Word 2011. &nbsp;I agree with you, in normal corporate work, I can find no use for the stuff in the SmartArt tab, but I use the old drawing tools constantly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What you will find is that you can draw your pictures in PowerPoint, which uses the same graphics engine. &nbsp;PowerPoint presents the controls better, and places the Arrange menu, where you can find the rest of the drawing tools, on the Home tab. &nbsp;The "Group"
 command will appear on the Arrange menu when you have multiple objects selected. &nbsp;The Graphics Cursor (white arrow) has gone too: the normal cursor will enable drag-selection of graphic objects.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When you have finished, simply copy and paste them into Word.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

 the command button, I've used regedit, I've used just about everything under the sun, I've written little programs that I would never write in a million years because I'm not a technician, I have searched the whole of the internet for hours a day and have
 come up with nothing.&nbsp; Nothing anyone has said has worked.&nbsp; My machine used to work like a dream. It had no problems whatsoever, ever!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so naffed off with this now (which all started when Windows 10 started putting unwanted&nbsp;updates on my machine), that I am willing to give £200 to ANYONE&nbsp; who knows how to fix this problem or give it to a Charity of your choice who I will ask to contact
 you to prove I did it.&nbsp; I can't stand it anymore.&nbsp; If you think you are in with a chance, please come up with something original because the chances are I have tried your "fix" and it hasn't worked.&nbsp; I really have tried everything that nearly everyone on the
 community board and other places have said so really, think about what you tell me to try because I've probably already done it.</p>

            There is no way for an end-user to add a language to a Nokia phone. You can take it to the service point and get them to change over the phone's Language Pack to one that includes Farsi, but they may charge you for that, and it will revert to its original
 Language Pack if you update the phone's software.

<p>Instead of going to the trouble of installing a new language on your E71, you can download and install the international version of opera browser from
<a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.opera.com/mobile/download/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have installed it on my cell phone. It's fantastic. I check websites like bbcpersian very easily without changing the language settings of my handphone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<p>Hi.. Lex,</p>
<p>I have Lumia 640 xl. It's OS build is 10.0.14393.1066 . I haven't done any troubleshooting yet. The phone's internal memory is 7.28 GB. There is no app in my internal memory instead of pre installed app. And 1.08 gb of pending updates are in temporary files.
 Now my memory is 7.20 GB full out of 7.28 GB.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86d86af4-e507-49d2-845e-8998d95076a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86d86af4-e507-49d2-845e-8998d95076a3" /></a></p>

    <title>XBox Music App Issues - Windows Phone 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmmontal  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox Music App Issues - Windows Phone 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I installed the Developer Preview of Windows Phone 8.1 earlier today, and was frustrated to discover that the dedicated XBox Music app has seemingly not been updated at all since it was released as a Beta months ago. Of course since this app replaces the
 stock Music app, and since the WP8.1 Developer Preview cannot be rolled back to an older version of the OS, I advise anyone installing WP8.1 early to beware (if you care about your music collection). The new XBox Music app is considerably worse than even it's
 predecessor. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This has certainly been documented in other threads, for instance in AndySteck's

 "Xbox Music Preview" Comments Here</a></span> thread, however I thought I'd post this discussion to confirm that the app remains in its current awful form even with the recent OS update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Major Issues</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>We are back to XBM overriding all metadata - song names, artist names, album names, and album art are all being rewritten in my collection. The app is also splitting up and/or combining albums. There is no longer the "Connect to XBM" setting that can be
 toggled on and off. In the previous version, even with this setting enabled the app had at least become smart enough to not overwrite existing metadata (at least for me) - it would only add in missing metadata (for instance an album cover that had not been
 manually attached to the tags). So we are back to square one with this - the one major flaw that was fixed in XBM on WP8 is now completely broken again, a year and a half after this platform launched.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>The second part of this issue is that even in cases where the app is not overriding metadata, it is often not recognizing it at all. So in addition to having XBM override some of my existing album art, I also have tons of blank album art now even though
 every song in my collection has album art permanently embedded in the file. It's also suffering from a lack of artist backgrounds.&nbsp;
</del><strong>Update 8/28:</strong> Album art is now being populated in most cases. In many cases the app is still overriding my embedded album art, despite the notes claiming it will no longer do this. I am also still seeing many albums that are split into
 multiple instances, or combined where they shouldn't be. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to have affected the sync utilities also (at least the Desktop Sync App, and yes mine is updated to the most current version). I just noticed that some songs in my collection are back to not syncing properly. I'm also seeing that playlists are
 being changed when they sync - for instance a specific song in a playlist might be replaced with a live version of that song. Looking back at the playlist on my local computer however, everything is correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only available setting is "Show Streaming Music In My Collection" - everything else syncs automatically. So for instance there's no way to separate out cloud playlists from ones you added manually to your device - even with the view set strictly to "SD
 Card", it is showing duplicates of all my playlists, as well as playlists in my cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>The app is extreeeeemely sluggish - way worse than the previous version. Average time for me to navigate is 3-5 seconds between taps. Even when jumping to a letter in your collection, you are immediately greeted with a blank list that needs to repopulate
 to show your collection again, taking several more seconds.</del> <strong>Update 6/10:
</strong>App seems to have picked up some amount of navigational speed, but still nowhere near as snappy as the WP8.0 version, which wasn't even itself all that fast compared to
<em>its</em> predecessor. This update claims that "Artist backgrounds now load more smoothly", yet on my device (Lumia 1520) it still takes around 5 seconds between track changes for the artist background to load.
<strong>Update 6/19:</strong> After today's update, the app is even slower to navigate than when it first launched. It's now taking a full 8 seconds to load when navigating between presses (i.e. tapping on an artist, tapping on an album, etc.).
</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>The app is currently limited to only playing 100 songs at a time. Shuffling all the music in your collection from the home screen? It actually is just creating a random 100-song slice to listen to. Have a playlist that has 100+ songs in it? You can't
 listen to that playlist in its entirety anymore.&nbsp;</del></p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Other Frustrating Changes</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The changes to the sizing of everything is really cumbersome. Text is so unnecessarily huge now that album names, artist names, and song names, get truncated very heavily, to the point where in some cases I can't even tell what I'm looking at because I am
 not seeing enough of the name. It's as if this were re-designed for an elderly person with poor vision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as I've complained previously, there is no longer any way to rate songs. I just added a new album to my collection a couple weeks ago - did I like that 7th song? Did I want to keep it? Delete it? Add it to a playlist? I can't remember - wish there was
 some way to remind myself at a glance if I liked a song or not...</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>The new Now Playing screen is less efficient space-wise because it must now display the giant XBOX MUSIC text banner across the top - as a result a lot of previously well-used screen real estate is lost. For instance, under Now Playing (specifically
 below the playing song's timer bar) the app now only displays the song title and the artist. Previously this space was reserved for the currently playing song title, and the
</del><em><del>next two</del></em><del> upcoming tracks. You must now click a separate icon (looks like a little list) to see the upcoming songs. This stinks for users who like to shuffle, as it is really helpful to be able to see at a glance what tracks are
 coming up without having to navigate.</del> <strong>Updated 5/23:</strong> Now Playing layout has been revised. "Current Song by Artist" now sits atop album art. Album art has been increased in size. "Up Next: Next Song by Artist" now sits below album art/scroll
 bar. Overall this is an improvement, but still not as logically laid out compared to the 8.0 app. There is no hierarchy of scale in the text (everything is the same size, so it all reads the same), so your eye doesn't go to what's currently playing, especially
 since all the controls are now at the bottom (your eye logically goes to the bottom).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also no text to tell you what the name of the album is - you have to rely on the album art, which of course is not always accurate, or may even be blank in certain rare albums.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>Clicking on the upcoming song moves the track forward. This is really confusing, since clicking on the currently playing song actually takes you to that song's album in your collection. I would thinking clicking the upcoming song would take me to
</del><em><del>that </del></em><del>track's album. There are already two ways to advance the song (the fast forward button and swiping down on album art), why waste possible functionality on a third redundant method for skipping to the next track?</del>
<strong>Update:</strong> This no longer seems to be the case. This functionality was removed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>Since the Now Playing screen is baked into the overall app layout, you no longer have the ability to navigate ahead or back a track by swiping the album art. This was useful when you were partway through a track and wanted to go directly to the previous
 track, rather than skipping back to the beginning of the current track. It was also just a quicker way to navigate.</del>
<strong>Updated 5/23:</strong> swipe capabilities have been added (swipe up/down on album art to advance forward/back).
</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>There is no longer a list of recently played / new items.</del> <strong>Update:
</strong>This feature has been added. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When looking at lists of songs (whether in Song view, or looking at the content of a Playlist), the small text under the song title now only displays the artist name, rather than the artist and album. Have multiple versions of a song from different albums
 (say, from a studio vs live album)? Now you have no way of knowing which is which before playing. Strangely, once you play a set of songs, then you
<em>do </em>get the artist and album - why on earth can't this be universal?</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>The LiveTile no longer displays any information when playing music - there is no scrolling text or artist imagery.</del>
<strong>Update: 8/28 - </strong>Live Tile now displays artist art and name of artist. Would like to see more info in future updates, i.e. ability to choose from a couple Live Tile options, including option to show current song, album, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding music to Now Playing now adds it to the end of whatever list of music you're listening to, rather than queuing it up as the next upcoming track. So you now have to navigate all the way to the end of the Now Playing list to hear the new music you just
 queued up. This makes Add to: Now Playing pretty much useless when listening to more than a few tracks at a time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When clicking on the icon to display all the upcoming music in Now Playing, the screen often does not automatically jump to the currently playing track - it instead starts at your currently playing track, and on subsequent views it stays on wherever in the
 list you last left off. So if you are well into whatever list of music you are listening to and you want to see what's coming up next, you have to hunt through the whole queue to find your currently playing song and see what's coming after it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When scrolling through the list of currently playing songs, you can only scroll by touching the actual song title - if you touch the black area of the screen, the software will not register your touch. Oddly, once you have the list scrolling, you
<em>can</em> touch the black area of the screen to continue scrolling - it works if the list is in motion, but not when it is static. This does not seem to happen in other areas of the app that require scrolling, just in the list of queued currently playing
 songs. </p>

<p>Thanks Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When playing music, there is currently nothing displayed on the live tile at all except the word "Music" in the lower left corner and the headphone icons that symbolize the app. This goes for all views. Even in wide format, there is no scrolling text or
 imagery of any sort. So it remains exactly as it did before - I believe the app has not seen an update at all (at least for us on the user end) since the Beta was released a few months ago.

            Wow that's totally lame! Currently I have the stock app pinned on my screen simply so that the artist artwork is displayed when playing music. In fact it will show the artwork regardless if the music was initiated with the stock, or preview app. Can't
 believe they removed one of the only cool things about the music experience!

<p>Right - I can only hope this will be updated soon. I'd like to say that maybe there will be a more fully fleshed out version that is released once WP8.1 goes out to the general public, but who knows when that will be (I've simply read "sometime this summer").</p>

<p>Totally lame sums it up. I have to imagine that they did not "remove" this feature though, but rather that the app simply hasn't been updated to include it yet (I believe they were again re-creating this app mostly from scratch for this release). Here's
 hoping that we can expect more frequent updates this time around...<br />

I just updated, and the sluggish-ness is really a pain in the ****. 



Also, one thing that I do is make these biig playlists... Like, almost 300 songs. I like to put music that I listen to often into a single space (the recent section of the app isn't big enough in my opinion). So now that I've updated, when I start playing the songs, it can only display a fraction of the songs I have in the playlist. The songs are still in the playlist, but they don't transfer to the "now playing" list. It seems like they established a limit of the number of songs that can go on the now playing queue. I just don't see the logic behind it. 



As for compiling playlists though, it's much easier. You don't have to create a new playlist every single time you want to change it. Instead, you can simply add songs to a playlist, which is really nice.  



But if anyone from Microsoft reads this, please consider making the changes mentioned in my post and OP.

<p>I noticed back when the Beta version first came out that when you used the "Shuffle All" button (which theoretically plays all the music in your collection in random order), it would only queue up a random 100 songs at a time. I hadn't noticed at the time
 if that applies to playlists as well - but hearing this I'm sure you're right.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>At the time I speculated that it might have been a measure to reduce the insane lag when trying to play large amounts of music all at once. It's a real shame as I too listen to most of my collection through playlists, many of which are well over 100 songs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just gave this a test - it displays a single static artist image. No text or other info, and the image is pretty low-res (tested this with a number of artists).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            SharePoint - Calendar  issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a SharePoint page, and on the front page a calendar is loaded.&nbsp; It however is not showing the events from the list that is used to create it.&nbsp; The weird thing is that when you choose to Edit the page, the events appear - OR - when you click on the
 title of the calendar to open it on its own the events appear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what we have tried thus far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting and readding the calendar</li><li>Calendar Overlays</li><li>Calendar settings</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In Edit mode you can see events:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Non Edit mode - NO EVENTS visible</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Corrie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. How do you "load" the SharePoint Online calendar to the site home page, click Edit page&gt;Insert&gt;App part&gt;select that Calendar app? If not, please let us know more details about your steps.
</p>
<p>2. Capture some screenshots as below.</p>
<p>a. One screenshot for the calendar in the SharePoint page (which should have no events)</p>
<p>b. One screenshot for the calendar itself (which should have events)</p>
<p>c. In the SharePoint page, click Edit, capture a screenshot for the calendar (which should have events)</p>
<p>3. URLs of the SharePoint site and calendar. </p>
<p>4. Create a new SharePoint calendar. Use the same method to load it in the same SharePoint page. Check the outcome. Add SharePoint Calendar to other pages in the site. See if the issue is related to specific calendar or site page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To protect your privacy, I have sent you a <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
private message</a> to collect URLs and screenshots mentioned above. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Hi Corrie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to my private message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The CustomerExperience seems to be a sub site of https://domain.sharepoint.com. If yes, I want to confirm if that SharePoint calendar created in this sub site or in root site.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, is this sub site using the same permission from root site (in sub site&gt;click setting gear&gt;Site Settings&gt;Site Permissions&gt;if you see Stop inheriting, it means the sub site uses the same permission as root site)? Is the calendar using the same permission
 of that sub site (access that calendar&gt;click CALENDAR tab&gt;List Settings&gt;Permission for this list&gt;see if it shows Stop inheriting permissions)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you create another calendar and add it to the same page? Let's check if the issue is only related to specific calendar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<h2>            Visio database model&#58; How to uncheck &#34;Child has parent&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to create a IDEF1X data model diagram that has has a required non-identifying relationship. I have placed two entities and a relationship on the diagram.</p>
<p>If the relationship is not attached to the identities the "Child has parent" checkbox on the miscellaneous section of database properties is active and I can check or uncheck it. (When doing so, the diamond symbol properly appears and disappears on the dashed
 line representing the relationship.)</p>
<p>If I attach the relationship to the entities, the "Child has parent" box gets checked and greyed out. How do I uncheck this box and have a diagram with no diamond symbol and a dashed line?</p>

            I found a workaround for this, though it would be nice if this just worked.&nbsp; If you make the relationship identifying, and then immediately make it non-identifying, the "Child has parent" checkbox becomes unchecked.&nbsp; I'm guessing this is all just a bug.

                    Is there any possible way to change the font style that is used in the menus and toolbars in Office Professional 2013? I feel like they're all yelling at me because they're in capital letters and I would just like to know if there is a setting to change
 them to lowercase, or the proper capitalization.

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I think I can help you.</p>
<p>First you must be a Windows Insider. The following link will take you there. After a few formalities you will have the choice to download the latest version ( Build 9879 ). Also just in case write down the product key they display.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/preview</a>
</p>
<p>Burn the ISO file to a DVD disk. Pick yours ( 32 or 64 bit ).</p>
<p>I think you mean " without loosing any data ", that you want to save pictures, important documents, music, videos and so on. If you have 2 hard drives installed in your computer, you can moved those files to that 2nd HD. If not you will need to burn or copy&nbsp;those
 files/data to a CD or DVD blank disk.</p>
<p>The reason is that there is always a possibility that the install will erase the data you want saved.</p>
<p>That's it, and run the install DVD.</p>
<p>Let me know if this was helpful, and did it solve the issue.?</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>
