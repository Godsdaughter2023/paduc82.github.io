<h2>            Trump pic gets &#34;offending content&#34; ban</h2>
                    <p>I was recently banned for having a trump picture that had a pistol in his hand. I know&nbsp;the persons that did this was a group platoon&nbsp;that I was beating in a game of Battlefield last night. They attempted to send me party invites, even after they would rarely kill me and teabag me afterwards. I knew if I went into that party, it would have been nothing but nonsense said. I&nbsp;did not report that but I still don't understand how that group could get me banned for a picture of trump. I've seen much worse gamer pics than what I had and it still passed your parameters as far as offensive content</p>

            <p>I have no answer to this question. To get a meaningful answer, you will have to be much more specific about what you want to know. For example, do you want to know the lngth of time it took the legislation that set up Microsoft as a Corporastion, a body
 in law, to pas all the formalities of the legislative body and be proclaimed into law?</p>
<p>You will also have to do some research to determine who to ask. Try looking at the MS corporate directory, locating a likely person and call their office. In my eaperience, they are amazingle helpful.</p>

<p>Glad to helps with such things but I don't think anyone here will actually do your homework for you.</p>

<h2>            We couldn&#39;t install windows 8. &#34;We&#39;ve set your PC back to the way it was right before you started installing Windows 8.&#34;&#8207;</h2>
                    Getting this error every time i try to install windows 8:&nbsp;
<div><br />
We couldn't install windows 8. "We've set your PC back to the way it was right before you started installing Windows 8"‏&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This question has been asked many times without any useful responses from Microsoft. All i have seen are long lists of steps to try and clean or disable features on your current system. This is all well and good for those who actually have corrupted systems
 - What is microsoft doing about the rest of the users who are&nbsp;angrily&nbsp;reporting that they can't install windows 8 on perfectly clean systems?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All that happens is that the computer will restart after preparing the installation, it will show the blue windows 8 icon, the rotating snake will spin for about 20 seconds and then the snake will freeze. Part of the windows logo will be slightly faded
 and then some time later my PC will restart and take me back to windows 7.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I bought windows 8 on friday and have spent the last 5 days doing absolutely everything i can to get this running. I had microsoft support remote into my computer to repair my windows 7 install and it made no difference. He told me a clean install of windows
 7 was required. I have since done this twice and it made no difference.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have unplugged all devices from my PC, pulled out unimportant PCI cards, i have booted in different modes, run system file checker, debugged my system, cleaned out all my windows.old folders, i've booted from desktop, from usb, from dvd, clean installed
 windows 7 etc. - All this paints a pretty obvious&nbsp;picture&nbsp;that my system is in a perfectly good condition. It has no issues running windows 7 nor is it corrupted in any way.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Before i bought windows 8 the installer told me that windows 8 was compatible with my machine - Therefore i expect the install to work. I am pretty sure the installer is faulty. It doesn't make any difference what condition my machine is in or what hardware
 i am using, the installer fails at the same point every time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm really not looking for any advice on how to fix this because I know that there is nothing else to do on my end. I simply want to know if Microsoft is going to release a patched installer or if there is a way to get an updated version of it. It is broken
 and does not work. If not, can someone direct me to a place where i can get a refund?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            We are in the exact same boat, although my PC is not new.&nbsp; The kicker with this whole process is that the installation never tells you why that it failed.&nbsp; I burnt the ISO to a disk and tried all 3 install options and none of them work and I have no idea
 why.&nbsp; Awesome!<br />

            <p>You might want to consider choosing the option 'Keep personal files only' doing the upgrade. Its possible an offending application or driver is preventing the upgrade from completing successfully.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to keep your Windows Settings and Personal files, you can keep your personal files too when upgrading from Windows 7. If you choose Nothing, Windows 8 will place your files in a folder called Windows.old.</p>

<div>I am aware of how this works, i have tried this for about half of the 18 times i tried installing windows 8 - I also don't see how this is relevant considering i have re-installed windows 7 with no drivers or applications and the installer continues to
 fail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Like i said, i'm not really asking for further help, i just want to know if microsoft is releasing a patched installer for windows 8.</div>

            6 hours with support, a solution from a tier 2 tech that didn't work. Microsoft, when are you going to admit that there is a problem with your installer?
<div><br />
<div>Are you releasing a patch? Yes or no?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've spent 25-30 hours on this delightful experience already but if the answer is no, where do i go to get a refund?</div>

            So i've done my own research and i found some error logs that say this:

<div><br />
<div>From what i can this is related to asus. However, i've tried installing files, removing them, updating them and nothing stops these errors from occurring.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>These errors get logged after checking the agreement box during setup and prior to clicking the install button to begin the installation.</div>

            I followed the link in one of the messages above to the <a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2012/08/02/how-to-upgrade-from-windows-7-to-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WordPress blog</a>, read the tips, and Windows 8 successfully upgraded after I uninstalled Norton Anti-Virus and turned off all the non-Microsoft start up items that you can access from Start/Run/Msconfig. Since the Windows 8 upgrade has to restart the computer
 several times, I suspect some of the start up items for other apps or Norton AntiVirus were causing the problem.

            Ok, so i spent 2 days trying to remove these errors and finally succeeded.
<div><br />
<div>Now my error log shows nothing throughout the entire install and it still fails.</div>

            <p>Hello ebotacular,</p><p>After reviewing your account, it appears that you are currently being affected by an&nbsp;internal database issue which is interfering with the information on your account. What is happening is that your billable account information is being incorrectly communicated to our servers. Since this data is necessary to determine where to place your deposit, the process is aborted.&nbsp;This missing information is also why our system is incorrectly asking you to update your data.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have escalated this issue to another team to resolve, but have not yet received an approximate solution date. We apologize for the inconvenience, and ask for your patience while our other team works on a solution. Unfortunately, we have no control over billable account information. If you would like to inquire about the strange Canadian information on your account, you would have to reach out to Xbox support at (support.<b>xbox</b>.com/<b>contact</b>-<b>us</b>).<br /></p>

<p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgraded from a retail license, try chat support:</p>

    <title>Windows 10 built in administrator password says, incorrect&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 built in administrator password says, incorrect&#63;</h2>
                    <p>First, thank you in advance for help!!! Second, I downloaded my free windows 10. I have a flashdrive that the "key" is supposed to reside on,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a week ago a new build was offered and I downloaded it. Since then my built in administrator password says its incorrect yet, I have a password hint below it where you enter the password (for me) easy to understand. Still won't accept it. So I followed
 instructions to change it using the password reset wizard and the "key" flash drive was recognized, but right at the end after changing to a new password I got this error saying "An error has occurred while the wizard was attempting to set the password for
 this user account."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its not a "user" account. Its the built in administrator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed instructions to see if any new IP addresses have been attempting to access my computer and found several attempts that locate the ip address in Illinois, I live in California. So I changed my password online, while signed in.... but only changed
 my USER account. Not the built in user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, I can see the cmd prompt (Administrator) after a few days ago, hiding it (before the new download) &nbsp;weird...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How in the world do I fix this issue, when I cannot access the built in user account, to FIX it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joni W</p>

            <p>Hi Joni,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do not worry, will assist you with the&nbsp;issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not&nbsp;safe to use built-in administrator account so I suggest you to disable it and start using either a Microsoft account or a local account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>net user&nbsp;administrator /active:no </p>
<p>
</p><p>If password is incorrect then it is not possible to recover the built-in account. Since you already have a Microsoft account, you can use MSA account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if you still want&nbsp;access to built in account you need to re-install Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you for your reply. I seem to need the built in administrator, since its the only account that allows me to download/ install most programs or get into secure or restricted areas/files etc. I truly wish i had more flexibility/access as a standard administrator
 but its not allowed or I'm not understanding how to get that kind of access?</p>
<p>So I downloaded Windows10 will I still be able to download it again, free?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Joni,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you sure it is a built-in admin account not the one which you created and set it up as admin account?</li><li>If yes, how did you enable the built-in admin account?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Once you have access to built-in admin account, create a new user account (either&nbsp;a Microsoft account or a local account)&nbsp;or use the old Microsoft account and set it as administrator. Then disable built in admin account, so that you&nbsp;can make your system
 secure and safe. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In administrator account (newly set Microsoft account as admin)&nbsp;you will be able to&nbsp;install or uninstall or do other stuff on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Standard account and administrator account is different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can reinstall Windows 10 for free, if it was a valid Windows 10 upgrade. Once you’ve upgraded to
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> using the free upgrade offer, you can reinstall or perform a clean installation on the same device. You won’t need a product key to re-activate
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> on the same hardware. For more info on how to create your own
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> installation media, go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=616447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>LoL yeah that whould explain it. I actually had almost the same thing happen to me just a couple of days ago on PSN. Put the game in. It then logged into the Darksouls2 gameserver, but it dident want to DL the latest calibration.I tryed it a couple of times,
 and eventually gave it up. Later I noticed when I tryed to go into the PSN store it told me it was Down for maintanence, and I figured that must have been the problem. Next day everything was back to normal. Whould have been nice with an ingame message to
 explain the situation tho</p>

<h2>            0x80070015 error in Photo Gallery</h2>
                    Hello I have the problem with Photo Viewer not working--encountered an error loading WLXPhotoViewer.dll and can't start Error code: 0x80070015<br />
I went through the removal of Win Essentials and did a clean install to no avail.&nbsp; I have collected the System Information, Event logs, and the DxDiag logs.&nbsp; I placed all three of them inside of a folder and zipped that folder.&nbsp; How do I attach the compressed
 folder to send it to you?<br />
Thank you<br />

<h2>            Direct connection from Modem to Xbox - DNS Error</h2>
                    I've been trying to connect my Xbox directly to my modem rather than through my router to see if I get a better connection while playing on live. But, when I do a connection test I get up to Internet and get a DNS Error. I've put in all the network information
 properly (I'm doing it manually) I've checked multiple times and nothing seems to work. Is it a problem with my modem? Or the fact that I'm usually receiving my Internet through modem

<p>Hi Rack,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the DNS troubles. Let's see if we can get this sorted. <br />
<br />
I would suggest starting with our&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/191860.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DNS server can't resolve Xbox LIVE server names</a>&nbsp;forums sticky.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Also, what would be the exact make/model of your modem?</strong> <br />
<br />
Let us know, and we can go from there. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there, I have tried taking the steps that are listed in the that particular thread. If I go through my router as well as my modem I am able to connect. But I would prefer to have a direct connection from my modem to my xbox and of course that is the part
 that is not working.</p>

<p>[/quote]<br />Can we rewind for a minute and get back to your network set up. Can you tell us if the OV303R2&nbsp;OvisLink ADSL Modem is operating in bridge mode. Since this device (OV303R2) is a modem and a router in a single device, which then connects to a second router. (make and model?) When having two devices doing NAT, you will have multiple levels of NAT on your local network, also known as "double NAT". This scenario is truly something you would like to avoid.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, that's where I get confused. I know how to check my router setting via typing in 192.168.0.1 in my browser. I'm not sure how to just access the modems settings.</p>
<p>Obviously I'm not too educated in this area. My router is basically tied into all of&nbsp;my internet, I've tried connecting a computer as well as my Xbox directly to my modem without either of them getting internet. The router is set-up to be the only way of
 me receiving internet for anything is what I'm getting at.</p>
<p>My router is a D-Link Model: DIR-655 and I'm not sure if it's relevant but I do normally have a open NAT, I have seen it at moderate; not often though.</p>

<p>Hey Rack,<br />
<br />
Alright, did some digging, and information on that modem is pretty limited. I do have something I would like you to try though.
<br />
<br />
Let's connect directly to your modem, and then in your browser, type in 192.168.10.200. There you will be able to see if it is in "Bridge" mode or not. NOTE: This is from another Ovis modem guide, as I was not able to find your exact one.<br />
<br />
If this does not help, I would say give your ISP a call, and explain to them what you are trying to do, and see if they have a better modem for you.
<br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If I unplug my computer's Ethernet cable from my router and put it directly into my modem I have limited/no connectivity and am unable to search that address.</p>
<p>I appreciate all of your help, thanks for the suggestions. I'll just have to talk to my ISP I guess.</p>
<p>On another note, I found it weird that if I used my white Xbox wireless adapter and connected using wireless rather than wired; my NAT turned from open to moderate? Any particular reason why that may be?
</p>
<p>Anyways thanks again for your time!</p>

            <p>Before you try to access your ADSL modem, do you still have the router connected to the ADSL modem? If so, Can you access your &nbsp;D-Link router from your computer and select "Status" for device information. Look for the WAN or Internet IP address column and post up the first two octets from this IP address (eg 192.168.xxx.xxx). Do not post up the entire address, just the first two octets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Before you attempt to connect any device to your modem, disconnect any device connected to the LAN port of your ADSL modem and power your modem off for a couple of minutes. Power on your modem and wait one minute for it to connect properly. Connect your computer to the LAN port on your ADSL modem. Turn on your computer and open up a Web Browser. Enter: <strong>192.168.1.1 </strong>If this address do not work, it could be that this specific ADSL modem has been adapted by your ISP and with a custom made firmware.&nbsp;<br /><br />Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We appreciate your update,&nbsp;<span>Mahmoud. Based on the information you've provided, it's possible that the major culprits of this issue are network misconfiguration. We understand that it's the only way you can connect to
 the internet, but it is still best connecting your computer to a wired network connection for us to isolate it better.

                    <p>OT: Unspecified Error Message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a message periodically (every 10 minutes or so) saying "Some errors occurred while processing the requested tasks."&nbsp; When I look at the details, the error box is blank.&nbsp; I seem to be receiving all my emails, but the error popup interferes with other
 jobs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on my new Win 7 laptop.&nbsp; I have copied the settings from my old Win 7 laptop, which never&nbsp;shows this message.</p>

            Please switch to the newsgroups window (e.g. press Ctrl-5). Is there a news account showing in the folder pane? If so, right-click on it and select
<em>Properties</em>. At the foot of the <em>General</em> tab, deselect <em>Include this account when checking for new messages</em>. Close down Windows Live Mail and wait a few minutes, then re-launch and test. Do you still get the repeated message?

<h2>            Network Icon Shows No Internet, but I am Connected</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have been trying to get rid of this issue for months. My internet is working perfectly, but the network item shows "no internet". This would not be a problem, except most Microsoft software apparently relies on this status monitor for access to internet
 features. I cannot search for templates in Office products or send feedback through the Feedback Hub. The Windows Store works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got this issue fixed a few months ago by running the Tweaking Windows repair tool. However, the fix only lasted for a few days and then the problem was back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 x64 on a Lenovo desktop tower. My network card is an onboard Intel I219-LM #2.</p>

            In addition I would not run any tweaking suites as these frequently ruin Windows beyond repair.  With a solid install, WIndows 10 is resilient with only its own built-in Troubleshooting.
<br />
<br />What we're learning with WIndows 10 is that everything depends upon the quality of the install.  This is also the reason why most enthusiasts won't run a Factory or Upgrade Install in the first place, because they'd expect endless issues until they Clean Install.  By comparison those who have followed the Clean Install in this link have not reported a single subsequent issue through multiple version Updates.: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>   
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows but sheds corrupting factory bloatware, saves your file, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Short of that you can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Error&#58; &#34;A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer&#34; when trying to resinstall Windows.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Reloading Vista Problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer was infected with the Malware "Live Security Platinum". I downloaded "Super AntiSpyware", ran that program and no longer get the Live Security prompts, but my computer runs impossibly slow now to the point where it is barely running.</p>
<p>I'd like to just wipe the hard drives clean and reinstall Vista.</p>
<p>But everything I try doesn't work.</p>
<p>With my recovery disk in the CD drive . . .</p>
<p>If I try to boot from disk first I get the message "Windows is loading files", then when that is done I get a blue screen with the following message . . .</p>
<p>"A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer. If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen restart your computer. If this screen appears again follow these steps:<br />
Make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed. If this is a new installation ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any Windows updates you might need.<br />
If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware of software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. If you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup
 Options, and then select safe mode."</p>
<p><br />
If I try to load Vista with the computer fully running by clicking on the DVD drive after some files load I get this error message:</p>
<p>"Windows cannot access the required file E:\Sources\Boot.wim.Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error Code: 0x80070660"</p>
<p>If I try to use system restore:<br />
"Windows has detected file system corruption on OS (C). You must check disk for errors before it can be restored."</p>
<p>If I try to run CHkdsk I get the error message:<br />
"Windows cannot check disk while in use"</p>
<p>I suspect some if not all these problems were purposely created by the malware. Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are you boot to the desktop?</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>: If you’re able to boot to the desktop then,
</span><span>I suggest you to run a complete system scan on the computer using Microsoft Safety Scanner to check if the computer is infected by virus and then try to reinstall Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>You may download and run the Microsoft Safety scanner from the following link.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely,
 which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> If you’re unable to boot to the desktop then, boot to
<span>Windows Recovery environment using the Windows Vista recovery disc and run
<b>‘chkdsk’</b>. Select command prompt from the recovery option and run the following command to run check disk.</span></p>
<p><b><span>"chkdsk /f"</span></b><span> then press enter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>"chkdsk /r"</span></b><span> and press enter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>‘What are the system recovery options in Windows Vista?’</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While performing
<b>‘chkdsk’</b> on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when
<b>‘chkdsk’</b> tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
To work with this issue, refer these methods.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Open Windows Update Troubleshooter</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows update troubleshooter makes sure that your computer is connected to the Internet, and checks to see
 whether your network adapter and Windows Update services are running correctly.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
Check which update is getting installed. Refer the following article.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Temporarily disable the antivirus software and check if you are able to perform system restore with any errors.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Warning:</span></b><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have
 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then try installing the update again. Check if it helps.</span></p>

<h3> trey martin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Free period Activation</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received windows 10 for free during the period before July of 2016. I've used it and loved it ever since then, though I noticed something different after a big upgrade to my hardware. (Motherboard,GPU,CPU and temperature control is what I upgraded)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>That I needed to Activate Windows.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Well since I got it during the free period, how do I go about activating it?</p>
<p>I received no key, that I'm aware of, after I upgraded?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>
<p>-Trey<br />

<p>Depending on what type of license (OEM or retail) you upgraded from can invalidate the license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you originally upgraded from an OEM Windows 7 or 8 license, then you will need to purchase a new Windows 10 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its a retail license, try reactivating using your Windows 7 or Windows 8 key.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Microsoft Family and Xbox Live</h2>
                    <p>This may be a dumb question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have 2 kids and 1 Xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently they use the one Xbox live account (free) to log in.</p>
<p>I created a "family" in Microsoft and set them up with an email and Windows Live account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to sign one of them in to XBox Live and it sends me in circles - proving my age using credit card details etc. It says its creating an account then nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I only have one XBox Live account associated with a single XBox? </p>
<p>I would have thought I could sign out and one of the kids could sign in to theirs instead?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I sign into <em>their</em> "XBox Live" accounts online it is using my Avatar and gamertag but has their email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confused and not sure how this works at all. :/&nbsp;</p>

            I'm not really sure how the Xbox 360 family system works, but with an Xbox One, they'd have games you own and such. But with 360, it being somewhat old I have no clue. Good luck though c:

            Since the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked so we know nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving
 these issues.<br />
<br />
Maybe someday the XP forums "Ask a question" dialog will ask these questions automatically when a new thread is started so I do not have to ask them every single time.&nbsp; It might even be possible to resolve an issue in a single reply when enough information
 is provided.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
A little Googling (very little) reveals that the wzcsldr2.exe or wzcsldr3.exe file belongs to some kind of wireless D-link device attached to your system.<br />
<br />
Does that sound familiar and do you have anything like that installed?<br />
<br />
If yes, then I would get out the the <a href="http://www.dlink.com/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">D-Link Support page</a> and find the latest driver for whatever device you are using and install it.&nbsp; You may need to uninstall your current device first - I'm sure they must have
 instructions and advice for the procedure.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
They also have an active <a href="http://forums.dlink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Support Forum</a> where you can post your issue/question to see if the folks out there can help you get going.&nbsp; There are already some threads in their forums about problems like you describe, but
 since we know absolutely nothing about your system, you should probably take it up yourself.<br />
<br />
I did find some other ideas through Googling, but I don't like some of the ideas I read and if you stuff was working before, what do you think changed since the last time it worked properly?&nbsp; Did you update or reinstall your D-Link device or drivers lately?<br />
<br />
