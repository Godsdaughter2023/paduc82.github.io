<h2>            My HP printer 4645 does not work since I installed Windows 10.</h2>
                    I have updated the software of the printer, the printer also can print the status report since the HP page and I also have already run the "Fix problem program" of Windows but it does not have a solution to my problem. I have reviewed the controllers and
 all seems to be updated but when I want to print a document from Word, for example, I cannot do it so. Please help me. I installed Windows 10 in November and since then I had not been able to use my printer. Thanks in advance for your help!!!

            <p>Hi Esther,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused, I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to outdated or corrupted printer driver. I suggest you to try uninstalling the driver and restart the compute and have Windows automatically install the driver upon restart.
</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + X and select device manager.</p>
<p>2. Locate the printer driver and uninstall it.</p>
<p>3. Restart the computer and check the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result, we will be glad to help if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Have you installed the latest versions of the printer's software from:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/HP-Deskjet-Ink-Advantage-4640-e-All-in-One-Printer-series/5305040/model/5305041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/HP-Deskjet-Ink-Advantage-4640-e-All-in-One-Printer-series/5305040/model/5305041</a></p>
<p>or just the original software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates to the Driver software seem to have been released in December 2015, with Windows 10 compatibility, after you upgraded to Windows 10, and the diagnostic software has also been updated more recently (August 2016)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 download stuck at &#39;Get Going Fast&#39; page, seems frozen</h2>
                    I am on a Dell Venue 8 Pro, which is a tablet. Downloading seemed okay until the 'Get Going Fast' page. Once it reaches this page, only the 'Use Express Settings' is highlighted, but when I press it nothing happens, the whole page is frozen. I even tried
 turning off the device and turning it back on, then it would go back to that page, being frozen. I even tried to just wait and see if the download continues, but then it goes to a black screen. Nothing is plugged into the device while I am doing this.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for your drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<p><strong>I have a Dell Precision M4400 loaded with Windows 7 Enterprise 64 Bit. I have a Dell external Monitor connected thru a Dell Docking Station.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I like using only one display for working. So, am trying to get the laptop display to switch to the monitor when it is on the docking station with the lid closed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This worked very well till yesterday when I had WinXP 32 Bit with this same hardware.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I used the option to :Show Desktop only on 1" option - but that doesn't seem to work.</strong></p>

<p>Right click on the desktop, select screen resolution then.....</p>
<p>Did you use the "detect displays" button ?&nbsp; In the event it actually detects, remember to hit "Apply"otherwise it keeps previous settings.</p>
<p>Is the external monitor ever detected ?</p>
<p>Does anything show on when you hit "Identify" ? (1 and 2) or only 1 ?</p>
<p>Is there any key combination on the keyboard to switch to/from external monitor ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>How about when you hit "the Win-key +P" ?? (the key with the window on the keyboard plus the letter p)&nbsp; ? Does anything happen ? (p for "projector"...)</p>
<p>I had some initial trouble with a similar setup when I finally figured out that once Win7 detects the external monitor, you have to hit the "Apply" in order to select the arrangement you want (Duplicate displays, Extend displays, Show desktop only on 1,
 or on 2)....</p>
<p>I used to be like you and only work on the external monitor, but take my word and give it a try and work with the two monitors... the only drawback is when you are away from your office.... (I actually had a second lcd at home to have more space).</p>
<p>You can even have the second monitor on a stand higher than the laptop screen and have a huge vertical area :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, good luck. Some fidgeting is needed to get things working.</p>

<h2>            Camera app closes immediately on opening</h2>

 it will crash. It was also happened to another camera apps but I can uninstall n re install them, then these camera app being normal. But for the built in camera app there is no uninstall button. The additional problem my skype also can't use the camera. I

            <p>The solution to this problem for me was to use the File Explorer to navigate to "This PC / Pictures." When I tried that, access was denied, and it told me that the owner was unknown. I changed the Owner of the folder to my own system account, and after that,
 the camera worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also check what happens if you start the Camera App from the Lock screen. To enable that, go to Settings | PC and devices | Lock screen and enable the item "Swipe down on the lock screen to use the camera." Then log out or enter Windows-L to get
 to the lock screen. In my case before I fixed the folder, I could view the Camera app from the Lock screen, but not save any pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, you might want to see if there are any errors in the Event Log. Run the Event Viewer app to see those. In the Event Viewer, filter on the word "Camera" to skip over the other stuff.</p>

<p>yes i am having problems with that 1)even if it worked it would change by 6th November, and my live will be renewed by the 4th so i need to turn off auto renewal before the 4th 2) whenever i type in my actual email in to alternate email address it comes
 up with "The security info you entered is too long or contains characters that aren't allowed." after i click save... this appears above the alternate email address bar.</p>

<p>Hello legend siv,<br />
<br />
It's quite possible that the e-mail you are using has something like dashes or underscores which Microsoft might not allow for their alternative e-mail address. Do you have the ability to reset the proofs by following the directions in Mister Gwyther's post
 but using a different e-mail address without those characters in it that it's seeing as invalid? If so, please do so.<br />
<br />
To turn off automatic renewal for the time being you would need to reach out to phone support by clicking this link
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us/#0:0:7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> and then clicking
<strong>Request a Call</strong>. That would be the only other way to turn it off without being able to do it online.</p>

                    <p>Sorry for my English, but I am translating with Google</p>
<p>**************************************************</p>
Good Morning.<br />
Yesterday I updated the computer to Windows 10.<br />
It all works, but I can not print!<br />
If I try to print with Word or any other program, it tells me that there are no printers.<br />
From the control panel, however, I can see them.<br />
If I try to see the print queue, he tells me that the print spooler is not running, and if I try to start it from a CMD with "net start spooler", I get this error:<br />
********************************<br />
Print Spooler service at startup.<br />
Could not start the Print Spooler service.<br />
<br />
system error.<br />
<br />
System error 1721.<br />
<br />
The resources available are not sufficient to complete the operation.<br />
********************************<br />
Same problem even if I try to start it from the "Services."<br />
Please help me, I have to print out important documents.<br />
Thank You

            <p>This computer was recently upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;Previously it was running Windows 8.1 with no issues and an Epson R3000 printer attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, after the Windows 10 upgrade, the print spooler will not start. &nbsp;Nothing can be printed from this computer. &nbsp;When manually trying to start the print spooler through the Services window, the message appears as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows could not start the Printer Spooler services on Local Computer.</p>
<p>Error 0x800706b9: Not enough resources are available to complete this operation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a fair assessment, because there were plenty of resources under Windows 8.1. I also checked dependencies,&nbsp;DCOM Server Process Launcher and RPC Endpoint Manager are running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performed "net start spooler" and received "System error 1721 has occurred. Not enough resources are available to complete this operation". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Am I faced with having to roll back to Windows 8.1 in order to print?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: &nbsp;YES. &nbsp;I did roll back. &nbsp;Printer spooler function was restored. &nbsp;So there was no hardware issue. &nbsp;It was a Windows 10 glitch. &nbsp;Despite the lure of a free upgrade, I will save my precious time (which is an expense) and wait a year until Microsoft addresses
 all notable defects with a service pack for Windows 10.</p>

            * BUMP * for good measure. &nbsp;If you are unable to print due to the printer spooler service being unable to start, and Microsoft does not have a KB fix specifically for this, your only hope is to go back to Windows 8.1. &nbsp;And frankly, you won't miss Windows
 10. &nbsp;I did not see any notable performance improvement. &nbsp;And there are workarounds to the loss of the start orb. &nbsp;Windows 10 does away with the "tiles", but... in a clumsy kind of way. &nbsp;I prefer Windows 8.1.

<h2>            Question about Gta5 Discs&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Does installing the "Play" disc still mess up the game or graphics, or should I just install it? I'm just wondering because I don't like that sound my xbox makes when playing the game.</p>

<p>As you will all know GTA V has a mandatory install disc which requires 8 GB of free space.</p>
<p>As soon as you launch this disc you will be prompted to install the file. If for any reason the install does not work you can manually install to you hard drive by following this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/audio-video-setup-and-use/install-play-delete-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../install-play-delete-game</a></p>
<p>The second disc is a play disc which Rockstar have already recommended isn’t installed to your hard drive as this can cause texture issues. This wont be a problem for some people but others prefer the quiet running of games installed on hard dives etc.</p>
<p>A way round this is to install the play disc to a USB flash drive which can be done as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../usb-flash-drive</a></p>
<p>My friends and I have had no issues but Rockstar do say not to install the play disc at all as it could affect performance.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!!!</p>

    <title>High CPU Usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crimsonkiller29  say:</h3>
<h2>            High CPU Usage</h2>
                    <p>A few day's ago after uninstalling and reinstalling my display driver to fix a BSOD, my PC's CPU began running at a constant 99% no matter what. I posted on here and was told that it sounded like the newer video driver was causing an issue with Window's
 Defender when I run any program it actively checks. I was provided with a list of possible solutions, these were - Doing a clean boot, using process explorer, using autoruns, process monitor, uninstalling 3rd party anti-virus software, running the troubleshooter,
 running a SFC scan, DISM /online / cleanup-image / scanhealth, as well as a restorehealth one, I downloaded and installed all of the drivers provided from Dell, I checked for updates through device manager, and I checked for updates in Window's Update, and
 all drivers are now updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when my computer is idling on the desktop the CPU runs between 50-70% which is an improvement, however anytime I try to open anything, Chrome, a single folder, or any other application the CPU runs back up to 85-99% with the "System" running around 40%
 and the running application also around 40%. Before dealing with the BSOD, my CPU never ran this high, I could open ten different tabs in Chrome, or have Photoshop and Illustrator open and my PC would run just fine. Now opening a single folder, freezes up
 the PC for a few seconds and in general it's just way slower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot of the task manager when the computer is idle.</p>

<p>Well <em>Chrome</em> is certainly going to town. Do you have any add-ons installed that may be using this much cpu ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>System</em> and <em>Explorer</em> are too, but I don't know what would cause that.</p>
<p>I'm probably jumping ahead a bit (but you have done so many other tests/fix attempts),&nbsp; but have you downloaded anything</p>
<p>from a torrent or similar site, or opened an email from an unknown source recently ?If so, know that some of these sites have started installing data miners/malware on peoples machines. High cpu use is the result when this has happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Are you updated to Win10 v1709 ?</p>
<p>- Your graphics processor driver is installed and functioning properly now ?</p>
<p>If so I doubt the gpu driver is, or was the cause of your BSOD's . </p>
<p>The image you posted shows no evidence the gpu driver is using your cpu.&nbsp; How much cpu use do you see if you open your gpu's
</p>
<p>Control Panel (My Nvidia Control Panel <em>briefly</em> hits around 9% cpu use when opening) ?
</p>
<p>- Also, doing simple things like trying to open a folder does not involve the gpu driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing/reinstalling the gpu driver is very rarely a solution for BSOD which involves the graphics processor, with the<br />
uncommon exception the driver has been corrupted (which is actually a bit more common these days when Win10<br />
does one of it's version/feature updates).<br />
Error's that point to the gpu driver after a crash are often not accurate. The main reason for this is the gpu driver<br />
is often the last thing to go down in a series of events that leads to a crash, so Windows points the finger at the gpu driver.<br />

<p>You can turn off hibernation if it is on and you don't use it..</p>
<p>When you hibernate your computer, Windows saves the contents of the system's memory to the hiberfil.sys file. As a result, the size of the hiberfil.sys file will always equal the amount of physical memory in your system. If you don't use the hibernate feature
 and want to recapture the space that Windows uses for the hiberfil.sys file, perform the following steps:</p>
<p>- Start the Control Panel Power Options applet (go to Start, Settings, Control Panel, and click Power Options).<br />
- Select the Hibernate tab, clear the "Enable hibernation" check box, then click OK; although you might think otherwise, selecting Never under the "System hibernates" option on the Power Schemes tab doesn't delete the hiberfil.sys file.<br />
- Windows will remove the "System hibernates" option from the Power Schemes tab and delete the hiberfil.sys file.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your System Restore can use...</p>
<p>1. Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br />
2. Click the System Restore tab.<br />
3. Highlight one of your drives (or C: if you only have one) and click on the "Settings" button.<br />
4. Change the percentage of disk space you wish to allow.. I suggest moving the slider until you have just about 1GB (1024MB or close to that...)<br />
5. Click OK.. Then Click OK again.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your Temporary Internet Files can utilize...</p>
<p>Empty your Temporary Internet Files and shrink the size it stores to a size between 64MB and 128MB..</p>
<p>- Open ONE copy of Internet Explorer.<br />
- Select TOOLS - Internet Options.<br />
- Under the General tab in the "Temporary Internet Files" section, do the following:<br />
- Click on "Delete Cookies" (click OK)<br />
- Click on "Settings" and change the "Amount of disk space to use:" to something between 64MB and 128MB. (It may be MUCH larger right now.)<br />
- Click OK.<br />
- Click on "Delete Files" and select to "Delete all offline contents" (the checkbox) and click OK. (If you had a LOT, this could take 2-10 minutes or more.)<br />
- Once it is done, click OK, close Internet Explorer, re-open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:</p>
<p>Ccleaner (Free!)<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br />
( just the disk cleanup - don't play with the registry part for now )</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that your system is generally free of malware (assuming you have an AntiVirus application), &nbsp;you have cleaned up the 'extra applications' that might be running and taking up your valuable memory and processor, you have cleared out some valuable drive

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Communities.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Before we start troubleshooting on the issue please provide us with the additional information by answering few questions mentioned below, this will help us to troubleshoot better.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the complete error message are you getting while you try to uninstall this program?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Please go ahead and follow the methods mentioned below and later update us on the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: </span></b><span>Try to end the process tree for x-lite soft phone in task manager, and check if it helps</span></p>
<p><b><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></b><span><span>Open Task Manager by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete.</span></span></p>
<p><b><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></b><span>Click the <span>Process</span> tab and Application tab, right click on the program, and then click
<b>End Process Tree.</b></span></p>
<p>End a process: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/End-a-process</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: </span></b><span>Most programs install themselves in the C:\Program Files folder. Check this folder because some programs also include an uninstall program that you can try.
</span></p>
<p><span>If the program doesn't uninstall completely the first time, sometimes running the uninstall program a second time will succeed.
</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, try uninstalling the program while Windows is running in

<p><span>Hi blaze38,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you get any error message when you try to play the game?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you try to install the game in compatibility mode or you are trying to run the game in compatibility mode after installing it on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>There is no information about the Leisure Suit Larry Box Office Bust game’s compatibility with Windows 7 in<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=leisure%20suit%20larry%20box%20office%20bust" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows
 7 Compatibility Center</a></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you installed the game normally and now you are trying to play the game in different compatibility modes then I* would suggest you to uninstall
 the game completely and then re-install it in Windows Vista or Windows XP compatibility modes and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p><span>2. Locate the setup file of the game.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Right click on the setup file and then select properties.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click the “Compatibility” tab.</span></p>

<p><span>7. Click Ok.</span></p>
<p><span>8. Double click the setup file and run the installation.</span></p>

    <title>Not happy with Storage Pools. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rlmosk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not happy with Storage Pools.</h2>
                    <p>New computer and upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7.&nbsp; I created a storage pool using 2 extra hard drives.&nbsp; It worked fine but I was unaware that by creating this pool I would lose the independent use of my files on Drive C.&nbsp; My normal Library files are
 now mirrored with the 2 extra drives I used to create the storage pool.&nbsp; I thought my C Drive (Library-Documents, Pictures, Videos, Music, and Downloads) would stay separate from the storage pool and I could just copy files to my Storage Pool and delete them
 from my C: Drive if I wanted to. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I'm explaining myself sufficiently.&nbsp; In other words, I thought creating a Storage Pool made 2 extra hard drives into one and you could copy files from the C: Drive when you wanted.&nbsp; Also, be able to delete files from the C: Drive in order to not fill
 it up so much.&nbsp; My C: Drive is a 512 GB SS drive.&nbsp; My 2 extra hard drives are 3TB each standard 7200 RPM SATA hard drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is how this works, I think I would rather have my drives back the way they were.&nbsp; Is there a way to reverse the Storage Pool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I already read&nbsp; the <strong>Storages &amp; spaces FAQ </strong>
before I posted this query.&nbsp; Maybe I still don't understand how this Storage Pool works. &nbsp; I do understand what you are saying about
<strong>C: Drive</strong>.&nbsp; But <strong>C:Drive</strong> also holds the "Library" files.&nbsp; These are the files I wish to delete on
<strong>C:Drive</strong> to free up space because they are now on the Storage Pool drives.&nbsp; The 2 extra Storage Pool drives are internal HD's in my tower.&nbsp; If this is the way the Storage Pool works, then I'd rather not have the Storage Pool and I'll just backup
 my Library Files (pictures, videos, music, documents) on my internal HDs.&nbsp; Is there a way to reverse the Storage Pool I just created?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>If you moved the folders that are members of the libraries to the storage pool and did not just include the storage pool drive(s) in the libraries ... then it ahould work as you seem to be expecting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A storage pool is nothing more than a virtual raid. &nbsp;I think your issue lies with your library setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A library is essentially a shortcut to several (usually) folders you (or someone else) deemed to be related. &nbsp;The location of the folders in the library is where ever you created it in the first place (or their default location or where you moved that location
 to in terms of user profile folders like documents and pictures.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post images of your storage pool setup and the thing where you think files are being mirrored...</p>

            <p>I copied files from the Library folders to the storage pool because I wanted to free up space on the C Drive.&nbsp; It wasn't until I tried to delete the files in the Library folders that I realized that the library folders were also part of the "E" Drive storage
 pool.&nbsp; I don't know exactly what images you want but I've posted several details that may be what you want.&nbsp; If not, let me know how to get the image you want me to send.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More after images.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62ca50d8-47aa-4ec3-a0f5-3a9eb0b140cc" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11e42b18-1e7d-4344-b7a9-c6ca12b13a0e" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b9672af-0479-4cd1-8842-5285064c84a3" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e545b28-9d66-4aad-bcb1-c5581579682b" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4cb20e52-d3e6-4f0f-a1fd-e326c09b43c8" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65ba3687-4e38-482f-95eb-05e3dfe2b762" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/702a1976-af02-4a5a-a4d5-df5d68848d70" /><img src="https://filestore.c
<p>My library files were on Drive C.&nbsp; I ask Drive C to be included as part of the storage pool.&nbsp; Only my 2 extra HDs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry that I'm not more tech savvy, but I just followed the instructions on how to make a storage pool using my to extra HDs.
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade - Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart</h2>
                    <p>oh... now this is special.&nbsp; After 5 attempts to install the Win 10 upgrade to my Win 7 machine it finally completed and appeared to be at least semi functional.&nbsp; However, upon rebooting the machine the morning when it came back up it showed this message
 twice:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart (twice)</strong></p>
<p><strong>System Service Exception</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it showed the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Recovery</strong><br />
<strong>It looks like Windows didn't load correctly</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The upon attempting a Startup Repair it showed the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Startup Repair</strong><br />
<strong>Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Fun times!&nbsp; This whole upgrade event has been nothing but terrible.&nbsp; WARNING.... DO NOT UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 10... until they figure out all the damn bugs...</p>

            <p>Had the same problem and even more disappointed. After several restarts I got the recovery window. I attempted to run the diagnostics which failed then trued the resetting option which led to a hard drive issue. Now I get black screen with a message "An
 operating systems wasn't found"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I wish I had stayed away from the upgrade until all the damn bugs are fixed...</p>

            Having the same issue. Three attempts at a Windows 10 install then what seemed like success. Now I keep getting rebooted or get asked the ""choose your keyboard layout" but my mouse won't work so I cannot make a selection.&nbsp;

            This is really disappointing, I have my PC on windows 10 for over a week now thinking it will be okay eventually but still tells me it needs to restart when I want to shutdown!&nbsp;
