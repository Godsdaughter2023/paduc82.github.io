<h2>            Palm Smartphone 750 and Lotus notes sync</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Got a quick question for you all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Palm 750 Smartphone with windows 6 and all the bells and whistles.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am wanting to sync it with Lotus notes I have at work. Any idea how I go about this considering I don't have Lotus notes on my Palm, I only have Microsoft Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I run Microsoft Outlook at home. Can I sync both my home PC and Work PC on my Palm or is it just&nbsp;one or the other?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope thats clear. Looking forward to your reponses</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>After consult, I have found this issue disappear when I upgrade Outlook to&nbsp;<strong><em>Monthly channel 1804 (Build 9226.2114)</em></strong>, it is the latest version of Outlook. So, please also update you Outlook to the latest version, and also&nbsp;<span>unselect
 the option&nbsp;</span><span> <em><strong>"Do not check spelling or grammar"&nbsp;</strong></em>from the Language<em>.
</em>On the latest version of Outlook, it will help to save this option, and help to check the spelling or grammar when you unselect this option.</span></p>

<h2>            Export Video Function PowerPoint 2016</h2>
                    The audio icon is visible when "Export Video" function is used even with the "Hide during Show" block checked to create mp4 files.&nbsp; During slideshow, it works as advertised (audio icon does not show).&nbsp;This function works perfectly on PowerPoint 2013 and
 2010. This is tested on two&nbsp;different computers: one that runs on Windows 7 and one with Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            The videos are exported from PPT the same way as I have done with PowerPoint 2013 so many times before:
<br />
File&gt;Export&gt;Create a Video&gt;Create a Video (icon)&gt;(type a filename on the new window)&gt;click save.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Attached are the screen captures depicting the difference <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1c1b97f-192c-4a2e-a0d2-c975cc972400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 running PPT slide show and playing the mp4 (same slide).&nbsp; The audio icon is clearly present on the mp4 screen capture.

            <p>Out of curiosity, is there some reason why you can't drag the audio icon just off the edge of the slide?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Granted, it'd be better if it simply didn't show in the video, but I suspect this'd be a simple workaround until the problem's fixed.</p>

<h2>            One graph, multiple curves where the X varies and the Y is the same - how do I do it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello wise Excel-ers! I am trying to create a graph with twelve different curves on it. The X axis represents a quantity of chemical (1.24, 3.79, 4.18, etc.) The Y axis represents percent mortality. Each of the twelve curves represents a different strain
 of bacteria (they each respond differently to the chemical). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can attach the actual data, but I don't know how to graph it! I can graph one strain as a lethality curve, but not more than one, because what I normally enter per strain is the Y, but in this case, the way they vary from each other is the X, not the Y.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just realized I can't attach a file, so I'm typing some data points below as examples.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone take a look at the sheet and suggest how this klutz can create a graph?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on a PC with Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dean</p>
<p>
</p><p>Y (percent mortality): 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55</p>
<p>X1 (first strain, quantity related to each Y point): 1.2, 1.4, 1.9, 2.3, 3.1, 3.5</p>
<p>X2 (second strain, quantity related to each Y point): 2.2, 2.8, 3.9, 4.3, 5.1, 5.5</p>
<p>X3 (third strain, quantity related to each Y point): 1.8, 2.4, 2.9, 3.3, 4.1, 4.5</p>

<p>
</p><p>See in the picture where the Mortality data is inside a purple like box and the X2 data (not header) is inside a blue box.&nbsp; In the next picture, these colors have been reversed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you select the red line (X2)&nbsp; and you will get the purple, blue and green boxes as shown in the picture.
</p>
<p>select the purple box and drag it to the right over some blank cells.&nbsp; Select the blue box and drag it over the mortality data where the purple box used to be.&nbsp; Select the purple box and drag it over the X2 data.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you will have his next picture with the boxes reversed (you might need to click on the green line).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now repeat this for each of the other two lines and you will get his final graph.

<p>
</p><p>If you put all your data into a single range and select the range, you can click INSERT SCATTER (scatter with smooth lines and markers). The rest is all done by default. This is the easiest way to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you must have mortality on the y-axis, you can do that but will require a little bit of tweaking. If you click on one of the lines, you will see three boxes like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86099da0-0e91-4c32-a9e8-e84ba9ce9442" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Drag the bigger boxes so that they swap positions, leaving the X2 label box alone. After that you will end up with something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/106398ea-f654-4dd2-a477-d7223639b678" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeat for the other two lines.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can right click on the graph (away from lines and axes), then click on SELECT DATA and go to EDIT.</p>

    <title>Calendar subscription in Office for Mac 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victorbasta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar subscription in Office for Mac 2016</h2>
                    I can't seem to locate anywhere a step by step guide to adding a subscribed calendar (or calendars in my case) to Outlook and viewing them alongside my main exchange calendar. &nbsp;I ideally want to subscribe to 2-3 calendars and see them all in one place
 (as I was able to with iCal obviously). &nbsp;iCal made it very simple, I'm surprised Outlook doesn't make it as simple. &nbsp;But am I missing something??

    <title>xt9 functionality in Smasung Omnia Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmgold1965  say:</h3>
<h2>            xt9 functionality in Smasung Omnia Not Working</h2>
                    I have a brand new Samsung Omnia.&nbsp; No matter how I change the settings for the XT9 functionality it operates the exact same way -- it replaces what I am typing with the word it guesses as I am typing it (which is very annoying).&nbsp; I want it to suggest words
 (which it currently does) but *NOT* replace what I am typing unless I select a suggested word from the list -- this is the way my previous windows mobile device worked.&nbsp; No matter how I change the settings it operates exactly as it does now -- as if those
 settings are not working.<br />
<br />
Is this a bug or is there a way to fix this?<br />

            I saw someone indicate that they had difficulty with the T9 input so they shut it off.<br />
<br />
I sent a note to Johan, one of our moderators, who has this device.&nbsp; Hopefully he can offer you some help.

            The T9 settings in the option are unfortunate written over by the Omnia T9 setting build into their own keyboards.<br />
<br />
Any changes in the regular options are not working. It's a fault with other devices as well who have build in manufacturer keyboards.<br />
<br />
Sorry that I could not help<br />

            <p>Hi Pawan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Google Chrome which I have always done and this seems the same. Hotmail/Outlook did a forced update a few weeks ago and now has a new look. It is only my emails from Barclaycard
 where the PDF statement&nbsp;files are invisible. I have tried sending other PDF files to myself from my work email and these are visible and I am able to open them. I have telephoned Barclaycard and they have assured me that the attachments are on the emails they
 have sent me. Previous similar emails from Barclaycard which I have moved to a folder I had created for them&nbsp;on Hotmail and where the PDF files used to be visible and I was able to open them previously are now the same - the PDF statement files have disappeared
 from the message since the new look Hotmail. I have tried a different browser and it is the same. The problem seems to be with Hotmail since the update&nbsp;and not the browser.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I am receiving a "Sharing Violation" error when trying to rename and save a read-only file. &nbsp; I saw a post from 2010 with this answer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try disabling the index option on the folder. &nbsp; Right click on the affected folder (where the file giving the error is located), choose properties. Click the "advanced" button near the bottom. Uncheck the "allow indexing" box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this and it did not work. &nbsp;I have changed properties to open as a Protected File with the feature to Enable Editing, but when I enable it changes to a Read-Only file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This change occurred suddenly and now all of my old files open as Read-Only. &nbsp;I can't even create a new file without it saving as Read-Only. &nbsp;How can this be corrected?</p>

<p>Hi Vicki,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “Sharing Violation” error that you’ve encountered when you tried to rename and save the Excel file can be caused by changes made to the security settings of the file or an antivirus running on your device is blocking it. To isolate your concern, we’d
 like to ask the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using a device running on Windows? If yes, which version of Windows is installed there? Type
<strong>winver</strong> in the search box to get the information.</li><li>Are there any third-party antivirus software installed on your device?</li><li>Have you tried updating the version of your Office Excel? To do this, check the steps on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Install Office updates">link</a></strong>. Check the result after installing the updates.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We’ll wait for your response.</p>

<br />When you delete the account A then all the files and emails associated with that account will be gone forever and You can't use your old account name to create a new account after the account-deletion wait period expires.
<br />
<br />So when you will create alias using the old and deleted email address, It will show as already exist<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20234038-3f4e-4b6d-8a58-364ea2283b92?upload=true" />

<p>The method you posted will move one account's emails, but the account has to remain active.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jim,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After consulting with the related team, we found there are two Office 365 Business Premium subscriptions in your tenant. I suppose you want to cancel the one which started on 02/25/2016. Auto-renew for this subscription is turned off,
 it will expire after the end date and you will not be charged for the next lifecycle.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also cancel the subscription immediately. For now, Microsoft does not charge the early termination fee from customer for any Office 365 product. Regarding the message about the termination fee, you can safely ignore it. If you
 are charged, please let me know.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Chris<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<h2>            How do I show the file location in Word or Excel with Office 2010&#63;</h2>
                    I often have more than one Word or Excel file with the same file name in different folders.&nbsp; It is very important to know which file I am currently working on.&nbsp; In my old Office programs (Word or Excel) I could display the "web toolbar" and show the location
 of the current file I'm working on. Can I still do that with Office 2010?&nbsp; If so, how?

            The same box that was on the Web toolbar is still available in 2010, and you can put it on your Quick Access Toolbar.<br />
<br />
Right-click the Quick Access Toolbar and choose Customize Quick Access Toolbar. In the dialog, set the "Choose commands from" dropdown to "All commands". Scroll down and click on "Document Location", and then click the Add button in the center of the dialog.
 The command will be placed at the bottom of the right-hand list; if you want it in a different position, use the up arrow to the right of the list. Then click OK.<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet with a lot of columns named like month-year (Jan-2016) reflected to multiple pivots on other worksheets. Every year I have to change the year in the column names, which then stops all the pivots from working and I have to rebuild all

<h2>            Disabled Forwarding still sending meeting requests</h2>
                    
<p>I have a user that had stopped working, so it was set to forward her email to another user.&nbsp; Then she came back, so the forwarding was disabled.&nbsp; But they are still getting all the meeting and calendar information even when she is not part of the invited
 group.&nbsp; I have checked the settings in the admin panel and cannot find anything to fix this.&nbsp; Any Ideas?</p>

<p>Hi BrianNelson5914,</p>
<p>Could you please share with us the detailed steps about how you set up the forward so that we are able to reproduce the issue?</p>
<p>Moreover, please also share with us the following information:</p>
<p>1. Let us know your Office 365 subscription such as Enterprise E3, Business Premium.</p>
<p>2. About “But they *** invited group”, who are “they”? Are “they” part of the invited group?</p>
<p>3. Share with us more information about the meeting and calendar information and appreciate you could share with us a detailed example.</p>
<p>4. Are normal emails received by the use still be forwarded out?</p>
<p>5. Which Outlook client is the user using? Outlook desktop or Outlook Web App?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook</p>

<p>Thank you for your prompt response. &nbsp;Here are the answers to your questions best I can.</p>
<p>To setup the forwarding, it was done through the exchange admin panel under Recipients&gt;User&gt;Mailbox Features&gt;Mail Flow Details&gt;Forwarded to another Email.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Unfortunately I am unable to answer this since I am contracted to do some of the IT work, and the previous Rep did not document everything properly. &nbsp;I have the company looking into it for me so I will re-post when/If I get an answer but the rest of
 the information is below. Or if you can tell me where to check on an admin account I have that access as well.</p>
<p>2, 3, 4. I will see if I can explain this better from what was explained to me. &nbsp;User 1's Email was set to forward to User 2. &nbsp;When User 1
</p>
<p>returned to work, Forwarding was turned off. &nbsp;User 2 does not get any emails from user 1 anymore, but whenever User 1 sets up a meeting or calendar event (Even without User 2 needing an invitation, or being part of the event) User 2 still gets an email with
 the event confirmation. &nbsp;Hopefully that clears this up a little bit.</p>
<p>5. Both Users are using Outlook 2010 to access their information.</p>

<p>Hi BrianNelson5914,</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>The issue does not seem to be an noremal behavior, to better understand and solve it, I need to the following information:</p>
<p>1. Please send your email address suffix to me via private message.</p>
<p>2. Can User 2 receive the normal emails(besides meeting invitation) which are sent to User 1 currently?</p>
<p>3. Please provide the .msg file of two emails as samples: one is the email sent to User 2 when forwarding is enabled, the other is the email of meeting request sent to User 2 when forwarding is turned off. To save the emails as .msg files, please follow
 the steps below:<br />
a. Choose the email you want to save.<br />
b. Click the File tab.<br />
c. Click Save As.<br />
d. In the Save in list, click the location where you want to save the file.<br />
e. In the File name box, type a name for the file.<br />
f. In the Save as type list, click the file type that you want.</p>
<p>I have sent a private message to collect the email suffix and .msg file. Click the link below to access the private message:<br />

    <title>It must be one of the most asked questions about macros - why has it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d pauldalton  say:</h3>
<h2>            It must be one of the most asked questions about macros - why has it not been addressed in the macro language after all these years&#63;</h2>
                    To those of us who are just users and not programmers, it seems like MS Word "macros" -- particularly recorded macros -- ought to include the capability to be easily constructed to (1) go to some identifiable place in a document and "do" some things starting
 from that point (such as "find" a new paragraph immediately followed by the word "publish", then go to the end of that line of text and insert "**") and then (here comes the sticking point) (2) repeat that series of activities over and over UNTIL some identifiable
 point is reached in the document [e.g., the end of the page; the end of the document; the end of the paragraph].&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
But for some reason, Word macros cannot be made to do that in an "easy for non-programmers to understand" sort of way.&nbsp; I've had it explained to me several times that I must use references to "ranges" and/or "counts" and all sorts of other commands that seem
 overly complicated to just "go to a place and do this", then go to the next such place, and do the same thing", and keep doing that UNTIL . . .&nbsp; It's certainly nothing that can be accomplished by recording a macro (as it logically should be.) &nbsp; With help,
 I'll finally get a macro cobbled together to do what I need done.&nbsp; But when the next occasion to do something like that comes along -- maybe a year later -- I've forgotten all those inscrutable concepts and I once again find myself just needing to record a
 macro doing some set of activities and then have it repeat itself through the document.
<br />
<br />
I know it's easy for programmers to understand all these arcane requirements to be able to get a macro to work through a document that way, but a lot of us "out here" are just regular users who occasionally need to be able to do repetitive tasks within a particular
 document and believe it should be easier to accomplish this sort of thing than it appears the macro language permits.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Can someone explain why the macro language cannot be made to easily allow a macro to just do something like:&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp; DO <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [find &lt;text&gt;, then move from there to another point 8 characters away and then make some change to the text at that point], then
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOOP (DOing that same series of things again} UNTIL [the End of the Page or the End of the Document is reached], then just Stop the macro</i> from further executing.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I haven't used the right syntax above, but I hope you get the point - it ought to be just that simple to accomplish that sort of chore, but it isn't.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain WHY the macro language CAN'T work this way or, if it could be made to do so, why Microsoft has not done it in all these many years while countless ordinary users have struggled with (and posted questions all over the Internet about) this
 specific concept?&nbsp; <br />

            <div>I have a few observations, and that's probably about all I'll be able to contribute here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In order to get much further with getting Microsoft to do this, you'll need to get your idea onto their agenda. While it's possible that ideas posted here sometimes get some attention from them, you can't guarantee it: you aren't really dealing with Microsoft
 people (it's mostly volunteers), and certainly not the Microsoft product group people, in here. So you either need to know someone, or find a proxy (either someone close or perhaps an influential corporate that can see the value of the idea). As for timing,
 I don't know what their product cycle looks like now, either - it could well be changing rapidly as their Office 365 subscription service develops. But if it's the old cycle, I would guess they already have the outline if not most of the details for the version
 after 2013 and may be thinking about ideas after that. Also, I would be very surprised if they did not want to be absolutely sure of their ground as far as Intellectual Property is concerned.</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>On the technical front, the biggest technical questions for me are "what can be done in the 'DO' part of the feature?" (i.e. the one you described a few messages back)&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>If it's "execution of an arbitrary macro", then it can do anything VBA can do, form "something sensible" to "accidentally trash every file on the system." It can also contain infinite loops, code that results in untrappable errors - at least not trappable
 by VBA - and doubtless other things I haven't even thought about that may result in dismay for the user.</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>As long as the user is willing to take responsibility for their part of the code,
<i>I</i> don't see any <i>technical</i>&nbsp;</span><span>showstoppers</span><i>.</i><span>&nbsp;But that doesn't mean that such problems won't turn up.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>From a support perspective though, having a half-and-half feature like that is a bit of a liability, to say the least.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Going to a slightly more detailed level, when I read your earlier messages, I got the impression that you were keen to avoid the more techie stuff involving selections, ranges etc. The trouble is that if the user still has to write VBA, e.g. to find something
 then move a few words to the right or whatever, they still have to understand that stuff. What's more, in the general case some code will function in (say) a paragraph in the main body of the document, but fail in a footer (say). In other words, in many cases
 the user would need to understand even more about their code.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I first read your question, I had a slightly different idea as to what you were driving at. To me, how you avoid dealing with "allowing any piece of VBA" is to try to identify a small but potent set of things the user might want to do (obviously reducing
 the generality obtainable in VBA) and allow them to do those things and nothing else. That's one of the reasons I suggested that a change to the recorder might be needed - you'd only be able to record the things that the feature is designed to allow. Then
 the feature takes responsibility for making all that stuff happen. How to do that technically is a detail, but perhaps specify that the DO macro only contains calls to a number of predefined subs/functions that have been designed to behave well within the
 overall structure of the feature. Or define a completely new, small, non-VBA language and some VBA to interpret it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally, I know we have been taking about Word and VBA. But really, we're talking about providing a set of features for repetitive processing. The Web App version of Word doesn't have any of that stuff, and perhaps it is intended that it never will. But
 because it doesn't have VBA, it would I think benefit far more from a feature to let its users do something like "do this in every paragraph that begins with 'Jack Robinson'"&nbsp;</div>

            <p>D PaulDalton,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glad I could help and I understand your comments and concerns.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I don't know if your suggestions will ever get any traction even if they made it to the "right person.&nbsp; In line with what Jay and Peter have said, my experience is that VBA&nbsp;becomes less and less complete as Word progresses rather than more and
 more complete.&nbsp; For example, everything that you could do as a user with a drawing or shape object in Word 2003, you could do with VBA.&nbsp; With the new graphics engine introduced with Word 2010, there are many things that a user can do that now cannot be done
 with VBA.&nbsp; Most of the things that you can do with those graphics are not even recorded.&nbsp; I&nbsp;suspect&nbsp;that the recorder will go away before it becomes anything like you envision.&nbsp; Still, it is a good and valid&nbsp;vision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Nokia 700 Software Updates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 700 Software Updates</h2>
                    
<p>After contacting Nokia Care via both email and telephone, I am still not able to update my two North American model Nokia 700s (unbranded, unlocked) to even FP1, let alone FP2. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, they are at software version <span>111.020.0309.</span>&nbsp; However, both the email agent and telephone agent confirmed that, based on my IMEI numbers, my phones should be at software version
<span>113.010.1506.</span>&nbsp; Here is an excerpt from the email reply I just received yesterday:</p>
<span>113.010.1506.</span>&nbsp; Here is an excerpt from the email reply I just received yesterday:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><span>In response to your concern, we are sorry to hear that your two (2) Nokia 700 still does not receive any update. We would like to inform you that the latest software release for the said device model in the United States is 113.010.1506.</span></p>
<p><span>--------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of their suggestions was to make sure that I tried to update via PC as well as via the phone itself. &nbsp;Unfortunately, both the on-board software updater and Nokia PC updater say that the phones are up-to-date at the aforementioned software version&nbsp;<span>111.020.0309.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What gives? &nbsp;I really need to get these phones updated, as I need some of the FP1/2 features for work purposes (updated MS Apps, for one).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind going into a Nokia Care center, but that would be a last resort, since it is probably going to involve a long drive somewhere, since I don't think there is one anywhere in Minnesota. :/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the info. re <strong>CCleaner Malware Incident</strong>. Microsoft may not recommend the use of programs that include a registry cleaner, but that's not likely to stop the rest of us from recommending CCleaner. ;-)&nbsp; DYK, they included a registry
 cleaner in Win95 called RegClean?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>CCleaner is a very popular, highly recommended program. It's not comparable to some of those questionable Windows repair, fix-it type apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>As for it may intefere with Windows Defender, you failed to mention you can just uncheck Defender under Applications section.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit</strong>: It'd be good to change the title of your post, imo, since the problem isn't with CCleaner in general. It's in reference to downloads between specific dates.<br />

<p>Nope Carol, most of the long-term MVP and other members here have been recommending against the use of any registry cleaner including CCleaner since at least the point at which Microsoft shifted their own official stance, pulling the Windows Live OneCare
 registry cleaner that was once part of the online safety scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurred at roughly the time the OneCare antivirus stopped being sold in 2008, though many of us&nbsp;here had been recommending against using registry cleaners for quite a while before that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best article I've found that covers this evolution, referencing both the&nbsp;history at Microsoft and the reasons for the change itself, which have to do with changes in the design and operation of the registry since the release of Windows Vista, is the
 following.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/microsoft-support-registry-cleaners-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft does not support use of Registry Cleaners in Windows</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So those still holding onto the long past legacy of registry cleaners are actually acting in direct opposition to what Microsoft recommends, no matter what they choose to believe.&nbsp; Typically this is due to the fact that they really have no understanding
 what a registry cleaner does and doesn't do, especially as relates to the lack of ability to determine whether or not removing something might in truth be damaging to the registry and so the entire operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that there are no simple standards of what should or shouldn't be removed, since that's typically decided by those designing the original program.&nbsp; So the commonly held belief that any program not currently installed should have everything
 relating to it removed is actually wrong, since in some cases these legacy keys are required in order to keep that portion of the registry stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this reason it's necessary for the person operating a registry cleaner to fully understand the ramifications of the registry changes they are about to make, which with a moments thought is easy to realize can't be true, since only the original application
 creator truly knows this for certain.&nbsp; This is the basic flaw that makes all registry cleaning inherently dangerous and precisely why Microsoft itself dropped the Windows Live OneCare registry cleaning module.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A great example is the existence of "First Run" selections within the Office application suite and in fact many programs using the Microsoft Installer, since this type of key is inherently designed to look like an orphaned entry within the registry.&nbsp; The
 first time I ever tried CCleaner myself&nbsp;many years ago I immediately realized it had mistaken many of these keys within my partially installed Office package, which if I'd allowed it to remove these would have broken their designed ability to prompt for the
 original installation CD if an attempt was made to open that particular program feature.&nbsp; Instead I immediately uninstalled the actual dangerous program, CCleaner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't understand what I'm explaining, you're indicating to those here who do precisely why we are so clearly against the use of all registry cleaners.&nbsp; Only those with&nbsp;a deep knowledge of the registry and the individual applications that use it are
 really capable of making such decisions, but you'll actually find that most of these skilled&nbsp;individuals have stopped using them themselves for this very reason, instead choosing to manually peruse the registry for the specific keys needing to be changed on
 the rare occasion this might be necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the registry cleaning feature is removed from CCleaner, it basically becomes a glorified file cleaner, which since a well behaved system does much of this itself today,&nbsp;is also unnecessary.&nbsp; Whatever the built-in Windows functions don't already do themselves
 are typically better off done with simple targeted tools designed to remove only well known temporary files for example, rather than a general purpose "cleaner" that tries to&nbsp;perform multiple functions some of which have always required a technically skilled&nbsp;person
 rather than&nbsp;the typical&nbsp;uninformed consumer PC owner.</p>

<p><span><br />
Since I'm in my 70's I'm well aware of Win 95. &nbsp;For some reason MS became concerned about registry&nbsp;cleaning programs and tuneup utilities and they quit including it in their programs (and stopped recommending such) before OneCare was phased out in 2009. &nbsp;I
 never asked why.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Rob, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't rec the registry cleaning tool in CCleaner either, but the main use for CCleaner isn't for registry cleaning. It's used to clean out temp folders, TIF, Cookies, etc. and can also be used to uninstall programs, remove browser add-ons, delete old restore
 points and many other things. All I said, was "t<em>hat's not likely to stop the rest of us from recommending CCle</em><em>aner</em>." I wasn't ref'g to registry cleaning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. You said you tried CCleaner 'many' yrs. ago. I'm sure things have changed and improved since then. I understand the registry fairly well. I've never seen anything listed that would cause problems, or has. I've used it for yrs.</p>

<p>Yes Carol, things with CCleaner had changed, with the addition of individual sections relating to specific programs such as Windows Defender having caused many issues for users of that and the earlier Microsoft Security Essentials and thus&nbsp;much pain and
 aggravation for those supporting them here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CCleaner is an anachronism from the days of Windows 9x and XP, with most of its purpose long ago replaced by functions built into Windows itself.&nbsp; The very idea of "cleaning" a system is akin to the reason an automotive dealer cleans the windshield or even
 the entire car today, since it makes the owner feel better about their vehicle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that CCleaner has been sold to another vendor is an indication that the need and so interest in such archaic tools is waning as most today expect whatever operating system they purchase to maintain itself, which Windows&nbsp;8.1 &amp; 10 do quite well in
 my experience.</p>

<p>Ads for&nbsp;questionable 3rd-party utilities are&nbsp;one of the many reasons we've been recommending against registry cleaning, optimization and other&nbsp;such tools for around 10 years now, since most of these are not reputable and the tiny handful that may be provide
 so little of value that they're not worth the potential risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases the Microsoft built-in utilities provide everything that the typical consumer requires.&nbsp; Since the Disk Cleanup utility provides individual selections for all items that Microsoft considers safe and necessary to remove, I'd rather use that
 then a 3rd-party tool that intentionally rips out items that were never intended to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though it's possible to use the task scheduler to schedule a disk cleanup operation, I've personally seen so few temporary file remnants left behind recently that I rarely even&nbsp;bother to use the tool any longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there are settings within the Internet Explorer and Edge browsers that allow for Temporary Internet files to either be limited in size and/or automatically emptied on exit from the browser, I've found these to be far more useful than any manual deletion&nbsp;tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Temporary files left by malware are typically found in the browser cache files automatically removed on proper exit from the browser, so these are of no true concern.&nbsp; If malware has already succeeded in infecting a system then the location of these files
 isn't important, since the protection has already failed.&nbsp; With the browser and other security&nbsp;settings I use along with Windows Defender, neither my Windows 8.1 or 10 systems have ever been successfully infected, so temporary files are incidental and unimportant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There hasn't been a good reason to delete cookies in years, since the advanced browser settings controlling these provide the ability to block or prompt, which is a far better way to manage cookies, since&nbsp;they perform their activities during a browsing session.&nbsp;
 Once the session is exited the privacy issues&nbsp;cookies can create have already been&nbsp;completed, so it's too late to have any useful impact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm a Microsoft fanboy for using its products and stating so,&nbsp;then what are you when you argue for a 3rd-party product like CCleaner?</p>

<p>CCleaner (if used) should be dumbed way down for temp file cleaning, from the default setting. And never go into any Registry or Tool setting.&nbsp; As non-Monkey57 clients do not know my recommended setting, I agree, CCleaner should not be used by users that
 do not have a&nbsp;<em>Local</em>&nbsp;competent Tech Support person, who has preconfigured it, and keeps it updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side note: (as bhringer noted):&nbsp; CCleaner has been being detected as Backdoor:Win32/Floxif by both Malwarebytes and Windows Defender (and other products) recently.&nbsp; So now users of CCleaner have another thing to worry about, besides the default configuration
 messing with windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you bhringer for the resent links, and Le Boule for starting this discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit note 2: thank you also for the warning about not clicking on the tricky Ads on the Ad supported websites... I don't recommend popup blockers, as they generally interfere with the smooth operation of browsers (especially as they update), &amp; I do not agree
 with the Blackmail Business models of most popup blockers, requiring advertiser to pay them to allow their ads to go through, imho making the product(s) untrustworthy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit note 3: &nbsp;The CCleaner update within the Free version should do a direct download/install, instead of requiring Free users to update via the ad supported tricky website, but only if the version installed was their most recent version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/builds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/builds</a></p>
<p>(will let users of the product download the most current Standard Free version without the tricky ads (as noted by "José Antonio Pontón Posada CEO" in posts in other threads)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check for updates for everything on a device on a regular basis, including from the non-Microsoft products' MFG website, or directly from within the specific program you are trusting (not another updater product). &nbsp;It's always a pain when products
 have vulnerabilities discovered, personally I can not think of a product that has not required updating for security vulnerabilities/stability issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>"If I'm a Microsoft fanboy for using its products and stating so,&nbsp;then what are you when you argue for a 3rd-party product like CCleaner?"</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I use MS products also, obviously, but I think you're odd in that you steer away from 3rd party apps. You can call me a traitor I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to keep useless junk cleaned off my system, which accumulates over time. I just run it weekly, biweekly, or whenever. Disk Cleanup utility is practically worthless. Everyone has their own preferences. I don't need MS to tell
 me what's safe or not safe. I'm not a novice. I don't let MS dictate what I can/can not, or should not do. It's that simple. Everyone else can do as they choose also. Good reason or not, we all have our own prefs.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The main reason to run it when a system's infected with malware is because full scans take a lot of time. The less the removal apps have to scan, the shorter the scan time obviously.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>To me CCleaner is simply a convenient and quicker way to get to various locations on my system, with a shortcut on my taskbar. I can easily disable/enable startup entries or delete them. There are times when I didn't realize something
 was added to startup. I can easily check there. It's a more convenient, quicker way to uninstall apps. I can delete old restore points, without the need to go through several steps. I don't use disk analyzer or dup file finder, etc.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>You seem to imply I don't know what I'm doing, if I run the registry cleaner included. I have a very good understanding of what a registry cleaner does/doesn't do. I also understand the entries and the so-called ramifications. I
 know what missing shared DLL's means, or invalid app locations, etc. I'm not a noob, but I do NOT advise users to run the registry cleaner. It's not possible to know what level of experience they have, and it's totally unnecessary.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I've uninstalled huge programs completely, manually using the registry editor. That is, programs that wouldn't uninstall. I s'pose that's a scary place to you too, eh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong><em>The fact that CCleaner has been sold to another vendor is an indication that the need and so interest in such archaic tools is waning</em>..."</strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>So Avast purchased CCleaner because interest is waning?? Yeah, that makes sense, Rob! That must be the reason Microsoft purchased Skype, too. It must be the reason Twitter purchased Tweetdeck, because not many users are interested any longer. *face palm*</p>

<h2>            Email merge with Word and Outlook. Error message 550 5.7.1 q3UIRfkH031549 This message does not comply with required standards.</h2>
                    I am having issues with a mail merge email being sent out. I can create teh mail merge, the emails get sent and no sooner do they send than I get them all bouncing back saying 550 5.7.1 q3UIRfkH031549 This message does not comply with required standards.
 I have spoken with my ISP and there are no spam filters on my outgoing email and there is no signature on these outgoing emails to interfere. They only thing they suggested was to do a system restore to before I started having these issues. Anyone have any
 other ideas?

<div>As I understand it, a 550 5.7.1 signifies an "Unable to relay" error, but I do not know if that is a universal error message that all types of server should issue, or whether it is specific to MS Exchange servers (where various configuration issues might
 cause it). Personally, I would probably start by trying to verify that the message is being sent via the Outlook account that I was expecting (which isn't necessarily the one that you normally use to send messages).</div>
