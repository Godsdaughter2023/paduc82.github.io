<h2>            Cheaters and Exploiters </h2>
                    
<p>So last night I am in COD:AW go into a match with my friends and turns out there is a glitch on the map. Well the person who exploited this did very well. We come out and has we are discussing to report the player he&nbsp;says "I've been reported&nbsp;on for&nbsp;the last
 10 yrs and have never been banned". Seriously, Is the reporting pointless? Why even have reporting has an option if nothing is done? Is it fair for us players who have integrity to hear such ramblings from&nbsp;cheaters and&nbsp;exploiters?&nbsp;I report players all the
 time for such violations of the code but never know if judgment has been passed. Would love to hear from the xbox live gods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>People do get banned on xbox live, but i honestly don`t think they are based on our reports.</p>
<p>I have reported hundreds of people over the years that i know full well have cheated/modded in one way or another, the vast majority, if not all, are still going strong today.</p>
<p>I believe anyone banned are those caught red handed by enforcement, and our reports have very little to do with leading them there.</p>
<p>I actually don`t even bother reporting any more, its not worth it.</p>

<p>I understand that the enforcers have a lot of reports to sift through. I am sure there are a lot of gamers that get reported just because somebody is being spiteful toward somebody. I know I get called a cheater on several occasions just because I have a
 good game. I tell them "I don't cheat and that its a violation of the code of conduct if I did such an act." I am just on a rant and needed to get it out. It would be nice to get some sort of thanks for the report and that its being looked into.</p>

<p>i posted in enforcement and opted to get notified but did not limit it to just my complaint. overwhelmed with about 3000 in a very short time - week? interesting ad entertaining as it was to see all the banned whiners complaining, questioning and yes threatening.
 surely the were a few innocent victims in there. i did have to stop the email notification and now stop in and read. it is ineffective and exploitable in that the offender could report you or worse hack you so keep it private. they make money off banning which
 can compensate for the effort. i say, give people an option not to play with the cheaters as a group not avoid this player individually after you have been trashed because your not supposed to leave the game early. so let the ethically challenged play among
 themselves - cheaters cheating cheaters. well we certainly can not trust them to say yes i am a cheater so programmatically it has to be done. yes it can be done. not 100% &nbsp;and it is an ongoing process, yet feasible. i reported a pervert and stated i could
 provide the gtags and answer any questions if they wanted to contact me so not to be liable for posting a perverts or young kids info. i even stated if the did nothing i would post it in many other social sites to make it go viral.one post was deleted and
 the other said insufficient information---DA! I TOLD THEM THEY COULD CONTACT ME and i would provide info and that was their response...legally i could not post it. sad when dismissing complaints about pedophiles...</p>

<p>The reporting system does work. Only if the enforcement team gets enough evidence and proof a individual is doing the wrong thing, they will get the ban hammer. Incocent until proven guilty.

<p>followup questioning about the perve would have been enlightening. i could/would not post a kids gtag but offered to tell them privately. //// as for the reputation score being extracted from all that info well the words ongoing process and a reference to
 percentage related to programmatically detecting and not the reputation factor although it could be weighed in. rep can be affected by anyone legit or not. if there is a problem with ethically challenged people exploiting the game and fair players becoming
 victims what makes you think they wont exploit the rep system and what resilient measures are you referring too. got a link to something i can read that programmatically sifts out the unscrupulous. im not downing the rep sys but realize it is open for abuse
 and a slow way to avoid the unethical gamers one by one ruining the game played. better to have an option to say i choose not to play with the list of players you have compiled through various means not just rep sys. algorithms, Actuarial science and more.
 it can work that way</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Vaynel, the new Rep System on the Xbox One is not based on Player or Peer Review. There is nothing to leave "negative rep" even if someone wanted to do so. I would say that is a pretty effective way of not allowing false Peer
 Review to occur. lol if they don't have a "negative rep" Button, they can't really leave any negative rep now, can they?<br />

Kinda hard to abuse something that's not there.</span></p>

<h2>            Passwords.......</h2>
                    So I tried to sign into Skype on my mobile device, which triggered a password reset as "someone was trying to access my account" Which after changing the password it asked me to change my password again to "Prove it was really me"<br />
<br />
I'm not the kind of guy who has 2,159,234,531 passwords saved up just dying to use them. I have like 6 that I alternate, and sites that use a system that never ever rotate password usage really really agitate me, ESPECIALLY, when they get false positives all
 the time and need you to change your password every time you sneeze. Not to mention the fact that they hide any form of contact information behind "community boards" to avoid needing any kind of customer support for people that have this kind of issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there any way around this password series of hoops and leaps they make you do, or anyone I should call to actually help me with my account? Or should I just dump microsoft for everything that isn't my OS? (And considering even that)

<h2>            Windows 8.1 laptop shuts off by itself</h2>
                    My problem is that after updating to 8.1, after roughly 5 minutes or so of not using my laptop, it shuts off by itself. &nbsp;I always come back to my laptop and it's shut off. &nbsp;I know it's not overheating because this is a brand new laptop, and the actual
 laptop is cold. &nbsp;This has to be software issue but I can't find anything about it. &nbsp;I did fix the secureboot isn't configured anymore by going into the BIOS and turning it off I believe, or whatever the fix was. &nbsp;Not sure if that would have any affect on this
 or not. &nbsp;Any help? &nbsp;This is getting very frustrating. &nbsp; &nbsp;

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this problem too, my new Toshiba E55 Satellite with&nbsp;Windows 8&nbsp; shuts off randomly.&nbsp; It was working well out of the box for the first few days, I added Corel quattro pro, Abobe, Trend&nbsp;Micro&nbsp;and updated to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Now &nbsp;it decided to&nbsp;shut off with
 a loud click&nbsp;every time I use it, usually within 20 minutes of use.&nbsp; Does not matter if I am using the battery or line power.&nbsp; Have changed power settings to never sleep, it still shuts off.&nbsp; Does not appear to matter which program or app&nbsp;I am using.&nbsp; No error
 messages have been recorded and the laptop appears to work fine after I manually restart it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried it in Safe Mode and it shut itself&nbsp;off within 20 minutes.&nbsp; The bottom of the laptop is cool to the touch and am running a cooling fan as a precaution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peter</p>

            My laptop is having the same exact issue - after upgrading to Windows 8.1, there are random shutdowns in the middle of doing work.&nbsp; It's not overheating (happens when PC is still cool) but it might look like it has to do with memory issues - when there
 is a load on the computer, it shuts off automatically.&nbsp; It happens in the middle of doing work and losing unsaved work.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; It's a software issue because this only started happening after switching to Windows 8.1

            <p>Update on the laptop auto shut off problem.&nbsp; I have timed the period the laptop works and it is exactly 30 minutes until it shuts itself off.&nbsp; I timed it on 5 consecutive uses and it shuts off after&nbsp;exactly 30 minutes of use, often when I am actively typing.&nbsp;
 Checked it on battery only power (shows full charge when tested) as well as line power.&nbsp; Same result, shuts down after 30 minutes.&nbsp; Checked sleep and power use functions, set to never sleep, maximum performance power level.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still shuts itself off.&nbsp; Shuts
 itself off in safe mode too, so running lengthy diagnostics is impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop seems to be sleeping&nbsp;on the job!&nbsp; Maybe my work is too boring....</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just asking, when it powers down, is it a hard power down or soft power down ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, does it just switches off like a light bulb in an instant or you see the usual shutdown process happening there ??</p>

<p>
</p><p>It actually shows the shutdown process, as if I pressed "Shut Down" on the start menu. Fun fact, it also turns on by itself. There's no active WOL or resume by keyboard/mouse options via BIOS.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 firewall won&#39;t start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lukehayne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 firewall won&#39;t start</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have been having a problem with windows firewall for several months now, I have tried all the suggestions from Microsoft and the community with no progress. I was hoping to get this issue fixed but seem to be going in circles, any help would be
 much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the thing, I had installed Kaspursky's protection suite which was working fine for a while, I then received a windows update some time later and my Kaspursky firewall had stopped working. I troubleshooted Kaspursky and Microsoft issues with no luck.
 I then completely removed kaspursky from my system and tried to activate windows firewall which did not work. I then troubleshooted all known problems with windows firewall through Microsoft support / community. Since the problems with windows firewall, I
 am also having issues with windows update which probably isn't related but maybe worth mentioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I click any of the methods for starting windows firewall services I do not get any error messages, it just takes a while to think and then fails to start.</p>
<p>
I have included a screenshot relating to the issue from event viewer...

    <title>Latency of the &#34;New&#34; Surface Pen on older Surface devices - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Latency of the &#34;New&#34; Surface Pen on older Surface devices</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, Microsoft announced New Surface Pen, and claims that it is the fastest pen in the world. According to Verge, this new pen is compatible on older devices. However, it also says that its new tilting feature is not available, at least for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering whether this new pen gives a faster performance on older devices as well, or is "just compatible" (which means that it works okay on older devices, but the performance is identical with its predecessor).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Apple launched Apple Pencil, they said the touch sensor on iPad Pro is twice faster than regular iPads. (Actually that was a good excuse for why Apple Pencil doesn't work on other iPads.) If Microsoft employed a similar method, then this new pen would
 be faster only on new devices.</p>

            <p>unknown. and regardless of any advance PR statements, the real performance won't<br />be known until end users start using it and reporting their experiences, which<br />will probably depend on what app they are using, etc.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p><br />I'm wondering whether this new pen gives a faster performance on older devices as well, or is "just compatible" (which means that it works okay on older devices, but the performance is identical with its predecessor).</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>I've just visited Microsoft Store. They welcomed to test the new pen on my own Surface Pro 4. Sadly, I felt little difference between old and new pens. The new pen is faster on new device for sure, but it seems that the delay is smaller only on the new Surface
 Pro. I would not buy the new pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of curiosity, I also tested the new iPad Pro 10.5 in the Apple Store. Apple Pencil's latency was noticeably smaller on the new iPad Pro. Actually, it feels like writing on a real paper! On the spec sheet, New Surface Pro and iPad should give similar
 feelings (about 20ms latency). However, I felt difference between those two; iPad has smaller latency, once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still Surface pen has several advantages over Apple pencil. It has an eraser, and magnetic side, which are quite handy in real life. Also it makes greater friction thanks to its rubber tip, as oppose to plastic on Apple pencil. However the latency on new
 iPad Pro was almost zero, which was very awesome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 1.5 years ago, I chose Surface Pro 4 over iPad Pro 12.9. Actually, Apple pencil gives a smaller latency at that time as well, but it was not quite perfect. But on new iPad Pro, it is now almost perfect, at least in the latency problem. Apple truly
 nailed it! If I would buy a new tablet this time for nice writing experience, I would choose iPad. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi there everyone I'm hoping you can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to delete a folder off my secondary HDD after installing a video game however I'm getting the following error "Error 0x80070091: the directory is not empty"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I've had a search around and ran a CHKDSK check on the drive and it's fine, also tried to delete the folder in safe mode and tried to use AVG shred feature all the no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping you all have some further suggestions that I could try as this is starting to stress me about a little and I'm fearing HDD failure!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance :)</p>

            <p><span>Hello Nick,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This could be a permission issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can refer to the below steps to provide <strong><span>full permission</span></strong> to a particular folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Select the file or folder which you need to provide <strong><span>full permission</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Now <strong><span>right click</span></strong> on that file or folder and click on
<strong><span>Properties.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong><span>Security tab</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong><span>user account</span></strong> through which you are logged in. Clicking on the
<strong><span>user</span></strong> will show you the <strong><span>permissions</span></strong> set for the user pertinent to the
<strong><span>folder.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>After you have viewed the <strong><span>permissions</span></strong> that are already set, you can now click on the
<strong><span>Advanced Button</span></strong> that is right below the "Permissions for Authenticated Users".</span></li><li><span>Once you have clicked <strong><span>Advanced</span></strong>, a box would appear, the "<strong><span>Permission Entries</span></strong>" box, which shows all the
<strong><span>permissions</span></strong> that are set for the <strong><span>users</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Now, after you have <strong><span>spotted</span></strong> the <strong><span>user</span></strong> whose
<strong><span>permissions</span></strong> you wish to <strong><span>change</span></strong>, click "<strong><span>Change Permissions".</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong><span>user</span></strong> you would like to <strong>
<span>edit</span></strong>, and then click the option that says "<strong><span>Change Permissions</span></strong>" which is
<strong><span>right below the box</span></strong>. To change permission you have to click on
<strong><span>edit.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Once <strong><span>edit</span></strong> is <strong><span>clicked</span></strong>, you are going to get the same box pop up but this time you can actually edit the options. You can do that by clicking the "<strong><span>Administrators</span></strong>"
 user again, and this time, you are going to click the "<strong><span>Edit</span></strong>" option.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Reference:</strong></span></p>

            This is not an acceptable answer. The forum you forwarded me to closed in April, 2014, and their ticketing system is non-functional anymore. It is uncalled for that Microsoft continues to sell a game that they provide no support for. I am already contacting
 the attorney general and the BBB about this issue, and plan on receiving a full refund since apparently no one at Microsoft can provide any actual support. If anyone else has an actual answer to this issue, feel free to respond.

<p>Hello omgimsoconfused,</p>
<p>Look at the following article from Roxio dealing with the "invalid key" error message.<br />
"Invalid CD Key" error when re-installing Easy Media Creator 9<br />

<h2>            Dunstanburgh Castle - NOT Ardvreck Castle</h2>
                    <p>The Windows 10 Lock Screen photograph of Ardvreck Castle in Scotland is completely wrong.&nbsp; It's
<strong>Dunstanburgh Castle</strong> in Northumberland, England taken from the north where the face of the ruin is hidden.&nbsp; As such, your "quiz" is then also wrong as the castle is very much in
<span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)"><strong>England </strong></span>and not Scotland.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I grew up next to this Northumbrian castle / ruin and 100% certain the image is of it.</p>

<span>Well here is my problem, I have a rather strange situation which you probably dont run into everyday, but thanks for listening anyways and i hope you can help me. So, one day I really wanted to make an xbox live account.My friend, was helping me set up
 an xbox live for my account, and it said that a parent email was required.So what he did was he ended up entering all this fake information for an email thinking it was just a one time deal in order to read the terms of use, give child accounts privilages
 and other things. However,today I learned that I need a parents password to get in and I cant sign in to my xbox live because it was all fakey information. It is extremely important to me to keep this account rather than to make a new one as I have spent large
 amounts of money purchasing accessories and extras for my xbox live account. Is it possible for you to manually terminate this account? Thank you</span>

<p>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you see the <span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced Boot Options</span> menu you can stop tapping.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You can help solve some computer problems and improve the performance of your computer by making sure that your hard disk has no errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Click to open Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Right-click the hard disk drive that you want to check, and then click Properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Click the Tools tab, and then, under Error-checking, click Check Now. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select Automatically fix file system errors. Otherwise, the disk check will simply report problems but not fix them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To perform a thorough disk check, select Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors. This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on the hard disk itself, and it can take much longer to complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both Automatically fix file system errors and Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Click Start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Depending upon the size of your hard disk, this may take several minutes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For best results, don't use your computer for any other tasks while it's checking for errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Note</p>
<p>
If you select Automatically fix file system errors for a disk that is in use (for example, the partition that contains Windows), you'll be prompted you to reschedule the disk check for the next time you restart your computer.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should resolve your problem.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Let us know if these steps resolve your problem.&nbsp; I hope the information is useful.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Regards,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  Battergi
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try installing the beta version of the Xbox app to see if it works. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-beta/9nblggh1j27h#activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-beta/9nb...</a>
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />First of all, make sure you are running the latest version of Windows 10. Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates 
<br />
<br />Wait while any pending updates are downloaded. 
<br />
<br />If not...
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator/active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Minecraft
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />download the following utility and use it to remove Minecraft: extract it, launch it, scroll through the list, select Minecraft then click Remove. 
<br />

<br />
<br />Download and reinstall Minecraft for Windows 10 - Microsoft Store
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/minecraft-for-windows-10/9nblggh2jhxj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/minecraft-for...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try disabling connected experiences and telemetry:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Feedback and diagnostics. 
<br />Set it to basic 
<br />
<br />Click Start 
<br />Type: regedit 
<br />Right click regedit 
<br />Click Run as administrator 
<br />
<br />Navigate to the following key: 
<br />
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection. 
<br />
<br />Right click and create a DWORD value named AllowTelemetry then set 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />
<br />Type gpedit.msc then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Expand Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components
<br />
<br />In the Windows Components dialog, find and right-click on Data Collection and Preview Builds
<br />Then double-click Allow Telemetry in the right pane
<br />Choose Disabled and choose 3-Full from the drop-down menu.
<br />Then click OK to save settings
<br />
<br />Click Apply and ok &gt; reboot computer

            It starts loading him in and it will either connect him to my sisters world (who was in the other room) or put him back in the menu and say "unable to connect to world". Im not sure if there was a message or not because he was at his house.

    <title>Surface Book not connecting to mobile hotspot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan_devon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book not connecting to mobile hotspot</h2>
                    <p>I have just become the proud owner of a surface book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks great. But it cannot connect to a mobile wifi hotspot.... making it pretty useless as that is how I am regularly connecting to the net.</p>
<p>I am running windows 10 and have downloaded all of the available updates.</p>
<p>I have my old (trusty) HP Pavilion laptop from 2013 running along side me. It is also running windows 10 and is connecting to my mobile hotspot without any fuss.</p>
<p>When i attempt to connect the surface to the hotspot I get the 1st message "checking network requirement" then I get the conclusion "unable to connect to this network". The laptop does work when USB tethered to the same phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps completed so far:</p>
<p>1) checked for automatic updates and installed them all.</p>
<p>2) found the Marvel AVASTAR Wireless-AC Network controller and tried all three versions of the driver that are currently installed.</p>
<p>3) Done a full system restore (!!!)</p>
<p>4) Manually downloaded and installed the latest surface msi kit from microsoft</p>
<p>5) Phoned my mobile phone provided to check there are no restrictions at there end.</p>
<p>6) Changed the name and password of the Hotspot to simple things with no capitals or characters.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having this problem?.... have i just got a dud SB?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or ideas would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dan.</p>

            <p>There are definitely issues with wireless networking with the SB.&nbsp; For one, Microsoft changed some of the fundamentals in networking for Windows 10, which can cause things not to work.&nbsp; As an example, we have a Cisco-based WiFi network here in the office
 that is on the old side.&nbsp; No matter what I try, I cannot get the SB to connect to it.&nbsp; I've spent countless hours with tech support and many hours on my own all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in other words, from my own experience and what I've read, yes the Surface's can be finicky about wireless connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps if you change some of the security settings on your hotspot you might be able to make it work.&nbsp; Are you using, WEP, WPA, or WPA2?&nbsp; Have you tried it without a password just to see if you can connect that way (not that you'd want to do that normally,
 but just for troubleshooting).&nbsp; There is also a method for copying the wireless profile/configuration from your old laptop to the SB that might be helpful, too, though it is fairly complicated.</p>

            This is a personal device, so no IT Pro support is available to me.&nbsp; All that was available to me was Surface support and since I'm now over 90 days, that's gone, too.

            <p>Thanks the comments BanditoB1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't log my issues with IT Pro Slide... hadn't heard of that. But I was engaged with "know how" which is a technical service provided by PC World (UK). After all the steps I had already taken it was concluded to be a network adapter issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just been out and changed the surface book. I'm a bit over my surface issues for now but I will try again tomorrow and see if this one is any better. Hopefully it was just a rogue piece of kit. I'll update my progress tomorrow.</p>

            <p>As an update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was indeed a faulty network adapter. Pretty disappointing quality procedures for Microsoft's flagship product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway.... replacement surface book works OK. It is a bit temperamental when I switch to tablet mode.... seems to lose wireless signal pretty easily. Is OK when I reconnect it to the base. Still expect more than this. Clearly the wireless adapters used are
 not of premium quality. I saved up my pocket money to get this premium product... I expect premium components MS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this because I wanted an all in one with excellent performance, graphic card, and the ability to use a quality stylus. I am an engineer by trade and run some pretty powerful software and I am always taking notes. If I had to do this again I would
 buy the Dell XPS13 (regarded as the best laptop in the market) and a cheap little Surface 3 + stylus for doing some notes. Would have saved in the order of £500 and ended up with a better laptop than what I am seeing so far from the Surface Book (it is day
 #3 of this particular SB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps others in the future.</p>

            <p>As another (very grumpy) update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My second surface device (i7 256MB) now has also decided to stop connecting to Mobile hotspots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's be clear. The Surface Book is a mobile device that costs a tonne of money and I expect it to connect to mobile wifi connections - i.e. my phone - without any fuss (my £200 HP Pavilion can do it!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked for 2 days and now it doesn't (for no apparent reason). I have had to again contact my tech team. They pretty much told me to try all the steps above (again) and then concluded that returning it was the only option they could recommend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have then gone into my Surface Support App (provided with the surface book) to find that the "Live Chat" is hosted in Australia and is therefore out of hours. BRILLIANT... I am in the UK on a totally different timezone! I bought the SB in a massive UK
 chain store (PC World) and it has a UK keyboard... why do MS give me an Australian support line?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice at this stage to anyone researching surface books is to stay well clear of these buggy devices. I have wasted many hours trying to set this up!</p>

            <p>OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By trial and error i have got to the bottom of this on my second Surface Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that the surface book can only connect to wireless phone hotspots (not sure about all wireless networks) when it is in the laptop mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem came because I have the Surface book flipped around and closed like a tablet (but still connected to the base)... in this mode it does not connect to wireless devices. When I switch back to upright it is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I guess this is a software flaw that MS need to sort out (start working on the update MS!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(FYI my first surface book did not connect no matter what I did i.e. must have been a very dodgy adapter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully these issues may help someone in the future to save the time I have wasted. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this stage I am keeping my surface because A) It is quick B) looks and feels awesome to use C) returning it takes up even more of my chargeable time and d) (Most important for how I work) the stylus is amazing (it really is a great pen). Networking the
 device is very problematic but now I am over the hump I will persevere.</p>

</span></span><span>If you're trying to play an ASF or WMV file that was encoded with the Sipro Lab Telecom ACELP.net (130) audio codec; you might not be able to use
 Windows Media Player to play this file until you install an updated version of this codec that's compatible with this version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>As a workaround, you might be able to play this file by using a multimedia playback program other than Windows Media Player.</span></p>

<h2>            Save data issues</h2>
                    <p>anybody else have issues with their Scorpio edition. 3 weeks after getting it it kept crashing and wouldn’t power up. It was sent to Germany for repair. Since getting it back after 3 days of use it brings up save data error and I have to clear the cache and reset to factory default. Spoke to one of the support team through web chat and entered the port id’s to set my router to open NAT. Been okay for a few days and today it’s ended up doing it 4 times. Getting pretty pee’d off with the excuses given and wonder if it’s my internet like they suggest why the gears S console in our house plays days, weeks on end without issue. Seriously wish I’d not bothered getting one now and considering taking legal action against Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Computer sounds when a program opens or closes</h2>
                    Without my OK, my computer downloaded Windows 10 automatically. I brought it to my fix it shop to have Windows 7 put back on. When that was done I found that none of my sounds play when a program opens or closes except for when my emails finish loading
 and are ready for display. The fix it shop could not figure out why this happened and are still trying to get a fix on it. Any ideas ?

On my computer I always get these wrong results.<br />
I also checked on other computers, using other versions of Windows:<br />
Windows 7 Professional 32bit (Lenovo, intel i5&nbsp; 3.20GHz&nbsp; 2GB RAM),<br />
Windows 98 (yes, old 98).<br />
I got the same results in both cases.<br />
(Windows 98 calculator displays 1 digit less in -8.3...e-444)<br />
It seems that this error is the result of internal arithmetic procedures placed in the calculator code, unchanged in various versions of Windows and is roughly 20 years old or more.<br />

            <p>I had the same problem until I realized that I can open the games that my friend bought. If you are sharing games via the home console method, you just need to bring up that friend's profile. After signing in and out of my friend's profile, I was able to play the games I bought. Hope this helps.<br /></p>
