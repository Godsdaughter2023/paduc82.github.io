<h2>            Xbox 360 controller not connected on PC</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a xbox 360 controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plugged it into my laptop, windows 10 noticed a new device. When I use game controller tester, the app found no controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I opened device manager, there was no unknown device like in the tutorials online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I pressed the button between the start button and the back button on the controller, a red light appeared at number 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I opened game controllers, there was an USB Gamepad not xbox 360 controller. Then I open properties and tested the buttons, they all worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried playing minesweeper with it but nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me if this controller is real or fake? If it is real, please help me getting to play games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clearly a fake knock off Xbox 360 controller.&nbsp; The official controllers have different packaging.&nbsp; Which would probably explain why it only shows it as USB game-pad rather than an Xbox 360 controller in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what 'Minesweeper' game you're playing to test if controllers work on it or not.&nbsp; Do other games detect the controller?</p>

    <title>second monitor has display issues ad it flickers and dim some times - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            second monitor has display issues ad it flickers and dim some times along with shadow images.</h2>
                    <p>hey,</p>
<p>just from the jump, I'm a standard computer user, so if you're sharing a super technical solution with me, please explain how to do it. I'm not illiterate, i just don't spend much time in the guts of computers, hardware or software-wise</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running windows 10 on a lenovo laptop with a graphics tablet as a second monitor. it's a huion GT-185 HD. it's similar to a wacom cintiq. it's connected to my laptop with an HDMI cable and a USB input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting very strange graphical errors on this tablet since this morning, and have been at it all day trying to fix it.</p>
<p>The screen flickers and dims, and dragging any window onto this monitor results in a trippy trailing effect. the mouse also lags, leaving a trail of ghost images behind it. this effects all windows, including task manager. the screen looks almost JPEG artifacted..
 it's very weird. windows open on this monitor appear transparent-- you can see a ghost image of my desktop background behind them, and when my desktop background changes it gives me an overlay of both images.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>none of this occurs on my laptop screen. it doesn't matter which is set to be my main monitor, it will always be the Huion that has these problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've tried: I've updated windows' display drivers, and the lenovo drivers: no change</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connecting the huion to the same computer with a different HDMI cable: no change</p>
<p>
</p><p>connecting the huion to another laptop (very old acer running windows 7) via VGA cable: huion works
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">perfectly fine</span>. the laptop is too old to try HDMI hookup with it, and my current laptop hasn't got a blue VGA hookup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>updating the huion drivers: a problem of its own, the huion drivers simply don't install. idk how likely it is that faulty pen input drivers are the solution anyhow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>running malwarebytes picked up nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>system restore to last week when the monitor was working fine did nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have another monitor to try with this laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, the only thing i can think of is that the HDMI port on the huion broke for no reason, and I'll try hooking it up to a third computer as soon as i can. If i can prove the Huion only does this when hooked up to the lenovo, then at least i know my
 drawing tablet isn't broken. that'd be a start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help is appreciated. i have deadlines looming on multiple projects. losing the upcoming weekend will be a major blow for me.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>there isn't another OS installed on the tablet, it's a pressure-sensitive drawing monitor, it doesn't run alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried disabling what you suggested in msconfig, unfortunately that didn't do anything. I had updated windows along with my drivers before I system restored, that had no effect either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've just tried hooking the monitor up to another computer and am now experiencing the same graphical glitches and dimness there. I'm going to look into getting a new power cord, but it's possible that the monitor is just broken.</p>
<p>

                    <p>I have spent (wasted) the last 5 hours of my life trying to get my windows 10 Mail app to sync my account..&nbsp;<br />
The problem is NOT with my email provider because I've been chatting with them for 2 hours and they keep saying it's Windows Mail that's to blame.&nbsp;<br />
Every article on this topic is useless.<br />
My business is depending on this email thing to work SOON.<br />
I need immediate help from some of you because it's not possible to get personal support from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I've seen a ton of other people with the same issue and no one is doing anything to help..<br />
<br />
Come on, Microsoft, how hard can it be to fix a simple issue?<br />
I'm buying a Mac next time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP ME!</p>

            Yo, I just know I need to get help with this issue immediately before I lose my **** mind and throw my pc into a wall.<br />
<br />
My Windows mail 10 won't sync my emails from Roundcube. I want to use Mail as my email client but it's not working.<br />
<br />
When I add my account it tries to sync for a couple of minutes. Then I get a ''your account is out-of-date.''<br />
I can then ''Fix account'' which wants me to update my password.<br />
Then I write my password again (this is 100% the correct password, I promise) and it tries to sync for a couple of minutes just to do the same thing.<br />
<br />
I have repeated this cycle for 5 straight hours and I am THIS close to losing it.<br />
<br />
I've tried your Answer Desk which was probably the most useless thing I have ever experienced. He just wanted to sell me some kind of annual support package. Mmh.. ABSOLUTELY NOT JUST SOLVE MY ISSUE.<br />
<br />
Please.. do something.

            What does Roundcube have to say about the issue? You might contact them and they might know what the issue is with their service and Win10 Mail.

I've googled this, and a few forums came up with some suggestions. one in particular stated that something that was installed to start with windows is failiing, but i have been unable to find out what program it is that is causing the error, and i am unsure

            Hello AllieAdams, <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; I would suggest that you check the Nvidia support site for the latest video card drivers.&nbsp; Video card manufacturers generally create new drivers every month with improvements and fixes for various bugs.&nbsp;
<br />
There might be a newer driver listed now that will resolve the issue.&nbsp; Also look for a Nvidia Driver removal tool to completely remove your current driver before installing the new one.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this helps you.

<p><strong>Hi rusty275,</strong></p>
<p>1. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
2. Were there any changes made prior to this issue?<br />
<br />
Try the below steps: <br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1: </strong><br />
<strong><span>Uninstall and re-install the drivers for your Network adapter and check if you come across the issue.</span></strong></p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><span>a. Click on Start, click on Run and then type devmgmt.msc in the Run box.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>b. In Device Manager, locate the device under network adapters, and then right-click the device name.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>c. Select uninstall and restart the computer.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>d. Let Windows detect the device and install the drivers by itself.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If that does not help, install the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>If the issue still persists, d</span></span></strong><span><span>isable
 Antivirus\Firewall temporarily and then check for the issue.<br />
Note: Please make sure that you enable the antivirus software\firewall after performing the test to keep your computer protected.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Surface closing applications when locked</h2>
                    <p>So since the redstone update I'm facing a really annoying bug where some applications (namely: drawboard PDF and Nebo) close whenever the device goes in rest mode (also per button). I'm currently at balanced in the powersettings and I disabled the option
 that windows decides how to handle the application in background but the problem persist.</p>

    <title>Inaccurate gamerscore leaderboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sqaz attack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inaccurate gamerscore leaderboard </h2>
                    
<p>The gamerscore leaderboard, located under the "Achievements" tab on my profile, does not reflect my total earned gamerscore from the past 30 days as it should. I first noticed the problem one week ago, when it failed to reach the gamerscore of 1000 that
 I had acquired over the previous week. Instead, my total gamerscore did not even reach 800. As of this writing, it has dropped below 600 without ever reaching the minimum of 1000 that I know it should be for at least another two weeks.</p>
<p>This problem is not reflected in my overall gamerscore, which continues to track and calculate my achievements correctly. It is only my total on the gamerscore leaderboard that is inaccurate. Unfortunately, I do not know how to compare and contrast my overall
 achievements with those the gamerscore leaderboard has and has not tracked, so I have no way of knowing which achievements my overall gamerscore reflects and which achievements the gamerscore leaderboard has overlooked.
</p>
<p>Neither refreshing my dashboard with RT+LT+Y nor deleting and reloading my account on the console have made any difference in this matter.
</p>
<p>I was excited about the gamerscore leaderboard when I first saw it. In theory, it represented a reliable scorekeeper in the ongoing and friendly-but-competitive metagame that achievements have created. But that reliability has failed me here. It is especially
 disappointing for the failure to occur at a time when I have earned over 1000 gamerscore in the past 30 days.
</p>
<p>Please help. Thank&nbsp; you for your time. </p>

<p>I too have the same issue - having scored close to 1000 Gamerscore points over the past couple of weeks (mostly in the excellent Quantum Break), the Gamerscore Leaderboard reports my score for the last 30 days as something like +65 points last time I looked!</p>
<p>Seems to be a serious error in the GamerScore leaderboard - as some days my score is reported correctly, until I unlock a new achievement, then it goes haywire again!</p>
<p>Can the Xbox team offer any guidance / advice? Is this something the user can fix from their end, or a backend error that needs fixing with the Xbox Live Service?</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>I have this same issue. In the month of April, I got 1,000 GS on both Quantum Break and Dead Space, 1250 on Alan Wake, a couple hundred here and there on some other games and finally another 635 on Dark Souls 3, putting me well over 4000 within a 30 day
 period and yet &nbsp;I'm only seeing a total of 970 on the updated leaderboard.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Actually this is wrong, it's a specific month leaderboard, like now it's May, so all achievements for May are counted. Not just last 30 days. You have 30 days to get your score up. Speaking of which, still broken :)</p>

<p>I can say most of the Lag issues with BF4 are gone. &nbsp;I would recommend making sure the lag you are now seeing isn't network related. &nbsp;Be sure you select a server instead of "Quick match", choose the geographic region closest to you. &nbsp;BF4 does not use MS
 Azure servers. &nbsp;As far as Frames, there are a few dips when buildings come down and such but other than that its pretty good.</p>
<p>Also take a look at what Xbox One says under Settings&gt;Network. &nbsp;Check the detailed settings and look at your upload and download. &nbsp;Are you wireless? &nbsp;Check your signal strength and if possible consider wired- its much better. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Just some tips to help. &nbsp;Enjoy BF4- I love it!</p>

    <title>Windows 8 remote desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenny_983  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 remote desktop</h2>
                    <p>I have deployed over 15 computers with windows 7 professional. The main use is for remote desktop. Each computer has their individual sign on. Every computer remotes to windows server 2008 R2. Everything works fine. I just bought 5 windows 8 computers and
 deployed them. Again, the main use for these computers are to remote to windows server 2008 R2. I sign into RDP on each windows 8 computer with different log on credentials for each computer. If only one user is working on RDP at a time it runs perfectly fine.
 If two computers start using RDP at the same time, one the computers will start to lag real bad. Then after 30 seconds or so it will work and the other computer will start to lag. What could be causing this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My other question is when two users sign into RDP on windows 8 with the same user name on two different computers (same username- desktop 1, same username-desktop 2), the RDP session mirrors each other. Whatever desktop 1 is doing, desktop 2 tries to mimic
 it and vice versa. What could be causing this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have assigned static IPs to each computer. I am lost, any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you</p>

    <title>USB Boot device, boots to black screen. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ihaddy  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Boot device, boots to black screen.</h2>
                    So i am <strong>COMPLETELY</strong>&nbsp;at a loss of what to do now since it appears i can't even wipe my own computer.<br />
<br />
so this is the third thread for help i have made here, and so far all of the answers have been appreciated and helpful in someway.<br />
<br />
My last thread asked if there was anyway to turn a jump drive into a boot disc that i could use to repair or reinstall my computer with
<strong>Since my CD drive is broken and no longer reads CD, and i CANNOT boot into my Hard drive OS at all using Safe mode, the regular Booting, Windows Recovery Enviroment, and Last known good configuration.<br />
<span><br />
<span><br />
<br />
So given as all the aforementioned means of booting did not work, and even hung my computer
</span>OR</strong>&nbsp;brought me to the black screen of death with a moveable cursor. I decided to try the Jump drive method. Which a very generous Poster in my previous post, provided the information i need to make a Bootable OS flash drive.<br />
<br />
<div>However the problem appears now, That <strong>even though i DID in fact</strong>&nbsp;use the Original Windows vista home premium boot CD, that came with my computer (Dell XPS m1530) and was
<strong>NEVER </strong>before opened, to copy onto my 8GB Flash drive that was properly formatted. It boots to a black screen with cursor.<br />
<br />
When i hit F12 and select the USB jumpdrive to boot from, it boots into the Jumpdrive, and begins to show a progress bar that says "Loading windows files" as this progress bar completes, and all windows files are loaded, it shows the windows splash screen,
 my built in webcam flashes blue, and then it Boots into the Black screen with cursor in record speed.<br />
<br />
i am COMPLETELY&nbsp;flabbergasted&nbsp;as to how this could even&nbsp;CONCEIVABLY happen, since i am booting from a completely clean never before opened copy of vista that came with my machine, and somehow it takes me to the black screen with cursor? And even still
<strong>NONE of the key commands (sticky keys, Control alt delete etc) work!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I even DISABLED all other boot devices besides the USB boot devices in the Bios SETUP</strong>&nbsp;and this still happens...<br />
<br />
I have no idea at all what to do anymore = /. any help at ALL would be appreciated since i feel like although i am completely stumped right now, that i am very close to the heart of the problem.</div>

The best thing to do is to fix the DVD Drive, and then follow Dell's instructions to do a Recovery to Factory Settings.<br />

    <title>Battery drain while plugged in. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Battery drain while plugged in.</h2>
                    <p>(I have the i7 model)</p>
<p>When gaming the battery slowly goes down even though the tablet is plugged into the wall. It is hard to find information on this but I think it has something to do with the charger not having enough watts. I have heard that the Surface Dock has more watts,
 eliminating this problem, is that true?</p>

<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting on Microsoft Community.<br />

The Surface Dock does have more watts because it also serves as a power supply for all other peripherals connected to it.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Update kills Apps, Store and others</h2>
                    <p>I just finished the latest Windows 10 Update.&nbsp; Several apps such as Candy Crush, My Radar, Microsoft Solitaire Suite, etc. no longer work.&nbsp; MS Carioca Rummy will not run.&nbsp; When I attempt to use the application file located in PROGRM FILES I get a message
 that it is already running although it is not.&nbsp; I cannot even access the STORE.&nbsp; Despite the fact that all my files were safe and not being changed, all the PDF files were no longer associated with Adobe but instead with Internet Explorer.&nbsp; I have been able
 to restore the association.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I cannot restore because the update disabled this option and after turning it back on there is nothing to restore to.&nbsp; I cannot even tell you which update because I cannot access SETTINGS from the start menu.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To check version Windows 10 version follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R, to open Run Command.</p>
<p>2. In the run box, type winver and hit Ok. You'll see if you're Windows 10 is out of date or not.</p>

<p>I am new to the xbox system I just recently switched over from a ps3. I didn't know when signing up to make an account on my xbox that I needed a microsoft account, therefore I used my gmail account and found out that I must have a microsoft account in order
 to log in..</p>
<p>I tried transferring the account through the xbox by going through the Account Settings and changing my microsoft account but every time it sends an error saying: "Sorry we can't transfer the account at this time" or something like that..</p>
<p>How do I transfer my gmail account to a microsoft account?</p>

<p>Sorry for the double post, but since I figured that I needed a new account, I decided to create an email using the microsoft email. I created one, and tried again through my xbox to change it but it says it already has an xbox membership... But I had just
 made it..</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>you don't need an microsoft email account to be able to have an Microsoft Account. You can use a gmail email account for a Microsoft Account. (The email address is only the ID for the account).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When you use the gmail account to create a Xbox Live account, you will first need to create a Microsoft Account for that gmail account.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>To understand the current situation correctly, can you please explain the following.</p>
<p>1. Do you already have a xbox live account connected to that gmail account?</p>
<p>2. How and where did you create that Microsoft Account, and what have you done with it so far?</p>
<p>3. Also give as much information as possible for what exactly you want to achieve?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Let us know the results :-)</p>
        </p>

<p>1. I created the account through my XBOX and it asked for a Microsoft account. I typed in my gmail account and registered through my XBOX with it. I tried logging into my account with the Microsoft login, on this website, but it says it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>2. I created it through my xbox, I registered for XBOX LIVE through my xbox, not on this website. I have played some GTA ONLINE but that is all that I have currently done with it, because I don't know how to log into it via this website.</p>
<p>3. Well, I want to be able to log into my account in case I need to cancel any services in the future.</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick reply!</p>

            <p>You should be able to use the exact details to login to this site that you used to create the account on the Xbox console.</p>
<p>So if you used your gmail account and when it asked for a Microsoft Account and it created the profile and you are able to download demo's etc, then a Microsoft Account was created with that gmail account as ID. </p>
<p>So you should be able to login with that gmail account on xbox.com</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So in short, use the exact details (email + password) that you used on the xbox console, to be able to login at xbox.com (and all other ms account sites)</p>
