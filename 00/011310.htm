    <title>Move to not working on Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Move to not working on Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I have been using outlook.com/hotmail.com for a long time now. For the past few weeks when I try and click on the move to icon on the menu bar to move an email to a folder it doesn't work. I click on it and it doesn't seem to do anything. It works for about
 2 'moves' after I restart Chrome (which is up-to-date) but then will stop working again. Its really frustrating. Does anyone else have the same problem or have a solution at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>Is its possible for you to use a different browser and use the <strong>move to</strong> option on it. This is to isolate the issue if it's a browser or Outlook.com related.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 mobile latest build on Lumia 1020</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have installed the latest build on my 1020 and it's working very hard. It&nbsp;is a&nbsp;beta OS, but why have you optimized it only for the quad core devices?? I have seen it on 930 and 1520 working like charm but on 1020, 925 it's a hell on earth :(. Apps lag,
 entire experience is very far from even acceptable.</p>
<p>I have even done a hard reset, fresh start and the experience is the same.</p>

<h2>            signature image keeps disappearing</h2>
                    <p>I have uploaded the image (logo) I want in my homail/outlook email signature to one drive as it is described. Then added the original image link to the email signature. When I set it up and go to compose a new e-mail it appears. But after a short time or
 after logging out the image always disappears and this icon appears instead <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62f7ea51-ea41-4fb4-b711-bfe30d05e664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Green screen and then blue screen on Surface Pro 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ferkner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Green screen and then blue screen on Surface Pro 1</h2>
                    <p>I went to install the latest Insider Preview build, and was greeted by the green error screen after a while. The stop code had to do with MEMORY_MANAGEMENT. I turned the tablet off because it never rebooted itself like it said it would, and the Surface Pro
 started its diagnostic routine, then its repair routine. Then I was greeted with the blue error screen, again telling me the stop code had to do with&nbsp;MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot tell you the version number of the build, but it was a more recent one. I tried disabling Secure Boot Control so that it would boot from a USB drive, but it doesn't even get to the Boot Configuration screen on reboot. It just starts diagnosing the
 PC, then tries to repair it, then crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now my tablet is in a perpetual cycle of crashing, then trying to fix itself, and then crashing. And there seems to be no way for me to fix it thus far.</p>

<p>Spoke to the support team, first by chat, then then by phone. Eventually was sent an email with instructions on downloading a Windows image for my Surface Pro and how to use a USB for recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the email I saw that it said to hold the volume down button and then turn on the Surface. Elsewhere I read that it was volume up. That didn't work, but volume down eventually did. So instead of using the Windows 8 Pro image they wanted me to download,
 I used the USB installer I created with the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and got my Surface Pro up and running again.</p>

<h2>            Running browser without add-ons</h2>
                    <p>Help me understand how this works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When I try to post a message on a particular forum, I get my email address automatically added to the Recipient box&nbsp;(which&nbsp;is yellow).&nbsp; If I run my browser selecting
<em>without add-ons</em> and do the same, my email is not added (and no yellow).&nbsp; An add-on must be adding my email (and coloring the box yellow) right?&nbsp; I thought I would be able to troubleshoot this by Disabling one add-on at a time and figure out which one
 it is.&nbsp; This did not give me any answers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I then ran my browser without add-ons again.&nbsp; When I looked at my add-ons page (<strong>Alt+t, a</strong>) I could see that my list was set the same as when I run my browser normally.&nbsp; I then tried to post a message and my email address was not added (and
 box was not yellow).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is my issue an add-on, a combination of add-ons or something else?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Are add-ons what are disabled when running my browser without add-ons?&nbsp; </p>
<p>Can you suggest where I would&nbsp; go from here?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When you're running in no add-ons mode, add-ons in Manage add-ons will not be unchecked, but they are disabled.</p>
<p>Try this analogy... If there's no electricity going to your house, it doesn't matter whether light switches are on or off. The switch may be on, but the light won't be.</p>
<p>In Manage add-ons (Show: All add-ons) uncheck all non-microsoft add-ons, then re-enable one at a time until the autofill/autocomplete action reoccurs.</p>
<p>Is the Google toolbar installed? This sounds like it may be AutoFill that's doing this.</p>

<h2>            Attachments in access</h2>
                    <p>How do I attach images quickly to individual cells in ms access? I currently have a 1000 photos or so that I need to attach to a database and i'm unsure if I can/do it faster than selecting the images individually and adding them to the attachment field.
 Bellow is currently what I have set up and as I said I have a 1000 or so different photo ID's to do. Any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            First, you need to stop thinking cells. Access does not have cells. Access has fields which are part of records. You cannot attach anything to fields in a record. You CAN attach files to a record. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Access has a data type called the Attachment datatype. toy can add a field as an Attachment datatype to a record and use that to attach files to records.
<br />
<br />
<br />The alternative and the way I recommend, is to use a child file to store the location of the file you want to attach in a text field and reference it that way.

<p>I've managed to attach the image files fine using the attachment data field, I'm just wondering if there is a way to attach the image files faster than selecting each one through the Manage Attachments tab. For example can I use macro's to automatically
 import the image files into the database. </p>

            Ultimately you still have to provide a list of files that you want to attach. You then have to loop through that list of files to attach them. How are you going to create the list of files?
<br />
<br />I'm not sure of the code to add values to an Attachment datatype. I suspect you would have to create a csv listing then apply it. 
<br />
<br />Using my recommended way would be easier. Just add a new record to the child table with the location of each file and the parentID.
<br />
<br />But, again, how are you going to create the list? If you have to manually add each file to the list, then you are no better off.

<p>As a side note, that quantity of attachments is going to significantly increase the database size, which may cause it to exceed the file size limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recommended approach of not using attachments, but rather simply storing the path and filename as plain text would be highly advisable in this scenario.&nbsp; As such, I'd recommend you review</p>

<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>It depends how the image files are named and stored.&nbsp; Also you'd need to use VBA, not a macro.&nbsp;
<em>If</em> the files are in a single folder for instance, and <em>if</em> you wish to assign one file only to each row in a table, and
<em>if</em> the rows in table can be sorted in the same order as the files in the folder, then you can iterate over the files in the folder with the Dir function, and through a recordset of the table's rows sorted accordingly, assigning the path to each file
 to a <em>column of text data type</em> in each row, as recommended by Daniel, not an attachment column.<br />
<br />
For more information on the Dir function see:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/dir-function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/reference/user-interface-help/dir-function</a><br />
<br />
For examples of the storage of image data by storing the path as text, and loading the image into an image control at runtime, you might like to take a look at Images.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
If you only want to store one image per row in a table, the basic Images_Simple.accdb file in the zip archive should suffice.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS:&nbsp; I notice that you have a Photo ID column in the table.&nbsp; Does this correspond to the file name?&nbsp; If so you can set the column name, preceded by the path to its folder, as the ControlSource property of an Image control in a form or report.</p>

            There's something fishy going on here :-) The <span style="font-weight: bold">
Do Not Check...</span> setting is not a <span style="font-style: italic">global</span> setting in any version of the program. Not only is it document-specific, it's specific to the individual text strings (passages) to which it's applied. I can't conceive of
 any reason why the check would be there if the text itself isn't carrying that attribute. Just to be on the safe side perform some basic maintenance checks first:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Confirm that Office (14.1.4) &amp; OS X are fully updated</li><li>Repair disk permissions using Disk Utility or comparable</li><li>Restart the Mac</li></ol>
<br />
Then hold the Shift key while you launch Word. Open one of the documents known to have the check in place &amp; see if it still appears. If not, it suggests that your installation may have picked up improper information from preexisting Preferences or Normal templates.
 We'll go from there.<br />
<br />
If the check remains I'm not sure what to suggest, but there are other responders here who are more likely to have some ideas. See what you come up with before we call in the 'heavy artillery' :-) When you reply be sure to supply as much additional detail as
 possible re the origin &amp; history of the documents.<br />

            On the Spelling and Grammar dialog that you accessed from Word &gt; Preferences there is a control label Recheck Document and it will reset the check spelling switch for that document.
<div><br />
<div>BTW this will only reset the switch on the open document. &nbsp;As Bob has said, why all your documents are impacted is strange.&nbsp;</div>

<br />
Do Not Check...</span> property. It simply clears anything that has been flagged using
<br />
Also, any Default settings [of any kind] in Word shouldn't have any influence on existing documents. If that were the case docs would get banged around like the steel balls in a pinball machine every time they were opened by a different user :-)<br />
<br />
I admire &amp; appreciate you scratching your head &amp; grasping at straws over this one, though - it's about as perplexing as anything I've ever come across.<br />

            We're seeing the same problem at one of our customers. &nbsp;She is running Office 14.2.3. &nbsp;The problem happens on some Word documents created on an old PC but we're not sure which version of Word created them and haven't been able to nail down a pattern, though
 we did find that at least one of the document was created by a custom template on her old PC, i.e. not by normal.dot. &nbsp;Perhaps something in that particular template is causing the issue.
<div><br />
<div>At this point we're either going to:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) Ask the user to always verify the status of the "Do not check spelling or grammar" checkbox every time she opens a .doc file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>OR</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) Try to come up with a script that can make that change recursively on a folder full of documents. &nbsp;Perhaps the "spelling dictionary type" Property in Word's AppleScript dictionary will let us script it?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Has anyone else found a solution to this?</div>

            I've been working on a very long document for a few years, revising and editing. Suddenly yesterday Word claims it's already spellchecked the entire document. Even after checking thru preferences, etc., renaming the document spellcheck still doesn't work.
 Feels like I'm using an overpriced typewriter.

<p>Hi Rafath Ullah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the questions, following are the answers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You can create a site workflow for a modern site in SharePoint Designer 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Using SharePoint Designer 2013, the Flow is different than SharePoint Workflow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about workflows in SharePoint, you can check the following articles:</p>

<p>This is a very confused answer. Why mention SP Designer if you can't open modern sites in it? Rafath can see the site workflows option but is unable to create a new workflow. Can someone knowledgeable explain this? Or is it just another deficiency in the
 modern ui?</p>

            <p>Catch 22 here: If Windows 7 Starter can be updated to Windows 10, as I have found has been stated by Microsoft, and Windows 7 Starter is used only on netbooks, and if netbooks have an older graphics driver (Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 3600 Series) that
 can't be used by Windows 10, how can Windows 7 Starter be upgradable to Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made sure I had enough space on the hard drive. I cleaned up everything that could be cleaned up, in preparation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All told, between last night and this morning/afternoon, I spent about six hours trying to get this upgrade to work, and after many flutters and restarts and the third attempt at upgrading, Windows 10's upgrade software finally indicated this specific driver
 was incompatible with the upgrade. Well...I then went in search of a more recent version. It doesn't exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel does not have a version of this driver that is any newer than 2013. According to what I read, it doesn't seem to work for running Windows 8 or 8.1 either. I realize Microsoft is not in control of vendor hardware, but it seems like a false statement
 on Microsoft's part if, in fact, the drivers can't be used and can't be updated either.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have suffered the same fate as Gail.&nbsp; Windows 10 will install a generic driver that can display only 800x600 32bit color.&nbsp; There is no Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 3600 Series driver for Windows 8.1 or Windows 10.&nbsp; If you install the Windows 7 driver,
 Windows 10 crashes right after login and there is no way to fix the error even from safe mode.&nbsp; Result for me on my Asus Eee PC 1025C was an unusable machine.&nbsp; I was forced to wipe it all and re-install Windows 7 Starter from scratch and download the support
 drivers directly from ASUS just to make the thing work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping a suitable driver will be created within the 1 year time period that Microsoft is offering the free Windows 10 upgrades.&nbsp; It runs old hardware much better than older OS.&nbsp; Do not attempt to upgrade until you have a new and proper Windows 10 driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if ASUS or Intel is responsible or interested in creating the driver.&nbsp; The machine is low powered and perhaps Windows 7 Starter is the most it can even handle.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one at the Microsoft Help Desk was able to resolve my issue, so don't bother
 waiting on the phone -- they can't help.</p>

<p>This is really disgusting. There are Millions of devices using the GMA, even machines sold with Windows 8/8.1</p>
<p>You can run devices with Windows 10 by deleting the GMA drivers BEFORE you upgrade, but they then run with
<strong><span style="color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)">Microsoft Basic Display Adapter</span></strong> which is a loss of visual quality.
</p>
<p>It's my hope that at least Microsoft can help us, maybe by improving this adapter.</p>

<h2>            Creating a Simple Address Book from New Data</h2>
                    <span>When my family address book literally fell apart (the rubber band holding it together finally gave up) I volunteered to put together a complete electronic address book with mailing addresses, first and last names, and landline and mobile
                    <span>When my family address book literally fell apart (the rubber band holding it together finally gave up) I volunteered to put together a complete electronic address book with mailing addresses, first and last names, and landline and mobile
 phone numbers. &nbsp;I don't contemplate including any commercial or emergency numbers; these will only be friends and relatives, and my wife has agreed to vet the final version for accuracy, inclusiveness and elimination of some entries.</span>

<div>Only a very small number of these folks are in my MS Outlook contacts and my iPad address book and I'm not sure it would be productive to figure out how to copy just selected persons into my new address book.</div>

<div>I intend, unless someone here has a convincing better idea, to construct and populate the project using a simple MS Access database (with the default data entry form) because that will give me a pretty straightforward export to either or both
 MS Word and Excel.</div>

<div>What I hope to receive here are suggestions for the final address book software form (it could be but would not necessarily be a MS product) that I might be able to relatively easily copy to my PC desktop, my wife's PC laptop, my iPad and my mobile
 phone. &nbsp;By the way, I'm a film instructor and I've been able to build a flat file Access database, export it to Excel and Word for various purposes. &nbsp;For Word, the Report format has exported well and has created useful film collection databases both for my
 PC, iPad and mobile phone.</div>

            As much as I like Access, I'd be inclined to skip it and go directly to an Outlook Contacts list. Outlook will let you use more than one .pst file (its data storage medium); try File... New... Outlook Data File or the equivalent operation in your version.
 Outlook has a lot of the user interface for managing this kind of contact information built in, which would have to be constructed from scratch in Access. Once you have this dedicated family address book .pst file, you can just give all your relatives a copy;
 if they're already using Outlook for email or other purposes they can just use File... Data File Management to add this book, or they can just install Outlook (or another program which can read .pst files) just for these addresses.

            I tend to agree with John that rather than reinventing the wheel, making use of Outlook's existing functionality makes a lot of sense, but if you do want to use Access, read on.<br />
<br />
The format for use on other devices really depends what functionality you want in the address books on those devices.&nbsp; If you want a simple list in alphabetical order which people can scroll through then I'd suggest you create a report in the Access database
 and export this as a PDF file.&nbsp; This can be opened on pretty much anything.<br />
<br />
For the Access database structure you'd need a model comprising tables along the following lines.&nbsp; I've used UK geographical units below, but you'll be able easily to translate these to whatever is appropriate in your case.<br />
<br />
Contacts<br />
....ContactID&nbsp; (PK)<br />
....FirstName<br />
....LastName<br />
....AddressLine1<br />
....AddressLine2<br />
....CityID<br />
....PostCode<br />
<br />
PhoneTypes<br />
....PhoneTypeID (PK)<br />
....PhoneType<br />
<br />
To model the many-to-many relationship type between Contacts and PhoneTypes:<br />
<br />
ContactPhones<br />
....ContactID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
....PhoneTypeID (FK)<br />
....PhoneNumber<br />
<br />
The above table is 'all key', i.e. its primary key is a composite one of all three columns.<br />
<br />
Cities<br />
....CityID&nbsp; (PK)<br />
....City<br />
....CountyID&nbsp; (FK)<br />
<br />
Counties<br />
....CountyID&nbsp; (PK)<br />
....County<br />
<br />
For data input you'd use a Contacts form, in single form view, in which would be a phones subform in continuous forms view, the subform being based on the ContactPhones table and linked to the parent form on ContactID.<br />
<br />
A report would be based on a query which joins all the tables and is grouped by contact.&nbsp; All contact name and address data would be in a group header, with the phone numbers in the detail section.<br />
<br />
I've assumed a simple scenario where each contact has one address only.&nbsp; If it is necessary to record multiple addresses per contact then a separate related Addresses table would be needed, with a foreign key ContactID column to reference the key of Contacts.&nbsp;
 Addresses would then be entered via a subform in the Contacts form.<br />

            <p>First, the question is do you want to share the data and, if so, how? Since Outlook is now available for the iPad, it would probably be best to use Outlook and sync your address book to the cloud.</p>
<p>

<div>I'd only share this data in whole with my wife, and I'd like to plant it in electronic form on my desktop PC, my wife's laptop PC, and my iPad and mobile phone, and, finally, print some sort of hard copy for easy reference when when I'd rather reach for
 an address book in paper form than for an electronic device.</div>
<div>I thought of Access because it's possible to make simple flat file databases as well as complex relational databases. &nbsp;The latter would be overkill for my purposes; it's not necessary to link, say, Aunt Mary to Tacoma to a mobile phone, and it's not likel
 that I'd need to sort by anything other than last name, unless I can't remember a certain last name and need to look among all the Johns to find the correct one.</div>
<div>Access also gives me an easy export to several file extensions and several printing options.</div>
<div>I am interested in using the file structure and data input set up in Outlook if and only if the resultant completed database can be reasonably easily inserted into the devices noted above, and, of course, updated occasionally, and also be printed in a
 fairly economic hard copy.</div>
<p>
</p><p>PS: i think&nbsp; I'd be satisfied if only my PC and iPad would have name-sortable data.</p>

<p><span>I'd only create an address book for wife and me. &nbsp;As&nbsp; previously noted, I'd want an address book on my PC, another copy on my wife's laptop PC, one on my iPad and a hard copy.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Would&nbsp; I open an Outlook email account, using my iPad, then save the .pst file on that web mail account or use some appropriate Outlook "app" to set up Outlook on my iPad and copy the .pst file using the&nbsp;I Tunes Store?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Could I either email or use, say, Dropbox, to deliver the .pst file to my wife? &nbsp;She uses Office 2010 on her laptop but not Outlook, prefering Gmail. &nbsp;Could she set up an Outlook Gmail account for this purpose or should she attempt
 to download the Outlook component of Office 2010 if it's still available?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Could I print the new .pst file to produce my hard copy address book?</span></p>

            <p>Your wife uses Office 2010 but you don't say what version not all 2010 versions include MS Outlook, eg Office Home &amp; Student</p>
<p>MS Outlook is a program to which you add a mail account, eg a Gmail mail account as a pop or IMAP mail account, depending on the Gmail preferences you set on the Gmail web access options pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming your wife uses Gmail via her web browser. She could configure it with windows live mail, if she doesn't have MS Outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further confuse the issue MS renamed Hotmail (Their Gmail like mail program) to outlook.com. This also can be accessed by the web browser or added to your mail program</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use Apple (being a none believer) so I cannot comment on methods of syncing an MS Outlook address book (Contacts) with an Ipad
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife uses an android tablet and uses windows mail (win 8.1) configured with her outlook.com mail account, the outlook.com mail account is also set up on the android and all mail/Contacts happily sync</p>
<p>They also sync with her win8 mobile</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find MS Outlook has more options for Contacts/Address Book than outlook.com</p>

<p>hi simon,</p>
<p>we’d like to confirm whether you refer to the modern group from this article: <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2014/09/25/delivering-first-chapter-groups-office-365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://blogs.office.com/2014/09/25/delivering-first-chapter-groups-office-365/</a>. i have done some tests about the modern group successfully. after the message “we’re setting up your group files”, a new message like “ready to go” will be displayed.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=21ada3d9-8cab-4abd-9416-eb617cfeae30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d21ada3d9-8cab-4abd-9416-eb617cfeae30" /></a></p>

to identify the situation of the issue, we’d like to collect the following information:<br />
1. we recommend you wait for <strong>24 hours</strong> to check this group in your onedrive for business library since provisioning office 365 services may take from a few minutes to
<strong>24 hours</strong> generally.</p>
<p>2. does the issue happen when you click the newly created group in your onedrive for business library?</p>
<p>3. have you created the modern group in outlook web app successfully? after that, check whether you can access the group in your outlook web app.</p>
<p>4. try to use different browsers, such as ie or chrome browser.</p>
<p>5. check if other users in your organization encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>after referring to the information above and wait for <strong>24</strong> hours, if the issue persists, we’d like to collect the following information to investigate the issue:<br />
1.your office 365 login account.<br />
2.your tenant account like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
3.your global admin login account and your contactable email address.<br />
4.the affected users’ login accounts.</p>
<p>to protect your privacy, i have sent you a <strong>private message</strong>. please respond to the pm via the steps below:<br />

<p>(2) - Ah ha! Going to files from the OneDrive web app got it working, so now the files are setup and ready and I can use it. So how is going there from OneDrive on the web different to Outlook on the web?</p>
<p>I had previously deleted a group and re-added it. Could that have caused it to go wrong?</p>
<p>It was broken for different users yes, as I got a colleague to create a group to the same effect.</p>
<p>Yes modern groups.</p>
<p>Different browsers made no difference.</p>

<h2>            Kiosk Mode - Links not working</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set up a presentation in kiosk mode, as I have a large number of hidden slides which are hyperlinked to show background data, these are then linked back to the previous position in the presentation, so I need to disable keyboard function to
 prevent people becoming lost. The presentation does also have several interactive ActiveX textboxes for user input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have put the presentation into kiosk mode and added a large action shape, linking to the next slide, with no fill and no outline so that it doesn't interfere with the slide. However, when I enter full screen these action shapes are not working and I am
 unable to progress through the presentation. I have made sure that the shapes have been brought to the front on all slides, but the only seem to work when they have a shape fill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to make these shapes link correctly without having a fill?</p>

            <p>To expand on what John's suggested:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a shape has NO fill, PowerPoint doesn't see it as clickable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it has a fill, even if the fill is totally transparent, PPT sees it as clickable, even though the human doesn't see any fill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So: &nbsp;Give the shape a solid fill rather than no fill, but set it to 100% transparent.</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com fails to filter junk mail AND delivers TOO much junk mail</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use web based outlook.com and ever since moving to it from desktop version, I have experienced three problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Obvious spam being delivered to in-box and bypassing the junk folder</p>
<p>2) Receiving huge volume of spam to my junk folder</p>
<p>3) Mail I have declared as SAFE still going to my junk folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched this site but haven't found a solution yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also run yahoo and gmail, and experience nothing like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For eg today I logged in and had 123 junk emails. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE!!! I log in daily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While in gmail, after not logging in for a week, I have only 3, THREE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you see a problem here???????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can your filtering NOT block these before they reach individual's in-boxes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously annoyed now, if I can't find a solution I'll be moving from Outlook to the dreaded gmail for all accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I find it weird (or telling) that in sub-topic options below, there is no option for junk or even other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Wendy, </p>

<p>Hi Andree</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really not a solution to my problem at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only trusting new messages from members of my Safe Senders list means any new email I receive will go to junk folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How on earth does Microsoft expect users to operate that way?&nbsp; I am not a psychic and have no way of knowing email addresses of new correspondents before I receive them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In business terms, this is a catastrophic fault within outlook.com that microsoft continues to fail to address.....the bottom line is if gmail and yahoo can do it properly, why can't outlook?&nbsp; There is no way I will go to the paid version when you fail so
 spectacularly at this basic function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Wendy</p>

<p>Firstly, why should I open a new form of contact when I am already dealing with MS? Why can't you tag them in this issue - which actually would be customer service as opposed to passing the proverbial buck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, clearly this issue isn't likely to be dealt with by Microsoft given this thread dates back from 2013 and a simple search online produces many MANY people who have experienced the same issue without resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thirdly, the link you provided simply takes me back to outlook email.</p>

<h3> bradwenner  say:</h3>
<h2>            missing playlists</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just recently sync'd my zune and after doing so, 2 of the playlists I painstakingly created within the Zune software have dissappeared. I can see the playlist files in the directory, but it now says the file size is 0 kb.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I recover my playlists? This is the second time this has happened, can anyone tell me why this is occuring? Is it because the files are all located on a shared network drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the playlists were not over 2000 songs. In fact, one only had 60 songs, the other had quite a bit more, but I don't remember exactly how many.</p>
<p>Also, all playlists that were created in other applications have been unaffected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

You should be able to recover the playlist files from a backup, if you are doing those...
<div>But to prevent it? &nbsp;Nothing I can think of... &nbsp;this is very strange. &nbsp;I don't know how MS coded this, but I have looked at zpl files on the PC. &nbsp;The zune software has to convert them to something useful on the zune device (a list of songs and where to
 find them on your PC hard drive is not useful on the device!) &nbsp;I can't even begin to guess what would delete the content of that file and leave only the name behind!</div>

                    <p>Dear colleagues, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I purchased enterprise E1 license for my business (let's call it account 1), but I also have an active E5 license from elsewhere (account 2) on my computer. When I decided to add my account 1 mailbox and calendar to the Outlook downloaded as part
 of the account 2 package, the system allowed me to use it only as IMAP or POP3 account, but not an Active Sync one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody explain why? Is it possible to use both a accounts with ActiveSync features?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>

<p>Your issue stems from the fact that you are trying to set it up manually; That is not supported for Exchange accounts (which is something completely different that an Exchange ActiveSync account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Auto Account Setup to add your account instead and it will automatically configure your account as an Exchange account via the Exchange AutoDiscover service.</p>

<h2>            Exporting Calendar from outlook.com as ICS file to import to google calendar</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to export my outlook.live.com (hotmail.com) calendar to import this to google calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried from outlook.live.com going to calendar, selecting calendar, clicking the share button, entering an email address and selecting 'can view', clicking share. I receive the email, but the file received is an .xml which cannot be imported into my
 google calendar! There are no options to export this in a different format. I have googled and tried everything I could find without success and now I'm about 4 hours down and quite frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help.</p>

<p>Exactly same problem.</p>
<p>It seems that the option was available until 1-2 years ago, but Microsoft decided to remove it.</p>
<p>This is completely retarded and frustrating!<br />
<br />
It should be very simple (and important!) to include this option in Outlook!</p>
<p>It really seems that Microsoft is kind of trying to lock people to Outlook, but these kind of things are just making things so worse!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this thing, thanks!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

            Hi josay1 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.

<p>Hi Vijay</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me - I appreciate it!&nbsp; But is setting up caller ID an essential part of the calling process? Just to clarify - I am wanting to call from skype computer account (not a skype number) to a landline and a mobile here in new zealand.&nbsp;
 I'm finding even doing caller ID bit too challenging!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jo</p>

            Many telecom service providers block the calls if caller ID is not set up. This is fairly easy. Just attempt it.

<h2>            Opening Excel documents not displaying properly after creating a macro</h2>
                    <p><span><span>At the request of MS support, I am reposting this question from <a href="http://community.office365.com/en-us/f/172/p/235713/733784.aspx#733784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MS Communities</a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>My Office 365 Suite is working properly (I think), except for Excel.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>With Excel, I am able to open a document but it sometimes won’t display the document on my screen (more on that later).</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>If I open the document from an elevated command prompt (Run As Administrator), it opens and displays properly.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>If I open the document from the command prompt (as a normal user), it opens but does not display properly.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>All I see is the Excel background, menu, ribbon, etc.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<span>But the document itself does not display on my screen.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<span>But the document itself does not display on my screen.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<span>By default, Excel opens in Full Screen.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>If I open a document that doesn’t display properly, all I have to do is change from Full Screen to Windowed and it will display the document (in Full Screen or Windowed).</span><span>&nbsp;
<span>By default, Excel opens in Full Screen.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>If I open a document that doesn’t display properly, all I have to do is change from Full Screen to Windowed and it will display the document (in Full Screen or Windowed).</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I can then change it back to either Full Screen or Windowed (but this is annoying) and it will continue to display the document.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>This happens whether the document is password protected or not.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>It also doesn’t matter whether I am opening a document locally or opening a document that is stored within my on-premises servers.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Also, when I open a document and it doesn’t display properly, I can expand or collapse the ribbon and that will cause it to display properly.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>If I use Windows Explorer and open the document (using Open in Protected View), the document opens and displays properly.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>If I just double-click on the document from Windows Explorer (opening it normally), it doesn’t display properly.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>If I start Excel and open a blank workbook and then I open the document (using one of the methods that previously didn’t work), the document now opens and displays properly.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I am using Windows v7 x64 SP1 (Enterprise) and Office 365.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Everything is patched and up-to-date (as of a week ago).</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I have the latest drivers installed on my system.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<span>I’m sure that it isn’t a software problem and it isn’t a driver issue.</span><span>&nbsp;
<span>I’m sure that it isn’t a software problem and it isn’t a driver issue.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>My (strange) problem started this morning and I haven’t been able to determine why it is happening.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I’ve tried different documents, and these are just plain workbook documents (no charts, graphics, etc.).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Here is one of the unusual findings regarding this problem.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I am using Office 365 (both the online service and the Office Suite software).</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>If I open an online Excel document, it opens and displays itself properly (there is no need to display/hide the ribbon or switch between full screen/windowed view).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The next unusual thing about my problem may be what caused this to occur in the first place.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Up until a few hours ago, everything worked (I was able to open Excel documents and they displayed properly, local documents, network documents, cloud documents, no problems).</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Then, I tried to record my first macro in Excel and everything when bad from there.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Yeah, I’ve recorded macros in Excel before but not with this particular Excel 365 installation.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I installed Office 365 a few months ago (after doing a clean OS install).</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Other than a few initial activation issues when I first installed Office 365, Excel has been working fine.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>The macro that I recorded is a simple macro.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>It inserts a new row and adjusts the data in one of the columns.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Nothing spectacular about that.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>And as far as I can tell, I am not having this problem with any of the other Office 365 (aka Office 2013) applications.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Because it was a macro being saved, I had to save the workbook as a XLSM file instead of a XLSX file (I deleted the XLSX file).</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I saved it to my local PC.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>Also, Excel is “pinned” to my taskbar.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Something that is different now is that the file PERSONAL shows up when I right-click Excel on the taskbar (that didn’t happen prior to today).</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I went in and renamed the PERSONAL.XLSB file but that didn’t help.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I also removed the AutomaticDestinations file (the one starting with “b8ab77100df80ab2”) for Excel (initially thinking that this was a “pinned on the taskbar” issue), that didn’t help because that wasn’t the problem.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I’ve run out of ideas and any help is appreciated.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>TO:</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>Microsoft Support –––– I did a repair of my Office 365 installation.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I had an issue with the repair (popup – Something went wrong, Error 30029-4).</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I’ve seen a few posts about this problem and most are new and follow the most recent MS update on patch Tuesday.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>Seems like a recent patch may be causing this issue.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<span>I rebooted my system and some of the other stuff, nothing helped.</span><span>&nbsp;
<span>I rebooted my system and some of the other stuff, nothing helped.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I was able to repair my Office 365 Suite by running APPWIZ.CPL (“Application Wizard” aka “Programs and Features”) from an elevated command prompt.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>I’m not sure how to open an elevated Control Panel via the GUI.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>But I was finally able to run a repair after starting APPWIZ.CPL from an elevated command prompt.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>TO:</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span>Microsoft Support –––– Please tell me why Excel 365 has a problem displaying local documents after I created the macro in Excel.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you</span></p>

</p><p>Additional explanation -- The only workbooks that display properly are workbooks that are in the cloud (Office 365). &nbsp;Any local Excel workbooks (normal or macro-enabled) won't display properly (I have to "redraw" the Excel application for them to display
 in Excel).</p>

            <p>Sorry that my original post was so long - I wanted to be sure to provide as much info as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've since found that this problem may be related to&nbsp;PERSONAL.XLSB.&nbsp; If it is hidden, Excel does not display properly.&nbsp; However, if I unhide the PERSONAL.XLSB document, Excel opens and displays workbooks properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not found a proper solution yet (to get Excel to behave like it did before I created the first macro).&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?</p>
