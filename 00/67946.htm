<h2>            Program crashed then refused to work and now refuses to reinstall ...</h2>
                    <p>I am not overly technically minded with computers so forgive me if I miss something you all need to help, just ask (and tell me how to get it if it is not obvious to laymen and I will).</p>

<p>Windows 7</p>
<p>service pack 1</p>
<p>Paint Shop Pro Ultimate 2018</p>
<p>Aviria</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sunday night I was working in Paint Shop Pro Ultimate 2018.&nbsp; It has been on the computer since Feb 2018, and working as it should.&nbsp; After about 3 hours of working it crashed.&nbsp; When I reopened it I received a message about script parameters.&nbsp; Not having any
 idea what it was asking or why I simply closed the message box.&nbsp; After which any time I tried to open anything a new image, the old one I was working on, a tool anything, the program would crash.&nbsp; I went to the Corel site and was told by support to delete
 the program run a registry cleaner restart the computer then reinstall.&nbsp; I did so, however half way through the reinstall the folowing message pops up</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3277fed0-ce58-4cf1-abb8-19e0d6ff54e7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3277fed0-ce58-4cf1-abb8-19e0d6ff54e7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again I went to Corel support.&nbsp; They told me to run a cleaner program they have.&nbsp; I did so.&nbsp; They tell me to turn of my antivirius and firewall.&nbsp; I did so.&nbsp; They tell me to try to reinstall from a new admin account.&nbsp; I did so.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even went so far as to delete all the related programs to PSP, and the antivirus.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the "repair" function on all the Microsoft visual c++"s on the computer (I read a blog that claimed the install problems were because of a corrupt 2012 c++ and to using the repair function on it would fix all).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corel support has, so far, no answer for what the problem is or how to fix it.&nbsp; I have asked for a download of the missing file and where to put it; they have not responded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I come here in the hope that someone here is more kind and knowledgeable and willing to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a problem with Windows (does windows suddenly no like the program)? or is it a problem with PaintShop?&nbsp; Is there a way to remedy this?&nbsp; If so, how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance to all who read and any that help.</p>

<p>Your picture didn't make it (copy/paste doesn't work on here, have to click the "add picture" button on the toolbar as you type your message).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you post it, or let us know what that message said?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And while I wait, one other option you might try is the built-in system restore. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the problem just began suddenly, you can restore Windows back to an earlier time, called a restore point. This restores backups of your registry and system settings, but doesn’t touch any of your files.
 It only takes a couple of minutes, and you can undo the process or try another date if it doesn’t fix the problem on the first try. When you aren’t sure where to go, this is by far the safest, fastest, and easiest option to try first.&nbsp; This works best if you
 use it immediately after a problem shows up.&nbsp; Waiting more than a week or two means the good backups can be too outdated to use.</p>

<strong>RSTRUI </strong>and click OK.</li><li>Choose a date when the computer was working correctly, and click Next to restore the system files from that date.</li><li>Check to see if the problem is fixed. If not, you can go back to step 1 to either undo the restore process, or try another date.</li></ol>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/cmdrkeene.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/restore.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fi2.wp.com%2fcmdrkeene.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f08%2frestore.png%3fw%3d580%26amp%3bssl%3d1" height="466" width="580" /></a></p>
<p>System Restore can undo recent changes to the system, without affecting your personal files.

<p>
</p><p>Also, I did use system restore before I contacted Corel support thinking that an update had broken things.&nbsp; It did not fix anything.&nbsp; I ran it again today before I tried the reinstall again after getting a new download of the original program.&nbsp; Still will

<p>Thanks a ton.&nbsp; I take it there is no disk involved right?&nbsp; Just a website download from Corel?&nbsp; I think you did the right think by downloading it again since it says it's a potential problem with the package.&nbsp; Perhaps this: after you download it, right-click
 the downloaded file and choose Properties, then see if there is an "unblock" button on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from that, I'm not really sure what would cause it to not find that file either.&nbsp; It should be entirely in the download.&nbsp; Another thought I had was to right-click the setup file and choose "run as admin", but you already tried it inside an admin account,
 so I feel like the result there would be the same.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct, there is no disk, just a download file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The download file opens up and leaves other (.exe) files for the program and the add ons.&nbsp; The main/original download file does have a block but the files it extracts do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the files I originally extracted after opening the main download file and am in the process of extracting the files from the main download now that I have unblocked it.&nbsp; After which, I will try the install again and let you know if it made
 any difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>**Update</p>
<p>Nope, still get the message popping up about the missing file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying.</p>

<p>So Corel support finally got around to replying to my help ticket and said this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">Based on the log file reports from your PC the problem we found out that the error (kernellbase.dll) during
 the installation is already caused by the corrupted file on your Windows OS System we suggest that you reformat/repair your OS but make sure to contact your Windows Support before doing this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>and nothing more.&nbsp; No idea what the "Kernellbase.dll" they refer to is as the error message was listing something entirely different.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)"><span>So if it is my operating system and not just them being to lazy to actually&nbsp; figure out what the issue is, why is it only that version of the program that is
 broken (I reinstalled the old version and it worked&nbsp;fine).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>This is my mother's computer, she doesn't know where the install disks are.&nbsp; Is there a way to download everything I need to fix the computer

<p>
</p><p>Word 2007 keeps launching a Configuration Process" box each time I go to open a word document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop&nbsp;is running&nbsp;Windows 10 Home and has a 64 bit operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have the original Windows CD disc to run a repair..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it may be a registry issue but I'm nervous about making any changes to it myself.</p>

    <title>randomly losing touch screen driver. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caracorr  say:</h3>
<h2>            randomly losing touch screen driver.</h2>
                    I have figured out how to correct this problem by using the "hardware and devices" troubleshooting.&nbsp; I have Windows 8.1 and when I run the troubleshooting sequence, Windows recognizes that I have a missing USB input device.&nbsp; I run the fix and it corrects
 the problem.&nbsp; My touch screen will work again.&nbsp; Then randomly, it quits.&nbsp; The computer doesn't seem to do it any specific time.&nbsp; It never does it while I'm working rather, it does it after sitting idle.&nbsp; Now this is not to say it always loses the driver when
 it sits idle, it sometimes works fine.&nbsp; So Microsoft what's up with this issue?&nbsp; Yeah, I can fix it but, I shouldn't have to keep doing this.&nbsp; My computer is an ASUS 11.6 inch laptop.<br />

To answer your question, this is a new computer and it's done it ever since I've owned it.&nbsp; A little over a month now.&nbsp; The only thing I have done is upgrade to Windows 8.1 but, I did that immediately after I bought the computer.&nbsp; It is an Asus Q200E.&nbsp; Losing
 this touchscreen driver regularly is the only issue I seem to have.&nbsp; Otherwise, I love this little laptop.<br />
I appreciate your suggestion but, let me explain that I have had this issue since the computer was brand new... so I don't see how wiping it would help? Running the troubleshooting is what I already do.&nbsp; Is there some permanent fix so I DON'T have to keep running
 the troubleshooter?&nbsp; Considering what I've told you, would running the clean boot really make a difference? and wouldn't I lose information?<br />

            Have you run the troubleshooter to fix the problem and have it come up saying that you were missing a USB input device?&nbsp; If so, then running the troubleshooter is the only way to fix it that I know of however, in my case, it's a temporary fix because it
 randomly happens again.&nbsp; I am trying to find a permanent fix and I will post it here when I find one.&nbsp; What is your brand and model of laptop?&nbsp; I am working with an ASUS Q200E.<br />

also... it is completely random when it happens.&nbsp; It can be idle and NOT go into sleep mode or it can be after it goes into sleep mode and I try to use it upon waking. More often though, it is upon waking from sleep mode. Either time it can happen.&nbsp; The only
 time that it doesn't happen is when I'm actively working.<br />

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I play MP2 on win10 with WMP12</h2>
                    On my old computer with WIndows 7 I could play mp2 videos with Windows Media Player 12.&nbsp; I try to play the exact same videos on Windows Media Player 12 on my new computer with WIndows 10 and all it plays is sound.&nbsp; The horrible default player won't play
 them either.&nbsp; Is it a codec thing?&nbsp; mp2 is not new and is very common now, how can this not play by default?&nbsp; Can someone recommend a media player that will play these.

<p>You might encounter this error message for one of the following reasons: </p>
<p>a) The file type is supported by the Player, but the file was compressed by using a codec that is not supported by the Player.<br />
b) The file might have been encoded by using a codec that is not supported by Windows Media Player. If this is the case, Windows Media Player cannot play the file.</p>

<p>THe link you provide does list .mp2 as a file type WMP plays</p>
<p>THe codec link you provide is for WIndows 7 not 10, I've seen it as a common reply on the forums but it does not work with WIN10.</p>
<p>There is no error message, it just plays the audio from the clips not the video.&nbsp; THe system comes with Mcaffe virus software</p>
<p>Again the question still&nbsp;is, why would the same files play on 7 and not 10?&nbsp; If it is codecs, where do I download codecs for WINDOWS 10?</p>

<p>Hi Janine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The availability of 3D accelerator depends on the graphics card that your system has. If the graphics card supports it, then that option is available. To verify the graphics card you have, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the Windows key and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand the<strong> Display adapters</strong> category.</li><li>Please take note of the graphics card/s you have on the list.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To ensure that your graphics card is up-to-date, I suggest updating its driver. Please check out and follow the steps provided on this link:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Update drivers in Windows 10</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update this thread on how it goes and kindly include the information regarding the graphics card found in Device Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<li>Have you made any changes on your computer before you experienced this issue?</li><li>Are you using an external or internal camera? If you are using an external camera, have you tried to use a different camera?</li></ul>

<h2>            Windows 10 proves Microsoft hates its customers</h2>
                    <p>I've been using and administering Microsoft products since DOS 3 something. And it always made sense.</p>
<p>After using Windows 10,&nbsp;I've decided that Microsoft must hate its customers, and I don't mind saying it anymore.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why, If I'm logged in as an Administrator do I keep getting access denied, and must modify security settings to see folders?<br />
Why can't I remove the bloatware from my PC?&nbsp; I don't want all these garbage apps.
<br />
I don't want a Store. Why have a store if I can't choose what I don't want?<br />
Why can't I remove Cortana?<br />
Why can't I turn off the Telemetry?&nbsp; Has Microsoft become part of the NSA, or just a competitor?<br />
Why is Xbox loaded?<br />
Was this OS made for gaming only?<br />
Why does OneDrive keep showing up after removing it, removing it from the registry, and deleting everything with OneDrive in its name?<br />
Why do the Group Policy settings seem to work at random? <br />
(Oh, they work, Maybe, but only if you buy the subscription OS. As IF Microsoft isn't rich enough already)
<br />
How are Admins supposed to know what policies work in Pro vs Enterprise when they show up in both?<br />
Even if they work today,&nbsp;I now have to ask, when will&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;break them again?<br />
<br />
Why do I have to manually set the firewall to allow group policy to get thru after joining a domain? Why is that not part of joining?<br />
<br />
I have been trying for a week to "tune" 10 to be usable, and I give up. <br />

This isn't an OS, its garbage designed to annoy people to insanity.&nbsp; <br />

<h2>            Questions for Procmon users</h2>
                    <p><span>Why is there a time gap on Process Monitor when the computer is in malware induced sleep/standby?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Is there anything I can change in the filter that will show me what is happening during sleep/standby? If I wake it, by clicking the mouse, the PID stays the same. If I let it wake itself up, the PID changes, Why?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>History:</span></p>
<p><span>After giving a terrible rating in an online survey from a customer service department of a well-known, very large, “trusted” online company in which I had dealt with on the phone earlier that day. The very instant I clicked the second “terrible” button
 on that survey, my computer screen went black. I’ve been dealing with this malware since. The malware is meant to annoy and disrupt and hasn’t done any other damage to my computer that I can tell, since it installed in mid-August.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Running a full scan of Windows Defender and a full scan of Microsoft Safety Scanner did NOT find the malware. After doing a System Restore, I still had the malware, it even activated a couple times during the restore process (thought I was screwed)
 but it restored okay to a point before mid-August. </span></p>
<p><span>The symptom of this malware is to activate the Standby or sleep mode on this computer. (screen goes black, a few seconds later I get “no signal” message on screen, then all lights turn off.) I can press the power button or click the mouse and it wakes
 up as normal, but mostly goes right back into sleep/standby mode a few seconds or a minute or so later, this happens for first half hour or so.
<span>&nbsp;</span>After that it acts up less giving me more time to do things on the computer. If I do nothing it will wake from sleep/standby by itself after a few minutes. When it wakes the fan and fan light turns on, green power light blinks 7 times just like
<span>&nbsp;</span>After that it acts up less giving me more time to do things on the computer. If I do nothing it will wake from sleep/standby by itself after a few minutes. When it wakes the fan and fan light turns on, green power light blinks 7 times just like
 initial turn on, but NO Start Beep, it comes on with the lock screen, press enter or click mouse to get to the welcome screen, enter password and I am back to the exact point of whatever I was doing before. (If I was listening to a song, it comes back on at
 the exact same point in the song)</span></p>
<p><span>I spent the last month or so giving myself a crash course in Process Explorer, Process Monitor and Autoruns. I have learned a little about how to run those tools, but I really don’t know what to look for. Process Monitor is suspended when the malware
 is activated and in sleep/standby mode, which leaves a gap in the time line. I believe this is where there may be clues to its source, before or after this time gap, but especially if I could see the processes during sleep/standby mode.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>I can activate the malware by pressing the functions keys “F7” and ‘F8”, the “Home” key, the “4” on the numeric keyboard and the “0” (zero) and one letter in the alphanumeric keys, and when I press the Win key + PrtScr to get a screenshot
 (captures the ss okay). There are times when these keys do not activate the malware, I have determined that a process called “mobsync.exe” is always present in the Process Monitor Filter selection box - Process Name dropdown menu when the malware is active.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Mobsync.exe</strong> is a normal process that belongs to Microsoft Sync Center and the Offline Files feature. I suspect the malware has hidden itself inside this process. When the computer is working normally,

<p><span>I did NOT open an attachment to get it, unless clicking a button on a survey is the same.

<p><span>I was using a standard account, NOT an administrative account when it downloaded.</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Defender and Microsoft Safety Scanner, nor newly downloaded Malwarebytes can NOT detect it.

<p><span>Update: After 2+ months of dealing with this malware. My computer suddenly came on without constantly going into standby/sleep mode multiple times in the first 5 minutes. It began working normally, well almost; my keyboard
 didn’t work, couldn’t put in my password, unplugged and replugged it into another USB port and it worked okay, plugged back into original port, it continued to work okay. One last aggravation before timing out or coincidence? Also, my trial version of Malwarebytes
 expired the same day the infection disappeared. Another coincidence? <span>
&nbsp;</span>It’s been working okay since. I even let it go to into standby mode by itself. This time there was NO TIME GAP while in standby (With Procmon, this time I could see all processes while it was in the standby or sleep mode) Before, with the infection,
 I could reactivate the malware by restarting the computer or putting it into “sleep” via start button, or by putting into “standby” via Process Explorer. Tried all those again and mobsync.exe doesn’t show on Procmon. Using TIME.IS on another computer for reference
 of Procmon, the only time mobsync.exe shows is the instant I click the mouse button to wake it from normal standby/sleep mode.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hopefully these clues can help the next victim, so they don’t have put up with this for over 2+ months, before it times out.

<h2>            Microphone not recognized</h2>
                    I have a logitech microphone (no software required) which I used on my previous computer using Windows XP and connected to a back panel jack. I now have a Dell computer with Windows 10 and the microphone doesn't work plugged into back (pink) jack. When
 I check control panel it shows a high definition microphone but it is connected to front usb port. When I have it check for new device it doesn't show up. How do I get it to recognize back panel jack.

<p>Nothing happens when I plug microphone into back jack. Shouldn't a notice come up when you plug something in saying detecting new device.</p>
<p>I updated from Windows 7 to 10 but I never used microphone when I was in 7 so I don't know if it worked in 7. Like I said it did work in XP on anothrer computer.</p>
<p>I clicked that web site but it was instructions for Windows 8</p>
<p>Maybe it would be easier just get a microphone that connects to a front usb port.</p>
<p>I guess there isn't any safe mode for Windows 10</p>

            <p>I did that before and I did it again and it says it detected a problem and fixed it but it still won't recognize back jack. This is going to show how dumb I am but I just noticed there is a jack for the microphone on the front of my Dell. Windows has been
 showing a microphone but said it was on a usb port so that was why I was ignoring it. I plugged the microphone into the front jack and although I didn't hear anything when I talked into it, I brought up the sound recorder app and it did record in it, so I
 know the microphone is working. Still don't know why it won,t recognize back jack but not going to worry about it.

<h2>            How to view the FULL folder names in Explorer&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Can someone tell me how to view full folder names in Windows 7 ult (x64) Explorer?</p>
<p>I was looking in some of the folders created by the Windows 7.1 SDK while trying to track down a problem with using msbuild to compile a .vcxproj. In c:\program files (x86)\MsBuild, there are three folders "4.0", "Microsoft" and "Microsoft.Cpp". When viewed
 in explorer they display as "4", "Microsoft" and "Microsoft". How do I turn this feature off please? I may be mistaken, but I'm sure XP displayed folders like this correctly.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
I would like to confirm if "4.0", "Microsoft" and "Microsoft.Cpp" are folders or files.<br />
Apart from explorer from where are you trying to view the complete file or folder name?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows 7 by default displays the complete folder name. It might not show the extension of the files. This is based on the settings on your computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may try the steps provided in the below article to unhide the extensions.<br />

<p>Dear Umesh,</p>
<p>Thank you for responding, they are indeed folders, not files.</p>
<p>Ok, this is strange, the folder names are now nolonger truncated! My&nbsp;PC has been turned off overnight, but I assure you the folders were not displaying correctly. I looked on the Internet for a good 45 minutes, before posting here as last resort.</p>
<p>I've been through as many steps as I can think of to reproduce the problem before posting again, but everything is still ok. The only major thing different is that I was downloading an MMO client at the time, I had to use a piece of software called Pandomedia
 Booster. Since then I have uninstalled it as I finished the download.</p>
<p>I apologise for not offering you any proof. If you don't mind, I'll post on this thread if it happens again and I'll rember to take some screenshots!</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Pad.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

I am happy to know that the issue doesn’t persist now. As I said in my first post folders on windows 7 will display the complete name. However, now we are not sure why this happened.</p>

<p>I've recently noticed the same problem on my laptop (Win7 Ultimate x64). I often name folders "something.v1.0", "something.v.1.1", "something.old", etc. I've noticed that in Windows Explorer the extension after the last period will be hidden, though it's
 still there when viewed from a Cmd Prompt, and also from some file Save/Open dialogs.</p>
<p>I've spent a fair amount of time searching the web but have only found endless references to hiding/unhiding FILE extensions (yes all of those options are enabled etc). This is the first reference I've found to someone else having the same problem!</p>
<p>Any assistance would be VERY gratefully received. This is making it much more difficult to work with folders and versions on my computer as I can't properly identify folders.</p>

<h2>            Pro tools 8.0.5 on windows 8</h2>
                    working on getting my new install of windows 8 to play nice with pro tools.&nbsp;
<div>had everything running for a few days, then windows updated. &nbsp;now i get some error message on launch... something like "user has insufficient privileges..." &nbsp;uninstalling update kb2756872 gets pro tools running again, but from what i can tell, this is
 a fairly important update, and likely to be part of any future cumulative updates. &nbsp;suggestions?</div>

            <p><span>Hi boah78,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to answer these questions.</span></p>
<p><span>What are the updates are you installing on your computer?<br />
What is the antivirus application are you using?</span></p>
<p><span>Are you using Administrator user account to perform Windows Update?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to place the computer in “Clean boot” state and then check the issue status.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps given below to perform Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></b><span> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>

    <title>Live Movie Maker does not recognise any pictures or videos - even - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill sherwin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live Movie Maker does not recognise any pictures or videos - even standard jpg, tif, bmp, avi, etc.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows Live Movie Maker 2011&nbsp;installed via Live Essentials on my Windows Vista Home Premium SP2 64-bit system, (and just today uninstalled Live Essentials and re-installed fresh to make sure), and I cannot get it to recognise any picture type or
 video type, even ones that are supposed to be supported as standard like photo types of&nbsp;jpg, tif, bmp or video types of&nbsp;avi, wmv, mov, mp4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I search for solutions via Google I get suggestions that I do not have the right codec installed, although this should not affect photos, however if I use
<strong>Windows Live Photo Gallery</strong> all the photo types are recognised and can be displayed, and I can use
<strong>Windows Media Player</strong> to play the various movie types, so they are all recognised by everything except Live Movie Maker 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more weird is that avi type movies loaded into Live Movie Maker 2011&nbsp;shown the the yellow triangle exclamation error mark in the timeline, as unsupported video types (and show error 0x87160129) but will actually play without sound in the preview window
 - doh!!&nbsp; Photos just show as blank in the preview and have the same yellow triangle error in the timeline view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also noticed, having now de-installed Windows Live Essentials completely, that Vista has Movie Maker built-in, however this is Version 6.0 (Build 6002 SP2) from 2007 - and is not as functional or as easy to use as the Windows Live Movie Maker 2011
 version.&nbsp; However, this older 6.0 version does not seem to have any of the problems recognising photos and videos, they are all quite happily loaded in and displayed properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is driving me crazy - why does everything else in Windows quite happily accept and display all these media types for photos and videos, but not the Live Movie Maker version - which is what I want to use to create (you guessed it) a MOVIE using the newer
 Live Movie Maker !!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please - if any can help I would really appreciate it.&nbsp; If it is a codec problem - where can I get the original windows codes used in Vista from to install them again?</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your quick response to my query, but unfortunately this does not seem to be correct.&nbsp; I downloaded the Platform Update Supplement for Vista x64 KB2117917 (as I have a 64 bit system not a 32 bit one), as recommended&nbsp;and tried to run
 this standalone update.&nbsp; However when executed it came back with the message saying
<strong>"This update does not apply to your system"</strong>.&nbsp; I therefore assume that this is either already installed through normal Windows Update function (which I have running) or was a&nbsp;part of the Service Pack 2 update.&nbsp; (I did also download the 32-bit
 Platform Update (KB971512) as mentioned and tried to run that&nbsp;too, but that also stated it did not apply to my system).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have therefore not tried to re-install Windows Live Essentials again as there has been not changes to&nbsp;my system since I reported this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you think of any other reason why the Live Movie Maker version does not recognise any photo or video types at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. Please be aware that I am a technical consultant working for a very large computer software company, with&nbsp;around 35 years experience in computers,&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;have no real problem if you need to get more technical in trying to resolve this issue.&nbsp;
 I have been trying all sorts of things for quite a while now without any success.</p>

            <p>Could you please confirm the actual version of Movie Maker that you are installing?&nbsp; Go to the first menu (the blue "File" menu (Alt+F)) and choose
<strong>About Movie Maker</strong>.</p>
<p>The latest version is now Movie Maker 2012, not Windows Live Movie Maker 2011.&nbsp; There are
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-program/error-code-c945000e-sorry-movie-maker-cant-start/e510deeb-ec20-475c-b821-ddb34e751d23">
some known incompatibilities with older systems</a> that may not have sufficient hardware to run Movie Maker 2012.&nbsp; If that is the case, you may actually want to check you have the latest video card drivers.&nbsp; Of particular note, if you have an onboard graphics
 chip, you may want to consider adding a dedicated card.&nbsp; Alternatively, you may opt to&nbsp;reinstall Windows Live Essentials 2011 instead.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: </strong>I just realized you have a Windows Vista system so I don't believe Movie Maker 2012 is an option, so you must still have WLMM 2011.&nbsp; However, I still recommend checking your video card drivers and making sure&nbsp;you have the latest.&nbsp;
 If a basic .jpg won't even display the issue is most likely the driver.</p>

            <p>The version that I am actually running at the moment is the one I believe is included with Windows Vista and is
<strong>Version 6.0.6002.18273</strong> also described in the About as <strong>Version 6.0 (Build 6002: Service Pack 2).</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to install a newer version of Movie Maker because I feel this version lacks functionality and is not so easy to use as the later Live Essentials Movie Maker 2011 version which I have had running before&nbsp;on a seperate computer (my work laptop running
 Windows 7), however I want to actually run this on my home computer running Windows Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was not aware that there is a newer Movie Maker 2012 version available, as according to the Microsoft own
<strong>Get Movie Maker</strong> web site (at <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/get-movie-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/get-movie-maker</a>), for Windows Vista I can use built-in 6.0, download 2.6 or download 2011 version (requires SP2 and Platform Update).&nbsp; Even the Windows 7 entry here still indicates Movie Maker 2011.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Searching the web now I do find references to Movie Maker 2012, but all of these do not appear to be genuine Microsoft web sites and all seem to refer to this as for Windows 7 and Windows 8.&nbsp; I do not normally install Microsoft software obtained from anywhere
 else other than Microsoft web sites.&nbsp; Please provide an official link for this download if it is actually suitable for a Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that I have just done a search for Live Essentials 2012 on the Microsoft web site and found the following&nbsp;entries, (see
<a href="http://search.microsoft.com/en-US/results.aspx?form=MSHOME&amp;setlang=en-US&amp;q=live+essentials+2012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://search.microsoft.com/en-US/results.aspx?form=MSHOME&amp;setlang=en-US&amp;q=live+essentials+2012</a>), however when I select any of the "2012" options I always seem to end up with the 2011 version.&nbsp; Where and how can you actually get to the 2012 version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of my video card I am running an AMD (formerly ATI) Radeon HD 4850 with 512MB memory and have just installed the very latest AMD Catalyst Control Center (Version 2012.0214.2218.39913) which provides all the latest drivers for this graphics card,
 so in that respect I am completely up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your continuing support in this matter.</p>

            <p><u><strong>Further Update - All seems now resolved (on Vista system anyway)&nbsp;?</strong></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just followed the link from search entry above (on both my Vista system and my Windows 7 laptop) and downloaded the
<strong>wlsetup-web.exe</strong> program and executed that.&nbsp; On&nbsp;my Windows Vista 64-bit home system I selected just Movie Maker to install and when this completed I started up the new Movie Maker and checked the Options for version information.&nbsp; This shows
 as <strong>14.0.8117.0416</strong> which I have no idea what actual version this is (2011 or 2012 or something else entirely - but does look and feel like the 2011 version I had installed on my laptop before (??).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then imported a .jpg picture and a .avi video clip and everything was absolutely fine.&nbsp;They were accepted properly by this version of Movie Maker, they displayed fine in the timeline and the avi video clip played back properly with sound when running the
 preview.&nbsp; I have no idea why this is now working, althought the only thing I did change since yesterday's update to the issue was to download the latest AMD Catalyst Control Center for my Radeon HD 4850 graphics card.&nbsp; Maybe the newer graphics drivers resolved
 this - don't know for sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my Windows 7 work laptop the wlsetup-web.exe program did try to install the Windows Live Essentials 2012 (acccording to the splash screen)&nbsp;and again I selected just the Movie maker option, however this actually failed with a message&nbsp;"<strong>An unknown
 error has occurred</strong>" with <strong>Error: 0x800b010e</strong> and <strong>
Source: D3DX9</strong> however I seem to remember that there was a mention of an install error when I did a search for Live Essentials 2012 so I will research this further and update if this is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, from the Windows Vista 64-bit system where I will be doing most of my movie making I am happy to state this this is now resolved as far as I am concerned, as this new version that works does appear to look and feel like the Movie Maker 2011 version&nbsp;I
 used on my laptop before, even though it seems to state it is a Version 14.0.8117.0416 (?).</p>
<p>Many thanks for all your help and fast responses to my questions and updates - this is much appreciated.</p>

            <p><strong>Additional Information - not completely resolved - old projects won't open</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just tried to open an old Movie Maker project that I originally created with what I believed was Movie Maker 2011 and I get a message saying this project cannot be opened because it was created with a version of Live Movie Maker that is not compatible
 with the current version (?).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I follow the "How can I open this project..." link the Help web page (see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-live/movie-maker-the-project-cant-be-opened" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-live/movie-maker-the-project-cant-be-opened</a>) states that
<strong>"A project file that was created and saved in Windows Live Movie Maker Beta can't be opened in this version of Windows Live Movie Maker. "</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is/was Live Movie Maker Beta?&nbsp; How was this somehow running when I thought I had originally installed and used Live Movie Maker 2011 on my laptop to create this project originally?&nbsp; I am more confused now, even though Live Movie Maker is working now
 on&nbsp;my Vista system I cannot seem to be able to do anything with previously created projects - doh!!</p>

            <p>Very confusing indeed.</p>
<p>The initial versions of Windows "Live" Movie Maker were called beta versions.&nbsp; This continued through the 2009 version which I believe was version 14.0 (the one you have).&nbsp; Then in 2010 there was the release of Windows Live Movie Maker 2011 which had a version
 number of 15.4.&nbsp; Later, for Windows 7 and 8 systems there is a Movie Maker 2012 (version 16.4).</p>
<p>The latest version (Movie Maker 2012) cannot be installed on Windows Vista.&nbsp; Plus it has higher graphics requirements needing DirectX 10 support or higher.&nbsp; It appears your Windows 7 system doesn't have that support.</p>
<p>The version that should be offered to you via download.live.com on your Vista system is probably 15.4.3555.0308 (the WLMM 2011 version).&nbsp; I'm not sure where the 14.0 version is coming from since that is old.&nbsp; I suspect you have projects from the *later*
 version and that's why they aren't opening in the earlier version.</p>
<p>Hopefully some of the moderators here can help sort out your concerns can get you working again.</p>

            <p>HI,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, I think the problem has been solved (or at least gone away) with regard to my home Windows Vista system, although there is still a problem on my Windows 7 laptop system, but less important at this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit SP2 - home mini-tower system</strong></p>
<p>Having read your comments above, I decided to have one more go and so I de-installed the Version 14.0.8117.0416 Movie Maker.&nbsp; This was originally downloaded after doing a search on the Microsoft Support web site for "live essentials 2012".&nbsp; This provided
 one search entry with a link to page <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3945</a>&nbsp;which is (now that I look again) the older Live Essentials version from 2010 (Version 14).&nbsp; From here I downloaded the wlsetup-web.exe program that installed the older Version 14 of Live Movie
 Maker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the de-install of Version 14, I used the original instructions from the first reply and went to the newer Live Essentials download page at
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home</a>&nbsp;and selected the
<strong>Download now</strong> button.&nbsp; This started the install process for Live Essentials 2011 (I assume it recognises I have Vista and so chooses 2011 not 2012 version), giving me the option to choose the components I wanted.&nbsp; I selected Movie Maker and
 Photo Gallery and completed the install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just in case, I then re-booted the system and started the new Live Movie Maker 2011.&nbsp; The Options / About splash screen now shows me this is
<strong>Version 2011 (Build 15.4.3555.0308)</strong> - so success, I at least&nbsp;have the right version installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then added a .jpg photo and a .avi video clip (keeping my fingers crossed) and amazingly it all worked perfectly, showed the photo and video properly in the timeline and the preview pane, including sound when I played the video clip.&nbsp; I then tried loading
 one of my previously created Movie Maker projects created with 2011 version that the previous Version 14 would not open and again fully successful, loaded properly, including photos and videos clips, and allows me to edit, change and save with no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in conclusion, for the Windows Vista home system the problem appears to have gone away - although I am at a loss as to explain why or how it was fixed.&nbsp; maybe the Version 14 installed sorted sometihng out so that when I then re-installed the 2011 Version
 15 Movie maker, it was sorted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows 7 Enterprise 64-bit (6.1, Build 7600) - work laptop system</strong></p>
<p>Whilst I will not normally be using this to do movie creation / editing, I decided to try out the&nbsp;download to see if it would select and install the Live Essentials 2012 version.&nbsp; Using the same page as before at&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home</a>&nbsp;and
 the same <strong>Download now</strong> button, I now get an installation started for Live Essentials 2012 (so it does recognise I am on Windows 7 this time - which is good).&nbsp; Having selected the option to install Movie Maker and Photo Gallery again, the install
 process gets to around 93% and then fails with "<strong>An unknown error has occurred</strong>"&nbsp;message with
<strong>Error: 0x800b010e</strong> and <strong>Source: D3DX9</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched in Microsoft Support and found 4 entries that matched this which seemed to indicate there might be an issue with the Windows Firewall, which I then turned OFF and re-tried the installation, but receive the same error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the logs stored in folder&nbsp;<strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft|WLSetup\Logs</strong> I find that in the
<strong>2012-10-04_19-15-1170-dd9ebwqt.log</strong> file there are error messages as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ERROR!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :00000DEC (10/04/2012 19:17:43) SOURCE=CERT, CODE=0x800b010e 'C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\WLSetup\wlt882C.tmp' failed signature verification. (0x800b010e)</strong></p>
<p><strong>!ERROR!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :00000DEC (10/04/2012 19:17:43) SOURCE=SecureCache, CODE=0x800b010e AddPackage(): Error extracting package 'C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\WLSetup\wlt882C.tmp' to directory 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Windows Live\.cache\8b2f2ae41cda25c02'</strong></p>
<p><strong>!ERROR!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :00000DEC (10/04/2012 19:17:43) SOURCE=PkgDownload, CODE=0x800b010e Download 'D3DX9' completed with an error (OnDownloadFinished), _fBackground=0</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are in amongst many other error messages, but seem to directly relate to the message issued&nbsp;- I don't know if this information helps with resolution.&nbsp; These logs, along with a number of others, were sent to Microsoft through the automatic reporting
 mechanism for install failures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I will not normally be doing movie building on this laptop system it is less important to me that this is resolved, however this obviously could affect many other people, so I am happy to provide whatever I can to help you resolve this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary then, Windows Vista home system has Live Movie Maker 2011 installed and working fine, Windows 7 laptop system fails on install of Live Movie Maker 2012.&nbsp; Over to you :-)</p>

                    <p>I have a somewhat&nbsp;slow notebook computer running 64-bit Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; It does have a USB 3.0 port, and I recently purchased a fast USB 3.0 flash drive and enabled ReadyBoost.&nbsp; I'd now like to measure if this is improving performance.&nbsp; I see that I should

            <p>Thank you for your suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was more than a user account issue, and I had high hopes I had solved the original problem (the missing ReadyBoost counter in Perfmon).&nbsp; However, it still remains.&nbsp; Let me explain:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran SFC /SCANNOW from an administrative command prompt, and it reported multiple file errors.&nbsp; So I thought I better do a repair install of Windows 10.&nbsp; I downloaded the image, burned it to a CD and did the install.&nbsp; Unfortunately SFC continued to report
 errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time I was able to run DISM without the Error 1726, but it reported it was unable to find all the necessary source files and was unable to complete the repair.&nbsp; That led to some research into DISM, which is far from a robust diagnostic and repair tool.&nbsp;
 In most cases, using the /Online option is not sufficient; you need a full Windows 10 image and the /source option.&nbsp; Moreover, not just any image will work; it requires the Windows 10 image file downloaded from&nbsp;Microsoft's TechBench site rather than the commonly
 used Media Creation tool.&nbsp; Unfortunately the error messages that it cannot find the correct source files do not appear until after you run DISM (10 minutes on my computer).&nbsp; It would be a lot better if DISM ran the check for the source files before it began
 its scan, but such is not the case (sloppy&nbsp;design and poor product testing in my opinion).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, I was then able to run DISM correctly and it reported the files had been repaired.&nbsp; And SFC reported no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That led me to&nbsp;hope my problem had been solved.&nbsp; But no, I still cannot find the ReadyBoost Cache counter available in Performance Monitor, despite the fact that DISM and SFC no longer report any errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after quite a few hours of time and no small frustration, I'm back&nbsp;to square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do I go from here?</p>
<p />

            <p>Oops! I spoke too soon.&nbsp; I was running the 64-bit version of Perfmon from the \Windows\SysWow64 folder, which apparently does not include the ReadyBoost Cache counter.&nbsp; When I run the 32-bit version from \Windows\System32 I now can select the ReadyBoost
 Cache counter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure I was running the 32-bit version when I first encountered the problem, so indeed a Windows 10 repair install and DISM (when properly configured to find its source files) was the correct solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>

<h2>            Unable to use Windows Ink</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Envy x360 Convertible Laptop, with pen and touch support, an active pen and yet I do not have windows ink on the laptop. The settings tab is not useful as I can't change what the buttons do.
<br />
<br />
The why:</p>
<p>I'm trying to draw on pdfs to take notes but instead I get to scroll whenever i try to make horizontal lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I have windows 10 home (version 1803)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
