            <p><span>Hi Pattie.Franco.Main,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1. When did the issue start?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>This issue happens if your hard disk is corrupt. <span>You can try running a checkdisk and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You need to boot from Windows Vista Installation disc to run Checkdsk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: When you run the check disk, there are chances of losing data so you can take a backup before running checkdisk</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Insert the installation disc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Restart your computer. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart. If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. On the System Recovery Options menu, click Command Prompt</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f. At a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>chkdsk /f /r X:( drive letter)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: When you run the checkdisk, there are chances of losing data so you can take a backup before running checkdisk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>g. Press Y when you are prompted to check the disk the next time that the system restarts.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>h. Close all applications, and then restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Note:</span></span><span><span><strong> </strong></span></span><span><span>If the outcome of the scan is unrecoverable errors, then the hard disk is either damaged or corrupt.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span></span><span><span>For additional support, yo</span></span><span><span>u can get in touch with the system manufacturer to check if they have any diagnostic tools to check hardware.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

            I have seen this error&nbsp;in a Dell boot time diagnostic run. Chances are that the hard drive is actually in pre failure state an/or you may have a memory module problem. In both cases the problem revolves around the physical computer hardware.

<p>Hi Jagrim,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear that you're having problems with IE.&nbsp; I believe if you reset your Internet Explorer settings that your problem will be resolved; it's fairly easy to do.&nbsp; Here is a link from Microsoft on how to do this:&nbsp;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an automatic tool called FixIt that might work for you, otherwise it maps out the steps on how to do it manually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if this works for you.</p>
<p>Barbara</p>

I purchased a windows 7 home premium pack in november of 2010, via the internet, as a digital DL. I just had a hard drive issue that caused me to reinstall windows 7. &nbsp;It saved my last installation as windows.old. &nbsp;How do i recover my PID to activate this installation
 of windows 7 so that i may have my features back, but also so that i may delete windows.old and free up the 20ish g of space it is using

<p>The game freezes ever time I open it. The screen is stuck on Updating downloadable content and circle below keeps spinning. It doesn't let me do anything and the only option I have is to reboot the console. After that it for that time but have the same problem
 every time I start the&nbsp;game. Is anyone else have this issue and&nbsp;does anyone know how to fix this or at the very least disable the downloadable content?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same problem here... really frustrating. &nbsp;Will go away after 15-20 minutes. &nbsp;I also notice that the Campaign, Loadout, and Shooting Range items in the main menu have a yellow circle with an exclamation point next to them.</p>

<p>I have found a consistent workaround... when I boot xbox and go into Sniper... it acts as if I had not previously shut down the game and the console. &nbsp;It starts with a black screen (and the wings icon) that says something about a "job". &nbsp;When I finally get
 to the main page, the "Updating downloadable content" dialog hangs forever.</p>
<p>SO, I will QUIT the game fully. &nbsp;Then when I restart the game, I see the "Updating downloadable content" screen for only a few seconds and I am in the game. &nbsp;Hopefully someone else can substantiate this. &nbsp;It is 100% repeatable for me.</p>

<h2>            Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems &#40;KB4019472&#41; Fails&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have reviewed and tried just about everything I can find to resolve this issue, from MS and not from MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even downloaded the 1 GB off-line installer (windows10.0-kb4015217-x64_60bfcc7b365f9ab40608e2fb96bc2be8229bc319.msu) to install this damn update. It is a 100% failure that I cannot resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Process:</p>
<p>1. Update is downloaded.</p>
<p>2. Update installs to 21%.</p>
<p>3. Computer restarts.</p>
<p>4. Update installs to 21% and then reports it has failed to install.</p>
<p>5. Update automatically removed.</p>
<p>6. Log in into the Desktop and a message is shown saying the update has failed to install.<br />
7. After about 20 minutes, a message is shown saying the computer needs to be restarted to install the update.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I restart or not, the result remains the same. I restart the computer 2 to 3 times an hour, or simply ignore the message, the process above does NOT change, the update will fail to install every time, with no information as to why it failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this is a rather new computer, there is no restore to revert to, to correct this issue, and I will not reinstall just because some one at MS cannot get his or her act together and product correct updates that actually work. The error code points to an
 error that MS has known about since Windows&nbsp;8 and the Windows 10 BETA so it is NOT new! This is would appear someone hasn't done proper testing in MS and ZERO helpful information is available on the MS Website!<br />
</p>
<p>Windows log reports (and my log is full of this error condition):</p>
<p>Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x80070011: Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB4019472).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the damn solution to this, as I'm getting tired of seeing this update error every damn day and no solution from MS?<br />

<p>OK you are running the Anniversary Upgrade (1607), you would probably have more success if you go straight for the Creators Upgrade. Since your system is new, this would be your best course of action.</p>

<p>I had the same issue.&nbsp; 6 fails over 3 days. Couldn't get past 10%. Here's how I fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Download the <a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span>This seemed to do the trick. After restarting I checked the "Windows Update"&nbsp; (in Settings) again. It told me to restart (again) which I did. After restarting I again checked the
</span>"Windows Update"&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>History Settings) and it showed the update as being successfully installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I checked for "Updates" and it confirmed the device as being up to date.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Good luck</span></p>

<p>Considering the update is AUTOMATICALLY running (I'm not manually trying to install it, Microsoft is!), shouldn't I be getting the right one since it is in the AUTOMATIC process and even showing the log?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or are you saying that the ENTIRE Microsoft staff has not taken this into consideration and the ENTIRE world needs to go through an extra process in order to install and update Microsoft has pushed to all Windows 10 devices, and isn't even a required update
 for everyone but cannot be ignored?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps Microsoft needs to wake up and fix what they broke!</p>

<p>Thanks, gave this a try and it reports it fixed all the problems, however no change, I'm still getting the damn update failed message.</p>

<p>
</p><p>After restarting I got the exact same update failed messages and this is in the log:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e7a4fe8-e48f-43c0-98a3-e6b2e256bda2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e7a4fe8-e48f-43c0-98a3-e6b2e256bda2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, Windows is still messaging me with 'We need to restart to install the update', it is getting ridiculous since it is a daily event. I'm starting to think no one at Microsoft has any idea what the **** they are doing.</p>

<p>Had similar problems and managed to get round it with the installer I see you downloaded it</p>
<p>If you've still got the installer&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if you tried this approach or not but if you haven't might be worth a try</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logged in to <strong>admin account&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Ran SFC utility to be sure no corruption on system, once finished and no corruption found</p>
<p>disconnected from internet</p>
<p>then proceeded with the installation using the self installer package.</p>
<p>took a fair while but went ok</p>
<p>just check after reboot the update service is running after install if all went well</p>
<p>
</p><p>don't know if all these steps are all required or not.</p>
<p>but solved my issue</p>

<p>Well, after much trial and error and finally finding a site with simple batch file that resets the Windows Updater, Windows no longer bothers me with this update. M$ offers absolutely nothing to help, not even an option to report the error and get a solution.
 Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However within days of fixing this, M$ put out a new update KB4022715, and again the same stupid error situation is back. Again, the standard update fails and offline installer also fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both these updates are just over 1GB in size, and both fail to install at exactly 21%, and with the same error code;
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Every time</span></strong>. One time can be an inconvenience, two different ones with the exact same problem in a constant fail loop, a trend. Smaller file size updates install without error. It would appear that
 large updates are a problem, this should be a signal to M$ to reduce the size and put out smaller installers that actually appear to install, and that someone there is to damn lazy to do their job and test this. A lab or test PC is NOT proper testing,
<p>
</p><p>As far as I'm concerned M$ needs to pull their collective heads out of their ****es and look into this. Why do I say that? Because they aren't doing it. There are hundreds of sites and forums with millions of people reporting errors with these updates, yet
 M$ does nothing. In fact, they have the gull to sit at their desks and state 'we put out these important updates, free of charge, but the users are not installing them'. Seriously? The updates are being pushed and failing to install. I do not get a prompt
 from Windows saying 'hey there is an update that fixes a major security issue that hackers are exploiting, do you want to install [Yes] [No]', it just installs and fails. So it is NOT the users that are not installing, it is the M$ staff that is failing to
 produce updates that actually install. Comments M$? Nah, you wont comment or look into this, why? Because it would force you to admit that you, in fact, lied to the public. Perhaps the hackers that are exploiting these security issues actually work for M$?</p>
<p>
</p><p>M$ wants are money, but offers zero support unless you pay <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
extra</span> for it, and the support needed is for an error <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>they</strong></span> caused. They should be paying me to report it and spending my time looking into resolving it. As an End User, I shouldn't have to be concerned with having to identify why an update fails or having to spend hours trying to get the
 update to install. I should be able to report errors and M$ should be doing it. This is what the M$ staff are paid to do! Hell, even Google takes error reports from the End User and fixes the problem. Why can't M$?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>M$, feel free to contact me and offer a REAL solution!</p>

<p>Agreed. &nbsp;Only solution I found that I haven't tried is basically a new install so I would have to reload my machine, I don't have time for that nonsense. &nbsp;And since they took away our control over updates, it does nothing but exacerbate the whole issue.</p>

<p>The issue repeated itself with KB4041676.</p>
<p>Numerous fails, with download stuck at 45%.</p>
<p>Troubleshooter didn't fix the problem.</p>
<p>Tried the direct download but no luck there.</p>
<p>Eventually (after 4 or 5 days) the update miraculously installed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the download is gobbling up resources and slowing my computer down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, Please No more updates!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you've provided, are you getting any error messages when your computer failed to update?</p>
<p>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far to fix the issue?</p>
<p>Have you tried to run the Windows Update troubleshooter and still getting the same issue?</p>

<h2>            Unable to upgrade to 8.1&#58; User folder moved</h2>
                    Hi @all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've installed Win8 (in BIOS mode).</div>
<div>I used the method suggested at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4275-user-profiles-relocate-another-partition-disk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4275-user-profiles-relocate-another-partition-disk.html</a>&nbsp;to move
 the Users-folder to a different partition (on the same drive) (namely d:\Users). However as I try to upgrade to 8.1 (using Store) I get an error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>something happened and the Windows 8.1 couldn't be installed. Please try again. Error code: 0xc1900102</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A more descriptive screen says:</div>
<div>"Can't update to Windows 8.1</div>
<div>Sorry, it looks like this PC can't run Windows 8.1. This might be because the Users or Program Files folder is being redirected to another parititon"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way to still install the update without formatting everything?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows8-UpgradeAssistant.exe did not complain at all (...as it just checks apps I think)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

            <div>So log files have been sent and hopefully there will be a solution.</div>
<div>Nevertheless although answering the 0-8-15 questions might be a waste of time here u go:</div>
<div>- Lenovo ThinkPad T430 with latest drivers installed</div>
<div>- No Proxy enabled</div>
<div>- disabled KIS, did not make a change</div>
<div><br />
<div>Well I think this scenario can easily be reproduced in a virtual machine and I do think that this works as designed as the error message is quite precise about the error. But as pointed out by @A613S no one of the users having their folder redirected will
 be able to do a upgrade? An official statement would be nice.</div>

            After a whole night of experimenting I could successfully upgrade to 8.1 on a machine where the ProfilesDirectory was redirected to D:\Users and the user folder was also D:\Users\Username.
<div><br />
<div>Beware: I also tried roughly the same on a different computer without luck (but it had low on free space) and after doing the update and restarted several times, it stuck at 59% and when I forced the shutdown, it rolled back automatically to Windows 8,
 but the profile directory cannot be loaded since then, every time when I log on, a temporary directory is created.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The steps I made for the successful upgrade:<br />
<div>(I am not sure if all these are required but this worked for me)</div>
<div><br />
<div>- I reset HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/ProfileList/ProfilesDirectory back to "%SystemDrive%\Users".</div>
<div>- I created a new account (after the first step it will be created in C:\Users )</div>
<div>- I made the new account Administrator (Control panel, change user type)</div>
<div>- I signed out with my existing user</div>
<div>- I signed in with the newly created user</div>
<div>- I opened an administrator command prompt and made a Junction from the C: profile folders to the D: profile folders running mklink /J C:\Users\Username D:\Users\Username</div>
<div>- I changed the HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/ProfileList/S-1-5-xx-xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx/ProfileImagePath keys that point to D:\Users\Username to C:\Users\Username</div>
<div>- Verified that I could still log in to desktop with the user.</div>
<div>- (I guess the previous 3 steps should be repeated for all the accounts with profile folders on D)</div>
<div>- Installed all pending updates and made a full restart to make sure that the no user on D is logged in</div>
<div>- Downloaded and installed the 8.1 update successfully :-) .</div>
<div><br />
<div>Actually I tried to install the update after the previous steps too but it was unsuccessful. At first, it failed with the error message "Can't update to Windows 8.1 Sorry, it looks like this PC can't run Windows 8.1. This might be because the Users or
 Program Files folder is being redirected to another parititon" during compatibility check.</div>
<div>After changing the ProfilesDirectory, the error was different, the progress indicator in Windows Store went to something like 95% and then it just gave an error number. (I can't remember it but something like 700040001, it had only 3 nonzero digits)</div>
<div>At the end, after installing all updates and a full restart, the update went successfully.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Playing around with the ProfileImagePaths doesn't seem to be very safe, I don't know when the user account went wrong in the other case, I can't remember signing back in after doing the registry changes, so it might have been wrong before the 8.1 upgrade.
 It might have been the case of the failure to upgrade.</div>
<div>I have no idea what I did differently apart from the new user I created was a local account and not a microsoft account.</div>
<div>Actually the same thing happened to me sometimes when I tried to relocate an existing account to a different drive in the past (Win XP, Win 7), but after that my strategy was to create a temporary account when installing windows, then change ProfilesDirectory
 and for the accounts I created after that were created on D:. This led to the setup that made Windows 8.1 upgrade fail.</div>
<div>Note: It happened to me previously that an update failed for the same reason, but that time it was enough to do the first step on my list and I didn't have to touch my existing profiles.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It also occurred to me that probably the Junction and changing ProfileImagePaths was unnecessary and the reason of the failure after changed ProfilesDirectory was not that would have to install the pending 3 updates and do a clean restart.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope that this helps, at least there is a case when the upgrade was solved without doing a full reinstall or deleting users.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I hope deleting and recreating the user will work in my other case as well.</div>
<div>I also have the suspicion that after upgrading to 8.1 I would be able to put the default profiles dir back to D: (until Windows 8.2, Windows 9 or a SP comes out)</div>

            <blockquote>After a whole night of experimenting I could successfully upgrade to 8.1 on a machine where the ProfilesDirectory was redirected to D:\Users and the user folder was also D:\Users\Username.
<div><br />
<div>Beware: I also tried roughly the same on a different computer without luck (but it had low on free space) and after doing the update and restarted several times, it stuck at 59% and when I forced the shutdown, it rolled back automatically to Windows 8,
 but the profile directory cannot be loaded since then, every time when I log on, a temporary directory is created.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The steps I made for the successful upgrade:<br />
<div>(I am not sure if all these are required but this worked for me)</div>
<div><br />
<div>- I reset HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/ProfileList/ProfilesDirectory back to "%SystemDrive%\Users".</div>
<div>- I created a new account (after the first step it will be created in C:\Users )</div>
<div>- I made the new account Administrator (Control panel, change user type)</div>
<div>- I signed out with my existing user</div>
<div>- I signed in with the newly created user</div>
<div>- I opened an administrator command prompt and made a Junction from the C: profile folders to the D: profile folders running mklink /J C:\Users\Username D:\Users\Username</div>

                    <p>Original title : Parental controls restrict this game from running</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am unable to play a game on my computer.&nbsp; It is rated E10+.&nbsp; Every time I load the disc, I receive the error message: "Parental Controls restrict this game from running."&nbsp; I use the Vista operating system.&nbsp; I am also an administrator on the computer.&nbsp;
 Due to the ages of my children, there is no need to set up password protections.&nbsp; I was not aware that there had been any parental controls set up on my computer.</p>

<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the issue confined to any specific games or particular game?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Was it working fine before? If so, do you remember making any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>You may try running the game as administrator. Follow the steps in the link:</span></p>

<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails disable the parental control and check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on<b> start</b> and click on

            Could it be you are looking for the Application Experience SERVICE?
<br />From what I've read, it does not appear to be included in Windows 10.  
<br />
<br />Specifically what Edition of Windows 10 do you have?
<br />
<br />PLEASE PROVIDE FULL Windows and/or Office Edition, Version AND Build Numbers
<br />..........******************************************************
<br />.
<br />Although MS does not tell you, when you are asking for help, we really do need to know specific the Windows (or Office) Edition, Version AND Build numbers you are running. 
<br />.
<br />Contrary to MS's wishful thinking, we are all NOT running the "most recent" version (actually Version AND BUILD!) .  Individual recurring, (obviously unfixed) Windows update errors cause people to be running older versions and builds. We commonly see people running versions of Windows that have fallen out of support because they are 18 months old due to unfixed update errors during that span of time. 
<br />.
<br />The simplest way is to RUN the WinVer command  (option 4 or 5 in the following tip)

Unless I explicitly suggest it, avoid downloading their “utilities”.  Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it. Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs. 
<br />
<br />As well, watch out for ads on the site. They may advertise products that include PUPs. Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

    <title>An application in chinese &#40;&#63;&#41; prevent my computer from - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            An application in chinese &#40;&#63;&#41; prevent my computer from shutting down.</h2>
                    <div>Hi everyone,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm a little bit concerned by something weird that started several weeks ago.</div>
<div>When I try to restart or shutdown my computer this application / process appear succintly before disapearing (an app without name is then preventing from shutdown) (I have to be super quick to take the picture).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here the name of the application.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/508ac898-fcf6-4d55-afc0-e4077de26879" />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Eventually, after some seconds the coumputer is shutting down.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My problem is I never installed whatsoever in chinese, and when I look into my processes and application (even with process hacker), I have nothing with this name. I'm a bit affraid that could be a malware (but i cannot even research the name because it's
 in chinese).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anti-malware (malwarebit, several others like trend micro...), anti-rootkit and anti-virus (the microsoft one) do not detect anything. So maybe it's safe after all, but is somebody knows what is this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you very much,</div>
<div>JC</div>
                </div>

<p>
</p><p>The answer is that the text is in Unicode rather than ASCII and can be converted to English.&nbsp; It is not Chinese or Taiwanese or... .&nbsp; It is also not malicious; in fact it is quite the opposite:</p>

<p>(Please note that I do not have the windows key or install disk, as I bought this computer from someone else, used[The computer had been used for 2 years, and I had it for about two and a half months].)</p>

    <title>What is your favorite controller button&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aka scratch  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is your favorite controller button&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We’ve all wondered at one time just what are peoples favorite controller buttons? This isn't favorite of all time, that's for my next post. This is just favorite and no one steal my idea of least favorite. &nbsp;Also since this is an Xbox forum make sure to respond
 with Nintendo buttons if you want to try and troll even though we talk gaming and it doesn't matter. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Joking aside 😆&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ACTUAL TOPIC: &nbsp;How to get good discussion ratings for the most XP</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to post a few tips for gaining some solid XP here on the forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create posts that inspire conversation. &nbsp;Could be news articles, game strategies, guides, opinions on topical news in the industry .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Avoid things that most people are going to just one word answer and move on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you currently get XP for this but you'll gain far more if the post has topical substance. &nbsp;This will encourage emotion from the readers and your answers and posts are more likely to be upvoted. &nbsp;Which means more people will see your posts and responses.
 &nbsp;This is how you earn XP when you're not even logged in. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To help people out I'd like to see some long time ambassadors respond with what types of things you look for in a post that make you upvote it or what things you look for in a solid discussion post you'd upvote.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>

<p>I know the A button gets used a lot, but I think we can all agree that X is probably best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all seriousness, I miss the days of the really thought provoking discussions we used to have. Now it all just turns into one big list of game names. I tend to ignore most, if not all, of the discussion threads these days because they're not true discussions
 and not really the best use of the forums imo. I don't mean to be Debbie Downer, but we've lost a lot of good forum people because of the way the forums are now and that's one of the reasons.&nbsp;</p>

            I love a good discussion post, I don't know that I look for anything particular as well but if the topic stands out to me than im all in. I would think its that way for a lot of people. Now if I had to pick a button though it would be the LT, just seems
 like he is the assist button and he compliments the RT really well lol.

<p>My favorite button would be the "Any button" that some games tell me to press to start the game. I still haven't found a controller that has that button though...&nbsp; lel

<p>The up on the D pad is topographically more superior to the other buttons and there fore is the best. Right angles combined with a forward first attitude makes the Up button on the Dpad a real go getter compared to the others. The down button just wants
 to go away from everything, the left and right buttons are always fighting on which direction to go. The YBAX buttons are well rounded but lack true inner character. The joy sticks are just an aimless pair with no real direction in life. The start and menu
 buttons have lost their way since their journey began decades ago. The Bumpers are just stuck in themselves and have a tendency to breakdown in critical life decisions and the the triggers have a hard time finding any balance in their life. So yea, the Up
 button on the D pad is always best.</p>

<p>I was sitting here trying to think about which button was my favorite as I was reading. You had me for a second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is some really solid advice though! I don’t really look for to much from a discussion post, just weather it is relevant to me or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a post ask about a specific this or that game, I may not comment on it, because chances are I may not have played either games listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer taking part in blanket discussion post. Something that may have a topic for everyone to bring up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>A few tips for creating discussions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I've noticed is that if the original post has some good discussion to it to begin with, it's more likely to invite better discussion below.&nbsp; Answer your own question thoughtfully and it'll make some difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also seen a lot of threads that boil down to "What's your favorite ______?" or "What's your favorite ______ and why?"&nbsp; Just adding that little "and why" at the end of those threads invites more discussion, though unfortunately a lot of people still
 ignore it.&nbsp; But I'll be more likely to upvote something that can't be answered in 3 words or less unless the respondent is extremely lazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, maybe most importantly, ask something where you're genuinely interested in the responses that people might give.&nbsp; I've started a few discussion threads about community attitudes toward achievements in the last month, such as types of achievements
 we like/dislike seeing on lists and how having achievements changes the way you play games.&nbsp; I've gotten at least a complete sentence for nearly every reply in those threads, often more.&nbsp; It's been genuinely fascinating seeing how much diversity there has
 been in the responses, let alone what the answers revealed about how different our attitudes are about how much we care about achievements to begin with.</p>
<p>

<h2>            One channel not working in Windows Media Center</h2>
                    Original title:Windows Media Center Help<br />
I have a TV tuner card installed on my PC and was having no problems pulling in all of my OTA channels in my local area of Minneapolis/St. Paul MN. &nbsp;Now one channel isn't working, its the FOX affiliate 9.1. &nbsp;9.2 works fine and all of my other channels. &nbsp;9.1
 works fine on my two other televisions hooked up to the same antenna. &nbsp;I am wondering if there is a setting or something that could help me with this issue. &nbsp;Thanks.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I too am having a very similar problem.&nbsp; Using OTA in cleveland, oh and receive the same error message, although I'm having trouble with 19.1 (CBS) but 19.2 is fine along with all my other stations.&nbsp; I have my pc connected to a plasma tv and if i change its
 input to antenna 19.1 comes in fine and they are both connected to the same antenna.&nbsp; I have deleted and rescanned for channels and 19.1 is there and checking signal strength its all green but no picture.&nbsp; I have also tried uninstalling/reinstalling the tv
 tuner (aver media duet) driver to no avail.&nbsp; This is a recent problem as this system has been up since win7 came out and this channel has always worked. If you found a solution could you please post.
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
UPDATE<br />
<br />
Ok, I found a solution that worked for me, its on the hack7mc website. http://www.hack7mc.com/2009/09/clearing-guide-data-and-tuner-setup-from-windows-7-media-center.html .&nbsp; I did not see all the services they highlighted but i shutdown the ones that were running,
 deleted the db for the guide data and restarted. Once back in mce reran the live tv setup and everything worked. hope this helps.<br />

                    Hi was hoping someone can help me out, I have an account with the Kadukukid and was hoping to see to if someone can see if it still exists or has been deleted. Also if Skype has a recovery email? Thank you.

<p>Based on the screenshot provided by one of a fellow Skype user, it looks like you're using your display name to reset your password. Display names cannot be used when resetting your password, only your sign-in information (Skype Name, email or phone number)
 can be used for account recovery purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you still recall if you used an email, phone number or Skype Name&nbsp;when you created your account?</p>

<h2>            Recovering skype account</h2>
                    <p>I have had the same account ID for ten years!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night Skype decided to sign me out and force an account verification, on all my devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now spent two hours and 15 plus email messages on three different emails/phones, skype browser and my MS account to get back in. No joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite having changed my details at the skype web browser account level, it still tries to verify using a deceased email address. (Is it not talking to the master account?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will let me change my password and then does the same stupid verification.&nbsp; Then the browser skype account said there was a problem with the account, try later. I did, same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ironically I had just tried Skype phone credits, not a good example is it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is appalling MS, rubbish in fact, will have to do a lot better in the future to be depended upon for my business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep getting too many niggles and mess ups these days, is this a sign of quick and dirty software all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with a useful suggestion most welcome?</p>

<h2>            Xbox One won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t play certain Blu Ray Discs &#40;Die Hard, atleast&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>

<p>I recently purchased the Die Hard collection on amazon. Got it today, and it won't play on my Xbox One. I put the disc into the drive, and it spins over and over. According to the Xbox, there is no disc. I've tried a few things, including the hard restart
 (Holding power button until system shuts down completely, then starting it back up), no luck. Figured it might just be the disc, so I tried Die Hard 2. Still no luck. I then tried a few other blu rays I had, and they worked fine. I tried Die Hard on my computer,
 and it worked fine. What's up with this?<br />
<br />
I appreciate any help, thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is possible that the Die Hard collection may not play on the xbox one because of the java script on the disc. I know that with my stand alone player I have to periodically update the firmware for newer discs to play. Microsoft may need to send out an
 update for the blu-ray player app.</p>

<p>The Die Hard collection blu-ray pack came out in 2007.</p>
<p>2007.</p>
<p>Somehow I don't think a blu-ray player released in 2013 (Nov 2013 for Xbone!!!) will be incompatible with such an old title.</p>
<p>Anyhow to test this I just popped the first movie in my Xbone and it plays. &nbsp;It sounds like you have a machine with a defective drive.</p>

<h2>            System crashes randomly while using on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>&lt;p&gt;I have been hvaing a strange problem and cant find a solution anywhere, have been searching days for a solution and tried so many things and none have worked. my problem is the following:&lt;</p>
<p>I get random freezes while using the pc but its not a standard blue screen or black screen of death, its like every program stops working suddenly and even Ctrl+Alt+Dlt wont work (i think is has something to do with windows.exe crashing). not sometimes i
 can use the computer for hours and everything will run perfectly untill it doesent. i read that it could be related to windows not being updates and have been told to try and reset windows. i have tryed doing it from setting/recovery etc, even trying using
 an external USB and guess what, it crashes... it says there is an update pending but i cant install it, it seems whenever i try to do anything windows related like update or repair it crashes. i dont know what else to try.</p>

<p>The difference with live is that - there is no option to deal out an appropriate thump and the bouncer is nowhere to be seen! &nbsp;The gobshites are being allowed ruin everyone elses fun and until something is done about it well you can forget it. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 apps won&#39;t connect to the internet although the desktop will</h2>
                    <span>I upgraded my Windows 7 computer to Windows 8 and none of the apps work and they all show offline. When I open the desktop I can use the internet with no problem. In the network and sharing options it says that I am not connected to a network.

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns.
 However, you may receive the original error message. Or, you may experience the original behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3<span>:</span></span></b></p>

<p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and
 other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your
 antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<h2>            Unable to un-install GeForce Experience</h2>
                    <p>I currently have a Windows 10 laptop with a NVIDIA GeForce 970M gpu installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to uninstall the GeForce experience but cannot. I followed the directions in a similar post that stated to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you are unable to un-install GeForce Experience software, I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows key + X</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Expand&nbsp;<strong>Display Adaptors</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Right click on&nbsp;<strong>NVidia display card drivers</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>Un-install</strong>.</span></li><li><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After selecting un-install you will get the message dialog box –&nbsp;<strong>Confirm Device un-install.&nbsp;</strong>Make sure you put a check mark that says<strong>&nbsp;Delete
 the driver software for this device</strong></span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer, computer will load generic display drivers.</span></li><li><span>Now go to&nbsp;<strong>Programs and features</strong>&nbsp;and check if&nbsp;</span><strong><span>GeForce Experience</span></strong><span>&nbsp;is listed under installed programs. If GeForce Experience is still listed,
 select it and click on Un-install and check</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I am still unable to uninstall the program and am currently trying to reinstall an updated driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What else can I do to remove the "experience" program?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you</span></p>
<p>

            Thank you for your response. I removed the driver and downloaded an updated one off the nvidia website. There I was able to select the option not to install the experience software. Oddly enough by selecting that it removed what was already downloaded
 and voila!
