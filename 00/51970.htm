    <title>Windows 10 Updates - complaint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jseni  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Updates - complaint</h2>
                    <p>I have been in contact with a Microsoft technician using the "chat" facility, and at the end of the session I have been pointed here as the appropriate place to make an official complaint. (It seems a strange forum to have to air my complaint in public!)<br />
<br />
When I was using Windows 7 I was able to control when I applied a Microsoft update, and was able to make the restart occur at a time convenient for me. Since I have been using Windows 10 it seems I no longer have that control. The result is that the Windows
 restart is occurring when my jobs are partially processed. I need to be able to manage when the update affects the processing on my computer otherwise the jobs I am doing with it are damaged.<br />
<br />
I often have jobs which can take a number of days and I believe it is unreasonable to expect me to sit at the computer the whole time to postpone a restart if a request occurs. If Microsoft wants to impose a restart at a time which is convenient to Microsoft
 then it should also accept the responsibility to postpone all taskd running on that machine at the point of interrupting and to restart all connections and continue processing as if the restart never took place. If this cannot be done then the control should
 be given to the user and it is then their responsibility to manage the task completion and closing of applications before enabling the update restart to occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained to the technician that I have some processes which might take a number of days to complete and I was told that under the OS build I have (14393.222) I can no longer control when the restarts occur other than using an "active hours" setting within
 twelve hours Which is not much use if I have tasks to run which take say four days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked if I need to buy another computer to get back the control I need, but didn't get an answer to that question.<br />
<br />
So can a message be got through to the MIcrosoft System design team responsible for updates please.to give the user control. Also to the Microsoft Marketing team to understand that a computer is purchased by a user so that they can run their applications on
 it and that the Microsoft maintenance tools need to respect this is why people have bought the computer. &nbsp;I have had so many interruptions of overnight tasks that I need to know how to stop Microsoft from messing up my systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone from Microsoft is able to help on this and get their products back to be able to do what users want, but I would also like a solution sooner than the next computer I buy.</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying.&nbsp;<br />
This was the site Microsoft gave me a link in order to make a complaint.<br />
<br />
I do want to apply Microsoft updates, but I don't want them to wipe out the work I am doing by switching off my computer at a point in the middle of my process. It's worse than having to start again as I have to remove the files brought over first for a clean
 start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was so much easier when you could choose when to restart, after completing and closing down the applications.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft have lost the plot and don't seem to understand that people buy a computer to do things, not just to update the operating system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure where you mean regarding the feedback app?</p>

    <title>How can I check for registry errors or a corruption of windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tracemaurer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I check for registry errors or a corruption of windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    My computer has recently begun to crash for no apparent reason. sometimes while just sitting idle or while running a program that requires a lot of CPU processing.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There doesn't seem to be any pattern dealing with these crashes. (which may only be fixed by holding down the power button since everything completely locks up, including the mouse and keyboard functions such as alt f4 and ctrl alt delete.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I have come to the conclusion that something must have corrupted my operating system somehow.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone knows how to help or thinks of something I have forgotten please let me know</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></p>
<p>Boot the computer to safe mode with networking and download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only), update
 definitions and run in safe mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />
<a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chsafe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chsafe.htm</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a></p>
<p>Download and run SuperAntiSpyware (Free Edition)<br />
<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/download.html</a></p>
<p>Checking for registry errors using a registry cleaner would not be a smart move so please do not go down that route.</p>
<p>If scanning for malware reveals no problems then lokking at Event Viewer reports can reveal what is wrong.</p><span>1.
 Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the
 reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</span>
<p><span>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes
 System is by far the most important.</span></p>
<p><span>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side
 of the window select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to
 click a second time to see the latest Report at the top. </span></p>
<p><span>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Select the
 Details tab and check the box before XML View. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports
 that offer the best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues.
</span></p>
<p><span>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports.
 Study reports since the point when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on
 the internet. The description is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</span></p>

<h2>            0x8078012D and 0x8007045D Backup errors</h2>
                    At this point my next computer will either run Linux or Mac OS. I have been a Microsoft user going back to the days of DOS 5.0...I have been trying for 2 weeks to upgrade my HDD because of a current failing drive. Backups constantly fail. Mainly because
 of how tweaky everything is now. This hybrid version of backing up as a 7 Pro user who migrated to 10 Pro is completely useless. Cant get real media, have to download, cant do a true clean install and manually bring files back either. Cant speak to someone
 I can understand who isnt following the idiotic flow charts. Why have I spent as much money on Microsoft products over the years if I cant get this fixed?

<p>Hi Jeff,<br />
<br />
The error codes 0x8078012D and 0x8007045D you are experiencing with the backup feature in Windows may be caused by several factors. These include the drives (HDD) that you are using, the antivirus software running in the background or corruption in the Windows
 operating system. At this point, please answer the questions below so we can better assist you:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When does the errors appear: during the backup process, starting the backup process, or when retrieving the image files?</li><li>To avoid repetition, can you provide us with all the troubleshooting steps that you've done so far?</li><li>Can you send a screenshot of the error messages if there are any?</li></ul>

<p>Erika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. I also need to apologize for my rant, just extremely frustrated. It may be corruption, bad sectors or a whole host of other issues as you stated above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows backup fails anywhere from a third of the progress bar all the way up to the end. Have tried various measures, these are listed below:</p>
<p>Windows Repair</p>
<p>3rd Party Repair Programs</p>
<p>CHKDSK/ R</p>
<p>Stopped Anti Virus</p>
<p>Turned off firewalls (Due to the infamous cannot reach the RPC Server)</p>
<p>Made sure I had the latest updates</p>
<p>Went thru MSCONFIG to make sure everything was correct because I had restricted some services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have screen shots because I am trying to do a clean install at this point to a replacement hard drive but having some issues with that as Windows Install cannot recognize a partition to write to.</p>

<p>Thank you for the information. Since the partitions can't be recognized when doing a clean install, we recommend formatting the HDD and downloading the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media Creation Tool</a></strong> to perform a clean installation of Windows 10. You can get in touch with the hard drive manufacturer on how to reset
 your HDD to factory default settings.</p>

<h2>            Controller keeps disconnecting from Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>So I have the controller the system came with and it seemed the batteries died so I replaced them with brand new out of the packaging batteries and while I am in the middle of the game the controller disconnects, so I turn the controller back on and asks
 me to sign in. It keeps happening frequently and is a little annoying. So I don't know if there is any fix to this or not. But I might just have to go buy the charging kit for it.</p>

 or heard about. i told the dude that there is lots and lots of people having these problems and there all one the forms, so he better start looking at them. -You people need to start calling them and telling them these things. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 right now that there XBOX ONE are popping then Smoking like its on fire. Also people have been sending there XBOX ONE and there stuff and the Microsoft people have been sending the stuff all scratched up and Losing the stuff the customer sent in, They have
 all gone to the higher ups in Microsoft and always get the same answer still dont know were your stuff is. &nbsp;If you send in your XBOX ONE do not spend the amount of money they want you to on shipping products because they will send it back to you after they
 fix or give you a new one in a Crap box and the packing is just 2 fom things on the left and right side of the counsel and wraped in a one layer paper thin fom. I know and ask any one else that has sent there xboxs out and got them back. &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>I just finished talking to support about my day one controller with the same issue. &nbsp; They said I need to send my controller in to be replaced. &nbsp;I asked if they could send me the replacement before I sent mine and the answer was NO. &nbsp;So now I need to pay
 for shipping and will have a week or so where I cannot play my Xbox. &nbsp;I asked if I will be compensated for the shipping costs and time not being able to play. &nbsp;They said there are no updates in this area. &nbsp;Wow great way to treat an early adopter who preordered
 the console during last year's e3</p>

<p>Rambo, I too am having the same issues as you are. Controllers (Yes Both do it) disconnecting &amp; one makes an awful noise everytime it is used in game play. COD Ghosts is a nightmare. Every reload, movement etc I get what sounds like motors whirring. If as
 TheBergsShows says we have to send them in for repair/replace and we don't get a refund on P&amp;P then Microsoft can have the whole shebang back. Shocking Customer Service.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Designer Keyboard Taking to Long to Pair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianlawrence_983  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Designer Keyboard Taking to Long to Pair</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 7 on a Lenovo T440s. I'm attempting to pair a new Microsoft Designer Keyboard and Mouse. When I try to pair using the Add a Device feature, it sees the equipment when I activate the Bluetooth pairing process, but as soon as I try to connect
 it says it is taking too long to pair, despite it being less than one second between the time it sees it and the time I attempt to pair. It does this for both the Mouse and the Keyboard. I also tried adding other Bluetooth devices to my machine (an iPhone
 and a pair of music headphones), and both pair just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought two sets of the keyboard, one for home and one for my office. The Lenovo is my office machine. When I try the same process using my Surface Book to pair to the keyboard, it works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...my conclusions:</p>
<p>* Bluetooth settings on the Lenovo appear okay since the laptop is recognizing and pairing to other types of Bluetooth devices</p>
<p>* The keyboards are pairing to the Surface Book, so it's not a defective keyboard or mouse</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts? </p>

<p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>No it didn't work.</p>
<p>Step 1. I got 100%, 1680 X 1050 which was the recommended.</p>
<p>Step 2. screen went blank, came back on, logged in - no change.</p>
<p>Step 3. A.&nbsp; rollback&nbsp; is grayed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B. I can not get on the internet , it is in AIRPLANE MODE - AND IT IS ALSO GRAYED OUT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying things others suggested I also have folders that have no contents, ones I was told to change something in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so frustrated with the computer right now, I am writing a long post to Dell, it is a brand-new computer!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you so much for your assistance, have a wonderful day :)</span></p>

<p>Got it fixed, </p>
<p>Very simple, the monitor has a reset option only if you know where to find it.&nbsp; The on off button on the bottom right has a light that comes on above it when you hover over the on /off button, click on it, you have options for brightness and contrast, and
 menu. choose menu then you will see a factory reset, click on it and everything goes back like it is suppose to be!</p>
<p><span>I have other monitors that those options are on select buttons beside on the on and off but the Dell 20" does not have these buttons, so THANK YOU DELL for helping me correct this! And thank the people here that responded!</span></p>

            <p>Hi ChandrashekharaK,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your post. Please provide us some information to understand the scenario:</p>
<p>1.) The Skype for Business app version you are using on iOS. And the iOS version device also the device type (iPhone/iPad)</p>
<p>2.) The Voice settings that don’t stick, please provide the detailed steps showing what kind of setting you want to "stick", also a screenshot of the scenario if possible.</p>
<p>3.) Does the issue occurs only on this device or also on other devices?</p>
<p>4.) Check if the issue still persist when changing a Wifi network, Example like Café internet.</p>
<p>5.) Do you also use Skype for Business client (PC/Mac)? If yes try to disable/logoff other Skype for Business clients as well on other mobile devices, then check if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Ruel</p>

<p>Actually, i posted on some other forum before. I don't have the actual dump files anymore but i used the debugging tools for windows myself before to see if i could fix it myself maybe.</p>
<p>Here was the output of those i posted them up on pastebin...</p>
<p>Maybe they are useful, otherwise i have to wait a bit to get some more crashes since i just reinstalled.</p>

<p>1 crash is caused by Avast (aswMonFlt). You also have a lot of crashes with Access violation which can be caused by faulty RAM.</p>
<p>Please download memtest86+ [1], burn a new bootable CD (use a CD-RW if possible) from the ISO (download and use ImgBurn [2] to do this), reboot your PC and scan your RAM 4-5hours for errors.<br />

            I have checked latest dumps, and I still believe that it is a hardware issue. Is your RAM compatible to your ASUS M4A87TD/USB3 Motherboard?<br />

<p>Hi Serge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A single-app kiosk uses the assigned access features to run a single app aboce the lock screen. When the kiosk account sign in, the app is launched automatically. The person using the kiosk cannot so anything in the device outside of the kiosk app and this
 feature applies to Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education. We appreciate the time and effort that you have taken to work on this issue. However, in order to get better clarity on the issue, we would need some more information regarding the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you using administrator user account?</p>
<p>2. Do you see any account apart from yours at sign in screen? If no, the kiosk account is not set up.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Could you let us know how exactly you are trying to remove KIOSK account?</p>
<p>4. When you say "Get Started button is not available", could you let us know where exactly you are loooking for it?</p>
<p>5. May I know the version and edition of Windows operating system your&nbsp;computer currently running on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also want to refer <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/kiosk-single-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>I&#39;m uncertain as to whether I could transfer a digital license to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 19chickens  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;m uncertain as to whether I could transfer a digital license to a new PC build.</h2>
                    <p>So I'm considering building a desktop, as my aging laptop (Asus X552CL) is showing its age (plus, the dead/dying charger).&nbsp; In response, I'm considering building a more modern system, however given the rather expensive cost of retail keys (£120!) I'd prefer
 to reuse an old key.&nbsp; Sadly I don't have any 7, 8 or 8.1 keys lying around, though I do have two XP keys.&nbsp; Therefore, that option (if it's still available) is out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, the only option I can think of is to try and transfer the digital license from my laptop to the new build.&nbsp; Said laptop came with 8 in mid-2014, which I then upgraded to 8.1.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't know if it came with an OEM key or not.&nbsp; Then,
 in mid-2015, I updated it to Windows 10.&nbsp; I recently ran the "slmgr -dli" command on it, which informed me that it was a "RETAIL" key.&nbsp; It's currently activated by a digital license linked to my mother's Microsoft account.&nbsp; Her laptop (that I'm typing this
 on) is activated in the same manner, only its product key is on the OEM_DM channel.&nbsp; For comparison, it came with 10 preinstalled.&nbsp; What I want to know is if I can uninstall the product key from my laptop and install it on a desktop build in order to activate
 Windows there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to summarise:</p>
<p>a) I got a laptop in mid-2014 with Windows 8.&nbsp; The Microsoft account used there is my mother's.</p>
<p>b) I don't check the license it came with.</p>
<p>c) I upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>d) After upgrading the product key is "RETAIL channel", linked to my mother's Microsoft account.</p>
<p>e) I want to know if I can transfer the product key to a desktop build and use my account there.&nbsp; As far as I can tell using my account shouldn't be&nbsp;<em>too</em> difficult, it's the transferring the product key.&nbsp; Of course, all of this depends on whether
 the key was originally OEM or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help in advance!</p>

            Even though the Windows 10 free upgrade from Windows 8 says retail, it is still in spirit and OEM License and cannot be transferred. 
<br />
<br />You will need to purchase an entirely new Windows 10 license for the machine you are building:
<br />
<br />When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?
<br />
<br />If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing too.
<br />
<br />If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.
<br />If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.
<br />
<br />Full version (Retail):
<br />- Includes transfer rights to another computer.
<br />- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.
<br />- Expensive
<br />Upgrade version (Retail):
<br />- Includes transfer rights to another computer.
<br />- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.
<br />- Expensive, but cheaper than full version
<br />
<br />OEM :
<br />OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:
<br />- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel
<br />- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on
<br />- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard
<br />- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system
<br />
<br />What happens if I change my motherboard?
<br />As it pertains to the OEM license this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail Windows 10 license. If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1) was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
<br />
<br />From the Windows 10 end user license agreement:
<br />b. Stand-alone software. If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.

<h2>            What is supposed to happen when I paste a screenshot into a group chat IM&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was in a Skype for Business group chat and pasted a screenshot into the discussion. Once I clicked send, I couldn't see my screenshot to see that it was sent, but I noticed a little orange dot&nbsp; next to the the upper right corner of the Present icon. After
 a few seconds one participant left the chat and I saw a message saying they left the Meeting. Could the rest of the group continue to see my desktop as long as the chat was open? Is this what is supposed to happen?</p>

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late reply. From my test in the lab, the rest of group still can see the screenshot as long as the chat is open. Even if you leave the group chat, the rest of group can still see the managed content. This is because the file has been uploaded
 in the chat room.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO, the adapter is helpful in sharing the network connection from the device by creating it as portable hotspot. In absence of this adapter, you may get '<em>The hosted network couldn’t be started. The group or resource is not in the correct state to perform
 the requested operation</em>' error while creating hotspot using Command Prompt.</p>

            There is no official driver provided by Microsoft for this. Many third party websites claim to provide the driver for this, but don't fall for them. These sites are too risky.
<br />
<br />If Windows 10 is not able to detect your camera =
<br />
<br />1. See if the camera is appearing in Device Manager. If yes, try to update driver from there by right clicking on the camera
<br />
<br />2. Windows Key+I &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera &gt; Let apps use my camera hardware should be ON
<br />
<br />3. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />4. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to invoke Task Manager &gt; Go to the “Processes” tab &gt; See which programs are currently running in the background of the system and     If you found an app that uses Camera, end that program
<br />
<br />5. Refer to this Microsoft help and execute the following steps 
<br />
<br />Check your antivirus software
<br />Check for an outdated webcam driver 
<br />Roll back your webcam driver 
<br />Uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes

<p><span><font color="#000000">-What do you mean by “display goes locked”, are you locking the computer?</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">I would like to let you know that Dwm.exe assists in displaying the operating system's visual theme and format. The Dwm file is responsible for some of the graphic effects. It also serves to control icons and desktop themes, and
 offers support for high-resolution graphics. The Desktop Window Manager program performs these graphic-based functions every time the user opens a new program window.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">While the Desktop Window Manager assists in smoother graphics and more detailed effects, the amount of memory it utilizes can be a concern. As the computer operator opens more program windows, the Dwm.exe program increases its
 use of the computer's memory, up to several megabytes. As each window opens, the Dmw.exe process uses additional memory to store the window's contents. Generally, this only causes an issue if a limited amount of memory is available, or if the user is opening
 several program windows at once.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">The high amount of memory the Desktop Windows Manager requires may affect other programs. This is resolved by shutting down the file when not in use. Although Dwm is a not a virus, it's possible that a malignant virus may hide
 in the same file name. It's important to keep your anti-virus programs up to date to avoid potential infection.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If the amount of memory the Dwm.exe program uses is comprising your operating system or other running programs, the application is easily disabled. First, determine the amount of memory the program is running by opening the task
 manager and locating the Dwm.exe file under the Processes tab. If memory use is high and seems to be affecting your computer, open Control Panel and under "Services," click the "Desktop Window Manager Session Manager." There, you will be able to enable and
 disable the program as needed.</font></span></p>

            <p>as in Windows+L locked. or Power Options after 20min locked. As soon as the displays are switched off DWM goes haywire. Or probably the AMD Catalyst display driver. Yes, I have the latest version installed. Just checked.</p>

            thanks Srihmadwah
<div><br />
<div>Good advice to run a virus scan. Thought of that myself and already did that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The other thing I tried is roll back display driver. The problem happens when screens are switched off.</div>
<div>Maybe I should refrain from the blank screen power setting.</div>

            <p>Microsoft Windows 7 Home premium is the system I am using with a duel processor.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The problem seems to be in all of my copied or transfered files in my .wpd documents and it also has my personal files connect to my web browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I also do not know how to stop this either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The exact error message is:Error 0x80070057: The parameter is incorrect.&nbsp; The Microsoft tech, Jonathan Esperon, said that it came from a music download on the Mixrosoft software.</p>
<p>&nbsp; This error message is now not allowing me to transfer my personal files to the new user I had to set up to access my other word perfect files and causes my wordperfect software to freeze up in the middle of a sentense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Microsoft troubleshooter says&nbsp;it cannot continue because an error is stopping them from troubleshooting&nbsp; and they are trying to find the problem and fix it ,but then&nbsp;cannot fix it and will have to close the program&nbsp; and shut down.&nbsp; If Microsoft finds
 a solution they will contact me.&nbsp; This has never happened for over 8 months now and everything I did not get a chance to save is lost.</p>
<p>This error is literally making me "bonkers" and I do not believe I can put up with this Microsoft err that they themselves cannot fix without me now paying a tech do do it.&nbsp; Mr. Esperson who found where the error was comming from said he could fix it if
 I paid him for his time.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>This was on the FREE tech support that I have with the purchase of my new HP- Compaq Persario that I purachased from Best Buy last year around July of 2011.</p>
<p>The "Geek" Squad of Best Buy had me bring my computer back nd they worked on it, but only made the problem worse as they too transferred this corrupt file and it spread throughout&nbsp; my computer again.&nbsp; Best Buy then gave me a new replacement Computer at no
 charge.</p>
<p>Microsoft three times took control of my computer to fix it, HP Techs three times took control of my computer to fix it and each tech again reproduced this file through out the new replacement.</p>
<p>Then I thought that it was a wordperfect software problem and called Corel; after about three times when three different techs took control of my compouter to fix it, one tech found the problem and fixed it , but this was in only ONE file and by now this
 error was in several hundred transferred files through out my computer.</p>
<p>When I tried to cut and past all user files into my main usser files, this error stopped me and now I AM LOST.&nbsp; I just don't know where to turn and reformatting my hard drive AGAIN will not work as it did not work before and I lost more than I gained.</p>
<p>PLEASE can someone help me, without it costing me an arm and a leg.&nbsp; They wouldn't get very mush because I am unable to walk much and my arms are really only good for typing.&nbsp; Ha Ha.&nbsp; I hope I can type.</p>
<p>One thing I do know, is that I am not a tech and do NOT know how to fix this or type&nbsp;any type of tech &nbsp;command.&nbsp;

            Hey The One and Only Granny!
<div><br />
<div>Good for you fixing your grandparents computer. I have be told by those I look up to you cant consider yourself a master at something until you explain in to and teach the past generation. Off topic but I felt it was worth adding.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a few questions that if you should need further assistance, should help us to help you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1.In the original question you said you spread this error (<span>0x80070057</span>&nbsp;is the error I am assuming you are&nbsp;referencing) when you tried to log into her computer. Were you logging into the User Profile,
 your Outlook Account, your Live account? Please clarify. Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2.This may be less of a question more of a&nbsp;statement, your comments on shutting down browser, locking up system, security software not working correctly, signs are really pointing to a Virus or Malware of some sort. Check the thread below, and refer to
 Brian-'s post, he gives a great guide:</div>

<div><br />
<div>As for the exact error code&nbsp;<span>0x80070057 this thread here was never marked answered, but the most recent post has a list of great troubleshooting steps:</span></div>

<p><span><span><span>You might have noticed that in
<span>Windows&nbsp;7</span>, web restrictions and activity reports aren’t included in Parental Controls. You can still restrict the sites your kids can visit and see reports of their online activity by adding a service provider in

Windows Live Family Safety</span>. With <span>Family Safety</span>, you can set up web filtering and activity monitoring for your kids, and decide who your kids can communicate with in

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>The Family Safety Filter monitors your child’s computer activity and filters the content they can see on the web. It needs to be installed and set up on each computer
 your children use. To see if you already have the Family Safety Filter installed on your computer, click the

            <p><span>Hi Mohan,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From the description, I understand that you often get an Error box on your computer with "WerFault.exe Application Error with the message 'The instruction at 0x7cdc0080 referenced memory at 0xffffffff. The memory could not be read'.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. <span>&nbsp;</span>Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to your computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>2. <span>&nbsp;</span>When do you get this error message?</span></p>
<p><span>3. What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Memory Error usually comes up if a program tries to access the memory location for which it does not have access.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It could be because of malware as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are using Lenovo Computer and have installed the following software, then go ahead and uninstall them.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Lenovo energy management<br />
2.One key theater</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
