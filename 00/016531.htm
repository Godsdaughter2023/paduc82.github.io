            <span>Hi Chuck.Bauer,<br />
<br />
Before giving the exact answer, I’d like to confirm what the business and personal account referred to. If you have an Office 365 for Business account (business account) and a personal Microsoft account (personal account), it is not feasible to login to Skype
 for Business with the personal Microsoft account. <br />
If you have two Office 365 accounts, one is used for business purpose and the other is used for personal purpose, and then you can use both the two account in Skype for Business. However, it is not feasible to sign into both the two account at the same time
 on one computer using the Skype for Business client. You may use one account in Skype for Business client and the other one in

<h2>            MSO.dll file preventing Outlook 2007 from running</h2>
                    Suddenly, Outlook 2007 won't start due to some mso.dll file that is incompatible with this version of Outlook.&nbsp; I've uninstalled every Microsoft product except Windows, ran various software fixes like registry cleaners and anti virus programs, rebooted
 and reinstalled Office 2007 and still Outlook won't work.&nbsp; Word and Excel work fine, but Outlook won't.

<p>Thanks, that did not work, so I kept going at it. &nbsp;I uninstalled Office 2007 again, cleaned up the registry and rebooted. &nbsp;Then I had to delete the entire Microsoft Office folder in the Program Files and reinstall Office again. &nbsp;I rebooted, ran software
 update, and that seemed to fix the problem. &nbsp;Not sure where that mso.dll was located, but I think I deleted it so a fresh copy was installed with Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for answering my question, though. &nbsp;I appreciate it.</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 Excel download - Open fails, Save works</h2>
                    <p>Our users recently started reporting an issue that prevents them&nbsp;from opening a dynamically generated Excel file from our website.&nbsp; The error only occurs in IE, and only if the user selects "Open" rather than "Save" when prompted.&nbsp; If the user clicks Save
 they can open the Excel file without an issue, if they click Open the Excel file throws the error "Can't open pivot table source:..." and it lists the URL of the file that was downloaded.&nbsp; What's strange about this error is that the downloaded file is a static
 spreadsheet.&nbsp; The Pivot table in the spreadsheets uses another tab of the spreadsheet as a source.&nbsp; The spreadsheet contains no external connections or references to URLs in it.&nbsp; We have been trying to train users to click Save rather than download, but the
 problem is causing a lot of confusion.&nbsp; Please let us know how we can prevent the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some additional information - it appears this only happens if the URL used to download the file contains a query string parameter.&nbsp; For some reason in those situations Excel is actually changing the pivot table source range.&nbsp; So the source range of the pivot
 table is something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SourceSheet!$A$1:$Z$1000</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if the URL of the downloaded spreadsheet contains a query parameter, either IE or Excel is changing the pivot table source range to something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'https://localhost/downloads/[somepage?somequeryparam=x]SourceSheet'!$A$1:$Z$1000</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the added brackets, this is of course not a valid URL.&nbsp; Why is IE or Excel altering the spreadsheet in the first place??&nbsp; Definitely seems like a bug?&nbsp; Can you please confirm?</p>

<p>Hello BatGa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience and tests, it is not feasible to meet your requirements. The article you provided is old and I tested it in Outlook 2016. It failed to display emails from trusted senders in HTML. As a workaround, you can click
<strong>We converted this message into plain text format</strong> above the message's content and select
<strong>Display as HTML</strong> from the menu that has appeared. Or you can just display all the emails as HTML.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I invite you create a new vote in Outlook UserVoice forum for feedback. Microsoft pays high values on customer’s feedback. Please click on the following link:

<h2>            Windows takes wrong monitor color profile when switching monitors</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Pretty annoying for photographers, has been there for ages already and is not done with the latest patch as of today. Had this on different machines with different graphic cards.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>Prerequisit:<br />
Have a two monitor setup, both with color profile in Windows, as system wide setting. I use a laptop plus external monitor.</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>1. Extend screen from laptop to external monitor (extend, not just mirror) (Win + P)<br />
2. Set the external monitor as primary screen (important)<br />
3. Set DIFFERENT color profiles for laptop and external monitor as system wide settings<br />
4. Now (Win + P) and display just the external screen. Laptop off, external monitor on.<br />
5. Open the advance color management settings. Reload the color calibration profile.</p>
</div>

<div>And boom, windows takes the color profile, the laptop one! Set the external monitor profile as the color profile for the laptop screen and reload to proove that it takes the wrong monitors profile.<br />
Now click to identify the screens. Strangely windows identifies the external monitor correctly, it just takes the color profiles from the first monitor.</div>

            Still happening in 2017, in Windows 10. As far as I understand, the problem exists since Windows 7. Is there a way we can submit a bug report to Microsoft? This forum seems useless in providing help.

            This is an odd error that I haven't seen in quite some time. Last time it was reported was for Entourage. Do you have a message in the Outbox that's too big or corrupt? Test one message at a time for sending.
<br />
<br />
Error -108<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error -108 (not enough memory)<br />
<br />
1. Upping memory does not seem to help. One user reported this error started after updating. The update put new language encodings in the system folder without removing the old ones. Remove the old ones manually.<br />
<br />
2. The following has been suggested as a fix if the problem occurs when trying to receive mail:<br />
<br />
The problem is caused by a bad message.<br />
<br />
Open Tools/Accounts/that account/Options. Check Allow online access. Now you'll see a server account for the account in your Folder list. Go to it. You're now looking at the messages on the server. If you know which is the problem message (the oldest one there
 if you don't normally leave messages on the server, or the oldest one with a jagged icon indicating not downloaded otherwise), turn off the preview pane in View menu (or command-\). Select the bad message and delete it. Now everything will be fine - send &amp;
 receive all.<br />

<p>Select Properties from the context menu.</p>
<p>Activate the Previous Versions tab (if present).</p>
<p>Locate a version from before the defrag, then click Copy to copy that version of the folder to another location (I assume that you don't want to restore the entire folder - you'd lose all other changes)</p>

<h3> crummo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Save email to client folders - multiple users</h2>
                    <p>Office 365 Business Premium </p>
<p>Rather like a normal file folder structure, we would like to have an email folder for each client. All members of staff will need visibility and access to save copies of emails sent to, and received from clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's 5 members of staff all with different email addresses saving emails into a 100 or so client folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have considered using shared file folders outside of Outlook but this presented two issues
</p>
<ol>
<li>Emails with the same subject throw up file name duplication and so have to have their name changed</li><li>Messages do not display necessary data to make sense i.e. sender, date, time, etc. and also message content preview</li></ol>
<p>We have also considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Archive; does not work as that creates an archive per user.</li><li>Archive for a Group; does not work because we need to group by client not by Group.</li></ul>
<p>I am aware of various programs and services that can achieve this and also add additional functionality such as archiving and compliance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a best practice etc. for achieving this using the tools available within Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, it is suggested that you use Shared mailbox to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Shared mailbox is a mailbox without a user. In other words – it is a mailbox to which many users have access and can send/receive messages. It serves best as a common contact mailbox, such as support
 team email or sales representatives general address. Therefore it is very often that each company department has its own shared mailbox with designated users or groups that have access to them.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Meanwhile, you can set up some rules to meet some specific conditions, please refer to the two articles below:</span></p>

                    OK so I just got blocked out of my Hotmail account meaning I don't have access to my Xbox live account or my Microsoft account meaning I essentially just lost over 300$ worth of games and software. Yes I know I can recover it with my alternate email unfortunately
 I was in the midst of switching that email to my phone since that email is obsolete so that recovery route is not an option. Yes I understand I have to fill out a form to recover my account unfortunately I made this account like TEN years ago when I was like
 TEN YEARS OLD so sorry if I cannot remember who I thought my childhood friend was TEN years ago. And no I do not know the subject of my most recent emails because I receive up to 100 junk emails a day. Yes I understand that this was mostly my fault as I should
 have updated my information but that does not excuse outlooks lack of customer support or their current awful automated system for recovering emails. I have failed to fill out the form twice now and I've contacted x b

            <p>Try putting a piece of paper or thin cardboard over the touchpad and see if the problem is fixed. Many people, myself included, tend to drag their right thumb on the keyboard. On a laptop with a center mounted touchpad, this causes the mouse to jump around.</p>

<p>If the paper works, you can try adjusting the Touchpad sensitivity in the Control panel.</p>

            ee, you really should start a new question. Since the question was marked as answered by the original poster very few new people will look at it. Only those of us who originally replied will see your question.&nbsp; By posting a new question you can provide
 us with all of the background information.<br />
<br />
ee, the "cursor" is an electronic image. It can't "stick". If it doesn't move, then the computer is not getting an input signal to move it.&nbsp; This is one spot where "getting a bigger hammer" and hitting harder is not going to work in the long run (no matter
 how satisfying it feels). You will just end up breaking the crappy plastic keyboard components and effectively killing your whole laptop<br />
<br />
Is the problem that the cursor is not moving or that it is jumping around as in the original question.<br />
<br />
The mouse pointer and the insertion point indicator are 2 different things, which one are you having the problem with?<br />
<br />
ee, I've been a touch typist for many years and I found that my thumbs do drag or at least bounce "randomly" on the touchpad that is located directly under the spacebar.<br />
<br />
If you have an issue with not enough USB ports, the fix is cheap and easy!&nbsp; Buy a USB splitter. They only cost $5 and up.&nbsp; The reality is that most devices do not use the USB port full time so it is entirely reasonable to use a splitter to connect multiple
 devices. <br />
<br />
A simple TEST is to plug in an external keyboard and mouse to see if the problem goes away. If it does, then you know your problem is with the built in physical keyboard device.<br />
<br />
If the test indicates the problem is with the built in keyboard, turn off the power, turni it upside down and running the flat of you hand over the keyboard. The idea is to shake lose any dustbunnies and other nasties that may be living under the keys.<br />

<h2>            Wifi network problems with Samsung Omnia</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just purchased a Samsung Omnia and am very keen to get my wireless internet set up so i can surf the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is that the phone says it is connected to my wireless router (which is a Belkin). However, when i click on the internet icon, it says "network problem".
</p>
<p>Could you please explain what i need to do to get it up and running?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            <span>I have the exact same issue that Bananspnk has. My wifi completely dissapears for no apparent reason. The Wireless Connection Manager wont allow me to turn it On or Off depending on when the phone lost the
 wifi. The actual Wifi button under settings just takes me to the Network Connections tab with the Wireless tab completely missing. I spent 45 mins on the phone with Verizon Tech support, of which the conclusion was to Hard Reset the phone. Then 3 hours later
 it mysteriously dissapeared again. So I once again did a Hard Reset this morning and am waiting to see if the Wifi just dissapears again?<br />
<br />
I have been all over the web today reading up on people with similar issues and it seems to be an unanswered question. Obviously no one is going to want to own a phone they have to Wipe clean everyday.<br />
<br />
***Edit***<br />
<br />
My phone battery currently dropped from about 1/2 to almost dead within a matter of an hour, so I am unable to put any more time into contacting Verizon or Samsung and discussing it with them in greater detail. If/When I find anything out I will re-post here.<br />
<br />
<br />
***Added Information 12/11/08***<br />
<br />
So after spending a lot of time on the web and reading every bit of information I could get my hands on it does appear that the reason the WiFi dissapears is because of the Power save. When the battery reaches a certain level it automatically disables the WiFi
 so that the battery is not drained further. While my battery was low (and plugged in) I disabled the Power Save for wifi and it immediately returned and became responsive again.<br />
<br />
It makes sense that they would add the power save feature to protect from the Wifi search draining your phone battery constantly searching for a wireless network. However if you turn off the power save and in turn forget to disable (through the Connection Manager)
 Wifi your battery life will be severly shortened.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps everyone!<br />

    <title>Licence type - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Licence type</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is small enterprise up to 10 PCs. We have bought some MS Office 2016 licenses, but it is quit expensive comparing to MS Business 365. The question is, what is the main difference between these two products and what you suggest to company, which basically
 uses Excel and Outlook and does not need any of MS Office features? What is the reason to buy standard licence for 300$ if Office 365 Business costs only 120$ per year, per user?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help!</p>

<p>365 is a subscription license type, and provided any subscription is valid it will be updated to the latest version, a stand-alone or lifetime license is for the individual PC and will not be upgraded when a later version is released.</p>

            <p>Office 2016 is a one-time payment of $300, but Office 365 is a you keep paying forever "subscription", $120 per year. So after 2 1/2 years they cost the same. After that Office 2016 becomes cheaper on a pure dollar basis. On this basis, the question is simple,
 do you plan to "upgrade" to the next version of Office immediately after it is released (normally not a good idea) or will you be more typical and wait "a while" or even skip a version altogether?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 bundles typically allow each user to install on up to 5 computers that they use at the same time.&nbsp; The license terms of Office 2016 were "improved" (actually it started with 2013) so that they now only allow install on one machine at a time. So
 if you are a "hardware happy" company where uses have desktop computers, laptops, tablets and maybe even a smartphone the 365 license quickly becomes a more cost effective deal.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When they were released together in Sept 2015 the programs in both Office 2016 and Office 365/2016 had identical functionality.&nbsp; But Office 365 includes "free" new features that are released on an irregular basis every 1 to 3 months (whenever MS feels it
 is ready to).&nbsp; These new features will not be given to Office 2016 users until a SP1 is released (if there ever is one) or in the next full release of Office, some time in the future.&nbsp; If you want an idea of the sort of changes that have been released since
 Sept 2015 this link is one of the places that MS lets people know what new functions have been added to 365: http://blogs.technet.com/b/office_sustained_engineering/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 bundles tend to have more applications than 2016 bundles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 licensing is managed through an "admin" portal web site. The administrator can assign licenses to users, recover them when person leaves the company. Admin can even buy new licenses online, cutting down lead time on purchases.&nbsp; Admin can also
 do a lot of monitoring of Office use through the "telemetry" feature. </p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has "<em><strong>improved</strong></em>" &lt;sarcasm&gt; the Office 2016 installation "User Experience".&nbsp; You now absolutely MUST provide an email address as well as the product key during the INSTALL process.&nbsp; They did this to "encourage" people to switch
 to Office 365. Most people providing technical support to businesses absolutely loathe this change. It makes installing very unwieldy.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Office 2016, you <strong>MUST </strong>manually track the product key installed on each specific machine for future re-install activation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In another "<em><strong>improvement</strong></em>", MS now only stores the last 5 digits of the Office 2016 product key in a way that users can retrieve (unlike 2010 and earlier where you could extract the full key) &lt;SIGH!&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 bundles also have several additional "free features" such as 1TB of "free" OneDrive space, and free Skype time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For business users, depending on your local tax laws, you may be able to charge the "rental" / subscription costs of Office 365 as a "current Expense", while the "purchase" price of Office 2016 is typically treated as a Capital cost that has to be depreciated
 over multiple years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both Office 365 and 2016 are now installed through the "Click to Run" (or maybe NOT run) virtual environment.&nbsp; One of the "features" of CTR is that by default it is an all or nothing installation to the C:\ drive.&nbsp; You can no longer easily do "custom" installs
 of just the applications you need. It is also a major PITA for users with small drives (like tablets with TINY 32GB SSD's).&nbsp; There is a tool you can use to customize the installs, it just takes extra work to learn how to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being CTR installations, both Office 365 and 2016 are huge bandwidth hogs, downloading much larger chunks of code during the monthly "update" process than 2010 and earlier "local installs" did through Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 <strong>REQUIRES</strong> connection to the internet no more than every 30 days (or so) to confirm your license is still valid (MS does not trust you). Office 2016 requires much less frequent internet connections.&nbsp; This is a particular problem
 for workers in remote locations with intermittent or no internet access for more than a month (a military user noted this as a particular issue for them).&nbsp; After the 30 days pass, Office 365 goes into read-only mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish, I can provide you with links to more information about administering Office 365.&nbsp; Frankly, for business users who take the time to learn about it and take full advantage of it, the Admin portal can be a major management tool, and provide a significant
 advantage over simple 2016 installs. <br />
</p>
<p>Bottom line, there are a lot more points to consider than simple purchase cost when you are trying to figure out the business costs of Office 365 vs Office 2016 licenses.

<p>Depends entirely on your tax location as to how the cost is treated.</p>
<p>It would be most unusual for a software purchase to be categorized as a capital cost, but then the US tax system is unique &amp; has its own bizarre rules.</p>

<p>I have two child accounts with time limits set. Everything worked fine for a few weeks then for one of the child accounts Family Safety records the screen time but ignores the limits and curfew times that have been set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have removed the child from Family Safety and re-added it but still this has not fixed the issue.</p>

<h2>            Installation of danish proofing tools on a us-english Microsoft Office2010</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,<br />
I am running on an us-english version of Microsoft Office 2010 with english menus and english formulas in Excel. This is what I like. But I would like to do danish spell checking. I have tried to install a language pack but it changed the menus and formulas
 into danish! This is NOT what I want.<br />
Does&nbsp;anybody&nbsp;have a hint I can use?</p>
<p>Best regards, <br />
MrPloops</p>

<h2>            Home Media Server</h2>
                    Hello. The home media server included with the Nokia Nseries CD unfortunately crashes a lot and it cannot check for updates. Also, I cannot type any text in any other window unless i shut it down completely (minimizing does not help). recently i upgraded
 my Nsries PC Suite to Nokia Ovi Suite, unfortunately the Home Media Server application was not included in the upgrade and got deleted.I tried searching everywhere for it, but all the links on the Nokia sites forward me to unavailable or missing pages. Does
 anyone know a link that works?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>but I do have home media server because it came with my nokia installation CD, (with my NSeries PCSuite)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am wondering, isn't there any kind of update for it? it crashed a lo ton xp, still more on vista, and the same on windows 7.. Why does Nokia include a non-working application if there is no support for it? &nbsp;I checked ur link.. It is a link to download
 ovi suite.. I already have it...</p>

<p>I upgraded my Nokia Home Media Server by downloading and installing Simplecenter 4.2 (available at several download sites, just google for it). When I switched on Home Media Server on my N95-1, Simplecenter recognised it immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can now&nbsp;browse files on my PC from my N95-1, select a photo, video or music file and play it on the phone. (Remembering to select Options - Play On Device, otherwise the file details appear on my phone but it actually appears/plays on the PC!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Operating from the PC doesn't seem to work though: I can't get Simplecenter to show the files on the phone. If I&nbsp;select Device&nbsp;- Copy From Device (which should produce a list of files on the phone), Simple Center scans and then tells me I have "0 items",
 - whereas in fact my phone has over 2000 tracks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is rather slow&nbsp;at finding files and to transferring them. It is unable to connect to the internet (to access Simplecenter's Music Store and find the list of supported devices).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do wish Nokia would solve this connectivity&nbsp;problem by&nbsp;releasing their Home Music Manager device which streams over wi-fi, connecting your phone to your hi-fi, TV, PC and the internet. This device has been shown in Nokia's online store for over a year,
 unpriced and unavailable.</p>

            Of course it is available. But I was looking for the official (legal) version. Either from Nokia or from Universal Electronics. But all the links on Nokia's sites are dead and Universal Electornics homepage:
<a href="http://www.ueic.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.ueic.com</a> returns an error.

<p>The upnp media server at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.simplecenter.net/nokia/devices.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.simplecenter.net/nokia/devices.html</a>&nbsp;is legal freeware and seems still to be the best one can get for this purpose. Windows Media Player under
 Windows 7 does not connect to the Nokia N95.</p>
<p>It works under Windows 7 32 bit. Does anyone know if it also plays under Windows 7 64 bit?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype to Skype calls are free - but to call a mobile or landline directly from Skype, you need a little
<a href="http://www.skype.com/go/skypecredit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype Credit</a> or a
<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">subscription</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The price you pay depends on the country you're calling <strong>to</strong>, not the country you're calling
<strong>from</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when a Skype contact has a landline or mobile information under their Skype profile,&nbsp;the system will ask you for a Skype Credit or a subscription. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps! Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

Connect phone in "Mass Storage" right click on Mass Memory drive icon in windows &gt;Properties&gt;Tools&gt;Check for errors.<br />

if this doesn't help Back up ur data from memory card and format it, then manually copy only ur music files back to mem card, disconnect and see if this helps, otherwise try another memory card.<br />

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. I tried checking the mass memory disk but no errors were detected.&nbsp; So I copied everything on there, formatted it then copied everything back. It fixed the song list. Except for a few songs that couldn't be copied for some random
 reason. Anyway I went to delete the songs I had doubled. But they are not actually doubled. They are different songs to what they say they are. Like just say song 1 is doubled. I click either one and it says are you sure you want to delete song 6. So I switched
 phone off and back on. Then looked at song list it is gone again after P. What I will do is Tuesday I will take it in to the store and ask them because its only a few days old and its not on a memory card it is internal memory (as far as I can figure out anyway)</p>

<p>I just had the same exact Issue. This is casued by spyware/malware. So you will need to clean using some malware/spyware software. Then follow the steps below</p>
<p>Right Click on on the Internet Explorer icon</p>
<p>Left Click on properties</p>
<p>Click on the connections tab</p>
<p>make sure that the proxy server box has no checks and everything should be blank/unchecked on the page</p>
<p>Hit OK and hopefully you are back in business!!!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Since when are you facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Do you remember making any changes on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Disable Antivirus\Firewall temporarily and then check for the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Note: Please make sure that you enable the antivirus software after performing the test to keep your computer protected.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
<br />
If you still come across the issue, put the computer in a clean boot state and then check for the issue.<br />
a. Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or
 in Windows 7:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps.<br />

            SIMPLE ANSWER!<br />
<br />
HOME AND STUDENT does NOT include Outlook.&nbsp; Your product key activated Word, Excel Powerpoint and Onenote&nbsp; applications. You still have the unactivated free trial of Outlook. No surprise Outlook doesn't work.<br />
<br />
You bought the wrong license. To get Outlook, you need Home and Business.&nbsp; You have 2 options, return H&amp;S and buy H&amp;B or use the Anytime Upgrade to upgrade to H&amp;B<br />

<b>I have Office Home and Student. I Need Outlook. Now What? – Anytime Upgrade</b>
<p><span>You will have to buy Office 2010 Home and Business to get Outlook.</span></p>
<p><span>If you start with Office Home and Student and realize that you need Outlook, you have 3 options:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Buy standalone Outlook to add to Home and student</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Buy Home and Business full bundle</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Use Office Anytime Upgrade offer</span></p>
<p><span>Pros and Cons:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>The standalone Outlook does not integrate with Word in Home and Student, and it is the most expensive combination.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Buying Home and Business is better price wise, especially since you can resell the Home and Student to someone else.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Apparently MS provides a discounted price to using Anytime Upgrade to a full Home and Student bundle</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the new and improved solution (much better than our previous advice) to your problem, direct from MS Customer Service.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Anytime Upgrade offers you a discounted upgrade between Office 2010 bundles.
</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I contacted Microsoft directly and was able to get an upgrade to Home and Business for $79.95.&nbsp; I was told that there is no way to buy it from the Microsoft store website but that you can get it through the Office website.&nbsp; (The rep said that the easiest
 way was to contact Microsoft.)&nbsp; Microsoft will e-mail you an authorization code so you can upgrade.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Dear Charlie,</span></p>
<p><span>Warm greetings from Microsoft Customer Service Australia and New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><span>Based on our recent phone conversation, here's the step by step instruction of upgrading the Office Home and Business 2010 to Office Professional 2010.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the start button</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click all programs</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the Microsoft Office folder</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the Microsoft Office 2010 tools folder</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on office anytime upgrade</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>You'd be routed to a new window so click the "buy Microsoft Professional 2010 link</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>You'd be routed to another window, just click on the "upgrade now" link for $220.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Just follow the prompts and you should be good to go.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope I was able to address your inquiry to your satisfaction, should you have further questions, relating to this inquiry, please don't hesitate to contact us back.</span></p>

<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is another similar story:</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>I went to Office Anytime Upgrade under Start Menu
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Made payment for Office Home &amp; Student &gt;&gt; Home &amp; Business upgrade ($120)</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>After payment, a box with an "Install" button came up. I wasn't given the opportunity to save the download. I was given a new Product key.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>I clicked Install &amp; it installed (or upgraded?) to Office 2010 Home &amp; Business</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>I ran Excel &amp; Word, and the "non-commercial use" was no longer there</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>However, under my Control Panel / Uninstall Programs, there is only 1 office installation - Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2010; there isn't any Home &amp; Business.</span></p>
<p><span>My main intention in upgrading was to get rid of the "non-commercial use", so it turned out ok. But is there anything wrong that I did? Why does Control Panel show Home &amp; Student? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the “old” advice as an alternative.<span>&nbsp; </span>Consider it based on the upgrade price they present you.</span></p>
<p><span>You have to buy a product key that is valid for Outlook. </span></p>
<p><span>The simplest apparent solution is to buy Outlook standalone for roughly USD$140. However, I have been told that this may not be the best overall approach for a couple of reasons. The obvious reason is that you'll have to manage 2 separate Office installations:
 separate install files/CD's and separate product keys. The other reason I've been told about is that when you install a standalone Outlook it does NOT fully integrate with the existing H&amp;S. Apparently spell checking dictionaries are maintained separately and
 a few other things.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do the math, retail H&amp;S has list price USD$150. Standalone Outlook has list price USD$140. Home and Business is USD$280. So, if you have the option, buying H&amp;B makes best sense all around.</span></p>
<p><span>If you bought the Retail/"FPP" license for H&amp;S, you have the option of uninstalling it and reselling it to someone else. If you have an OEM or Product Key Card license transferring the license to someone else is NOT an option.</span></p>
<p><span>PS: prices assume Retail/"FPP" license (my only recommendation). The product key card name "equivalents" are slightly cheaper on the surface. But if you understand the implication of license terms, you instantly realize that for most people the PKC
 is effectively a s*c*a*m IMO (because most people are not aware of the downsides of the the PKC when they buy it)</span></p>

<p>You haven't won.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's absolutely plain obvious scam spam that's probably been sent out to millions of people all over the world. Delete it, forget about it as nothing can be done to stop these scams. The scammers are only after your money and you will not receive any prize
 from them.<br />
<br />
Do you really honestly think that any large international company like nokia would contact you is such a way? They would never do suich a thing.<br />
<br />
All you need to protect yourself from scams like this is common sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These messages are like a bad smell, they never go away.</p>

<p>I recieved this SMS message from +35864490810: "Your Mobile# has won $330,000 AUD in NokiaFreeLotto.Ref No: NFL982. to claim send your name, Email &amp; Mobile to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although winning this sum of money sounds great (and would be a big help financially), I don't recall entering a competition (with Nokia anyway) and have read somewhere that Nokia doesn't run lottery competitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the email address sounds suspicious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just thought I'd let everyone know this scam is still around. Don't fall for it. As the saying goes 'if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.'</p>

<h2>            Creating a Save&#47;Load point of a Slide</h2>
                    <p>I am currently working on an adventure/visual novel type of game within Powerpoint.<br />
<br />
I would like to know of a method on how to "Save" &amp; "load" a Game point / Slide<br />
<br />
Currently I am contemplating on just adding a "Menu" Button to the game then adding the option to save or load a previous save point but at this part I am pretty much stuck.<br />
Searching the answer in the internet seems to have failed so I am now asking the community.<br />
Answers using Macro are fine.</p>

<p>I think you'll want to use a feature called Tags. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Simplest form:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ActivePresentation.Tags.Add "LastStoppingPoint", "42"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This adds a tag named LastStoppingPoint to the presentation; the tag's value is 42.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To retrieve the value:</p>
<p>
</p><p>MsgBox ActivePresentation.Tags("LastStoppingPoint")</p>
<p>
</p><p>How/where you'd use these commands will depend on how you expect the user to quit the game partway through and how you want them to resume play at the last stopping point vs from the beginning.</p>
