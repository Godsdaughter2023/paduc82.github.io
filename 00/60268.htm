    <title>How do I get rolling open screens back in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I get rolling open screens back in Windows 10</h2>
                    I used to be able to hit Alt Tab and scroll through open screens, including the desktop.&nbsp; Windows 10 has removed this feature, so now all I get is a static page of open items.&nbsp; While I can move through these, I can't get back to the desktop where some
 applications are seated, ones that can't be pinned to the taskbar.&nbsp; In order to get back to the desktop I have to close, shrink, move, slide, click, open things.&nbsp; Is there a way to get the ALT Tab rolling scroll function back.&nbsp; 10Q.

            Hello
<br />
<br />My name is May, I am an Independent advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />Please try this:
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc. (If Windows is not installed on C:, substitute the appropriate drive letter.)
<br />
<br />2. Double-click hosts, and select Notepad when Windows prompts you to choose a program. If you don’t get the prompt, or if the hosts file opens in another program, open Notepad (Start, All Programs, Accessories, Notepad), and then navigate to hosts by clicking File, Open within Notepad.
<br />3. Place the cursor at the end of the last line, which will say something such as “127.0.0.1 localhost” or “::1 localhost”. Press Enter to create a new line.
<br />
<br />4. Type 127.0.0.1, tap the spacebar once, and then type the address of a website you want to block. For example, to block all traffic from YouTube, type 127.0.0.1 www.youtube.com on this line.
<br />
<br />5. Continue to add the websites you wish to block, each prefaced with 127.0.0.1 and a space
<br />6. Click File, Save to commit to your changes. Dismiss any warnings from antimalware software, which may be triggered by your editing of the hosts file.
<br />
<br />7. Close any open browser windows, and then reopen a browser to test your edits. The blocked sites should not display in any browser.
<br />

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.

            Hi Joe.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It has either set itself as your browser Home Page, or become a Startup Freeloader app needing removal.  Here's what to do:
<br />
<br />1) Remove it as a Home page from your browsers if necessary in the browser Settings.  For Edge it's in Edge Settings &gt; Open Microsoft Edge with &gt; Dropdown menu &gt; delete the unwanted page then add one you want.  
<br />
<br />2)  Check all Startup programs from Step 4 in this checklist to disable it:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />3) Run a full scan with the most powerful on-demand free scanner Malwarebytes: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>.  In the Scan Settings first set it to include scanning for Rootkits.  
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.
<br />
<br />4) Check for any remainders in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, and also in each of your browser's Extensions, Home Page settings, Search service or Add-On's as shown here:  <a href="https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-Account/How-To-Disable-Plugins-Add-Ons-Extensions-In-Multiple-Browsers/ta-p/19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-...</a>
<br />
<br />5) Then check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you want to keep Malwarebytes as an on-demand scanner then you can turn off its Real Time trial version in it's Settings &gt; Account Details tab.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            How to search for an email address in the text of all files in a folder tree &#40;Windows 7 Enterprise&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I need to search the contents of files in a folder tree for email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I need to find all files which contain the string "@myorg.org"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm already set up to index the contents of files. When I search for "@myorg.org", or "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" or "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" I either get a list of no files, or almost every file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this be accomplished?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>So I was looking around on the xbox community&nbsp;blog, when I came across this article about
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/b/community_blog/archive/2011/05/13/unleash-your-figureprint-avatar.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Avatar Figure-Prints</a>. What&nbsp;they are is&nbsp;just your xbox live avatar created into a doll, which looks cool but too expensive. It has a&nbsp;$49.95 price tag, plus shipping,&nbsp;and is non-refundable. Also it is not guaranteed&nbsp;that it will&nbsp;look identically the same
 as the Xbox 360 Avatar.&nbsp;If you would like&nbsp;to know any other additional information you can check out the

<p>Hello&nbsp;sanyogbhardwaj<span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unfortunately exchanges for a controller require a registered Xbox device. It doesn't have to be a controller that came with the device however it appears you are still required to have a registered Xbox console to make an exchange/register the controller.</span></p>
<p>For more information on how to register a controller, check out <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wireless-controller-broken-wont-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Replacing
 a broken Xbox One Controller</a></span></strong>.</p>
<p>Xbox controllers are high quality and I have yet to have one break so you likely won't have an issue in the standard 90 warranty period that comes with a controller unless you're throwing it around in rage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions you may want to consider <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contacting support</a></span></strong>.</p>

            You may want to try contacting support then for that issue. As far as I know there is not a way to get it replaced without having a registered console. If you recently got it from a 3rd party dealer you might want to try and see if they will replace it
 as well.

            You can't register a controller but there is a warranty and it requires that you have the sales receipt for service/replacement.

<h2>            Recover &#40;D&#41; Almost Full</h2>
                    I just bought a HP Mini with Windows 7 (Starter). I firstly installed iTunes and my old iTunes library and then I ran a windows backup to an external hard drive. I have since noticed my Recovery (D:) is almost full. Is this something to do with my backup
 or was it likely almost full anyway?

<br />
<div>Entegy is correct: Drive D: holds the Factory Restore data. You should keep well clear of it because you will need it in case you have to perform a Factory Restore. I usually remove its drive letter via the Disk Manager so that it ceases being visible.</div>

    <title>Please wait while windows installs ... adobe acrobat, family tree - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> digging4roots  say:</h3>
<h2>            Please wait while windows installs ... adobe acrobat, family tree maker 2009, overdrive media console .... again and again and again&#33;</h2>
                    I have 3 flavors of what I believe is the same root problem. The aforementioned 3 programs, after being installed (overdrive media console) or updated (adobe acrobat pro 9 and ftm 2009) keep reinstalling.<br />
<br />
In the case of adobe, it's anytime I use the right-click in any environment or situation. For the other 2 (ftm 2009, overdrive media console), it's when ever I try to start them.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows Vista home Premium, sp2. I have tried the reg clean utility I found on the MS site. I have also tried RegCure (a program to fix install problems in the registry). Of course, I've uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times with different
 options. All to no avail.<br />
<br />
I do not have UAC turned on. I do not run any anti-spyware or anti-virus software. However, Windows Defender is running and I haven't tried turning it off (only just remembered it).<br />
<br />
I found similar descriptions (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/966963), but they were all specific to MS programs (e.g. Office, Mail, Visio) and the solutions involved changes to those programs in the registry. I failed to see how I could use those solutions.<br />
<br />
Another dialogue (http://www.vbmonster.com/Uwe/Forum.aspx/vb-deployment/1139/Please-wait-while-Windows-configures-ProductName) appears to be the same problem, but I found neither FileMon nor RegMon on my system.<br />
<br />
I also found the following article, but was unable to get the logging to work (or maybe there is no error occuring to be logged?):<br />
http://www.appdeploy.com/faq/detail.asp?id=54<br />
http://www.appdeploy.com/FAQ/detail.asp?id=73<br />
<br />
I am completely dumb founded and really hope someone out there can help me.<br />
<br />
Thank you.

    <title>Surface Pro emits high-pitched buzz noise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samuel52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro emits high-pitched buzz noise</h2>
                    <p>I have bought a Surface Pro a few months ago. It works well. However, I found that, when in use, the device emits a continuous, high-pitched humming sound, which is especially notable in a quiet environment. It really annoys me when I'm working with it and
 I start to suspect there is something wrong with the device. Not sure if it's from the speakers as it does get louder if I turn up the volume but I can't eliminate it by lowering the volume to zero.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure if other users experience the same. Would appreciate any solution to this issue. Thanks!</p>

    <title>USB Driver Issues on 7 64bit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Driver Issues on 7 64bit</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I've been having issues with USB devices I plug in acting quirky. It started a while ago, when a USB Midi controller I have stopped working. I simply switched to the USB ports on the front of my computer, and it worked on them. I thought nothing
 of it at the time (though I was incredibly confused, as prior to that, I'd seen Win7 handle USB devices/drivers remarkably better than any previous installment), and have just let it slide since. I've slowly noticed more and more issues though. My girlfriend
 later said she couldn't get the computer to recognize her camera, after installing the drivers first from a CD. I haven't bothered with that particular issue, so I don't know what's wrong there. A roomate of mine bought a Western Digital external hard drive
 to setup over the network through our router. We originally plugged it right into the router and formatted it via router firmware to be FAT32. It's worked fine on the router since, and works on every other computer (3 other computers, one running Win7 32bit,
 one running XP/Mac, and one running XP). They all have no problem detecting the drive, it's just plug and play, but for some reason, my computer fails to initialize the device. It shows in Device Manager as WD+its model number (I don't have it plugged in right
 now and it's rather inconvenient to get to), and right-clicking &gt; going to properties shows that the devices drivers aren't installed. Update now finds nothing. That was a bummer, but I put up with it. Whatever. Recently, I tried to play a few games with my
 girlfriend on the computer. We've got a couple of Afterglow Xbox 360 controllers that we've run on the computer previously with no issue. We plugged in one, it initialized fine, and was ready to roll. However, plugging in the second gave a message that it
 didn't have drivers (they've been plug and play since we got them). I tried switching the ports, trying every USB port available, changing the order in which I plugged them in, and restarting plenty of times. No matter what, one of the controls (same one every
 time) kept giving me the same error, that there were no drivers installed and Windows couldn't find any. They both showed up in Device Manager as Afterglow for 360, but the one that wouldn't work would show up in the other devices section and say it didn't
 have drivers. It really bugged me when opening devices and printers, and seeing them both side by side, with the exact same name, with one having the yellow mark next to it, telling me it doesn't work. Once again, whatever. Well today, I just bought a Logitech
 G110, and I've been having more weird problems. It works fine in my BIOS (I even sat around in it for a good 15 minutes to make sure), and even works for a minute or two upon launching Win7 perfectly. However, during that period, Device Manager shows the G110
 in device manager (twice actually, two separate names, I'm assuming because there's a lot going on in the keyboard) under other devices, and has the icon next to it like it's disabled. After a little bit, the<em>installing new hardware</em></strong><strong>
 window pops up, searches for drivers, fails to find them, and the keyboard off at that point. I've tried hitting the "skip searching for drivers" button, but it hasn't helped, just continues to search until it finds nothing. Keep in mind, I didn't even plug
 in the keyboard until after running all of the setup through the disc that was provided with it. After Windows determines it has no drivers and the keyboard shuts off, the keyboard is no longer identified in device manager (first time I've had an issue like
 that so far), aside from the USB2.0 Hub that stays in other devices. Since messing with the issue for a bit, my TVs drivers have changed (now shows up as Generic Monitor), and I've got an Unknown Device giving me a Code 28 (no drivers) message. That Unknown
 Device identifies its location as on UMBus Root Bus Enumerator.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm so stumped. I've tried everything I can think of. I've stripped the computer of all connections aside from the keyboard (no mouse, no other usb devices, switched to a monitor so I don't have dvi-hdmi hooked up, took out my optical sound... just
 power, a monitor, and the keyboard) and tried that on multiple ports, to no avail. I've tried uninstalling/re-installing the UMBus Root Enumerator, however upon trying to re-install, Windows tells me it can not find any drivers online, and goes right back
 to being an unknown device in other devices. I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling the keyboard as well. Ran an "sfc /scannow" that came back 100% clean. I want to blame the OS because it works in my BIOS perfectly fine (and every other computer in the house).
 I just updated my chipset drivers (AMD 790FX) by installing AMD's Catalyst Control Center (saw a post after long hours of searching that suggested that may help). The ports work fine for certain other devices (flash drives, USB wireless receiver, the mouse).
 I really need some help here. Any suggestions at all, or any more information I need to provide?</strong></p>

<p>Hi Speshuleddie,</p>
<p>• Have you made any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Uninstall and reinstall the USB controllers:</p>
<p>a) Click Start and type “devmgmt.msc” (without quotes) in the search box, and then press Enter.<br />
b) Expand the Universal Serial Bus Controllers section.<br />
c) Uninstall each of the devices under the USB Controller section by right-clicking on each one, and then clicking Uninstall.<br />
d) Close the Device Manager and restart your computer. Windows will automatically re-install the USB controllers in your computer, without you having to do anything further. Your computer should now run USB devices properly.</p>
<p>From the manufacturer's website install the latest chipset drivers.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Sandeep – Microsoft Support</p>

<p>You know, the issue's been going on so long, I really don't recall what changes I made prior to the issues starting. It's been going on for so long, and it started so small, it's really just now that I'm noticing that it's all been related. So yes, I'm sure
 I've made more and more changes over the course of time, but I've tried thinking long and hard about anything that I did that corresponded with the time the issue started, and I really can't think of one specific thing.</p>
<p>I'll go ahead and uninstall/re-install the USB controllers. Will come back and edit my post with the results.</p>
<p>I went to AMD's website and it was ridiculous to navigate. Half of the pages took minutes to load on a 30mbps connection, the other half didn't load at all. I just saw that CCC should contain what I want so I downloaded it just in case. Will try again though.
 Thank you.</p>

<p>Me again. Don't even know the login for that account, I assumed this would be it but I guess not. That initial computer with all of the issues is now effectively out of commission for a bit. I was uninstalling the USB controllers, and got them all uninstalled
 except for the last (uninstalling the second to last one shut off the keyboard and mouse; no PS2 mouse or keyboard). I force restarted the computer, and both the mouse and keyboard were working fine. I went in to device manager, and there was a bunch of USB
 controllers listed in other devices, most with a yellow exclamation mark, and a few with that white mark to the left of them. The installing hardware thing popped up, and when I clicked it to get the status, it said it was searching for drivers for my keyboard
 (twice), my afterglow controller (the one that was working stopped sometime mid-day), and a USB controller. Everything was working for a second, and I even got excited when it told me that the G110 and the Afterglow were installing (had not seen that before),
 but then it told me it couldn't find drivers for the USB controller, and both my mouse and keyboard switched off. Just like how the G110 was it works until Windows determines it can't find drivers.<br />
Also, don't know if this is relevant, but the two drivers it did find weren't found by searching online. It was only after it said searching preconfigured folders that windows decided it would start installing my other kb/control. Anyway, waited a minute in
 hopes that the keyboard would finish installing so that I could use the computer, but nothing happened. Force restarted again, and neither of my keyboards work, nor does the mouse.</p>
<p>Now I REALLY don't know what to do. I can't imagine why Windows isn't getting the drivers online for such basic things. I'm off to find my motherboard CD. ANY ideas appreciated at this point, as its the house's main computer, as well as my work computer.</p>

<h2>            How to set the default location of Windows 10 &#40;so that web searches  and Cortana may be more helpful on my desktop&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting a notification message swinging out from the right side of the screen asking me to 'Set the default location of your PC'&nbsp; but when I click on it nothing happens.&nbsp;The message furthermore says, "We'll use it when we can't detect your exact location

<p>
</p><p>There is only one thread that most closely matches what I am trying to find, and that message says "Change the default location reported in Windows 10 and Cortana" but that community thread doesn't seem to help the people asking and replying&nbsp;about it since
 it started almost two years ago, and goes for over 390 replies and 40 pages with no solution yet. I think&nbsp;what I encountered and asking to solve&nbsp;may be related to that thread. But I could not find any clues in that thread. I found one place somewhere in settings

                    I have C: and D: drives. C: is where Windows resides and D: is where OneDrive files reside. If I reset Windows, will I need to delete the OneDrive files or will OneDrive match the files upon location change during set up?

            Hi W,
<br />
<br />I’m OneDrive Independent Advisor. You can the files on your D drive.
<br />Once you reset windows and install One Drive app, just be sure to change the location to D drive where are your OneDrive files.
<br />
<br />If you forget to do that on the first set up, The OneDrive sync client automatically takes over syncing in the same folder location you were using before. To choose which folders you're syncing, right-click the blue cloud icon in the taskbar notification area, and select Settings &gt; Account &gt; Choose folders.
<br />
<br />More information in this link:
<br />
<br />Get started with the new OneDrive sync client in Windows

            Right, I know how to do it. But will the OneDrive files on D: match the OneDrive files in the cloud? The last time I did this, OneDrive appended _1 to the names of the cloud files and redownloaded them so I had a duplicate of each file.

            Hi W.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When you sign into the new install it will walk you through OneDrive setup again including where you want the files located.  <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3256907/microsoft-windows/how-to-use-onedrive-in-windows-10-to-sync-and-share-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3256907/m...</a>
<br />
<br />A better method than relying on the buggy Reset is to save a System Image backup of the install to your data hard drive so that if it becomes irreparable you can restore C from booted media and the stored image in 20 minutes and the links are all held in place.  
<br />
<br />Use this free imaging program which is the choice of the experts:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 10 update 1709 problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fungus55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update 1709 problems</h2>
                    I have an older Lenovo S20 Thinkstation (Xeon W3550 processor) running Win 10 pro 64 bit I started out with win 7 but upgraded to Win 10 about a year ago and let windows update automatically.&nbsp; All was well until the latest major&nbsp;update - 1709.&nbsp; After this
 windows could not find a display driver for my NVIDIA controller and reverts to a "Generic Non-PnP Monitor on Microsoft Basic Display Driver" which does not give me the full resolution my monitor can support.&nbsp; My system also freezes frequently for a few seconds.&nbsp;
 I have been unable to find win 10 drivers from lenovo&nbsp;or nvidia; windows support staff have also been unable to find working drivers; they suggested I&nbsp;revert to Win 7 or 8.1 or get a new PC.&nbsp; Any suggestions???<br />

            Hi fungus55, which nVidia card are you using, that model comes with one of the following devices:
<br />
<br />NVIDIA Quadro FX380 256MB PCIe
<br />NVIDIA Quadro FX580 512MB PCIe
<br />NVIDIA Quadro FX4800 1.5GB PCIe
<br />NVIDIA Quadro FX1800 768MB PCIe
<br />NVIDIA Quadro NVS290 256MB PCIe
<br />ATI FirePro V5700 512MB PCIe
<br />ATI FirePro V3700 256MB PCIe
<br />ATI FirePro V7750 1GB PCIe
<br />
<br />Right click your video card, choose properties
<br />On the Details Tab, change 'Property' to 'Hardware Id'
<br />Right click the top item in the resulting list and select 'Copy'
<br />Paste that line here, and I will see if I can find a solution for you . . .

            Hi Fungus.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot find a Driver from the Lenovo Support Downloads web page for you exact model, or the Nvidia Driver scanner here:  <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>,
<br />
<br />then you may need to go back to Version 1703 either using the Go Back to old Version at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery, or doing the Clean Install using version 1703 media downloaded from here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Others have had luck rolling back the Display driver from the one given.  But Basic Driver is only intended to be a Placeholder so it means either the Upgrade was dysfunctional or came up blank.  Try the roll back anyway if you can't find other drivers from Lenovo or Nividia.  I'd also ask in the Lenovo Forums.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm Curtis, I hope I'm not doing something wrong with asking this question here.&nbsp; At our library system we sysprep our computers for deployment of an OS image.&nbsp; We're using Windows 10 Pro now.&nbsp; Every time we have an update for Windows 1703 and now 1709 Fall
 Creators it fails.&nbsp; The nags popup for us to update and no matter what we try it always fails.&nbsp; I've downloaded the MediaCreator tool, Windows10Upgrade9252 and Windows 10 Update Assistant and nothing works.&nbsp; With over 50 attempts to upgrade on my computer
 alone and with staff getting frustrated with the nags about updating is there any solution other than a clean install?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>I am having the exact same problem ... I've lost count how many attempts but at this point in terms of man hours its about 2 weeks work -recovering from the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My video card gets removed, my network connection also gets turned into a public labelled one but that's assuming I can boot. There is a list of missing files that varies and crashes me.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
The error message, "<strong>Windows Update Standalone Installer. The update is not applicable to your computer.</strong>", that you're receiving when trying to install
<strong>KB4022716</strong> update might be due to these common reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Update is superseded</strong><br />
If the update that you're trying to install already has a newer version of the payload on your system.<br />
</li><li><strong>Update is already installed</strong><br />
If the update that you're trying to install was previously installed, for example, by another update that carried the same payload.<br />
</li><li><strong>Wrong update for architecture</strong><br />
If the update doesn't match the architecture for your CPU.<br />
</li><li><strong>Missing prerequisite update</strong><br />
If you are missing a prerequisite update.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that, have you checked if you have previous updates that failed to be installed?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, you can download the <strong>Windows Update Troubleshooter </strong>
from this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/512a5183-ffab-40c5-8a68-021e32467565/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Select the sub-link entitled, "<strong>Download troubleshooter
 for Windows 10</strong>" to download and run the troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, let's <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset Windows Update components</a></strong> for further troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
You can also consider manually downloading the Windows update you're trying to install from the
<strong><a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4022716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update Catalog</a></strong> if the issue occurs.<br />

<h2>            Installed Windows 7 and cannot open or access Word, PowerPoint,iTunes, Adobe, files.</h2>
                    I installed Windows 7 on my computer and went to open up a MSFT PowerPoint presentation and nothing came up (not even the PowerPoint application).&nbsp; Then I tried MSFT Word and Adobe, and the same thing occurred.&nbsp; I have access to the Internet and some applications
 on my computer (IE8, Outlook).&nbsp; The problem just seems to be with Word, PowerPoint, Adobe, et al.

<h2>            Windows 7 64bit CPU Usage &#43; Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>I noticed while downloading from any source, Steam, through a web browser (tried IE and Google Chrome), and torrents (there are legal torrents) would cause my CPU to go crazy and spike to 100% for a few seconds, return to normal then spike again continuously
 while downloading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to reformat this pass weekend, (I got the laptop 14 months ago so it seemed like a good time to do it) got all my drivers downloaded from the official MSI site and loaded on a flash drive before reformatting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the reformat was complete I installed my MSI drivers and proceeded to download the plethora of window updates. The first two days went smoothly, I was able to download as much as I pleased with no effects on my CPU. It wasn't until yesterday after installing
 180+ window updates that my CPU began to start lagging when I was downloading, and today while downloading a freshly purchased game on steam it took 45 seconds for task manager to open (by right clicking the taskbar and clicking start task manager).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this issue obviously caused by a Windows Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my computer/laptop specs;</p>

            Sergio,
<br />There are two things you can try. 
<br />
<br />1.Plug in the device.
<br />2.Type ‘Device Manager’ in the Cortana/search box o and select ‘Device Manager’.
<br />3. Find ‘Batteries’ and expand
<br />4.Double click (or double tap) ‘Microsoft ACPI Complaint Control Method Battery’.
<br />5.Select ‘Driver’ and then click on ‘Uninstall’, and then ‘OK’. 
<br />6.Install updates for Surface and Windows while still plugged in.
<br />7.Then do a two button restart as follows:
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1:	Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.
<br />	
<br />Step 2:	Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both. 
<br />	
<br />	The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
<br />	
<br />Step 3:	After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.
<br />	
<br />Step 4:	Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.
<br />
<br />If that fails, try running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403723...</a> 
<br />
<br />If the above does not get you going, we need to look at your battery report. Open an administrative cmd prompt (type 
<br />
<br />cmd
<br />
<br />into the Cortana/Search field, then right click command prompt and Run as Administrator) and then type the following into the admin cmd prompt
<br />
<br />powercfg /batteryreport
<br />
<br />upload the html file it creates to your OneDrive and get a link and reply with that link here.
