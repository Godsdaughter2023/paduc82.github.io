            <p><span>Hi Jukka,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s not feasible to restore an account which is deleted from local AD and Office 365 portal after 30 days. The best practice before removing a user is to take owner of his OneDrive for Business library and then move those files to another
 location. Below is an article for your reference.</span></p>

<h2>            Disable CTRL&#43;H - Browsing history must be unavailable for user</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
we have a case where we are deploying Internet Explorer in kiosk mode (iexplore -k).<br />
The computers must be completely locked down. I use GPO to do this, the computer is a domain member.<br />
<br />
I have <strong>ONE BIG</strong>&nbsp;problem: The hot key/Keyboard shortcut "CTRL+H" must be disabled. Browsing history must not be available for the logged in user (which again all users of the kiosk is logged in as...)<br />
<br />
I cannot find a way to disable the CTRL+H keyboard shortcut for Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
Anybody out there who knows the trick?<br />
<br />
<br />
Best Regards<br />

<p>Hi <strong>Asgeir Husum,</strong></p>
<p>You can use Kiosk software itself to restrict the local user because the administrator can restrict the user in performing certain tasks.</p>
<p>You can also find other third party program on the internet and also you can use group policies.</p>
<p>You can visit the link provided below to know more about setting group policies for Windows Vista operating system.<br />

            <p>Hi magnushörkeby,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your ringtone doesn't work since the last update of your Windows Phone, is that correct ?</p>
<p>Can you check that you enabled all sounds in <strong>settings &gt; ringtones+sounds.</strong></p>
<p>You can also push on the volume button and expand the banner on the top of your screen, doing this your will see the volume for each setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing works, try to soft reset your device: </p>
<p>To do a proper soft reset, press and hold VOLUME DOWN + POWER buttons for 10-15 seconds until the phone vibrates and turns off by itself /!\ Do not Slide down to power off /!\
<br />
After the phone reboots, make sure that your date and time settings are correct. Also, if those settings are in automatic configuration, set them to manual</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, </p>
<p>Gaëtan L.</p>

<p>Hello, We have Office Education for Students and Office Education for faculty in Office 365. I wanted to know if there's a way to delete apps on the Student side that I don't want them to use/see. I actually only want them to use: Word, Excel, PowerPoint
 and OneDrive. For the faculty side everything needs to be accessible. Is this a possibility? Thanks!</p>

<p>hi jim,<br />
<br />
do you want to remove the app from the app launcher on the top-left corner?<br />
<br />
if so, you can achieve it via the steps below:<br />
1. click the <strong>app launcher</strong> icon on the top-left corner.<br />
2. hover your mouse over the app icon that you’re going to remove, then click the ellipsis on the top-right of the icon.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=dbeb9143-e18f-499d-ac1c-9e36a70c935e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3ddbeb9143-e18f-499d-ac1c-9e36a70c935e" /></a><br />
3. click <strong>unpin from app launcher</strong>, then the app will be removed.<br />
<br />
if the above is not your requirement, please share with us more details.<br />

<h2>            Still cannot edit shared calendar in Outlook &#47; Office 365 Home</h2>
                    <p>This has clearly been a long standing problem judging by this post:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been through all of the trouble-shooting sections which essentially involve removing the profile and starting from scratch and yet the problem still exisits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially - I can add/edit a shared calendar which is hosted on calendar.live.com through a browser, phone and Windows 10 Calendar app but I cannot do any of that with Outlook with Office 365.&nbsp; From what I can read in the post above, this has been an ongoing
 problem with Outlook since at least November 2016.</p>

<p>Hi Dominic Watts,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my research, I found it is a known issue that you can't use Outlook on Windows to edit calendars that are shared with your Outlook.com account, even if you've reconnected your Outlook.com account to Outlook.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To edit a shared calendar, go online to your own <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=846361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook.com calendar</a>, open Calendar for Windows 10, or use a mobile device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We totally understand your inconvenience and your concern to have this feature included. Our relevant team are working to make it possible to edit shared calendars in Outlook 2016 for Windows.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more detailed information, you can refer to <strong>I can't edit a shared Outlook.com in Outlook 2016
</strong>of the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/known-issues-with-shared-calendars-in-outlook-d6fd4f68-489c-4196-a9c2-588c5ead00b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/known-issues-with-shared-calendars-in-outlook-d6fd4f68-489c-4196-a9c2-588c5ead00b8</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your time and understanding will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Huni, thank you for spending some time researching this issue.&nbsp; I can edit the shared calendar from my laptop using Outlook.&nbsp; However, it's just my wife that can't edit it from her PC.&nbsp; We have already worked out that she can edit the calendar using the
 methods you describe above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The information contained in the article was last updated in May 2017.&nbsp; I have very good experience of Microsoft's coding capabilities and know for certain that you have the brain and horse power to fix this so why is it taking quite so long?&nbsp; How much more
 time and understanding do I need to provide you with?</p>

<p>Hi Judy,</p>
<p>I want to collect more details to identify this issue:<br />
1.&nbsp;Does the issue occur to emails sent to all recipients or some specific ones?<br />
2.&nbsp;Does it happen to internal or external emails?<br />
3.&nbsp;Have you tried sending emails to some mail system such as Gmail or Hotmail?<br />
4.&nbsp;Do anyone else encounter the same problem?</p>
<p>And please share with me a copy of the complete non-delivery report (NDR). You can reply to my private message via the following URL:<br />

<h2>            How to get Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>original title: OUTLOOK<br />
<br />
I just purchased a new Dell Computer with Windows 8, and had Office Home &amp; Student installed.&nbsp; But, now I find out that if I would have purchased Home &amp; Business I could have recieved Outlook for my e-mail.&nbsp; Is this correct, and if so, can I purchase an upgrade
 to Home &amp; Business so that I can get Outlook?</p>
<p><br />
Thank you,</p>

<p>There are no upgrade versions of Office 2013</p>
<p>You either use the MS Returns policy (If you are in North America) to obtain a refund, then order the version you require, or purchase Outlook 2013 on its own (Only applicable if you actually purchased H&amp;S)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is the issue specific to Photos app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure the latest updates are installed on your PC and that your antivirus program isn't preventing the app from running.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, some apps are blocked by Windows Firewall to help make your PC more secure. To work properly, you might need to allow an app to receive info through the firewall.

<h2>            Closing &#40;Reader&#41; app doesn&#39;t release file locks, need to kill app in Task Manager</h2>
                    <p>This&nbsp;issue was already present in Windows 8.1 but I'm reporting it here so that it gets fixed in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take the following scenario: open a (local) PDF file in Reader, then close reader e.g. using the X button or Alt+F4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you attempt to delete the file, File Explorer reports a "file in use" error. If you open Task Manager, you'll notice the Reader process is still running (though the app isn't visible among running apps, e.g. in the taskbar). Once you kill Reader, you
 can&nbsp; delete the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's OK to keep the process running so that, maybe, reopening the app is faster, but the app in such an "invisible state" must close all open files!</p>

            <p>Right-click inside the reader and some tabs will appear (like a web browser has tabs, this is similar).&nbsp; It will show all the PDF files the program has open.&nbsp; Close those and it will release the file lock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if you want, you can just use a better PDF program.&nbsp; Adobe Reader is a very popular one, for example.</p>

            <p>It seems to me, when and how apps will stay open has been an evolving process throughout Windows 8.0 and beyond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you realize you can end the Reader task in Task Manager, then restart your system and have it show up again.&nbsp; It just doesn't seem right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apps hiding the windowed environment in the Preview are one source of the Nvidia control panel situation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as you said, it has been occurring in Windows 8.1, and I have that situation right now.&nbsp; Being this close to the next OS release, whatever it might be, perhaps Windows 8.1 has been receiving updates that cause the same situations we see in the preview,
 not really sure.&nbsp; But I stopped the Reader in Task Manger and then rebooted.&nbsp; The Reader is back and I never opened it after the reboot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also seeing things like the attachment below when running the Energy report.&nbsp; My 8.1 system is currently having problems when waking from sleep and I am trying to understand why.</p>

<p>HOWEVER I can never complete them, no matter how many times I try.</p>
<p>Like today's tasks are: Little House, Lightspeed quiz, and Tutu Cool. I'm clicking on them! I'm not being rewarded nor are these tasks ever completed.</p>

<p>It looks like the system is flipping over to the next day's set of activities for the streak earlier than it is supposed to. So if you are trying to complete the tasks during that time, they don't work and don't get counted. You have to wait till it actually
 becomes the day that they are supposed to be active before they will work correctly. The new day on Bing seems to start at 2 AM CST or 12 AM PST, and yet the new activities seem to show up around an hour or two earlier than they are supposed to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are doing it when it is actually the next day when they are supposed to be active, I apologize for the mistake, but what I described has been happening to me.</p>

    <title>Setting up Gmail in Outlook 2010 &#38; Accessing Gmail from IE11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wedad khalil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting up Gmail in Outlook 2010 &#38; Accessing Gmail from IE11</h2>
                    I called MS about 2 issues I was having&nbsp;after I&nbsp;had a mishap with my google account.<br />
1. I was not able to sett up Gmail to work with Outlook 2010 as it used to do before that.&nbsp; I had used the correct recommended settings and it still didn't work. The rep was very courteous and after I consented to her remotely accessing my computer,&nbsp;she&nbsp;tried
 everything she knew then referred me to a higher level of techs who gave me a call a couple of days later as scheduled. So courtesy was not a&nbsp;problem! The new tech also tried a lot of settings and finally turned on the value "allow less secure apps to access
 your computer" in my google settings. I&nbsp;am not comfortable with that but it currently seems to be the only way to use Gmail with Outlook.&nbsp; After I hung up with this "high level" tech (who was also very courteous) I typed that phrase in the "Google search"
 and found that it's been a well known issue since 2014 at which time Google had&nbsp;started considering Outlook a "less secure" app! The reason is that MS is not using the more strict security protocols that Google requires. What really upset me is that the Microsoft
 techs, at both levels, did not know that this issue exists and have wasted their precious time and mine trying to figure it out! I also read that Microsoft is aware that this problem exists but is not doing anything to fix it, which led me wonder if MS is
 doing that on purpose- for reasons unbetold!!!<br />
2. I couldn't access Gmail from Internet Explorer 11. The first tech also tried everything she knew but couldn't fix the problem and elevated it to the higher tech level as well.&nbsp; But after I hung up with her, I went to the Internet Options and Google Settings,
 and tried various things until it worked! I can't tell what the changed settings were as things happened so fast and I don't remember what I did, but the important and laughable thing is that I, who is just computer savvy but not a real techy, could solve
 a problem while the real MS techs couldn't!!!<br />
I believe that MS should do two things to save its reputation as a good company: 1) work with Google and other companies to solve compatibility issues so that users can coordinate their work properly across these platforms. 2) CORRECTLY train, train, train,
 and again train its techs so they are aware of all the issues which currently exist, fix what's fixable and tell the customers that something is not at the moment but that MS is working on it. This would be the better way to go about it instead of wasting
 company and customers' time (4 hours of mine) and leave the clients frustrated and angry with MS. I hear my friends saying they have migrated to Apple computers because the system is easier to work with and have much less issues than MS.&nbsp; But so far I have
 stayed loyal to MS! Now I'm thinking of following their lead...<br />

<p>Hi Ramiz,</p>
<p>Quick Parts are stored in the <strong>Normalemail.dotm</strong> file in the following location:<br />
C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates</p>
<p>Based on my experience, if the <strong>Normalemail.dotm</strong> file is damaged or corrupted, the Quick Parts saved before will disappear and we cannot restore them. Such issues usually occur when the contents are not properly saved in the NoralEmail.dotm
 if we turn off the operating system before Outlook shuts down properly. Moreover, some add-ins which hold on to Outlook.exe may cause the issue.</p>
<p>So, for the best practice, we suggest you close the application completely and make sure the Outlook.exe is not in the Processes tab in Task Manager before shutting down the OS. You could also back up the
<strong>Normalemail.dotm </strong>file regularly to prevent Quick Parts from disappearing.</p>
<p>In addition, our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business Online services. As the Quick Parts is a feature in the Outlook client, if you need any further assistance regarding it, you can post to the
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook client forum</a> which a&nbsp;dedicated support channel for client related issues.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chris</p>

    <title>Copy &#38; Paste EXACTLY - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glraehn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy &#38; Paste EXACTLY</h2>
                    <p>I know before I ask that this is going to be twisted. so here is a hint, do not read between the lines but only what I type. &nbsp;Okay? &nbsp;Here we go:'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go online and try &nbsp;to learn a lot and also create a lot of reference material. The most efficient way of doing this is to search the subject we are interested in, copy it and then paste either into Excel or WORD (our choice) in exactly the very same appearance
 as is found where we copied so that we have an exact copy of the material. &nbsp;Beginning in the early days of Excel and WORD, it was MUCH EASIER to do than it is now. &nbsp;Today, it is a time eating task to copy &amp; paste information from the net and then we must spend
 hours formatting it so that it will appear almost exactly as it appeared in the very beginning on the net.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for Microsoft Office personnel to create a menu option under "EDIT" and then to "PASTE" with the option being, duplicate as copied? &nbsp;You have no idea how much of a time savings that would be. &nbsp;Saving time is critically important for when PC's
 were first introduced, they were pushed under the pretense of time saving devices for users. &nbsp;That became a laughable matter as PC's became anything except a time saver but actually became the exact opposite. &nbsp;I know, I was there before windows when we only
 had DOS and then Windows and then Office and so forth but during all of the advancements, time saving was never on the agenda and we have come far enough now that it should be an extremely high priority at Microsoft so no matter what the task, it is done in
 a manner that saves time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet another example: &nbsp;It used to be in Excel is I had two or more workbooks and I wanted to enter data into a specific cell that was located in another workbook and worksheet cell, all I had to do was go to Workbook II, pick the cell where I wanted the data
 and type in the equal sign, then click over to Workbook I, find that cell of data I wanted, put my cursor on the cell and hit "ENTER" and wham, bam, abracadabra, the data was then also in the second cell. &nbsp;At one point in time during my working career where
 i was involved in a tremendous amount of data analysis, I created an application where I had 51 different workbooks that were all interlinked to each other sharing data from various of the 50 of the 51 workbooks and the 51st workbook was the final that presented
 the analysis of all of the data. &nbsp;IF I had to do the very same thing today, it would be nearly impossible as the method today that is required to copy data from a specific cell in Wookbook I into another cell in Workbook II is so involved, I cannot even repeat
 here. &nbsp;Nearly every task that we are able to accomplish in Excel and Word, should be of a nature that we could easily type it right here from memory in our own minds without referring to a "HELP" file located some where else which is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The people involved in creating Windows, Office, Excel, WORD and on and on have forgotten what the main goal was in the very beginning (time savings) and have changed things from what was to the "new &amp; improved" way that is so difficult it is nearly impossible
 given the time restraints most are under to accomplish their job tasks to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now that I have, in all probability complicated things in this thread to a point that my initial intent is probably forgotten, let me restate it: &nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;I want to be able to copy material from the internet and then paste it either into Excel or WORD (my choice) and have the option of posting it EXACTLY as it appeared when I copied it and not as something that is not even recognizable from what I copied.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;I want to be easily in 2 or 3 steps copy data from a cell in one Excel workbook into a different cell in a different workbook without having to do more than three steps, or i.e., like it was in the very beginning instead of the overly complicated method
 required today making it nearly impossible.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;For Microsoft to create an extremely high priority among all work for "time saving" and "simplicity" to be if not #1, than not lower than #3. &nbsp;As I said, in the beginning, PC's were suppose to be time savers for users and yet they became the exact opposite
 in all cases and PC's were never intended as a method of creating a grocery shopping list. &nbsp;So, let's review what is going on, what is being done, what the priorities are and make the changes needed to get back to time saving and simplicity so we don't have
 to have a doctor's degree in order to do properly do things in Excel and Word and for that matter, all other programs employed on PC's. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely if this is done in my short remaining lifetime, I sincerely thank those who make it happen from the bottom of my heart and with every fiber of my being!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for considering what I have asked for.</p>

            <p>Yes, same old, tired computer Windows XP SP3 &nbsp;Office version? &nbsp;Well now that is a question not easy to answer. &nbsp;IF you check in Excel or Word it says Office 2003 but if you look in Program Files, you can find Microsoft Office / Media / CAGCAT10,</p>
<p>Office 11 &amp; Office 12, and Office 14 2003, 2007,. &nbsp;Then if you look in C:/Docs &amp; Sets / GR (my user dir) /App Data / Microsoft / you will find Excel11.pip &amp; Excel12.pip then there is Microsoft (2) Office (2) Word11.pip and then there is another directory
 in AppData called OfficeUpdate12. &nbsp;So now, can you tell me what Office version I am running? &nbsp;I go by Excel and Word when I click on HELP and get Office 2003 in both.</p>
<p>Then going to C:/Docs &amp; Sets / Local Settings / App Data / MICROSOFT / OFFICE /</p>
<p>12.0 / &amp; OFFICE / ONetConfig / there are two files one is a .sig &amp; one is .xml are dated 2008 and the rest of them, there is a .sig &amp; .xml file dated 3/29/15, 4/20/16 and 4/17/16.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now, can you tell me what version of Office I am using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I do apologize as I am not trying to be a smart mouthed person, just telling it like it is.</p>

            <p>IF it is still done that way, then it is done in a &nbsp;different version than I have which is 2003 and in 2003, you cannot do it that way. &nbsp;Soon I will be getting a new system, as soon as I decide what to get and then, if I can figure out what is the best version
 of Windows to get, hopefully, as you say, it will work in that system. &nbsp;What system do you know iit works that way in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in fact, let me ask here and now although not the right place, what is the vest version of Windows to run without facing a ton of problems but being as up to date as possible?</p>

            <p>Come on Bear Paw, give me some credit. &nbsp;I may be old, I may be retired, note I did not say retarded, I said retired, and I may not be up to date on the latest and greatest in hardware and software and extras, but I also am not stupid enough to put personal
 information on my machine. &nbsp;But, if I was going to put it on my machine, regardless of the version of windows, it would also be coded in such a way that you nor anyone else could even know what you were looking at if you looked at it all day long. &nbsp;I once
 published a highly confidential document in a 185 page publication that was reviewed by many of the best and not one person saw it in the form of knowing what it was nor did anyone know what it was when they did see and for a further test, it was sent to a
 government agency very use to dealing with such things and they could not find the data in the document. &nbsp;I also was assigned with developing a password system that no one could crack no matter what which I did and it was even certified by another government
 agency as being "impossible to crack" and it was, again another agency very use to dealing with such things. &nbsp;However, it was easy to read but to decode it you had to have two books that were identical in all ways. &nbsp;That is all I can say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But alas, you did not tell me what version of office I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Cortana doesn&#39;t &#34;see&#34; installed apps&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lumia 950 and a Groove music pass, but when I ask Cortana to "play x artist" she tells me to install iHeartRadio. Now, that alone is a little annoying, as the music pass should let me stream an artist anyhow (I can do it manually...). The REAL problem
 is that iHeartRadio is installed, but Cortana keeps telling me to install it. She even opens the store to download it. I've already restarted the phone, but I'd really like to avoid trying a reset or anything drastic if it isn't necessary. Any ideas?</p>

<p>This could be an error on the application. It is best if you are going to perform a
<strong>hard</strong> <strong>reset</strong> to rule out any software issues on the phone update. Take note that this method will remove all contents including application, text messages, media and other files. Make sure to

<p>
</p><p>To do a hard reset, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt;
<strong>About</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>phone</strong>.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.</p>

            Hi Raj_Raj_Raj,
<br />
<br />Firstly it better to understand do you have an account issue or not.
<br />
<br />Try to log in in account online: <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/</a>.
<br />
<br />If issue with service unavailable repeat, try to login via browser to the <a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/</a>. It seems you do not have the issue with the password, just with app and services are temporary not available.
<br />
<br />It you can logging on the <a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/</a> , below you name and account email choose option More actions and choose View inbox.
<br />
<br />This workaround helps to get an access to the inbox when outlook.com has some issue.
<br />
<br />If online you will not have issues, try to reinstall app on your device using this guide: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-email-in-outlook-for-ios-mobile-app-b2de2161-cc1d-49ef-9ef9-81acd1c8e234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up...</a>
<br />
<br />If the issue persist online regarding the password etc, better to contact the Account support: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12401/microsoft-account-get-help-by-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12401/...</a>

<h2>            Nokia 5800 - auto-rotation in Ovi Maps 3.0</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Nokia Maps 3 (without navigation). The map "auto-rotates" as i move. Is there a way I can disable auto rotation and keep map North Up at all times?</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

<p>Whenever we are moving or even standing on ground, satellite coordinates change. While walking very slowly in a straight line and while sat coordinates change, this software assumes we are turning and hence map rotates!! Imagine going on a US highway at
 about 55 miles per hour and while looking at the maps, the same is rotating like crazy again and again every 2 seconds or so, even if you were going on straight road - I can't use it on highway or even on slower roads!!! I don't understand why Nokia does not
 thoroughly test its products....&nbsp;</p>

<p>with the latest maps version, clicking the small compass locks the auto-rotation of the map on my phone. However - is there a way to manually rotate the map on a 5800... as I don't have a keypad...</p>

<p>Clicking the compass only locks north-up for a short while, then it automatically switches to travel direction - up mode again.&nbsp; This is a very well documented bug, and exists even in the latest beta from nokia betalabs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you have firmware v31.0.008 or later, then the map will automatically switch to landscape mode when you rotate your phone (assuming you have turned on the auto-turning sensors from the 5800's settings).</p>

                    <p>Cortana seems to be totally useless for me. all I can find that it does is search the Bing site. i have tried every way I can think of to use it to search for files on my PC or to access\change system settings. no matter what i say or ask it goes to the
 Bing search page and tries looking for those words or that phrase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>why don't we have a "search this PC" or "search recent files" option? why can't we have "settings" or other Windows related keywords to access Windows?</p>
<p>is Cortana really just designed to be a search engine with no Windows assistance?</p>
can we at least choose a better search engine than Bing for it to use?

            <p>windows 10 currently (as of 10240) does not have the option to change the search provider cortana uses to anything besides BING,<strong> even though this feature has been requested NUMEROUS times</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>and no i have not found a way for her to do anything useful either, it seems like she is only there to generate hype about nothing and force BING on people against their will.</p>

<p>You are not answering any of my questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, i'm guessing you just mean: "No, you can not change Cortana's search engine to anything besides Bing but MS doesn't want us to tell you that."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And are you suggesting that I troubleshoot why I can't search for files stored on my PC through Cortana's voice control function? Should that be a working function?</p>

<p>Oddly, on my Surface 3 the switch "Search online and include Web results" is missing from the settings pane. Is this something that may end up being disabled by group policy somehow? Any other reason why this setting may be missing? Below is a screencap
 of my settings. Not in the screencap are 'bing safesearch' and privacy settings', but those don't provide the option to disable web results either.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>you're late. this has already been confirmed and is not what we were looking for.</p>
<p>has long moved on to about how to totally disable the Cortana service. though most of it's processes can be stopped, even disabling through Policy Editor leaves the Cortana service running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>though the point of this thread was more of looking for a way to use Cortana to search your actual system, not the web.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think you mean 'welcome to the thread, and thank you for your vote'? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I thought posting the Cortana menu would be helpful to some. It's frustrating that this data leak channel cannot be disabled. Good luck with your fight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news: a closely related issue is VERY easy to find in the windows Feedback app. Search issues for Cortana web. It's the requests that starts with "D_mn it Microsoft" :)&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Please look it up and vote for it.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't address autocomplete though, or a complete disabling of web searching. If there's a more relevant issue please post how to find it so we can upvote.</p>

            <p>[I'll reply to myself so I don't get yelled at by GoBozo]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like you can at least get rid of Bing autocomplete bs when using Cortana, see the fourth post on page 3 of
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_search/how-do-i-disable-web-search-results-from-the-start/42a2f6e7-8fb9-4552-b1af-1e2224b97268?page=3&amp;tm=1440120792838">
this thread</a>. All that's needed is a Firewall rule to block Bing. Of course this blocks Bing everywhere, so better make sure you don't need it. Alternatively, Firewall can limit the scope to certain services and programs, so maybe there's a way to set it
 up such that it only affects Cortana.<br />
