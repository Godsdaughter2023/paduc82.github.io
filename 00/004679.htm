<h2>            How do I change the sender information in a Word email merge document and keep my email address intact for replies&#63;</h2>
                    I've created a merge document with personal information for each of our members at our country club and want to send the documents via email with the sender being identified as Oakland Hills but when our member hits "reply" to the email to complete the
 form I want the form returned to my email address.

</p><p>I am trying to send email to people and have Outlook.com show up as the address the email was sent from instead of Hotmail.com showing up to the receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mainly use the Hotmail app on my phone to send messages all of the accounts show that I am able to send email to folks using e.g. johndoe@gmail, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** etc. but johnsondoe@outlook does not show up as an option in the drop down box in the app.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the merging of Hotmail.com and Outlook.com, existing Hotmail email addresses keep the original domain, so even though you are logging in to
<strong><a href="http://outlook.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.live.com</a></strong> or any third party email client, it will still show the same/original email address.</p>

<h2>            mail merge to email not working</h2>
                    I'm trying to perform a mail merge to email. I've done this many times before the same way, but now the merge to email button is not active.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I open my form letter, open the mail merge manager, and:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>create new form letter</div>
<div>get my list (an excel file with first name, last name, and email address fields only)</div>
<div>drag the first name placeholder into place</div>
<div>preview the result</div>
<div>but under Complete Merge, the "generate email messages" is not active. Merge to printer and merge to new document works fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can duplicate this problem on two computers, using two form letters, and two data sources.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm either doing something wrong with this version, or something has changed in the version I have (14.1.4) that is not allowing me to complete this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>just to be certain, in Outlook, I have definitely added myself to my contacts, and made sure that Outlook knows who the "me" contact is.</div>
<div><br />

<div>help!</div>

            <p>Hi Haider Ijaz,<br />
<br />
We sincerely apologize for not being able to answer your concern in a timely manner. We are experiencing high contact volume at this time which has caused our delayed response.<br />
<span><br />
To rename the account to an account with country-specific domain, you need to change the country that was set up in the account. Follow the steps below:<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to <a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>https://account.live.com</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change <strong>Country/Region</strong> under <strong>Home</strong></span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Save</strong></span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go back to <strong>mail settings</strong></span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rename the account</span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose the domain name with specific country</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Renaming your account causes your sign in name to change from your existing @hotmail.com address to your new @outlook.com address. Your existing address becomes an alias of your new account so that mail delivery is uninterrupted.&nbsp; After renaming your account
 you will sign in with your new account to all services you previously accessed with your old account.</p>

            I have already tried these steps on one of my id and it got deleted. And I still didn't get the option of renaming my id to hotmail.co.uk on that particular account. After 30 days, I had to recreate that id and i had lost all my mails due to this. I can't
 risk trying this on my account because I am not even getting the option to rename to hotmail.co.uk.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I renamed it firstly to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and then again renamed it to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, which infact was done while testing and i couldn't revert back. And now when i try to rename to even a normal hotmail.com id, I get this error&nbsp;<span>You've
 already renamed this account. Please try again later..</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I have no issues login with the id. The main issue is that when i try to send an email from my iPhone it uses *** Email address is removed for privacy *** instead of my original id.&nbsp;</span></div>

<p>I have been trying this before as well and this is the error that comes up. My country has been set to UK as far as I remember. And now that I have had two renames and no option to rename before 180 days, I want to be sure that
 after 180 days I will be able to go back to .co.uk id. This is so absurd for me. When I send an email from my iPhone, it sends it through the new alias. And no one is familiar with that alias right now.&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you. Checked it says everything is running normally. I don't know what you term as temporary because I have this error coming up for a month now. I made the biggest mistake of my life by renaming my account. Now I already have had two renames and
 I have no option to rename it to @hotmail.co.uk id. I can't change my country. I have fixed the issue with my laptop by selecting the default FROM id has
<span>&lt;<strong><span>removed by moderator</span></strong>&gt;</span>. I get all the emails on the id. But I can't login
 from that id and if I sent an email from the MAIL app on iPhone, it sends it from the renamed alias. I have been trying to work this out since July. People told me to move to gmail but the problem is my id is 7 years old and I have been using it everywhere.
 Furthermore, I am not a fan of any other email service. but this issue is driving me nuts. Even if after 180 days I may get the option to rename, there is no way to rename it to
<span>&lt;<strong><span>removed by moderator</span></strong>&gt;</span>id.&nbsp;<br />
IN trying the steps that one of your colleagues had stated which included removing the old id from the alias and then try renaming, I completely lost that ID. and had to recreate it after a month. The issue I can't risk anything with this id. All my results,
 my logins, my social networking ids are created using this id. I am ready to do anything right now to get it back to login from there. I just want to be assured that after 180 days when I finally get the option to have a rename, I will be able to rename it
 to @hotmail.co.uk id that I have been using all along. Because I can't send any mail to anyone from my iPhone now.&nbsp;

<h2>            design review dwf viewer</h2>
                    <p>After trying to install auto desk design review to view and annotate DWF drawings several times the installation fails with windows 10 . It installed and worked with windows&nbsp;XP pro .
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem occurs at around the 75% installed point &nbsp;then it fails .</p>
<p>The other viewer a dwg viewer installs and works fine. Am I missing something in my driver repertoire or is windows 10 just not compatible with this&nbsp;auto desk viewer ???&nbsp;</p>

<h3> laserjeff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy&#47;Paste Function Not Working in Excel Mac Office 2011</h2>
                    <p>I've never seen this before and I couldn't find answers on the forums, so I decided to post my own question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running a simple formula (=C1/B1) that I wanted to copy and paste down a row. When I pasted the formula, however, only the values of the copied cells appeared, but clicking in the cell revealed that the<em> correct
</em>formula had been pasted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd copy the following formula from cell D1:</p>
<p>[B1: 50][C1: 25][D1: = C1/B1] &nbsp;where it showed D1 = 50%</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I'd paste that formula into D2...</p>
<p>[B2: 50][C2: 50][D2: = C2/B2] where it showed D2 = 50% when D2 should equal 100%</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me figure this out?</p>
<p />

<h2>            Outlook for Mac can&#39;t drag emails to folder with Gmail</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Outlook for Mac with office 365, version 16.20, 181202.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an outlook.com and gmail account. I'm able to drag emails into folders on the left sidebar with my outlook.com email, however I'm no longer able to do this with my Gmail accounts with the latest update (just got the new UI). Is this a bug or new intended
 behaviour?</p>

<p>Corentin, you may want to actually check the product before making those conclusions. As I mentioned in my message, until the recent update, I had been able to do this for months with this account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted the support team within Outlook. For anyone else facing this issue, turns out they are aware of the issue a fix should be on the way.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I've used the product for quite some time… I've been an MVP for Office for Mac since 2002. I'm not a paid contractor doing this on the sideline and I did check Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll see that there are other threads mentioning the same issues on the forum.</p>
<p>Up until recently, Outlook used to connect through IMAP and you were then just fine moving emails around in folders. A somewhat recent change brought OAuth support as well as calendar and contact syncing (requires a license through subscription or a perpetual
 license for Office 2019, not 2016). Since then, users have been enable to rename the Gmail folder, or move emails to the folders.</p>
<p>Microsoft is indeed aware of the limitation and they are indeed very likely to be working on implementing a better support for the folders for Gmail and Gmail-based accounts. You'll notice that this is also what's implied in Alan's reply to your original
 post.</p>

<h2>            Chat notification sounds on the newest update 8.23</h2>
                    With the previous version, when people would send messages you could hear a sound and get a banner running across the screen with the message. Now, all i receive is a badge symbol on the app icon, with no sounds or anything else. The sounds and everything
 are turned on, but it's still not working. Am i missing something or is that just how it is now?

</p><p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it is a conversation setting. Can you right click on the conversation and then click "Manage group" or "View profile" (depending if it's a group conversation or a 1:1 chat). Then, scroll down to see notification settings for that conversation. You
 may want to enable the notifications. Also there are Smart notifications, to get just the ones where they mention or quote you (this is available in groups only).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the latest version there is a Notifications button near your avatar picture. You can change how notifications work through the app in there.</p>

                    <p>GLITCH -&nbsp; using a HP mini-110&nbsp;and OS BUILD 10122 -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have installed several&nbsp;Windows 10 Builds,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUILD 10074 caused&nbsp;the first major glitch.&nbsp; The touchpad caused a major ERROR.&nbsp; The error was fixed with a driver update.&nbsp; And then the computer automatically
 installed this current BUILD 10122.&nbsp; And the error reoccurred but was somehow fixed after I pushed the computer back to the previous build and then the computer automaticly upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, now the touchpad is functioning but caused another error after the automatic
 BUILD 10130.&nbsp; I tried to re-upgrade the touchpad driver, but the major ERROR continued.&nbsp; I pushed the computer back to the previous build 10122 and the computer is functioning again.&nbsp; So, I'm hesitant to re-install BUILD 10130 because the of the touchpad error.&nbsp;
 Oh, the recent ' touchpad settings update ' caused the touchpad ERROR also, so I uninstalled the update and reset the computer back to the restore point.

            Glad you replied.&nbsp; The FEEDBACK APP isn't functioning and the INSIDER HUB APP isn't functioning; the apps appear to open and then abruptly shut.&nbsp; So, I posted the issue to the community website.&nbsp; Not certain about the apps not working, but assumed it was
 a minor glitch that might be internally resolved.&nbsp; I read a few post about the issue and many replies indicated the driver update issue was about a ??.?? 6. ??&nbsp; or ??.?? 4. ??&nbsp; driver, and that the ?6? driver was the most recent and functioning driver.&nbsp; Still
 uncertain about whether the computer will have a functioning touchpad driver after the BUILD 10130 upgrade.&nbsp;

            Installing a HP touchpad driver is the way I fixed the problem, but after the computer automatically upgrade to the most recent Build the ERROR continues.&nbsp; And sometimes updating the driver didn't correct the problem and I pushed the computer back to the
 previous build.&nbsp; So, that is the reason I've been hesitant about installing the most recent Build.&nbsp; I have upgraded to the Build 10130 but the touchpad ERROR continued and updating the drive was difficult without a touchpad and the Device Manager mouse driver
 upgrade didn't fix it, so I pushed the computer back to this BUILD 10122.

            <p>First you don't have fields on a form. You have controls that may or my not be bound to fields in a table. This is a subtle but important distinction. If you have a Control bound to an Attachment field. I'm not sure if you can limit what folders the user
 can access. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I don't like the Attachment datatype. I've tried using it and found it too cumbersome. What I do is simply store the full path and filename in a text field. I then use the FileDialog property to allow the user to select a file. You can set the
 default folder that opens. And you can check to make sure a different folder wasn't used.</p>

    <title>I&#39;m getting many duplicate emails from my POP3 account in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterclucas  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;m getting many duplicate emails from my POP3 account in Outlook 2016.</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft says this is an "emerging issue" with the latest update. When is it going to be fixed? The only way I can see to sort it at the moment is to delete the instruction to keep mails on server after downloading. But that means I can't see them on my
 iPhone once they have gone to my PC. Anyone got any ideas? Microsoft, perhaps? It was your update after all!!</p>

            <p>This issue has been solved in the March 4 update for Office 365, version 16.0.6568.2036.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get this fix directly, in Outlook choose: File-&gt; Office Account-&gt; Update Options-&gt; Update Now. If you’ve previously disabled updates, you’ll first have to choose “Enable Updates”.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating, you may receive duplicates from the mail server one last time. To get rid of these duplicates see:

<h3> bobbybox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Edge Browser does not remember it&#39;s position, and opens in a different position every time.</h2>
                    <p>There has been a previous post on this subject, but no-one from Microsoft has answered the problem. The previous post was titled " My edge browser has a mind of its own", but all the Microsoft advisor had to say about it was to say the question "did not
 give enough information about the nature of the problem", and to give a link to a page instructing people how to ask questions properly, so in a desperate hope of getting Microsoft to address the problem, I am posting this afresh.</p>
<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.5, and I like to have the Browser in the top left of my desktop, and Windows Live Mail 2012 in the bottom right. That way I can see icons for my most frequently used programs in the top right of the desktop, and my
 most frequently used document icons in the bottom left. This has worked for me throughout various versions of Internet Explorer without problems.&nbsp; However Edge opens in a different position every time, moving about the screen in no obvious pattern.</p>
<p>I have tried the "solutions" suggested by the Microsoft engineer, but they don't work. See the other post I have referred to, plenty of other people have exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system spec, if it has any relevance, which I doubt, is as follows.</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home 64-bit</p>
<p>Intel Core i7 4790 3.6Ghz&nbsp; Haswell 22nm Technology</p>

            <p><span>I am having the same issue but in my case I am using three monitors set to display as one at 5760 X 1200. I always want my browser to open in the center screen and all other browsers do that.
 They open in the exact same location they were in the last time I used them and that includes Internet Explorer when used in Windows 10. Not Edge however, it opens in various locations no matter where I set it last time. Usually it opens half way in my left
 hand monitor. This is a pain and it is becoming annoying enough for me to consider using a different browser.
</span></p>
<p><span>If I could hear that this is being worked on then I would have more patience.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Overall I very much like Win 10, one other moderate annoyance however is not having Windows Update in Control Panel. I am fine with the settings menu for quick easy changes but I expect control
 panel to including EVERYTHING, including all the options in Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>Also when I tried to summit this reply in Edge I get the "Opps something went wrong, please try again" message over and over. So hw did I post this? Easy, I went back to Internet Explorer
 for this post.</span></p>

    <title>Macros Disappeared in Macro-Enabled Workbook Excel 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlosmsal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macros Disappeared in Macro-Enabled Workbook Excel 2016</h2>
                    <p><span>I have built out and been working off of an excel file for the past two weeks utilizing VBA macros in excel 2016 (Windows 10). After opening up the workbook today I came to the upsetting realization that all my macros
 have suddenly disappeared. I am using a macro-enabled workbook and haven't had an issue until today. I have also been using VBA macros in many other workbooks over the past couple years and have never ran into this issue. I did some brief research into possible
 fixes and any solutions offered haven't been successful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Last night Microsoft updated my PC and this morning all my excel files were gone and needed to re-start the computer - it is the only thing that is different. Anyway, I would really like to recover ALL my macros.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to be disrespectful but your reply is quite naive to say the least -- when I said all my macros have disappeared i meant to say all not just the ones from that particular excel but from ALL my excel files. Every time Microsoft force an
 update it always causes major problems...this time macros from excel gone and my keyboard keys completely crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, as a precaution for all the problems that I always encounter with Windows I decided quite some time ago to not trust Windows/Microsoft so all my macros got saved on my Personal.xlsb - I made sure to have a copy of that file and then I kept it in
 my MacBook Pro computer where is completely safe. Unfortunately I can't use excel in my MacBook Pro computer when am working with XLSTAT so am forced to use my bloody HP Windows PC.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to your description, we need to confirm if you want to transfer the files to the new computer which installed Office 365, for example: Word files, Excel files.</span></p>
<p><span>If so, you can transfer the files by hard disk.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you try syncing files with the OneDrive for Business client.</span></p>

<h2>            Active Sync between two PCs &#38; Windows Mobile Device&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Have spent a few days on this problem but believe it is slightly different than all the posts I have read.<br />
I believe that there are thousands who would use this approach if it works.<br />
<br />
Situation:&nbsp;For WORK/BUSINESS, I&nbsp;use a Windows 2003 laptop with Office 2003 with Outlook on Exchange Server. (This is&nbsp;my MASTER information store.) For HOME, I use a desktop pc, Windows Vista Home Premium, MS Office 2007, Outlook 2007 which receives email from
 several POP email providers (This is my SECONDARY information store.) I also have a VZW XV6800 (HTC) running Windows Mobile 6.1. On the 6800 I receive my Pop emails as well as my Oultook work emails. All my Calendar and Contacts and Tasks are based on my work/MASTER
 information. When I log into my home pc and open Outlook it takes all my POP email accounts and takes everything off the POP ISP/servers and puts everything into my Inbox which allows me to then file and manage my personal emails locally.</p>
<p>What I want to be able to do is to use the 6800 as the broker for my Contacts and Calendar and Tasks by receiving and syncing from my Work Exchange server (which it does today just fine) and then when I plug the 6800 into my Home pc it will sync by uploading
 (?) just the Contacts, Calendar and Task items. Acitve Sync is 4.5. I have tried what I thought was the correct approach but it hasn't worked. (New to Windows Mobile and&nbsp;Data Service Phone use.)<br />
<br />
How does Active Sync/Windows Mobile Device Center know that the 6800 Phone is the Master and the&nbsp;PC is the Slave/recipient and not to take the empty PC calendar and down load that onto the phone?<br />
Can someone tell me if this is possible and how to set it up? <br />
Thank you in advance.</p>

            Hello. You are allowed two partnershps with Activesync/WMDC so that is no problem. I have&nbsp;2 PCs syncing with my device. The sync is always two-way, you change something on the PC and it syncs to the device. You change something on the device, it syncs
 to the PC. The conflict (you change an item on the PC and device after the last sync) is where you can say to sync the PC info or device info. That is somewhat directional but you can't change it on the fly and you have to remember how you have it set. I try&nbsp;to
 avoid the conflict by making all my changes on the phone. You can definitely choose your sync options. You can only sync email for one partnership. Those are basically the ground rules. And don't sync to empty outlook profile...it will erase the data from
 the phone. Oh, sounds like you want to sync business (work/exchange PC)&nbsp;and personal (home PC)&nbsp;contacts. You won't be able to keep them separate and they will merge. AS/WMDC doesn't support folder syncing.

<h2>            Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage BUT AOL browser has no problems displaying webpages on the same laptop</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
A perplexing problem with IE7 using Windows XP.&nbsp;&nbsp; I CAN access the Internet via my AOL browser using my broadband connection.&nbsp; No problems.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;go to IE7&nbsp;I get the message that it cannot display the page.&nbsp; I have tried&nbsp;various URLs&nbsp;but still&nbsp;get the same
 message.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only once have I been able to BRIEFLY (2-3 seconds) view a YouTube.com page.&nbsp;This problem surfaced when I tried to upgrade to IE8. When I tried to figure out how to fix the problem&nbsp;in IE8, I ended up removingt IE8 and going back to IE7.&nbsp; But the
 problem remains.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I cannot upgrade various software programs on my laptop because they all try to use IE.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am running McAfee Virus Scan 8.5i.&nbsp; HELP!&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try running Internet Explorer in No Add-ons mode and check if you can browse the websites, here are the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, and then type Internet Explorer in the Start Search box.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Internet Explorer (No Add-Ons). Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try optimizing Internet Explorer and check if it helps, here is the link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If nothing helps, then I would suggest you to try resetting Internet Explorer settings and check if it helps, here are the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Close any Internet Explorer or Windows Explorer windows that are currently open.<br />
2. Open Internet Explorer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Internet Explorer.<br />
3. Click the Tools button, and then click Internet Options.<br />
4. Click the Advanced tab, and then click Reset.<br />
5. In the Reset Internet Explorer Settings dialog box, click Reset.<br />
6. When Internet Explorer finishes applying default settings, click Close, click OK, and then click OK again.<br />
7. Close Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your changes will take effect the next time you open Internet Explorer.<br />

    <title>Outlook.com is blocking emails from unknown senders. How to turn - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swissmobile  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com is blocking emails from unknown senders. How to turn off&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to switch from Gmail to Outlook.com. I have currently setup email forwarding on Gmail to my Outlook.com account. Gmail is properly forwarding emails, but I'm not receiving lots of emails in Outlook.com. They just disappear. I can't find them in the Trash nor Junk folder. I've cleared my list of blocked senders and tried every possible options in the control panel, but I'm still only receiving emails from senders that are in my contacts. I've sent the Junk filter to standard and it still doesn't work. Something is blocking emails that I want. This is rather frustrating. I'm still keeping a copy of all email in my Gmail account and I have to keep checking my Gmail account for emails and any given day I have a number of emails that just don't show up in Outlook.com. 



I appreciate SmartFilter and Junk filter and all that, but if it's blocking legit emails, then this **** is broken!!!! 



Hope somebody from Microsoft can help me with this.
