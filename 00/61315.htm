<h2>            Event ID 129 - can&#39;t get rid of</h2>
                    <p>I'm having this constant problem on my Dell laptop and may be experiencing it on my current computer that I'm using as of this moment. I have already tried a multitude of solutions on my laptop, but to no avail. (See below)</p>

<p>
</p><p>What I have not tried yet is:<br />
<br />
Uninstalling f.lux</p>
<p>Running chkdsk</p>
<p>Other options I don't know of</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to uninstall f.lux because it has proven very useful &amp; easy on my eyes - I don't like bright light very much. Any assistance would be very much appreciated. Thank you<br />

                    <p>Ik heb een probleem, want ik wil graag mijn kind account aanpassen naar volwassenen account. Mijn moeder vind het heel fijn om ontrol te hebben, maar ik probeer me steeds verder los te maken. toen ik op Xbox mijn gamerpicture wilde aanpassen gaf de console
 aan dat hiervoor een volwassen account vereist is. Mijn moeder wil het niet doen en ik heb zoveel progression dat ik het echt niet kan veroorloven om alles opnieuw te doen.</p>
<p>Weet iemand hier wat ik kan doen om mijn "kinder" account aan te passen tot volwassenen account?</p>
<p>Met vriendelijke groet,</p>
<p>L. Maes</p>

</p><p><strong>Translation: [I have a problem because I would like to change my child account to adult account. My mother is very happy to have a troll, but I am trying to loosen up. When I wanted to customize my gamerpicture on Xbox, the console indicated that

            If one of you have the beta version of Minecraft available through the Xbox Insider Program/App on the Xbox One it will not let you join each other's worlds unless both of you have that version or the person who does have it goes through said program and
 de-enrolls the game from it. Try looking that up if what was suggested by the mod doesn't work. The Insider Minecraft beta is free and it shouldn't delete your world saves if you use it or happened to have had it installed. &nbsp;

<p>Did this happen previously or is this the first time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check if your friend is signed up for beta. Might cause some issues for you joining him/her as they have a different update version than you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they are signed up for beta they should unenroll from the insider app and uninstall the game for the current public version to be installed again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any worlds that was created while having beta installed will not be able to be played until the next update comes out for public. Which will be in the next week if it gets certified by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
You may try uninstalling and reinstalling sound card drivers and check.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here are the steps:<br />
a. Click "Start" and "Control Panel." Then double-click "Administrative Tools" and "Computer Management."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b. Choose "Device Manager" in the field on the left-hand side of the screen.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
c. Look for "Sound, video and game controllers." Click the plus sign (+) next to that field. This will expand a list of devices under sound, video and game controllers, which will include your sound card.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
d. Right click on your audio driver in the list and select "Update Driver."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
e. Follow the instructions and Windows will automatically search for and install any driver updates<br />

 a standard user account on my laptop running on Windows 7 Ultimate x64. &nbsp;i searched the System 32 folder, but there is no such file named Win2sys.dll. But the file is in the SysWOW64 folder. i just wanted to run the program from the standard user account without
 entering admin password. I have tried giving the user the permission by selecting security options in the properties of the program file. But it won't work. It gives me the above message. &nbsp;The program runs well on administrator account. &nbsp;Can anyone help me
 find a solution to fix the problem.

            <p><span>Hi Kantharuban Kailasapathy,<br />
<br />
1. Does the issue occur with all the programs or only Pals e-Dictionary program?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
3. Was the program running fine before on standard user account?<br />
<br />
WoW64 (Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit) is a subsystem of the Windows operating system that is capable of running 32-bit applications and is included on all 64-bit versions of Windows—including Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, IA-64 and x64 versions of
 Windows Server 2003, as well as 64-bit versions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and Windows 7. In Windows Server 2008 R2 Server Core, it is an optional component. WoW64 is designed to take care of many of the differences between 32-bit Windows and 64-bit
 Windows, particularly involving structural changes to Windows itself.<br />
<br />
System32, a directory in the Windows operating system containing system files<br />
<br />
To mark an application to always run as an administrator, do the following: </span>
</p>
<p><span>a. On the Start menu, locate the program that you want to always run as an administrator.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right-click the application’s shortcut, and then click Properties. </span>
</p>
<p><span>c. In the Properties dialog box, click the Compatibility tab. </span></p>
<p><span>d. Do one of the following: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To apply the setting to the currently logged-on user, select the Run This Program As An Administrator check box, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>To apply the setting to all users on the computer and regardless of which shortcut is used to start the application, click Change Setting For All Users to display the Properties dialog box for the application’s .exe file, select the Run This Program
 As An Administrator check box, and then click OK twice.</span></p>
<span><br />
The application will now always run using an administrator access token. Keep in mind that if you are using a standard account and prompting is disabled, the application will fail to run.

    <title>Problem enabling Bitlocker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom_g35  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem enabling Bitlocker</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I've just bought a samsung RF511 which I have upgraded to Win7 Ultimate.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to enable bitlocker and as the laptop doesn't support TPM I have followed the instructions here (<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/6229/how-to-use-bitlocker-on-drives-without-tpm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/6229/how-to-use-bitlocker-on-drives-without-tpm/</a>).<br />
<br />
This worked fine on my previous laptop but as I run through the configuration process I have to reboot. When Windows restarts it reports that the usb stick doesn't have the recovery key on it - Yet when I look on the stick the key is there.<br />
I've tried three different usb sticks and tried each of the usb ports but the result is the same.<br />
Can anyone suggest please what is going wrong?<br />
Thanks
                </div>

</span></span></span>What is the format of the Universal Serial Bus stick?</p>

<p>If it is FAT32 it may be worth trying to convert it to NTFS.<br />
(4GB is the file size limit for FAT32)<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>First I tried changing the file format, on the usb stick, to NTFS, still the same error message.</p>
<p>I moved onto the second hyperlink. I changed the boot order so that the machine boots from the hard disc first - No change. I then tried changing the boot ore so that it looked to the usb stick first - no change.</p>
<p>The error message is "The BitLocker startup key or recovery password cannot be found on the usb device".
</p>
<p>Certainly the startup key isn't on the usb stick&nbsp;but i saved the recovery key to the same usb device and that is there.</p>
<p>I've looked on the Samsung website and the date of my bios is newer than the one on their support site. I went to the bios manufacturers (American Megatrends Inc) website and according to their tool an update is available but you have to sign up at a third
 party website and pay £31+ which is a bit of a cheek!</p>
<p>The problem seems to be that windows is not writing the starup key to the usb stick (but does write the recovery key).</p>
<p>Not sure what to do next</p>

Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. As per my previous posting I have been to the manufacturers site but as mentioned the version shown is older than the one I have installed. I have contacted Samsung support for advice.</p>

BitLocker could not be enabled<br />
The BitLocker startup key or recovery password cannot be found un the USB device.<br />

I found the reason - it was plugged bluetooth mosu adapter. After disconnecting it Bitlocker flash drive was read exellent.

<p>
</p><p>I'm working on a computer that was hit by cryptowall 3 and poweliks.&nbsp; I've managed to clean the PC and while I was restoring files a new restore point was created and the old ones deleted.&nbsp; I ran a file recovery tool and backed up the 4GB in recovery files
 from the System Volume Information folder but can't figure out how to get them back into the system restore software.&nbsp; I've found applications that will allow me to&nbsp;extract the files but they don't show up.&nbsp; I'm assuming that's because it's all looking at
 the same place.&nbsp; How can I get the files extracted out of the recovered system restore files?

            <p>Hi Stewart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the issue description, I understand that your computer was infected with<strong>&nbsp;cryptowall 3
</strong>and <strong>poweliks </strong>malwares after which you have cleaned install the computer, now that your computer is cleaned installed you had lost the old Restore points.</p>
<p>To recover those old System Restore points you ran&nbsp;a file recovery tool and managed to recover 4GB of old system Restore point files, now you want to&nbsp;know how to put those extracted&nbsp;System Restore points back in System Restore&nbsp;tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand how frustrating it could be when things don't work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To understand this issue better, I would like to know the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>2. What&nbsp;is the file extension of the extracted System Restore points?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;When you say "I've managed to clean the PC" do you mean that you have cleaned installed Windows 7 by formatting the complete hard drive?</p>
<p>4. How did you try to restore the 4 GB recovered System Restore files after extracting, what was the procedure that you followed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I would like to re-confirm the issue was with malware infection due to which you formatted and clean installed Windows.</p>
<p>Now if you even manage to restore those recovered system restore files, those restore points may infect the computer again with
<strong>Cryptowall 3</strong> and <strong>Poweliks </strong>malwares as you may know the fact that System Restore will put your computer back to the earlier point of time.</p>

            <p>The laptop is an HP Envy.&nbsp; No, I did not format the computer.&nbsp; I cleaned out the infection through a combination of ESET's powelik cleaner, ESET's online scanner, Trend Micro's Housecall online scanner, Malwarebytes, and AVG.&nbsp; After the system was clean
 I began restoring the files by right-clicking on folders and restoring the "Previous Versions".&nbsp; While restoring, a new restore point was created and my previous restore points were deleted since it was set to a maximum of 10GB of storage space (don't know
 why).&nbsp; I immediately ran a recovery tool and pulled out the files from the "System Volume Information" folder and recovered them to a flash drive.&nbsp; There are no extensions on the files.&nbsp; They have names such as "{3dc41a1d-a8eb-11e4-baab-e02a82c9ed3b}{3808876b-c176-4e48-b7ae-04046e6cc752}".&nbsp;
 I'd rather not do a restore but just get them put back in so that I can restore the Documents, Pictures, and Music through the "Previous Versions" or some way I can just mount them.</p>

            <p>Hello Stewart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying with the required information and the status of the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your reply, I now understand that when the computer was infected with malware, you cleaned up the computer by running&nbsp;few malware cleaner tools (Anti Virus) programs.&nbsp;After cleaning the computer with malware infection&nbsp;while in the process of&nbsp;restoring
 back the&nbsp;system to earlier point using the&nbsp;system&nbsp;restore points a new restore point was created and the old restore points were getting deleted subsequently since the restore point space was set to maximum of 1 GB space. To recover the deleted system restore
 points you ran the recovery tool and managed to recover the deleted restore point on a flash drive from System&nbsp;Volume information.&nbsp;Correct me if I have understood&nbsp;it wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would still like to know the file extension of those recovered restore points as you say its not showing the file extension. I suggest you to follow the article below and unhide the file extension name and reply so that it helps us to examine the issue
 better and help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A file name extension is a set of characters added to the end of a file name that determine which program should open it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Show or hide file name extensions</strong></span> </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hide-file-name-extensions#show-hide-file-name-extensions=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hide-file-name-extensions#show-hide-file-name-extensions=windows-7</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest you to increase the System restore usage&nbsp;space so that it is convenient to&nbsp;store maximum restore points on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To store restore points, you need at least 300 megabytes (MB) of free space on each disk that is 500 MB or larger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore might use between three and five percent of the space on each disk. As the amount of space fills up with restore points, it deletes older restore points to make room for new ones. System Restore doesn't run on disks smaller than 1 gigabyte
 (GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How much disk space does System Restore require?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/How-much-disk-space-does-System-Restore-require" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/How-much-disk-space-does-System-Restore-require</a>
</p>

</p><p>Hope this information helps, please reply with the required information and status of the issue for further assistance.</p>

<p>*Original Title: <strong>Extract System Restore</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working on a computer that was hit by cryptowall 3 and poweliks.&nbsp; I've managed to clean the PC and while I was restoring files a new restore point was created and the old ones deleted.&nbsp; I ran a file recovery tool and backed up the 4GB in recovery files
 from the System Volume Information folder but can't figure out how to get them back into the system restore software.&nbsp; I've found applications that will allow me to&nbsp;extract the files but they don't show up.&nbsp; I'm assuming that's because it's all looking at
 the same place.&nbsp; How can I get the files extracted out of the recovered system restore files?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Hi Stewart.</p>
<p>It seems that many people could be helped through this development, if possible...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my scenario;</p>
<p>
</p><p>*VSS has been disabled. <br />
<br />
*VS copies has been deleted, previously were deleted the store points (i'm a Little confused about these two apparently different things: Restore Points/Shadow Copies).
<br />
<br />
*Restore System has been disabled.<br />
<br />
Plugging the disc to another machine i've been able to "see" into "System Volume Information" folder, through Recuva, large deleted (but recoverable) files with this kind of names; {3cfc80e0-be42-11e5-a950-f46d04d75d0c}{3808876b-c176-4e48-b7ae-04046e6cc752},
 ...are this large files Restore Points or Shadow Copies?, are the same thing, or very different?<br />
<br />
Well, just in order to experiment i've saved one of those files &amp; after a lot of trys i've been able to mount this file as a virtual DVD-rom (through a non-commercial version of DaemonTools Light). Just in case, i've made an image of this virtual unit through
 Testdisk. Later i've used Photorec &amp; extracted thousands of files from from the .dd image.<br />
<br />
Obviously, this restore point (or shadow copy?) has not the files that really matters, mostly of the files are Little images, txt's, system files, &amp; all kind of temporary files coming from the activity of the web browsers.<br />
<br />
I'm begging for someone who tell me that is posible to get back a deleted shadow copy, or several of them. The problem is that i don't know where to search for those "Sadow Copies", or if those files has some kind of name to search for.<br />
<br />
I was able to "rebuild" the "System Volume Information" folder, these are the files i've recovered:<br />
<br />
*SPP (folder in which is contained the "OnlineMetadataCache" sub-folder)<br />
<br />
*{7048df7f-d34b-11e5-b260-f46d04d75d0c}{3808876b-c176-4e48-b7ae-04046e6cc752} (large system file).<br />
<br />
*{3808876b-c176-4e48-b7ae-04046e6cc752} (64kb system file).<br />
<br />
*MountPointManagerRemoteDatabase (0kb system file).<br />
<br />
*tracking.log<br />
<br />
The very unknown (for me!) thing, is how to set the relationship between this recovered "System Volume Information" folder &amp; the Windows registry. I assume/wonder that if this relationship is rebuilted, we'll be able to recover entirely deleted shadow copies.
 Can someone tell me if i'm totally wrong about this? Because i've restored the entirely folder in the original location with their original files, but the system does not see the mentioned restore point.
<br />
<br />
I've made some proofs, as delete many large files from my disk when System Restore is active, &amp; later, obviously, i was able to recover all those file by simply navigate into the restore points through "System Restore Explorer" &amp; "ShadowExplorerPortable" apps.<br />
<br />
How to rebuild a recovered SVI folder-WindowsRegistry relationship; is there a chance?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for this so large post...<br />
<br />
Thx a lot in advance for the sacrifice of this part of your valuable time!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm having a similar problem and search for the samen answer as you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of our client PC's got infected with a newer version of cryptowall (Locky) and unfortunately there where import files stored local.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I've been able to recover files from the "System Volume Information" and looking for a way to view the contents of these files. I also have a copy of the original disk so if accessing the files on it own isn't a possibility, can the recovered files place
 back to the original "System Volume Information" folder?</p>

            <p>Arthur, i feel we're near to some good news about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First things first; try to get these softwares in order to experiment:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*AOMEI Partition Assistan Unlimited Edition</p>
<p>
</p><p>*R-Studio</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Spinrite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*ShadowMap (take a look over these 2 links in order to get an approach: http://forensicsfromthesausagefactory.blogspot.com.ar/2010/02/volume-shadow-copy-forensics-cannot-see.html</p>
<p>http://windowsir.blogspot.com.ar/2011/01/accessing-volume-shadow-copies.html).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look over here too..., however the best X-Ways version is too expensive: https://www.kazamiya.net/en/artifact/wipe/deletedsc#comment-27165</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, taking in count the AOMEI, R-Studio &amp; Spinrite options as more affordable &amp; very accurate recovery soft in order to rebuild an SVI folder, next step you'll find as an attractive approach is here (please read all the page);</p>

<h2>            Unable to power down Surface Pro 3 - Stuck in update</h2>
                    <p>Attempted to install Windows (10) update on my surface pro 3 this morning. It got as far the "Surface" black screen and "Please wait while we install a system update". The progress bar shows (approx) 99% complete. It has been this way for 3+ hours now. The
 fan is running continuously, and now sounds like it's beginning to fail. There are no peripherals plugged in. (No USB, no SD card, no keyboard, etc.) And it has been on the charger the entire time (it was at 100% battery before I began the update). I've tried
 to hard power down, but even holding the power button down for over a minute does nothing.</p>
<p>Please help?</p>

            <p>There are 2 ways you can do this well actually 3 but try click on task bar at the bottom of the screen then right click then click on task manager then right click on windows update then click end task that should shut it down</p>
<p>Or just try to restart not shut down ,and you can always go into the services on your RT and right click on the windows update then click on properties then click on stop that will stop windows update as well.</p>

<h2>            FIFA 15 Career mode freezing after playing or abandoning a game - Any advice please &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Bought new Xbox One &amp; FIFA bundle yesterday, FIFA 15 was a download game and not a disc. Game freezes after playing on career mode however a SIM game seems to work ok. I've tried wired and wireless network and wonder if this is a internet port issue (I'm
 on Sky broadband) however I'm no expert in this area.</p>
<p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you facing any performance issue with Windows 8?</li><li>Did you download this software form Iolo official website? </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cannot comment on third party software, using Third Party Software is at your own risk. You can try these methods to improve your system performance:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run System Maintenance troubleshooter. This troubleshooter will check your computer for any performance issue and will try to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Move your mouse to the right bottom and click on search.<br />
Step 2: Type Troubleshooting in the search box and click on it<br />
Step 3: On left pane click “View all” click on the "Run Maintenance task" under the System and Security.<br />
Step 4: Click on the "Next" in the System Maintenance interface.</p>
<p>Select "Try troubleshooting as an administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> One of the best ways you can improve your PC's performance is by optimizing the drive. Windows includes features to help optimize the different types of drives that PCs use today. No matter which type of drive your PC uses, Windows
 automatically chooses the optimization that's right for your drive.</p>

<p>On this HP DV6-1245dx, long hours have been spent following the suggestions contained within this site. The machine and OS have been recovering from the dreaded Bonjour removal process. The reason for the focus was that the Internet use was very unstable
 for a daughter's school laptop.</p>
<p>Removing Bonjour through the control panel does not work. The process corrupts Explorer, IExplore and Winsock. mDNSReponder.exe and mdnsNSP.DLL&nbsp;are left behind. To remove requires multiple Registry and directory&nbsp;searches for Bonjour's residual components
 and deleting them. This leaves Winsock in a corrupted state. The remedy is to rename the service reg keys Winsock and Winsock2 to Winsockold and Winsock2old. The export from a working non ITUNES MACHINE the Winsock and Winsock2 keys then import the files into
 the working machine. This requires and USB drive and administrator access. Note, netsh winsock reset can be run multiple times and does nothing because of the actions of Bonjour. Too many hooks into Windows 7 workings.</p>
<p>Now on to the problem. This machine is being investigated for very long shutdown times. Wow. The Eventlog changes are nearly 99% useful in attempting to see what is causing this. The 1% issue is that Startup and Shutdown events are the same. For example,
 Diagnostic-Performance reports an EventID 100 for <span>
167451ms</span><span>. In the XP days and fortunate, an Event ID of Startup and Shutdown was logged.&nbsp;Under 7,&nbsp;event&nbsp;100 can be LOGOFF/Shutdown + LOGON. The machine was left at Shutting Down and the spinning cursor as bedtime was calling.</span></p>
<p><span>This morning, a log on screen was presented. Good sign. Perfmon was running on startup and shutdown. Maybe, the eventlog captured something? As the desktop screen painted and the opening chime started, the machine blue screened with a screech
 through the speakers until the dump file was created. 0x3B is a new one. </span>
</p>
<p><span>Event-Kernel tracking has these two simultatious error and warning form last night.</span></p>
<p><span>12:06:18 AM EST </span></p>
<span><span>
<span><span>
<p>The maximum file size for session "ReadyBoot" has been reached. As a result, events might be lost (not logged) to file "C:\Windows\Prefetch\ReadyBoot\ReadyBoot.etl". The maximum files size is currently set to 20971520 bytes.</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>Followed by</p>
<p>Session "ReadyBoot" stopped due to the following error: 0xC0000188</p>
<p>Hmm... This may be the problem with the long shutdowns. The log shows 9 sets of these errors.</p>
<p>Ready-Boost shows the effects at 6/23/2010 12:28:31 AM.</p>
<p><span>"Boot plan calculation completed in 43150 ms. Boot Plan Timestamp: ‎2010‎-‎06‎-‎23T00:27:48.243758400Z Reason: System boot completion Result: 0x0"</span></p>
<p><span>This explains why the machine is taking a very very long time shutdown. With the very long shutdown and a following bug check, sure looks like some memory leak. The dump file has been preserved. What tool is now used to now used to view Dump
 Files?</span></p>
<p><span>PS: When will tools like NETDIAG be either pointed to the new paradigm or be brought back from the past?</span></p>
</span></span></span>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First off, what a priviledge to have trust in Jesus Christ. He alone gives wisdom to all who ask.</p>
<p><strong>DEVICE: </strong>HP DV6-1245dx. In Nov 2009, the machine was upgraded from Vista Home Premium 64 bit to Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit.&nbsp;4G Memory is factory installed Micron.</p>
<p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Procom, Procexp, Windbg, Bluescreenview, Norton Removal tool, Taskman, EventVwr, Windows 7 Advisor.</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Explorer.exe within Windows 7 Home Premium edition was hanging. All applications spawning under Explorer.exe would hang. Applications such as Windows Update would freeze at the startup screen with a blank white page. Other behaviors
 include when improper restarts, Event ID 41.&nbsp;A consistant restart behaviour was to hang at Logging Off or Shutting Down, indefinitely. Diagnostic-Performance would report long Event ID 100 times. Finally, when power management&nbsp;was enabled and&nbsp;the machine was
 allowed to&nbsp;run until failure, the&nbsp;machine would&nbsp;BugCheck 0x0000003b (0x00000000c000001d, 0xfffff88000000000, 0xfffff880089be160, 0x0000000000000000.</p>
<p>Tools needed to debug this problem would not run properly when opened. Procmon would hang with a whitened out screen. Windbg install would fail. Device driver installs would lock up. Eventvwr would hang up occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong>&nbsp;The machine, HP DV6-1245dx has a Secure Digital port. Installed in the drive was a Kingston SD 2G card. This card had bad sectors with the partition. The card was removed and repaired by another system.</p>
<p>Additional actions were taken.&nbsp;BIOS&nbsp;was updated to the current&nbsp;revision.&nbsp;The Intel SATA&nbsp;drivers were updated to the current release. HP applications&nbsp;were update from Vista versions to Windows 7 64 bit. Norton 2010 was removed. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM: </strong>NTDLL.DLL and SHELL32.DLL are the root cause of these symptoms. For both DLLs do not time out when conducting a device check on all available drives.&nbsp; The drive check for all drive letters may be called an application installation.
 When this call is made, NTDLL.DLL will&nbsp;error out with APPLICATION_HANG_BLOCKEDON_FILEIO. Shell32.DLL will error out with APPLICATION_HANG_WRONG_SYMBOLS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hanging NTDLL.DLL call is ntdll!ZwCreateFile.</p>
<p>The hanging Shell32.dll call&nbsp;is&nbsp;Shell32!CLocalInterruptSource: : v_CreateEvent.</p>
<p>Either one of these calls&nbsp;do not time out within an application. The&nbsp;wait call is to child process. The process is&nbsp;sent to anothe task.&nbsp;That task is hidden. As such, each call will prevent an application from being closed by PSLIST, Procexp,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Taskman.
 Applications installs will show wait:wrResource&nbsp;by Procexp when viewing the state of the application. This is not a Processor or TASK Lock. Windbg will not find any locks!!! in any crash dumps of an application no matter how long it is left to idle.&nbsp;When Procmon
 was able to run, applications were found to open threads&nbsp;after&nbsp;querying drive G: (SD drive) to wait indefinitely by&nbsp;opening a thread&nbsp;every 10 minutes&nbsp;to see if the&nbsp;state of drive G: was determined. Drive G: would never return its status.</p>
<p>Drive G: had a corrupted partition. As this was an SD card, NTFS failed to time out or report that the partition was corrupted. As this was not the primary install site, no message was sent&nbsp;describing the failed state of Drive G:.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real problem with the corrupted SD card in Drive G: is that this produced instablity with Windows&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;7 was&nbsp;waiting on the status of Drive G. How so? When restarting, Windows&nbsp;would show a list&nbsp;of applications to close. Sometimes, the list was
 blank. Logging off would never complete. Shutting down would never end.&nbsp;The machine would be left all night&nbsp;this state. Powering off was the&nbsp;singular solution. CrashonScrolllock does not work in the Logging Off&nbsp;or Shutting Down state.&nbsp;CrashonScrollLock is
 a Server tool and does not work&nbsp;for the workstation.</p>
<p>No tools capture restart or shutting down problems. This makes pin-pointing&nbsp;restart/shutdown problems difficult.</p>
<p>When the SD&nbsp;card was removed, Windows 7&nbsp;behaved normally. When the&nbsp;card's partition was repaired and reinstalled, Windows 7 behaved normally until Devmgmt.MSC was used. Under DISKS, a&nbsp;Generic- Multi-Card USB Device is displayed. When selecting any details
 on this&nbsp;device, the machine BugCheck 0x0000003b (0x00000000c000001d, 0xfffff88000000000, 0xfffff880089be160, 0x0000000000000000. This does not produce a dump file. Ouch!</p>
<p>So, the SD card had a bad partition (repaired) and is physically Bad? NO! The device works fine in another computer. No bug check. Then, the Generic- Multi-Card USB Device has a problem.&nbsp; The other machine has a Ricoh USB device for the SD card. Looks like
 the Generic version is the root problem.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>What a long stretch of days solving this problem. The Bugcheck messaging surrounding this error was completely off the mark.&nbsp;Googling for wisdom was&nbsp;sparce.&nbsp;Furthermore, thinking outside the box produced a clearer picture as to the&nbsp;root cause. Something
 was killing Explorer. To think that the generic driver and an SD card would produce such instablity&nbsp;for such a OS product&nbsp;seems incredulous. &nbsp;SD card slots on laptops are in different places On some, the card sticks out to let the user know the slot is filled.
 On the DV6-1245dx, the slot is flush between to ridges.</p>
<p>Explorer would sometimes display the G: drive. However, when a USB drive was installed, explorer would never update the drive. Drive G: was preventing Explorer from updating the drive state. No error messages were given when F5 was pressed multiple times
 and Drive F: would not refresh. Nothing pointed to Drive G: as the problem until Promon was stable enough to capture the Microsoft Security Essentials update from 1.61 to 1.63 asking for&nbsp;the status of Drive&nbsp;G: and&nbsp;never getting it. The progress bar would never
 advance. Deleting files would require F5 to refresh. Explorer would not refresh. This was tough. But the solution was found. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Creating a child account to make use of the Parent controls, but what about all the purchases</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I need some assistance, please. So I am a parent of a 10-year-old gamer. I want to set up some additional control on our XBOX console at home, but he has been playing for some time using my Microsoft Profile. So this means he bought some in-game assets and upgrades - what will happen to these if I create a child account and move him to this child account. Is there a way to transfer all his game upgrades and game data to his own profile as a child account? Over time we might have spent around $1500 and I do not want to lose all that when I create a child account and move him to it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sign into your web mail service -- the one that provides you your email.&nbsp; Delete the contents of your Inbox on that server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Live Mail, under the Account setting in the Advanced tab, set your settings up so that you tell the web mail server to delete the email once it downloads or you can delay it a few days.</p>
<p>

<p>I just had the same problem today!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I was trying to copy a CD with LG Burning Tool and got and error (#0xEB020B88) several times while trying to read and copy the original disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to RIP the files in Windows Media Player, move the files (all play fine) from the play list to the Burn CD Tab. This is when I got the same error message. (The error message and icon can only be seen if you click on the CD Drive icon in the
 left column - preparing the files to burn.) Click on the icon and I got the same message. Doing a Google Search on the error did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the folder where the RIP Files were put and looked at the restrictions for each mp3 song. No protection found in the audio file properties. Gee - what's going on here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next - I cleared the Burn List of songs then, I selected the audio files list from the RIP song folder (they were ripped into) and dragged the songs list from the file window -&gt; into the Windows Media Player Burn List.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to burn, put a new blank CD-R in the drive and the preparing file started in the "CD drive song&nbsp; list".
</p>
<p>This time it did the complete burn as expected!&nbsp; AND, the same song list in the Burn tab worked 2 more times!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there appears to be a problem with dragging audio files from the Windows Media Library to the Burn List, to burn the CD. And so, I found a work around the bug for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just need to figure out why my LG Burning Tool program is not allowing a CD Copy to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try putting the original disc in the CD/DVD drive and start the copy process I get and error -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy Disc - #0xEB020B88</p>
<p>Description:<br />
(1) Burning failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has never happened in the past, so it must be some new Windows 10 changes automatically installed.</p>

            Thank you for responding to my problem.&nbsp; I had the same responses (configuration settings might be set incorrectly and that my library files may be corrupted)&nbsp; when I ran the fix above as well as the original fixes that DaveM121 originally, when he responded,

<h2>            Dance Central 3&#58; SmartGlass not Working</h2>
                    
<p>I cannot get Dance Central 3 DJ SmartGlass experience to work. The Xbox 360 SmartGlass app (Windows 10) connects to my console, but every time I try to use the SmartGlass feature for Dance Central 3 specifically, there is an error: "There's a problem starting
 this experience."</p>

<p>Also, when I try to use the Dance Central 3 DJ SmartGlass experience using the Xbox 360 SmartGlass app for Android, I get an error: "Http/1.1 Service Unavailable"</p>
<p>Could this be related to the current Xbox Live service alert for streaming video? Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>The recent Xbox Live service issue has been resolved, but the same error for Dance Central 3 DJ SmartGlass experience persists: "There's a problem starting this experience."</p>

<p>N2Funk, did you figure out a &nbsp;solution to this? I'm also getting "Http/1.1 Service Unavailable" when starting the Dance Central 3 DJ Smartglass Experience on my Android phone, even though the xbox remote functionality in the Smartglass app works fine.</p>
