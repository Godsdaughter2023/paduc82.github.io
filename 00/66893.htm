<h2>            WHY XB WHY&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay I get comms ban for no real reason, go for CASE REVIEW, more then 48 hours nothing......WHY? So people get banned&nbsp;so quickly and the review board cant respond within their own policy timeframe? Come on guys, who is the client here? You or me? Gamers pay an arm and an leg to buy a console and games&nbsp; and then get banned because other players rage, message spam and then report you because they can. Why is getting banned so quick but trying to clear your name takes so much longer? ps that guy that reported me is still chatting away with his buddies and laughing as he got a message from xb saying they took action even tho he was the instigator. Again WHY?</p>

<h2>            Import Foreign Disk Help&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I have 4 Disks that are spanned dynamically and all of them show up in disk management but when I try to import them (from another system that no longer exists). it says import foreign disk group 2 of 2. It has this twice so I know it sees all 4 but it
 recognizes it as 2 groups of 2. It then asks are you sure you want to do this as its incomplete it could cause loss of data etc. it would be disatrous to lose the data on this disk. What should I do?I read that if I try to import them without all 4 the data
 will be destroyed. I just don't know how it assigns and recognizes that they are or are not part of the same group, is there some regedit?

<h2>            Everything Doesn&#8217;t Work And I Can&#8217;t Fix It, Please Send Help&#58; Kernel Data Inpage Error, dcll File Missing, RtllsProcessorFeaturePresent Not Located, Can&#8217;t Do A Factory Reset Or Refresh</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Essentially, everything is wrong with my computer and I have no way to fix it. The first problem arose about a year ago. My laptop
 battery suddenly wouldn’t register any charge, and could only be used while plugged in. I thought that might be a battery issue, but, a few months later, I replaced the battery and still had the same issue. Next, I started getting the “blue screen of doom,”
 the Kernel Data Inpage Error. My laptop began to consistantly stop working after a few hours of use: webpages would stop loading, files wouldn’t open after being clicked, and then the mouse and screen would become unresponsive. Most of the time, I turn the
 computer off, unplug it, and restart it to resume use. However, if I left the computer on, it would either give a black screen reading “all boot options are tried,” or the blue Kernel Data Inpage Error screen (the Kernel Data Inpage Error is the rarer of the
 two). It would last longerer the less I used it and after repeated sessions of rebooting after freezing, it would only last a few minutes. It also took a while after startup before it could open programs or load websites, but besides this, it still functioned
 as a proper computer, so, while frustrated and constantly attempting to find a solution, I dealt with it. However, recently, it’s begun to have errors opening any program not factory installed with windows or Google Chrome (I have no idea why Chrome, other
 browsers won’t open). Originally, I received an error box that a .dll file was missing and downloaded a replacement file. While I believed that would fix the issue, I only received an updated error:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">“The procedure entry point RtllsProcessorFeaturePresent could not be located in the dynamic link library</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">C:\WINDOWS\System32\wow64cpu.dll.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Defeated, I decided to just factory reset my computer and be done with it. However, when I tried to refresh or reset it, it said that
 I needed to insert windows installation media. As commanded, I ordered a windows system disk for my specific computer. When I inserted the disk and tried to reset my computer, it said that the installation media couldn’t be used. I tried to install windows
 directly from the boot menu. It said that the windows drive is locked. /sfc scannow detects problems, but can’t fix them.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">I have tried so many internet forums and found no fix.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">I have a Samsung ATIV Book 4 running Windows 8.1</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Everything doesn’t work, but I definitely can’t afford a new laptop. If anyone has any ideas on what to do to fix this, please help.
 I am utterly defeated and desperately need it.</span>

<h2>            Backslash button not working and typing backslash after the letters a and s continously</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following are my recent observations from today:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) My backslash button doesn’t work but after typing the letters "a" and "s", it types backslash sign continuously till backspace or any other key is pressed.</p>
<p>2) Also, I have noticed that if I press and hold the backslash key and then type the letters "a" and "s" then it types "a" and "s" only and not backslash signs continuously as it does when I just type "a" and "s".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the keyboard's driver, it's up to date and working fine. The sticky keys, toggle keys and mouse keys are all unticked. Also, I have restarted, shut down the computer multiple times. However, still the problem continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to either press backspace every time I type "a" and "s" OR else press and hold the backslash key first and then type "a" or "s" to get only "a" or "s".
<span>&nbsp;</span>Every time I type only "a" and "s", it looks as follows:</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Every time I type only "a" and "s", it looks as follows:</p>
<p>1) a\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</p>
<p>2) s\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</p>
<p>3) My backs\la\s\h button does\nt work but a\\\\\fter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to resolve this issue. I have checked the help and support section of Microsoft but there is no such exact issue mentioned there and thus unable to fix it.</p>

<h3> static jak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tim Schafer&#58; Indies Moving Away From XBLA, Console Patches Cost &#36;40,000</h2>
                    
<p><b>But there are frustrations, too. Schafer has watched the Xbox Live Arcade and PSN services dwindle away from fantastically promising beginnings to troubled, even fading services. “Ever since I played Geometry Wars I thought, what a great new portal,”
 he enthuses.<br />
<br />
“But it seems that this year, the idea didn’t explode like it should have. Back when Castle Crashers came out, it seemed it was going to grow and grow. I just wish there was more support, more marketing, more placement on the dashboard. It could have been our
 own little Sundance Film festival, a great sandbox for indie development.<br />
<br />
“But the indie community is now moving elsewhere; we’re figuring out how to fund and distribute games ourselves, and we’re getting more control over them. Those systems as great as they are, they’re still closed. You have to jump through a lot of hoops, even
 for important stuff like patching and supporting your game. Those are things we really want to do, but we can’t do it on these systems. I mean, it costs $40,000 to put up a patch – we can’t afford that! Open systems like Steam, that allow us to set our own
 prices, that’s where it’s at, and doing it completely alone like Minecraft. That’s where people are going.”</b></p>

<p><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>It's a shame MS tends to push aside the indie market. As years go on, it could well be the only place we'll see real new ideas take form. AAA games just cost too much to take those risks and that'll only continue to grow
 as an issue while indie studios continue to grow.</strong></span></p>

<p>I was excited by indie/arcade until I got burned on everyone I bought. Castle Crashers is a great example, awesome game but insultingly short. I won't waste money on anymore unless I know for sure that they have more than a couple days content.</p>

<p>Its not just microsoft thats pushing these games aside. It's also the console audience. The general xbox audience does not appreciate non AAA titles like the PC audience does.</p>

<p>Some blame has to be on the devs too. Like I said above the games are short and some are just not worth the money. We need more games like Terraria, paid 5 bucks for it on sale and it's got tons of content.</p>

<p>This is a problem with all 3 major consoles (and likely will continue to be so), new alternative mediums like mobile devices are gaining ground for that reason. Their more affordable to develop in, imagine a $1 game on an iPhone selling 1million copies,
 while a $60 console game can barely sell half of that most of the time.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I think we really need a pricing ladder for games these days, just because its a console title it shouldn't be $60, instead the price should be based on several things, like replay value, length and production costs.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Ill be honest though, there is no chance of me moving to mobile devices anytime soon, I got my hands on an iPhone 4S recently and the games while showing promise are nothing but time wasters, minor distractions compared to fully fleshed and realized games
 on consoles and PCs.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>I know there's the argument of "self worth" but really, that has its limitations. When you have new IPs that flop, they have to realise setting a new IP, a game that no one really knows much of outside previews, might
 not do great t such a high price point. Sure,</strong> <strong>some get through, but the likes of Homefront, Brink fall to the bottom of the pile. If they came out at a more competitive price point, they might have stood a better chance. Possible built up
 a big enough following to warrant a sequel and build on what they have.</strong></span></p>

<p>[/quote]I was playing some games on my mother's iPad2 and the games are fun but, they control like crap and most games like this GTA clone I was playing want you to pay for so much more content. These games could be so much better if they'd quit trying to
 jack us for more money at every other screen.</p>
<p>[/quote]<span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><strong>I think Adventure point &amp; click games could do very, very well on something like Tablets. As could RTS games.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Point and click adventure games could work, but RTS is not that good at least with the game I tried it with, a StarCraft clone named StarFront Collision by Gameloft. Its not bad but it doesn't feel that engaging or interesting.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also have a free Turn based Strategy game called Hero Academy by Robot Entertainment (formerly Ensemble Studios) its free with microtransactions and its actually pretty good, but its not that deep.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I tried a third person shooter called Star Warfare Alien Invasion which funny enough has soldiers dressed in oddly familiar Spartan armor killing bugs in Horde mode style maps, its good but the controls are really difficult to handle.</p>

<p>This is not true. Windows contains a feature that allows stealth install on first boot even with a clean install of Windows.&nbsp; Doing a clean install on any Windows PC may not be the same as a clean Windows version without the bloatware.&nbsp; Lenovo got some bad
 reviews because of this in the past, and so did some other PC manufacturers I believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Newer Intel and AMD cpus may also contain features that allow stealth installs. It's supposed to be disabled by default, but recently it has been shown that the Intel version is hackable from using a USB device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best option is a signature edition. Then make sure all remote access and management features are disabled upon first boot. This may involve changing options in UEFI.</p>

<h2>            Error Code E 74</h2>
                    
<p>When i turn on my xbox a screen pops up saying Error code E 74 . It has something to do with the AV cables i heard and I'm using a HDMI cable. The thing is that it did this the first time then I plugged in the HDMI slowly and turned it on and it worked but
 I had to turn it off for something and when i try to turn it on again the error code screen shows up again. How do i fix this?</p>

            Hi Sargan_499
<br />
<br />The best way and possible only way to install onto an SSD is to clean install Windows 10 onto the SSD. That way you take full advantage of the speed boost from your new SSD.
<br />
<br />You must disconnect the HDD temporarily when installing Windows 10 onto the SSD. It is not well reported, if you leave the HDD connected, the boot configuration files and/or page file can end up on the HDD instead of the SSD
<br />
<br />You can connect the HDD up again once the installation completes.
<br />
<br />One other thing, when you are in BIOS changing the Boot order, make sure SATA Mode is set to AHCI       
        </p>

<p>If I disconnect the HDD how do I bot up ? ... it would have no OS ?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Can you outline a few of the steps ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I install SSD make sure its empty and can be seen by OS&nbsp; - no problem there.</p>
<p>If I pull SATA lead plug on HDD while OS is running won't it crash ?</p>

            Hi Sargan_499, you need to create Windows 10 bootable installation media, boot from that and clean install Windows 10 onto the SSD
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />Before proceeding, backup your user data, just in case . . .
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the steps ..... where does the digital entitlement come from ... if it is happy with a clean install on a new SSD, its not coming form boot record or similar&nbsp; ... where does it pick this entitlement up from ?&nbsp; is it locked to mac address or similar.</p>
<p>Just want to be 100% certain I have a note of what it is ....&nbsp; can I look up serial number/user details so I can record them</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also do I have to create the USB flash drive on the PC I'm upgrading or can that be on any PC.</p>

            Hi Sargan_499
<br />
<br />When you initially activate Windows 10, the OS contacts the Microsoft Servers and a unique identifier for your PC is generated from your hardware (motherboard serial number . . etc.)
<br />
<br />That is stored on the Microsoft Activation servers and if you go to the Settings App - Update and Security - Activation, you will see your activation is reported as activated with a Digital licence
<br />
<br />Then whenever you need to re-install Windows, you skip the steps to provide a product key
<br />
<br />When the installation completes, and you put that PC on the Internet, Windows will without any user interaction contact the Microsoft Activation servers, check for a Digital Entitlement and automatically activate from that.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />It is best to create the bootable installation media on the PC you are going to re-install
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you do want to store your Windows 10 licence Key, though honestly, there is no need:
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Licence Key

<h2>            .NET Framework 4 Installation issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello. For the past few days I have been having this installation issue pop up when trying to install the .NET Framwork 4, whether I use the Windows Update or download directly from the microsoft site. I am the only user on this computer, and am the administrative
 user. I get a Windows Installer pop-up that reads:</p>
<p>"The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click OK to try again, or enter an alternate path to a folder containing the installation package 'netfx_Core_x64.msi' in the box below."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I try to browse and find the file, and can't find it. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Framework 4, and I have tried repairing it. Repairing it gave me the same error message. I was able to uninstall successfully, but upon reinstallation, I got the
 same error message.</p>

            This solution wasn't helpful, but mainly because the Resolution Method 2 wouldn't open/work. I have finally fixed it (I hope) by using the automated FixIt system. I had to run it twice, and the second time it allowed me to manually tell it which program
 needed repairs. Now I've just finished a successful install, and I'm crossing my fingers that when I restart my computer, my programs will all be able to update and work properly!

            Hello  FirozAnsary 
<br />
<br />If the battery on your computer is only charging to 80% this is likely because Battery Life Extender is turned on. Battery Life Extender sets the maximum battery charge level to 80% in order to extend the life of your battery. To turn this function off and charge your  laptop battery to 100% follow the steps below. 
<br />
<br />1. Open Settings from the Start Screen or your desktop. If you do not have Settings installed click here for instructions on installing it. 
<br />
<br />2. In the Settings window, go to Power Management.
<br />
<br />3. Click the Battery Life Extender tab.
<br />
<br />4. On the Battery Life Extender window, slide the slider to Off. Battery Life Extender is now turned off.
<br />I hope it helps

    <title>Movie Maker does not recognize .m4a files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craigwhittles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movie Maker does not recognize .m4a files</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have 8 or 9 Movie Maker Projects that I was currently working on. Windows 7. All of these projects had music files (.m4a,) that worked flawlessly. No issues at all. Well, after a few months break, I went back to these projects to check in and complete.
 Now every .m4a song has a warning that states that Movie Maker cannot read any of the .m4a files. I spent many hours with Microsoft with multiple techs on my computer but none of them could figure it out, (it seemed each were not really versed on Movie Maker.)
 Their advice was to convert every music file. Using Itunes for pulling music, this is extremely problematic. It seems to me there is a simple solution or fix, if only...I tried to re download Essentials but no change. Help!!</p>

Jayant, &nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. According to this article, .m4a <em>is</em> supported in Movie Maker. And, for two years, I have been using .m4a audio files in my projects with no issues.</p>

            <p>PapaJohn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for your assistance. In my projects, on the audio/song line, what is usually green is now grey. In the song title, there is an eclamation point inside a yellow triangle. When I click on the song, a box pops up that states 'the file might be corrupted
 or in a format that movie maker doesn't recognize.' Every single .m4a song in every project. About 40 songs. I try to start a new project, importing the .m4a song and it shows the same warning. These songs play fine in my itunes so they are not corrupted.
 Movie Maker just can't find them.</p>

            <p>Hi Craig... thanks for the sample file.&nbsp; Sorry to say&nbsp;it went into an MM2012 project on my Windows 7 laptop with no hint of an issue, and the saved movie with it included played perfectly, so the issue isn't with the file or MM2012, but with your computer
 hardware or software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easy way&nbsp;forward might be to&nbsp;convert it to another file, even a new .m4a one,&nbsp;and try again.&nbsp;

<p>Hi. <br />
<br />
<br />
What is it being attempted that made you look in the Event Viewer? It shows that this is an error related to
<em>MicrosoftWindowsSystemRestoreSR</em>. How does this affect your system performance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We may need more information about the issue so we can be more accurate. </p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>You found it in Event Viewer but you are not going to tell us where in Event Viewer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we must use the crystal ball and hope it is having a good day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MAYBE this is what you are seeing...</p>
<p><br />
Those are not error messages - they are informational messages about a Scheduled Task called SR (System Restore).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To understand things go to Event Viewer, Applications and Services Log, Microsoft, Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Find the TaskScheduler Folder, right click the Operational log and Clear it so you'll get a clean start on the log:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7415f07e-4536-4eb9-9408-133db3830592?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7415f07e-4536-4eb9-9408-133db3830592?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now open Task Scheduler, go to the Microsoft, Windows folder and find the SR (System Restore Task).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SR task runs every day at 12AM and at also at startup but it might not create a Restore Point if there is no need to create a Restore Point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click that Task and choose to Run it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4956da85-ffd8-44aa-a3f9-7e0b50c99dc5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4956da85-ffd8-44aa-a3f9-7e0b50c99dc5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Task may have created a Restore Point or may not have created a Restore Point if it is not time to create a Restore Point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to Event Viewer and look at the Task Scheduler Operational log again (press F5 to refresh) and it should look something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab643feb-7ea0-47fc-ba41-777958395237?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab643feb-7ea0-47fc-ba41-777958395237?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see where the SR Task was started - it reports the task was trigged by user (me), and the task completed and there are no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there's your Events of 102 and 201:</p>
<p>
</p><p>102 means the Task Completed</p>
<p>201 means the Action Completed<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>

I cannot interpret the results of your Autopsy and log2timeline programs.<br />
<br />
You can probably find the infromation you need with some Google searches and for Events I would start looking at this site:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.eventid.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eventid.net</a><br />
<br />
I can tell you that Event 7036 is logged with a Service starts and it is logged again when a Service stops.&nbsp; Many Windows Services like VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) are set to a Manual start which means they will start when they need to start and stop when the
 need to stop.<br />
<br />
This is one reason why it is so irritating when there is a problem with backup/restore and the Microsoft engaged alleged "experts" advise to set the VSS Service to Automatic start - and that is just plain wrong.<br />
<br />
See what it says here about Event 7036:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.eventid.net/display-eventid-7036-source-Service%20Control%20Manager-eventno-1529-phase-1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eventid.net/display-eventid-7036-source-Service%20Control%20Manager-eventno-1529-phase-1.htm</a><br />
</p><p>
</p><p>So you would learn more is you start doing some of your own research and homework and learn what this stuff means.</p>

<h2>            Wireless adapter suddenly missing&#47;not recognized by Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last year I installed Windows 10 on my Lenovo ideapad z580. Today suddenly in the middle of my session, my laptop suddenly could no longer connect to wifi. On restarting I realized the wireless network card wasn't working. In fact, the OS does not even realize
 that the laptop has a wireless network card. It can still recognize the ethernet card and bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Went to Device Manager --&gt; Network Adapters. I could not find the wireless adapter listed there. The following were listed: Bluetooth Device (PAN), Bluetooth Device (RFCOMM), Realtek PCIe FE.</li><li>I changed the settings to view hidden items. I can see the wireless adapter (Intel(R) Centrino(R) Wireless-N 2200). There were a few other adapters that are hidden as well, viz.: Microsoft ISATAP Adapter #2, Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter, Microsoft
 Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter, Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter #2.</li><li>I tried right clicking and uninstalling Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter. It disappeared from Device Manager.</li><li>When I restarted my machine, I could no longer find Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter even after showing hidden items.</li><li>I went to Lenovo support site, downloaded and installed the latest wireless network adapter driver. But no change in status.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Given steps 3 &amp; 4 above, I do not know if I should proceed with uninstalling the wireless adapter. The fact that the OS was not able to automatically install a device driver on a reboot indicates that this is a OS issue. The forums also point to the same
 direction. Please advise.</p>

 software or a driver that you recently installed or uninstalled caused problems with your PC, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a

            <p>Hi Nachappa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried restoring the system from an "Automatic restore point" dated 5/3/16, it erred out in seconds stating:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and settings were not changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>The specified restore point is missing or corrupt. Try again using another restore point (0x81000201)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried other other restore point I had - "Windows Update" dated 5/13/16. And I got the exact same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to scan your computer with
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious
 software. It works with your existing Antivirus software. Refer to the link to download and run the scanner:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Windows 10 machine. Seems it comes with a built-in Windows Defender. I further tried to download Microsoft Security Essentials from the link you gave me, but it does not have a version for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried pulling up Windows Defender it said "The app has been turned off and isn't monitoring your computer. If you're using another app to check for malicious or unwanted software, use Security and Maintenance to check the app's status"</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Security and Monitoring, the app shows as status "OK". It is AVG Free antivirus.
</p>
<p>A complete scan with AVG has revealed: "No threats detected"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>You could watch it if your cable/OTA TV is going through the HDMI in....then you use the TV app. I am guessing you can snap the NFL app to see all the stats etc.</p>

<p>I'm guessing he wants to use strictly the NFL app to watch the game with the stats and stuff on the side. I don't think it's possible though in the way he wants to. At least not this year.

<p>I thought the NFL app was going to let you view games iin real time, not highlights after the game has already been played. A little dissapointed with it.... hopefully they make some changes.</p>

<p>NFL app was fantastic and will be getting better next year as the streaming will be 60 FPS... last year was good.. especially for a few of us that went into a NFL.com fantasy league.... they did not show full games... only what was available on the NFL channel
 and their sub channels... &nbsp;DirectTV has the right to the NFL games through next year then their contract is up and is NOT getting renewed... &nbsp;MS will be hoping all over that deal.. as they already invested millions into the NFL..</p>

<p>Support said Comcast has support, but only certain zip codes, so you have to try changing your zip code to have it hopefully show up as an option. Seems kind of backwards, and I've yet to see if that actually works, but I will try tomorrow.</p>

<p>I don't doubt that at all. Some funny business going on with Comcast. If I could FIOS I'd be outta there faster than the wind.

    <title>Issue with maximizing windows. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a ruc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with maximizing windows.</h2>
                    Ok so I've been using Win 7 Ultimate since it's release without any issues. Then out of nowhere my windows no longer maximize to the correct size. When I hit the maximize button there is about 1/5th of the desktop still viewable on the right hand side.
 I can click maximize or drag the window to the top of the screen and get the same result. Also when dragging a window to the right to have it snap to the side the mouse stops at the same point as the maximized windows and sizes as if that is the edge of the
 screen. I cannot drag desktop icons to this part of the screen either. When I try they simple pop back to the other side of this "edge." However my taskbar still extends the full length of the screen and I can manually size the windows to have them fill the
 whole screen, and full-screen games still take up the whole screen. I thought the problem might have been my GPU so I replaced and upgraded to a more current card that has more support for Win 7 but that didn't work either. Here are some pics to show you what
 is going on: The first one is a maximized window. The 2nd one is a window snapping to the right side of the screen. You can see the circle nova where the mouse should be (not captured by Print Screen).

Problem solved.<br />
<br />
A O H3LL (AOL) Instant Messenger was the culprit. I don't know what it did but even when the program was closed it was still reserving that space. Weird but problem solved. Thanks anyways everyone.
