            Hi Mahmoud.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you changing the Default browser at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps?  
<br />
<br />What exactly happens?
<br />
<br />Which browser do you want as default?  Can you set it in that browser's settings?  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            Then I'd report this in Feedback Hub to the Insider program and go back to the last stable version in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery.  
<br />
<br />Insider Builds are never stable and should not be used as the production PC or if you don't want to deal with bugs.  The idea is that you'd report the bugs and wait for them to get fixed.  Some people don't want to deal with this, or only on a hobby PC.  
<br />
<br />If you'd want to have a better install you can even use the latest stable version from Media Creation Tool to do the Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.

    <title>Unable to type &#34;&#60;&#34; sign - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markiz_qmz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to type &#34;&#60;&#34; sign</h2>
                    <p>So basically after turning on my PC yesterday, I was unable to type the less than sign. I'm using a Hungarian keyboard layout, so for me it used to be AltGr+ M.
<br />
<br />
I tried using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4, but the key combination shows that pressing AltGr + M would result in a "&lt;", but for me nothing happens at all.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3852e49-1393-4089-9a4f-d432e5a620b0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3852e49-1393-4089-9a4f-d432e5a620b0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual AltGr button works as well as the M key, of course. I can type any other AltGr + Key combination such as the "&gt;" sign.&nbsp;<br />
I have my keyboard layout set to Hungarian, and I have changed the system locale to Hungarian as well, still doesn't work.<br />
All my drivers are up-to-date as well so I am out of ideas.<br />
As you can imagine, it is really difficult to write code without the less than sign, so I'm currently forced to keep copy pasting it until I find a solution.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated!<br />
<br />
By the way, I am using a Razer Black Widow Ultimate 2016 keyboard.<br />

            Hello again,<br />
<br />
I have fixed the problem about 15 minutes ago, where I noticed that after restarting my PC, I can write the character for about 5 seconds, and then I suddenly couldn't. I realized it's some program in the background that's causing the issue, and so I restarted
 my PC again and I was pressing "AltGr + M" for as long as I could while checking which programs started running and if I could still write the character.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Turns out, NVIDIA GeForce Experience was causing the issue. There's a feature called "In-game overlay" and the key combination "Ctrl + Alt + M" was used to mute the mic (without any background sound effect, or anything that would indicate that something happened
 in the background). Simply disabling the in-game overlay feature or changing the keybind solved my issue.&nbsp;I'm guessing they just released this feature in the new version (3.9.0.61).<br />
<br />
So anyone who uses a Hungarian keyboard layout the same way I am, and uses NVIDIA GeForce Experience to update GPU drivers, that's the solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time, I have no more issues :)

<p>
</p><p>One day my computer just started to shut down with the BSOD about every half hour. I tried to factory reset it, then I tried clean reinstalling Windows 7 but now it's shutting down a few seconds after it restarts. What other options do I have? Will replacing
 the hard drive with a new one fix it?&nbsp;</p>

If you are absolutely 100% sure there are no viruses/malware etc you could try *SFC*<br />

            Your system is still infected with malware and the malware knows that you are likely to use taskmgr.exe, regedit.exe or msconfig.exe to try to find and remove it so it will not let those processes exist as a running process.&nbsp; See if Start, Run, cmd.exe
 will open or not while you are looking around.&nbsp; System Restore may not work either.&nbsp; Think like malware.<br />
<br />
This is why a copies of the programs work - the malware does not recognize the name of the process.&nbsp; But you can't keep running copies of things - you need to fix things.<br />
<br />
You need to use something with a little more oomph than Avira and SpyBot, then see how things look.<br />
<br />
BTW - SFC will not replace a missing or corrupted taskmgr.exe either.&nbsp; To prove it, boot into Safe Mode or the Recovery Console so Windows File Protection is not running and rename taskmgr.exe to something you can remember (like taskmgr.goo) so now taskmgr.exe
 is "missing".&nbsp; Reboot normally and be sure Task Manager will not work (because it is "missing").&nbsp; Run SFC to completion and taskmgr.exe will
<br />
After you're convinced, be sure to rename your taskmgr.goo back to taskmgr.exe so you have one.<br />
<br />
Do this and if your TM still does not work, you can fix it:<br />
<br />
Download and run Hitman Pro (hitmanpro) from here and when installing be 100% sure to decline installation of any toolbars, decline any email options, anything to do with Bing or MSN, perform a one time scan, accept no emails and activate the free license:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.surfright.nl/en/downloads/</a>&nbsp; (make sure you get the free version)<br />
<br />
Download and run TDSSKiller from Kaspersky:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684</a><br />
<br />
Perform some scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do at least one full scan with these free malware detection programs:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
When the scans run clean, then troubleshoot any remaining issues.<br />
<br />
If you need to replace your taskmgr.exe, that is easy from a download.<br />

<br />You can access Reset from it's most stable platform which is via <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a> if necessary using the booted media.  
<br />
<br />To  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />In Troubleshoot options choose the Reset.  
<br />
<br />If it fails there too then close the Repair box and choose Install Now, follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

<h2>            Microphone will not unmute</h2>
                    I've been having this problem with my laptop for the past few days. Before, I was able to use the built in microphone on the computer to communicate over Skype, record videos for my kids, and answer business calls online. However, for the last few days,
 the microphone has not been picking up any of my audio. I went into the recording devices tab in the sound menu, and I found that my microphone was muted. I unmuted it and put the microphone volume back to it's original level, and then I closed the window.
 However, the settings did not work. The option to apply the changes was blacked out, and I could not click on it to apply the changes to the microphone. I've tried to repeat the process several times, with the same result. I even borrowed a headset from a
 co-worker to see if that would work, and the same problem still persisted. My computer seems to have all of my recording devices constantly muted with no way of changing the settings. If there is any way to fix this problem, I would a

<h3> brucecrossan  say:</h3>
<h2>            No smooth scrolling in the windows explorer.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. I have looked all over the forums, but there has been no answer to this issue. In the explorer of Windows 7 x64, when scrolling from lists to medium to large folder views, it does not scroll smoothly.</p>
<p>I checked the performance settings and it is enabled.&nbsp;I even tried disabling it and then&nbsp;re enabling&nbsp;it. Adjusting the notch settings does nothing either as it just changes by how much the lists jump.</p>
<p>I had the same issue in IE8, but when I tried IE9 beta smooth scrolling worked. It works fine in firefox and even in Chrome (which needs an extension to enable the function). I even tried download the mouse drivers for my Logitech LX3 mouse, but nothing
 helps. It is obviously not a hardware issue as I have smooth scrolling in everything except in Windows 7 itself.</p>
<p>The function also does not work on my laptop or on all 12 of my friend's computers who have x64 and x86 versions of windows 7. So, it can not be a mouse issue or a display driver issue as I have tried it on ATI, Nvidia and Intel PCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, my specs are:</p>
<p>Windows 7 x64</p>
<p>Processor<span> </span>AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 6000+, 3000 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 2 Logical Processor(s)</p>
<p>ATI Radeon HD5870 1GB Graphics card (10.9 driver version at the moment)</p>
<p>4GB DDR2 1066Mhz RAM</p>

<p>Yes, holding it down while sue the wheel does change the icon size. It is quick with no lag or hanging etc. And doing it in the browsers makes it zoom in and out with no lag etc. I have not come across a single copy of windows 7 that has smooth scrolling
 in the explorer. It is working fine in all my Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera and IE9 beta) except IE8. It does<strong>not</strong> work on my laptop nor on any of my friend's Windows 7 machines windows explorer. I think Microsoft did not incorporate the
 function even though they have a option to enable or disable it.</p>
<p>P.S. Sorry for the late reply :)</p>

<h2>            Path Variable gets set to null after install of software or Remote desktop session disconnect...</h2>
                    This has started happening within the last few weeks and has been causing issues when a reboot or log off cannot be done.&nbsp; If I remote desktop&nbsp;into my Windows7 machine and just disconnect to leave applications running when I return to the machine and unlock
 the Path variable is set to null, this is also happening if I install/uninstall any application onto the system.&nbsp; Is there any way to correct this issue, the log off or reboot options are effecting my ability to support my customers.&nbsp; Any thoughts would be
 greatly appriciated.

            Did you ever find an answer to this ? I see it happening too. If I leave my work PC running and remote desktop in, it nulls out the PATH variable and so naturally many things dont work. If I log off and back in remotely all is fine<br />

<h2>            Lenovo X201 Tablet and touch</h2>
                    <p>According to Microsoft on this site....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/multitouch-hardware-reqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/multitouch-hardware-reqs</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"....If you have touch input hardware that isn't specifically designed for <span>
Windows&nbsp;8</span> or <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, but displays the "Designed for Windows" logo for Windows&nbsp;7, you'll experience touch responsiveness
<strong><u>at least as good as it was on Windows&nbsp;7</u></strong>...."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Based on that, I upgraded my Lenovo X201 Tablet with Windows 7 (kept up to date with Lenovo's System update, and windows update, and working well), and
<u>lost the touch and pen abilities completely.</u></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In system manager I have an unknown device, but no Wacom device in Human Interface Devices; and in control panel I don't have either "Pen and Touch", or "Tablet PC Settings".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried installing the W7 drivers from the Lenovo site in Windows 7 compatibility mode, and it displayed the error "No supported tablet was found".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Having failed the upgrade, I proceeded to do a clean install, and had exactly the same result.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Must clarify the update was to Windows 8 Pro, then all windows and Lenovo updates, and the upgrading to 8.1 from the store, and all windows and Lenovo updates again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I'm dumbfounded. If I lost the touch ability as advertised <strong><u>at least as good as it was on Windows&nbsp;7</u></strong>...., I will go back to Windows 7.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any suggestions? I spent a lot of time on this, and plan to soon abandon W8.1, and return to W7.
</p>
<p><br />

<p>Many thans in advance,</p>

</p>
<p>Just realized that the first time I installed Windows 8 I did it as an upgrade to Windows 7, so I guess it used the existing Wacom driver. Here it is, for those who still haven't figured it out:

<p>Why would Microsoft not include this driver in Windows 8? </p>

                    Hi, After windows 10 took an update about a month ago, all my printers say "Driver is Unavaliable" I have run the windows troubleshooter with no luck, when I try to go and manually add the printers it fails and says "Windows Can't open add printer - The
 remote call procedure failed" the printers do show up under the control pannel device manager under WSD Print Provider since they are both wireless, If i try to update the driver through there they say they are up to date. Very Frustrating - if I go to print
 anything it states that I need to install a Printer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for any help in advance.

            Hi Wade.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. 
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span>Hi Michael,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Do you have any third party security software installed on the computer?</span></li><li><span>Does other USB devices work fine on the same computer?</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may run Hardware troubleshooter built in Windows 7 and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span>Open the Hardware
 and Devices troubleshooter by clicking the</span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span>
 button, and then clicking</span></span><span><span>Control</span></span><span><span>Panel</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>

 box, type</span></span><span><span>troubleshooter</span></span><span><span>, and then click</span></span><span><span>Troubleshooting</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Under</span></span><span><span>Hardware
 and Sound</span></span><span><span>, click</span></span><span><span>Configure a device and select
 Hardware Device</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>‌<span>&nbsp;(If you're prompted for an administrator password
 or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation)</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try connecting the Samsung phone to a different USB port on the back of your computer tower and check
 if it gets detected. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may verify if the device is detected in decive manager and check for any errors and post back
 the details.<span>&nbsp; </span>Access the link below and follow the steps to open device manager.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 4</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may also try to temporarily disable security software from the computer and try to check if the Samsung Phone and USB devices are
 detected. If gets detected, you may contact the security software Manufacturer and check if you need to change any settings. Later re-enable the security software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also access the link below and follow the steps in the article provided by Samsung and check
 if it helps. </span></p>

<p>There are numerous methods used by viruses, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some use their own executables</li><li>Some modify existing executables</li><li>Some modify some registry key</li><li>Some hide in the Master Boot Record</li><li>Some hide in the hard disk firmware</li><li>Some come with device drivers</li><li>etc.</li></ul>
<p>Looking for a virus in the registry not only requires a very good knowledge of how the registry works but also precise details about the virus itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

            That's why i am on here asking the question. I have enough knowledge to be dangerous, as they say. I know that for example, when you dispose of your old computer, you can go to the HKEY under current user, and you can change the name on a certain line.
 So logic has it that when a virus enters the computer, it attaches itself to a line in the start up portion of the the software. My question is, if i know the name of the virus software, where can i find it, using the registry editor?<br />

<p>Your view has nothing to do with reality. A burglar will take great care not to leave any trace that could lead the police back to him. A virus does exactly the same: It will go to great lengths to hide its identity. Some viruses can be detected by finding
 a signature in an executable. Others will change their signature in a random fashion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The virus names you see in the computer press are names coined by the anti-virus companies. They are never seen in the registry or in an executable files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could use <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virushttp://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this page</a></span> to find out a little more about viruses. It might show you that your focus on "finding
 viruses in the registry" is baseless.</p>

            Thank you very much for the explanation. I was not aware of how the virus works!

<h2>            My Wondows Live Mail program won&#39;t allow me to send emails.</h2>
                    <p>Last night I tried to send a few photos through my Windows Live Mail program and they wouldn't go through, even when I broke them down in to smaller groups. So today I tried to send regular emails and am getting error messages (on all 3 of my accounts) saying
 "Unable to complete task" when I hit send/recieve. "Task not completed successfully". When I try to delete the task there appears to be no way to do that. I am getting "Message could not be sent, error 0X800420CA and Errors occured trying to... error 0X800CCC0002.</p>
<p>Last week my Kapersky security was replaced with the Norton program but I don't think that relates to this.
</p>
<p>Internet works fine.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Did this happen after you've changed anti virus program? The error code is referring to a blocked port which can happen if the anti virus or firewall is blocking it.</p>
<p>Please try disabling your anti virus program and check if the same thing happens.
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to me. Before I heard from you I found the original emails residing in my Outbox (I assume still trying to process?) and deleted them. That appears to have fixed things. The thing is, I had this problem a while back and sort of remembered
 this but thought that if the problematic emails still existed they would be in my sent or draft box. I actually didn't even notice the outbox for quite a while.</p>
<p>In any event, I do have trouble sending photos with Windows Live Mail. It seems to clog up very esily, can't send more than a few (if at all) and automatically creates some kind of an album when that's not what I want. The pics aren't even big files!?</p>
<p>Do you think I should uninstall and then reinstall the Norton anti-virus? While trying to fix the above problem I did disconnect some of the firewall settings and I could never, at this point, remember or understand which ones.</p>
<p>The Kapersky program that come with the laptop six months ago or so, was fine. When the free trial ran out I took advantage of the free Norton offered through my cable provider (Comcast). Do you think I shoud leave well enough alone, go back to Kapersky,
 anything?</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry to send you on a wild goose chase and I appreciate your help,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I have just experienced the same problem The pooter is brand new and has Norton installed. Whilst trying to send some photos via Live mail the whole system stopped working until I spotted a note saying delete the photo message. This I did and things started
 happening again. I was able to forward some pictures sent to me afterwards but sending from 'My Pictures' does not want to work. BUT I can send photos via BT Yahoo email

 the previous steps and nothing worked.&nbsp; I did the above steps and that finally worked, but it does not adjust the size of the photos and takes a long time to send.&nbsp;

<h2>            Network Printer connection with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have browsed through the network printer connection posts here and cant seem to find my situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using Windows 7 , a Western Digital N900 router with internal hard drive, and a Canon MP160 printer.&nbsp; The printer connects to the router via a USB port on the router.&nbsp; There was an application called WDPrintshare that was used to send to the printer.
 This was all working OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now upgraded to Windows 10 via the free online update.</p>
<p>My WD router seems to be OK, I have access to all my files on it, internet access is OK&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>But I cant get my printer to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) after starting Windows 10 I got error message "Control Center Installation is Incomplete. Pleas install again".&nbsp; Searching led to several people with same problem, answer was to delete WDPrintShare.&nbsp; So I did that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) went into Devices and Printers.&nbsp; No printers found.&nbsp; So did Add Printer.&nbsp; No printers found, so click on "The Printer That I want isn't listed"&nbsp; Now 5 choices are presented, the one that I thought I could get to work was "add a printer using TCP/IP address
 or hostname" since I know the router base address 192.168.1.1 and the printer port is 192.168.2.110.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I type in my IP address and click next and it looks TCP/IP ports.&nbsp; But it says device is not found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now I am given choice of Standard Device or Custom Device.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have picked Standard Device, and then from the list of choices picked Generic Network Card.&nbsp; WD N900 is not listed, so Generic sounded like my&nbsp; best choice.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) I click Next, and then try to print a test page.&nbsp; This does not work, I get message "Cannot communicate with the printer. Turn Enable bi-directional support on in the printer's Properties dialog box."&nbsp; So I go in to properties of my new printer and click
 the box for bi-directional support in the Ports tab, and click apply and OK.&nbsp; But print test gives same error message, I check properties again and the bi-directional support box has not remained selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, have I selected an incorrect choice somewhere ? ie Generic Network Card ?&nbsp; What should I be doing to set up this network printer ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Update</p>
<p>I got an email today from this site saying I hadn't marked this question as answered yet, and basically asking whats up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I haven't got an answer to this problem either here or on the manufacturers site.&nbsp; I have had many other problems with Windows 10 as well, not just this printer thing.&nbsp; Plus I just don't like the look and feel of Windows 10, it does nothing for me that
 I cant do with Windows 7, or Windows XP for that matter.</p>
<p>So I have gone back to Windows 7.&nbsp; Windows 10 wanted to reinstall itself again, that's a whole other topic, but it is actually easily fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having gone back to Windows 7 I personally no longer have a problem.</p>
<p>But I do not consider that to be the same thing as having the question answered.&nbsp; The question has not really been answered as there may be people out there with the same situation who do wish to keep Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I will not mark this question as answered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Robert</p>

            <p>For anyone having problems connecting to their printers with Windows 10, you might want&nbsp;to try&nbsp;connecting via Bluetooth.&nbsp; I just got a new laptop, which has Windows 10 pre-installed (Windows 7 on my old laptop).&nbsp; I wasn't getting anywhere with wireless,
 so decided to try Bluetooth.&nbsp; It was really easy, and I can now print.&nbsp; I am connecting to an HP Photosmart printer, but I believe the Canon MP160 has Bluetooth capability as do other printers.&nbsp; FYI, I did not find any instructions with the HP printer that
 described how to set this up.&nbsp; Hopefully, newer models have some instructions.&nbsp; Also, if your computer or printer is not Bluetooth enabled, I believe there are adapters available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Bluetooth was turned off my laptop.&nbsp; To turn on in Windows 10, go to Settings/Devices/Bluetooth.&nbsp; After it is turned on, your Bluetooth enabled printer should come up on the list of devices.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I clicked to pair with the printer, I was asked for a
 passkey code for the printer.&nbsp; I had no idea what that should be, but when I went to the HP Photosmart printer and pressed the Setup button, I scrolled down to "Bluetooth Menu".&nbsp; I presume Canon has something similar.&nbsp; On the HP printer, I scrolled to Passkey,
 and 4 numbers were listed (newer printers have 6 numbers, I believe).&nbsp; I went back to the laptop and entered the 4 numbers.&nbsp; It took a&nbsp;minute or two to fully&nbsp;connect, then it was all set.&nbsp; I went to the printer again, though, because one of the Bluetooth scroll
 settings is for Security.&nbsp; I made sure it was set for High, which requires a passkey code for anyone to pair/connect to&nbsp;the printer.&nbsp; There is also a setting for Visibility.&nbsp; After setting my husband's laptop up via Bluetooth (he had not been able to use the
 printer since he upgraded to Windows 10), I set the Visibility to Invisible.&nbsp; So, other people in the vicinity (within 30 ft. or so) using Bluetooth, will not find our printer-- seems fairly secure.&nbsp; It's so easy to enable/disable Bluetooth in Windows 10,
 that we can enable it only when we want to print something if we feel we need the extra security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is of some help for those of you having trouble connecting to printers in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck,</p>
<p>Zoe</p>

Since it is a new Dell you need to be working with their support.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 includes full antivirus support - Windows Defender.</p>
<p>However Eset is a good one too.<br />

            <p>It's difficult to be 100% sure without more information from Toshiba, however I would read that as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Factory Default Reset</strong> - Return the PC to the state it was in when you bought it, i.e. with Windows on it, no personal files retained, and needing lots of updates.</li><li><strong>Erase Hard Disk</strong> - Completely wipe the hard drive ready for a manual installation of Windows or some other O.S. I would guess that this will also delete your Windows restore partition, but am not 100% sure.</li></ul>

<h2>            Network Bridge not showing up</h2>
                    I tried creating a network bridge between my LAN and wireless adapter but my laptop ran out of battery part way through. Now when I go on the properties of my wireless adapter it says that it is part of a network bridge. The issue is that the network bridge
 doesn't show up in the network sharing center or when I run the command line netsh bridge show adapter. I am now stuck, unable to create a bridge or remove the phantom one the wireless adapter seems to think it is part of. I have no system restore point to

I have a Lenovo Z500 and had tried the troubleshooting which came up with nothing.
<br />
<br />
I was going to try reinstalling the driver, but before I did decided to install the upgrade to Windows 8.1. This seems to have fixed it and I have now been able to create a network bridge which is visible.<br />

<p>to uninstall limeware because that was the cause to my virus. So i did, soon after I couldn't print? Now when I try to print the systems goes thru all the steps, the second window pops up to print, as I click on print, on the bottom the bar acts as if its

<p>I don't know what Best Buy did, but my guess is that they screwed up<br />
your computer.</p>
<p>It's too late now, but here's a piece of advice for you for the<br />
future: <strong>Never</strong> use Best Buy/the Geek Squad for any kind of computer<br />
advice or service. They are among the worst possible sources of help.</p>
<p>In fact, stay away from all big box stores for any kind of computer<br />
advice or service. Try to find a small local service company.</p>

<p>I don't know. But if I were in your shoes, I would be very concerned<br />
that had royally screwed up everything, and I would therefore probably<br />
do a clean reinstallation of Windows.</p>

<h2>            New Issues after updating to lastest windows update</h2>
                    <p>Okie....so....this a new pc i built....and iv had no issues with it till i updated to lastest windows....and then it all started...to go downhill....wohooo thanks microsoft...no issues till your forced update came in.....soo...lets start.....i overclock
 correctly to stable 4.7 on my 8700k....with all correct bios settings, no need to check those.....im on 1.3v to give extra juice to my cores, and iv had that for almost 2 months stable with no issues....and my ram using xmp profile 1, at 3000mhz....now....after
 the update i noticed task manager no longer displays my 3000mhz for ram speed, it is just reading my default 2133....and im assuming its causing some issues.....now every 30 - 40 seconds .....my (8700k) with a 150$ liquid cooler...is stuttering..and freezes
 completely...for 5 seconds....mouse....background...any apps i use...just completely freeze with no control...iv tried everything....i reset and completely removed everything on my ssd and clean installed 15 times...and now its just stuck....every time i clean
 install windows it always shows 2133.....before i updated for first time, it was always 3000...so somehow when i updated windows...it corrupted my ssd or bios somehow??? even tho im cleaning my ssd entirely deleting everything using my window's install cd...it
 still manages to say 2133, i even switched bios to default...and back to 3000 with xmp still nothing....even tried flashing bios...then i tried reseting bios like 50 times...nope...nothing works...so now im wondering if my ram is actually clocking at 3000
 or 2133....and the stuttering is there..any1 having this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>my specs...evga z370 ftw</p>
<p>msi 1080 x gaming</p>
<p>8700k cpu with liquid cooler</p>
<p>i have all updated drivers including graphics adapter...lit every single driver u can think of in the world..</p>
<p>did not touch any of my hardware since update...so what the heck is it?</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1709 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1709
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:
