<h2>            Black screen after preparing automatic repair</h2>
                    So when my computer is preparing automatic repair and finishes a black screen just shows up nothing else I've been waiting around 1 hour but nothing all I wanted to do is sadly is reset the PC for some reasons but I can't access the automatic repair to
 do that and I can't boot the PC normally now, just infinite loading I'm beginning to become worried, the computer is an Acer, by the way I saved some of my stuff on a USB key (not an backup)&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can't boot your system normally, I suggest you to perform a Startup Repair on your system and check if this helps in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let's perform a <strong>“Startup Repair”</strong> using Windows 10 bootable DVD or USB drive and check if that helps. Initiating repair from DVD may have different results.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup Repair is a Windows recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Startup Repair scans your computer for the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup Repair is one of the recovery tools in the System Recovery Options menu. This set of tools is located on your computer's hard disk and on the Windows installation disc.</p>
<p>

            <p>Ok umm yeah the information you gave might be helpful for other people but while in the night (June 20 at 12 pm)I tryied rebooting my PC, nope no differences infinite loading with the company name (Acer) and the black screen in the startup repair so I tryied
 pressing some buttons while rebooting my PC several times and I pressed shift and f2 and opened the the menu to boot from a disk and I tryed to look in the menu, found nothing so I left the menu, so I decided to do the same trick but with other buttons and
 then suddenly a startup sound (yes I enabled it) and then a blue loading screen (favorited colour set up: blue) appeared, waited around 30 minutes for some differences but nope so and I force shutdown and then the startup repair loading screen appears, but
 this time it worked so I wanted to reset my PC the fastest possible for any further errors, sorry that I dind't respond when I reseted my PC plus I don't read my mail very often and no I have no mail notifications enabled on my PC, well thx for the.&nbsp;</p>
<p>message it will maybe help other people. that was a true miracle that happened to</p>
<p>my PC and that's the only thing that I remember so.....</p>

    <title>Personalize Default User Profile in Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcw2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Personalize Default User Profile in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    Is this "unsupported," misguided, or just plain impossible?&nbsp; I'm setting up a new Windows 7 SP1 system.&nbsp; I've fully configured an administrator account that I want to become the template for future Standard User accounts, and now I'm trying to copy its
 profile into Default User so that new users start out with those tailored settings.&nbsp; Following precisely the instructions given in "Microsoft Windows 7 in Depth" by Cowart and Knittel, p.112, when I get to the Control Panel/System and Security/Advanced System
 Settings/User Profiles/Settings page, the "Copy To" button is grayed out for all accounts except "Default Profile" itself.&nbsp; It doesn't help to change the preconfigured administrator account to a Standard User first.<br />
<br />
I had successfully followed a similar procedure from an earlier Cowart and Knittel book on several Windows XP SP3 systems (including the one I'm working from now!) without any repercussions that I'm aware of .&nbsp; Perhaps Microsoft has disallowed it with SP1 in
 Win7 since the above-cited book was written?&nbsp; I've done some Google searching, but I haven't found any definitive answers to this question, and most of what I have found is quite old (2009-2010).&nbsp; For example, I found the following statement at http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/eff281a0-734f-4486-8dce-70a15964c24c/copy-profile-to-default?forum=w7itproinstall:<br />
<br />
"That scenario that was used to replace the Default User Profile was unsupported in Windows Vista,&nbsp;Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008&nbsp;and unsupported in Windows XP.&nbsp; There were many issues with it in the prior OSes, even though those issues were not always
 apparent, they did exist and caused inconsistencies and lingering problems.<br />
This&nbsp;article points to the supported way of updating the Default User profile which is the only profile that should be used to for creation of the new user profile.<br />
959753&nbsp;How to customize the default local user profile when you prepare an image of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003"<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the KB article referenced above now has a new title and refers only to using sysprep.exe to deploy system images.&nbsp; Further, the method is reported not to produce the desired result.<br />
<br />
Do I have to effectively start over and configure all new user accounts from scratch?&nbsp; Can somebody please give me the current (and hopefully definitive) answer? -- JCW2<br />

            The "Copy To" option in Users that worked in XP is disabled in Windows 7.&nbsp; If memory serves, Microsoft found it to be problematic in some way and disabled the feature.<br />

That sounds very promising, especially since I don't yet have any documents or e-mail of significance in the pre-configured Administrator account, just a lot of preference settings for Windows itself and for Office 2013.&nbsp; It would seem that it also does no
 damage to the original (pre-configured) account, which I will want to keep.&nbsp; Has anyone actually tried this method in my application?<br />
<br />
I presume Microsoft actually sanctions this procedure, since it's one of their own instructions.&nbsp; I wonder why they don't simply recommend it (avoiding the need to tamper with Default User) to all those people like me who are trying to "clone" settings to a
 new account??<br />
<br />
Any idea what aspects of the pre-configured account (if any, besides the name and password) I might lose, for ecample by not copying the three files named in the article? -- JCW2<br />

            The ntuser files are the user registry hive so settings that can be customized for individual user accounts would be lost.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this might apply to some of the&nbsp; Windows and Office settings you want to copy.<br />

</blockquote>
<br />
Oh well...&nbsp; I've been studying a bit, and I guess I don't have any other "supported" options.&nbsp; One fundamental problem seems to be that a user's registry hive is permanently associated with his/her original SID, so copying it to another user's profile probably
 would not cause problems without taking extreme measures.<br />
<br />
Before I actually use http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-corrupted-user-profile#1TC=windows-7, could you clarify a few points?<br />
<br />
1) The the "new_username" account that is created hold copies of the profile files from the "old_username" account being "fixed" is really intended to be a distinct name, right?&nbsp; In other words, at the end of the procedure the "old_username" account that's
 will be deleted and the user will just have to get used to the new name?<br />
<br />
2) Directly after step 4 of the first section (create new "new_username" account on a workgroup computer) comes a restart, followed immediately by logging on to a third unrelated account, followed by copying most files from the "old_username" to the "new_username"
 profiles.&nbsp; I was under the impression that a new user profile did not actually get created until the new user first logged on, but there are no cautions about this one way or the other.&nbsp; Can they really mean **not** to log onto the "new_username" account until
 **after** the copying is done?<br />
<br />
3) In step 2 of the second section, after logging on to the third user account, they want you to change to folder options of My Documents in "the folder with the name of **your account** [emphasis mine]"&nbsp; Does that mean the third-user account into which you
 are currently logged?&nbsp; Or does it mean one of the "old_username" or "new_username" profiles?<br />
<br />

&gt;<br />
I'm not clear on your question.&nbsp; I understood that you created an admin user to be used as a template for a new account.&nbsp; Is that what you mean by the "old_username" account?&nbsp; If so I guess you could keep it if you expect to use it again or not.<br />
<br />
&gt;2) Directly after step 4 of the first section (create new "new_username" account on a workgroup computer) comes a restart, followed immediately by logging on to a third unrelated account, followed by copying most files from the "old_username" to the "new_username"

&gt;<br />
I believe your impression is correct.&nbsp; You would have log into the newly created account once before you could apply this procedure.&nbsp; That first logon creates the User profile folders.<br />
<br />
&gt;3) In step 2 of the second section, after logging on to the third user account, they want you to change to folder options of My Documents in "the folder with the name of **your account** [emphasis mine]"&nbsp; Does that mean the third-user account into which you
 are currently logged?&nbsp; Or does it mean one of the "old_username" or "new_username" profiles?<br />
<br />
&nbsp; It means the means the My Documents folder of the administrator template user you're copying from to the "new_username" profile.<br />

OK, thanks a lot.&nbsp; I'll give it a try and report back.<br />
<br />
The only alternative I've come up with in the meantime is to change the name and type of the pre-configured administrator account to the name and type of an account that I ultimately want to use.&nbsp; (Of course I would still only have one configured account, which
 is not ideal.)&nbsp; Unfortunately, some Web research suggests that operation is a can of worms also, trying to get the account name changed in all of the relevant places.&nbsp; (At least I haven't seen anything from Microsoft saying it should not be done... yet.)&nbsp;
 Any thoughts on that option?<br />

In addition to the listed files (including Ntuser.dat.LOG1 and ...LOG2), there are also Ntuser(016888bd-...).TM.blf and ...regtrans.ms files -- seven files in all.&nbsp; I suppose I should not copy those over either? -- JCW2<br />

            <blockquote>I believe your impression is correct.&nbsp; You would have log into the newly created account once before you could apply this procedure.&nbsp; That first logon creates the User profile folders.<br />
</blockquote>
I could not make the "Fix corrupted user profile" procedure work.&nbsp; I did everything from a temporary Administrator account created for the purpose:<br />
<br />
First, we were right that the pre-configured profile cannot be copied until the new user has logged in because there is no profile folder to copy to.&nbsp; I did this login before the restart required in step 5 of the first section.<br />
<br />
On first login to the new user account, it looked fine (except not personalized, of course).&nbsp; But after following the copy/paste steps 8-10 in the second section (which required administrative consent to paste 10 of the folders, like "ReportArchive" -- and
 I did exclude all 7 files beginning with Ntuser), logging off the temporary administrative account, and logging into the new account, I got a series of three error messages:<br />
<br />
from Info: "Service has been disabled or deleted.&nbsp; The console cannot continue."<br />
from W8FC (my control overlay for the Window firewall): W8FC sercice not running."<br />
from BTTray: "Error: Unable to start Bluetooth service stack."<br />
<br />
For the above it appears to make no difference whether the new account is set up as a Standard User (what I ultimately want) or an Administrator.&nbsp; For the following further details it is an Administrator:<br />
<br />
W8FC will not even start from the Programs list (same complaint) even though Services shows its service present and started.&nbsp; On trying to open the Control Panel, or even Windows Explorer, I get another message:<br />
<br />
"Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file.&nbsp; You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."<br />
<br />
That was the last straw!&nbsp; I'm thinking I should start a new thread about this procedure to see if anybody understands or has successfully performed it... -- JCW2

            Sorry that didn't work out.&nbsp; I have actually used the procedure, but it is quite some time ago.&nbsp; I remember having a problem with some program that I attributed to the likelihood that it stored some setting in the user registry hive.&nbsp; I think I fixed it
 by reinstalling in the new user account.&nbsp; I wish MS had fixed and retained the copy profile functionality of XP.

<p>My surface pro 4 has been refusing to wake up every morning for the past couple of months too and during this period it used up to 70% of battery. I have given up hope of it getting fixed too.&nbsp;However, after the june 2016 update, it simply turns off in the
 middle of the night. I tried running a sleep study to find the reason for the turn off and&nbsp;it says "unrecognised sleep reason 11". I have attached a screenshot of the sleep study. From the screenshot, the surface exited CS because of a full wake (whatever
 that means). So looks like they cant solve the problem and therefore its programmed to turn off to preserve the battery when it experiences the sleep issue.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but xbox is not a charity for giving out free stuff in these circumstances, and asking for stuff is against forum rules.</p>

    <title>Useless Mystery Prize GTA V shark card code. Please - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Useless Mystery Prize GTA V shark card code. Please exchange&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So I won a GTA V sharkcard as a prize for completing some Game Pass Goals. The mystery gift i was awarded is absolutely worthless to me. I do not play GTA V, I feel the rewards if going to be a mystery gift should be better tailored to that individual gamers choice of games, CURRENTLY played games! Such as say my top 5 games I play. GTA wouldn’t even make my top 10. &nbsp;So I contacted Xbox Live customer support and they referred me to you guys. She tried and couldn’t exchange the myster gift code for the shark card but please, please, please could you guys? I have not redeemed the 25 digit code which is 500K GTA cash or about 5$ USD. I love the new system Xbox Live has integrated giving gamers initiative to actual get rewarded for paying hudndreds of dollars and putting an un-godly amount of hours at the joysticks. I love it, it’s fun. Gives me something more than say just “ In game achievements, challenges, and rewards”. My top 3 games would be Battlefield 1, Call of Duty W

<h2>            Touchpad not functioning correctly after Windows 10 update on 8 June</h2>
                    Touchpad not functioning correctly after Windows 10 update on 8 June 2018<br />
<br />
The touchpad on my laptop is not functioning correctly.&nbsp; I can't resize to enlarge documents using the 2 fingers.&nbsp; I can't scroll anymore up, down, or sideways using the touchpad.&nbsp; I can't move the mouse pointer anymore. The only function that is working is
 the tap or double tap.<br />
<br />
The above problems may have happened after the Windows 10 Update on 8 June 2018.

            Hi Bongo.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the touchpad software from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.
<br />
<br />Then check the controls to adjust as necessary at Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Touchpad.
<br />
<br />Also there under Additional Options click the touchpad tab on Mouse Properties to adjust any settings needed there, including ticking the box to "Disable touchpad when external pointing device is attached" to avoid palm-drag on touchpad causing cursor to jump.
<br />
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update (which you can check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I have a similar problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am an IT analyst and after the update, a client's laptop touchpad freezes after using the Markups.&nbsp;&nbsp; The difference that I can see is that Word now has balloons instead of just the markups in the righthand column.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a number of things - even went so far as to rebuild the device and adjust the settings so the balloons would not display, but alas the track changes and markup seem not to display as they should since the June 8 update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't necessarily want to remove the updates, but I will try to remove all June 8 updates to see if that does the trick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just thought this may be helpful to isolate the issue as the trackpad only stops working for us when using the above feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 In the past I don't recall balloons appearing - only text off to the side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The end user is used to the right-side markups and was too much of a change to use the review pane and it also didn't show exactly where the changes were....</p>

<p>Hello Lisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I highly recommend updating your Microsoft account password right away. The moment that your laptop connects to the Internet, it will prompt to verify the password again once you've changed it. You can refer to these support articles for the steps on how
 to update your password:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026838/microsoft-account-to-change-your-microsoft-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="To change your Microsoft account password"><strong>To change your Microsoft account password</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026971/microsoft-account-how-to-reset-your-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to reset your Microsoft account password"><strong>How to reset your Microsoft account password</strong></a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the local user account has administrative permission, it will have the capability to modify and even delete local files. You still have the option to restore deleted files or folders if it's synced with OneDrive. You can check this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restore-deleted-files-or-folders-in-onedrive-949ada80-0026-4db3-a953-c99083e6a84f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Restore deleted files or folders in OneDrive">

</span><br />
<strong><span>If the issue does not persist in Safe Mode, you can try troubleshooting this matter with a Clean Boot to see if we can pinpoint a program or driver that could be causing a conflict that is not letting you to play the Game.<br />
<br />
You have boot normally before performing Clean boot.<br />
<br />
A Clean Boot allows us to start Windows with certain programs and drivers turned off or on by selection. By doing this through trial-and-error we can hopefully pinpoint a specific cause of this issue. Here is how to troubleshoot with a Clean Boot:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Hey,
</span></strong><strong><span><br />
<br />
</span></strong><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Did anything change on your system right before this problem occurred- Any new hardware devices installed?&nbsp; Any new software or updates
 installed?<br />
<br />
May I know the security software installed on your computer?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You can check if the issue persists in “</span></strong><strong><span>Safe
 Mode with Networking”.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Refer the link below in order to get into “</span></strong><strong><span>Safe
 Mode with Networking”:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>First Step: Perform a Clean Boot
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Log on to your computer with an administrative account.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>2. Click Start.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>3.&nbsp; Type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>4. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>5. In the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to uncheck the Load startup items check box.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>6. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>*NOTE: Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services.
 If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Second Step: Enable Half of the Services
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Start the System Configuration Utility. Refer to the steps above if you need to see how to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>2. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>3.&nbsp; Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>4. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Third Step: Determine whether the problem returns
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat the First Step and the Second Step. In the Second Step, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service
 list.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat the First Step and the Second Step. In the Second Step, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service
 list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to the Sixth Step. If no service causes
 this problem, go to the Fourth Step.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Fourth Step: Enable Half of the Startup Items
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1.&nbsp; Perform a clean boot by repeating step 1.
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>2. Click the Startup tab and then click to select half of the check boxes in the Startup Item list.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>3. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Fifth Step: Determine Whether the Problem Returns
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat the First Step and the Fourth Step. In the Fourth Step, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup
 Item list.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat the First Step and the Fourth Step. In the Fourth Step, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup
 Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is
 causing the problem. Go to the Sixth Step.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat the First
 Step and the Second Step without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Sixth Step: Resolve the Problem
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the
 System Configuration Utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Seventh Step: Resolve the Problem
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1.&nbsp; Click Start</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>2.&nbsp; Type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>3.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>4. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>5. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

</p><p>Ultimately it is a 10 year old printer, Canon will not support it and want you to replace it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows printer installation is mostly automatic but it does have some drivers incorporated for manual installation. There is little guidance as to which driver to select as they are defined as "class" drivers so all you could do is experiment.</p>

<h2>            Wifi not working Code 37</h2>
                    <p>Hello Sir/Ma'am<br />
<br />
I am currently using windows 10 developers preview<br />

<br />
Last night my windows updated to this version and since the update my WiFi has stopped working and i am unable to fix the issue.<br />
I have followed all of the following steps in the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues<br />

I have tried resetting the network Through Network Reset from the settings and i have tried uninstalling the driver through device manager and then restarting the PC. Yet I am unable to fix the issue.<br />
<br />
It was working fine before the update and i am able to connect the internet through LAN Cable.<br />

Make sure ur system is clean first. use ccleaner to get rid of junkfiles <a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download</a></p>
also check for viruses i.e. using avast and spyware using superantispyware<br />
<br />
go to msconfig (type in searchbox in startmenu or run in xp then press enter) then prepare ur pc for clean boot by disabling all startup items and none windows services then restart ur computer. See if it make a difference? if it did then you have to find out
 which ones caused the problem.<br />
<br />
you might also need to find out what <span style="font-weight: bold">"</span>questviewer.exe" is? does it belong to a program? if the answer is yes try updating or re-installing the program but before that make sure that the program is not hamful to ur pc.<br />

                    I have installed the Win10 upgrade on a LenovoE73. It works sometimes, but at other times hangs unexpectedly. The mouse and keyboard are nonresponsive. &nbsp;The only fix I have found is to push the power button until the PC shuts off and try again!

<h2>            Connecting xbox one to external logitech speakers</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone.</p><p>So I have an xbox one and I am looking to get audio from my xbox to my external logitech speakers. My monitor, unfortunately, does not have a 3.5mm jack or any audio whatsoever, so that is why I need audio on my speakers. My speakers use 3.5mm connection, so is there anyway to connect the xbox ones audio to the speakers while having the video go to my monitor?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks!!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 weird internet problem</h2>
                    I installed Windows 10 on my PC and when it was done the internet started going screwy. It says it's connected, and it's not limited, and yet, If I go on a website in Chrome it says Unable to access the network. So I tried going on the firewall and making
 sure google was allowed. But it's not just Chrome. It's Microsoft Edge, (New W10 browser) and all of the computer. I can't set up Cortana because it says "something went wrong". And now the weird part. If I search on google it gives me results. But when I
 click on one then I get the error. E<em>xcept with YouTube and&nbsp;Wikipedia!</em> Which I can go on like there's no internet problem! If tried all sorts of thing ranging from restarting the router, to disabling webroot, the firewall, everything. Please help me
 if you can.

</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Hari, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand the inconvenience that you are experiencing. I will definitely assist you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let try simple troubleshooting steps and check if it helps resolving the issues. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>In order to perform system restore the Virtual Disk and Volume Shadow copy must run on the system background. So, I suggest you to check if both programs are running on computer background.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and type <strong>
services.msc</strong> and hit <strong>enter.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now locate for <strong>Virtual disk</strong> and <strong>
Volume Shadow copy </strong>on the list.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the programs are not running rick click on the program and click on run.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persist try the below method provided.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend you to boot on <strong>Clean boot</strong> sate and try to perform system restore.
<strong>Clean boot</strong> process will help you determine which third party program/app that is causing this issue. It could be some other application or programs, which runs on the computer at the background, leading to this issue. Please visit the below
 link on how to perform <strong>Clean boot.</strong></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></p>
