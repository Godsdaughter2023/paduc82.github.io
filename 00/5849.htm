<h2>            restarting to install 17704 with blue screen &#40;microcode prevision mismatch&#41;</h2>
                    ive been trying to install the new insider build for my pc 17704.1000 and it gave me the blue screen after clicking restart to update. says updating, and after post boot. it gives a blue screen with the microcode prevision mistmatch on it. not sure what
 is causing it, might be a unknown bug and only affecting a few. i run a amd a10 6800k cpu, 12gb ram, asrock extreme6 fm2-a85x motherboard. and a samsung evo 500gb ssd, gave the same error on another ssd as well. tried to do a full format and reinstalled windows
 10 and it is still happening the same way. thought it was maybe something with a corrupt file so tried that first

<p>Before hiting restart, use UUPtoISO or&nbsp;uup-converter-wimlib-18 to compile the ESD files into an ISO, then you can mount that iso and upgrade from within Windows by running 'setup.exe'.</p>
<p>There are plenty of tutorials out there if you need more details.</p>

    <title>Narrating PowerPoint across slide transitions - audio fade problem in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jolson46  say:</h3>
<h2>            Narrating PowerPoint across slide transitions - audio fade problem in 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I am in the process of converting some of my college PowerPoint lectures to video, and the narration recording in PowerPoint 2013 was initially very cooperative on my office laptop. However, when I attempted to complete one of the videos on my home laptop I
 realized that PowerPoint 2010 couldn't save the shows as mp4s and so I subscribed to Office 365 to upgrade my personal Office suite.<br />
<br />
However, I noticed that on *my* version of PowerPoint 2013 the audio playback momentarily fades if I'm narrating across slide transitions and I have not been able to solve the problem. Some things that have me confused:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- This was not an issue in 2010. The narrations played back with the appropriate timing of animations/transitions and no audio fade.</p>
<p>- If I do the recording in 2010, and then open/playback the file in 2013, there is no fade.</p>
<p>- I originally experimented with creating these videos on my copy of PowerPoint 2013 at work and there is NO fade if I record with that program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to hunt for some setting in my personal copy of PowerPoint that might be resulting in the audio fade and I am stumped. I can not find any differences between the two computers. I've seen people in some forums that there is no way to avoid this,
 but I know for a fact that it can be done!<br />
<br />
Please help - I want to uninstall my personal 2010 Office suite (because the two versions are not playing nice), but right now it seems like I have to keep PPT 2010 around if I want to record when I'm not at the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jen</p>
<p />

            <p>I have the same problem. My videos and sound were recorded in PP2013. I checked all three settings, and all were set as described. Playback's Fade in/out settings are 0s, Transition tab is set to "no sound". I've converted multiple time, and in all cases
 the transitions create an undesired audio fade in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another setting elsewhere that can be checked?</p>

    <title>scrolling within email not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mazman19  say:</h3>
<h2>            scrolling within email not working</h2>
                    <p>1. I canot scroll within an email - which I used to be able to do but has recently stopped functioning. &nbsp;Any ideas as to how to fix this? &nbsp;I can scroll using the scroll bar at the right of the panel when viewing the list of emails, but if I open an email
 I can't scroll up or down within it. &nbsp;I can see the scroll bar but cannot grab it or use it. &nbsp;I am using a Mac/Safari and have tried emptying cache, refreshing etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Am starting this thread because although I found a similar thread already started (albeit with no adequate solutions as far as I could see) I was not able to reply or contribute to the thread. &nbsp;When I clicked in 'reply' it didn't work; a small 'no entry'
 symbol, a circle with a line through it , appeared. Any ideas why?</p>
<p>3. I use <a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.com</a>&nbsp;(actually a hotmail.com email address) i.e. web-based email. &nbsp;I stress that because sometimes in these discussions there seems to be confusion stemming from answers that are proffered which apply to Outlook
 but not Outlook.com (i.e. the web based version).&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a year or more I have grievously suffered with the same issue--whenever they last fixed what ain't broke and then wouldn't fix what they broke fixing what
<em>worked fine before</em>! &nbsp;I found this thread from over a year ago&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-osend/new-outlook-mail-scroll-bar/4acf531c-fa52-4af5-90c9-d538d284873c?auth=1 and tried to reply but it wouldn't let me. &nbsp;Like
 the poor souls who posted there, I did everything it said to do and <em>none of it</em> fixed a
<em>dang thing</em>!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time in Safari, which is my default browser, I want to read an email longer than the length of the screen, I have to select the text and drag down. &nbsp;If I want to write one, rather than risk accidentally typing over or deleting what I wrote by highlighting
 and dragging text in the compose mode and then maybe accidentally hitting a wrong key, I have to quit out of Safari, open Firefox, hunt down Outlook Mail, and sign in all over again to compose and send my message! &nbsp;When I am finished, I send and then quit
 Firefox and go back into Safari. &nbsp;Every time I open Firefox it gets all excited with its tongue hanging out panting for me to make it my default browser which is a thing I will
<em>never do</em> unless <em>desperately driven</em> to it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is only this ONE ISSUE in this ONE PROGRAM (reading or writing in Outlook Mail) preventing my using Safari ALL THE TIME. &nbsp;Naturally I wish people would immediately address the issue of their silly fixes ruining something which once worked perfectly well,
 but I screamed myself hoarse for years along with countless other iTunes users and a fat lot of good
<em>that</em> did. &nbsp;I suppose this won't either but thanks for providing these forums so we can at least vent.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
We need to isolate this issue so that we could figure out if it's an issue with accessing Outlook.com in Safari or with the Outlook server. You can try to access your account using the web browser on other devices so that we can see if you will be able to scroll
 within an email. This will also help us to confirm if the problem is with the Safari browser or not.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your update.

            Thanks, this is strictly an Outlook/Safari issue. &nbsp;Scrolling within an email on Outlook
<em>does not work</em> in Safari on <strong>ANY</strong> device I have (three computers of various types and ages and an iPhone). &nbsp;I haven't tried it on devices which are not mine as most places such as libraries do not have Macs. &nbsp;It DOES work in Firefox on
 EVERY device, so NOT a Mac issue, JUST a Safari issue!

            Hi Cornelia,<br />
<br />
The information you provided really helps us to confirm that the issue is not with the device, or with the Outlook.com servers. It turns out that there's an issue with the Safari browser that's why you're unable to scroll within an email. In some cases, this
 occurs if there's an update applied to a browser which is incompatible to some functionality in a web page. We recommend that you contact the Apple Support team for them to address this issue.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

            Thanks for your suggestion of contacting Apple! &nbsp;There seems to be no way to email Apple Support, but I went onto the community and someone mentioned scrolling works in the Beta version of Outlook Mail. &nbsp;It is the godawfulest-looking thing, but the scrolling
 DOES work and switching to the Beta, at least to read longer messages, seems preferable to reopening Outlook in Firefox. &nbsp;I may still need to go into Firefox to
<em>compose</em> longer messages if I can't find a decent-looking version of the Beta!

<h2>            Audio output</h2>
                    <p>Skype 7 and previous versions for macOS had separate speaker settings for incoming calls and voice audio. In my setup the ring tone came through the computer speakers and when the call was answered, the audio came through the headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Skype 8 there is one single speaker setting, which means that all types of audio – ring tones and voice audio – are routed to one single source. If the sound is routed to my headset and I’m away from the computer, I cannot hear incoming calls. If the
 sound is routed to the computer speakers, Skype in effect becomes a speaker phone, which is not what I want.</p>

            <p>Hi bumblebeehiggins,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your time and efforts in posting to our forum. It seems that you're having issues on your Outlook emails no longer syncing with your Android phone. Is this correct?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, this issue usually happens when your account went out of sync with the phone, or the mail server settings were not configured properly. You can resolve this by removing and re-adding your account from the phone. Check out this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook-to-go#1TC=t1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> for the steps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists, please confirm if you're using the Outlook.com app or your phone's built in email app in accessing your emails. Does issue persists on another account on your phone? Was there any error messages? Please provide it here. In addition, please
 provide the affected email address on the private message I've created for further investigation.&nbsp; Make sure that you're signed in here to view the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're looking forward on your response. We appreciate your cooperation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

    <title>Fake BSOD which modern solutions do not apply to &#40;windows 10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maxcowen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fake BSOD which modern solutions do not apply to &#40;windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    My computer recently received a PUP file in a download. The file multiplied before I could use Malwarebytes to scan, and created a fake bsod and multiple clones of itself. The BSOD has a fake error message ( the standardized BSOD they use is pre- Windows
 8) and claims I can get support by calling a toll free number. I know this part is fake. However, the PUP also installed a group policy on my computer which bans my access to windows defender, recovery, and the taskbar/ keyboard commands. I attempted to fix
 it through Malwarebytes and shutting down processes which were recent and did not relate to the services I use in task manager, but this has not solved it. The only way I can access anything in my computer is through file explorer. I've even tried changing
 my desktop background. I also have tried a hard reboot, but that failed. Could someone please help me fix this fake BSOD? Have I necessarily attempted all solutions?

            <p>I installed Perfectdisk 13 Pro build #821 on windows 8.1 - then did an "upgrade" to the first preview build of windows 10 and it worked with no problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>everything continued to work correctly until upgrading Windows 10 from Build#9860 to #9879 - this broke perfectdisk.exe&nbsp; (and MSFT Office 2013 winword.exe, outlook.exe etc) with the following error</p>
<p>
</p><p>"the application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000022) click OK to continue"&nbsp; - in terms of MS Office attempted a "repair install" under add/remove programs&nbsp; (programs &amp; features) in control panel - reboot - same problem..&nbsp; going to try a clean install
 of office 2013 professional plus.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>now for Perfectdisk this is an upgraded patch to build #842&nbsp; but it appears to do "version checking"
</p>
<p>and will say "not supported OS" - you can do "compatibility mode" for win8 on the patch and the install gets farther (probably have to dig down to all the individual files and do "compatibility mode")

<h3> andersmeis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onenote unsharing and re-sharing</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use OneNote and OneDrive through Office 365 for Business.</p>
<p>We have several OneNote documents that are shared from one employee's OneDrive to the rest of the department.&nbsp;<br />
After a migration to another HR-system, some email adresses were altered, including the username of the person who shared the OneNote documents.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>This resulted in all sharing links throwing an error message when trying to access a path that no longer exists. No one paid much attention to this to start with, so changes have been made an all local versions of the shared documents that are currently
 unsynced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we relink the shared documents for all users, without losing the changes made over a couple of weeks?</p>
<p>I assume if the one who shared the document unshares it, then re-shares it, the link between the unsynced versions will be lost? Or?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any inputs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>/Anders</p>

<br />
Always state your IE version and&nbsp;full Windows version (e.g., WinXP SP3) when posting in a forum or newsgroup. Please do so in your next reply.<br />
<br />
Define "it stopped working,"&nbsp;please?

<p>Pfft, Thanks for attempting to answer the question, "Pa Bear MS MVP"</p>
<p><br />
Here's the deal, Nita Barnette, you posted your question on January 02, 2010, since IE8 was release March 19th, 2009, I'm going to assume that's the version of Internet Explorer you're having problems with.<br />
<br />
I have two reasons for assuming this;<br />
a) It's the latest version.<br />
b) I *just* had the same error, and it was when I installed Internet Explorer 8.<br />
<br />
So here's the fix:<br />
As I mentioned I was having the same problem with a WindowsXP install I was doing by hand onto a VMWware server. As my ISO file of Windows XP was not faulty (md5 was good) I looked into the error.<br />
<br />
The error I was getting was exactly the same as yours;<br />
<br />
"<em>The procedure entry point RunSetupCommandW could not be located in the dynamic link library ADVPACK.dll</em> "<br />
<br />
Every time I would try to fire up IE8 the system would hang (sort of, explorer.exe wouldn't respond).<br />
Turns out, reinstalling Internet Explorer 8 did the trick. I used IE8-WindowsXP-x86-ENU.exe (Published 19mar2009, 16.1MB download) from Microsoft.com<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=341C2AD5-8C3D-4347-8C03-08CDECD8852B&amp;displaylang=no&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=341C2AD5-8C3D-4347-8C03-08CDECD8852B&amp;amp;displaylang=no&amp;displaylang=en</a><br />
<br />
In the event that link doesn't work anymore, just google the following (without quotes);<br />
<br />
"site:microsoft.com IE8-WindowsXP-x86-ENU.exe".<br />
<br />
Good luck to whomever finds this fix useful!<br />
<br />
Signed, you're fly-by-night UNIX admin.<br />
<br />
(P.S: I'm posting this fix on every forum that has someone suffering from the same error.)</p>

<p>I have just received this error also.&nbsp;&nbsp; My PC is running XP SP2 (I know, needs to be updated).&nbsp; IE6 had been running on my machine.&nbsp; Tonight I downloaded IE8 (which took hours).&nbsp; After it finished, I rebooted the machine.&nbsp; When it came back up, I tried to
 open Explorer and got the ie4uinit.exe message as stated above.&nbsp; Researching this error, one site led me to believe it could be a registry error.&nbsp; So I tried to run my System Mechanic Pro (which I had just recently installed a few days ago) to see if it found
 any registry errors.&nbsp; Now it won't start either....get a message that says "The specified procedure could not be found".</p>
<p>Is your solution above suggesting that I go through the whole installation procedure again?&nbsp; If so, how am I going to do that if I can't get to the internet?</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>Hmmm....interesting follow-up note...... you know how you sometimes get the message when you startup that says "updates are available for your machine"?&nbsp; Well, I had been getting that for awhile and hadn't had time to apply them.&nbsp; so I decided that I might
 as well do that now because maybe there was something out of date that prevented IE8 from running.&nbsp; Well, after clicking the first couple of buttons to get the updates going, it opens a window that says<strong>"Some updates could not be installed".&nbsp;
</strong>Then, in an imbedded box that is titled<strong>"The following updates were not installed: ",</strong> it lists
<strong>Internet Explorer 8 for Windows XP</strong>.&nbsp; I'm not sure if that means IE8 was not installed or that the updates that it was supposed to do following installation and the re-boot.</p>

<p><br />
Injudicious use of System Mechanic and its ilk may have <em>caused</em> your problems!</p>
<p>If you ever think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, or optimized (it doesn't), read&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099</a> and draw your own conclusions.

            Hello
<br />
<br />Sign in to OneDrive using the same Microsoft account that’s tied to your Office  subscription. Look in the lower left corner of the OneDrive screen to see your current available storage. That number is equal to your total available storage minus whatever storage is currently in use.
<br />
<br />To see full details about available OneDrive storage, click the Get More Storage link in the bottom left of the OneDrive screen. That opens a web page.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help. 
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>I just got my new mac and have office/outlook 2016 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to arrange my outlook in a way where I only receive email at 10am and 4pm. Idealy I would be able to sent the emails I write.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read a few articles regarding this, but they are all focust on outlook for windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In outlook 2016 there is no sent &amp; receive section where I can customize things. Only in the rules section, but it doesn't give me the option to specify hours in which emails gets received in to my account, only days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone who can help me with this?</p>

<h2>            Activation of Office Home &#38; Business 2013 that was installed by Best Buy&#47;GeekSquad on new laptop</h2>
                    <p>When I bought a new laptop last year using Windows 8.1, I also purchased Office Home &amp; Business 2013 (key card).&nbsp; This was done at a Best Buy where they offered to install it for me.&nbsp; I didn't think about the Microsoft account issues at the time and okayed
 it.&nbsp; I've been using other components of Office (Word and Excel) during the year with no issues, but finally got around to going through the process of copying my Outlook 2003 file to my new computer and setting up Outlook 2013.&nbsp; Everything was going fine
 until it wanted to activate and asked for either my email address or the product key.&nbsp; Entering my email address comes up with no Office 2013 activated and entering the product key results in the website wanting to download and install Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides not wanting to waste the time downloading all of this software over a DSL line when it's already installed, I'm concerned about losing settings or even data files during the process (i.e. will the existing software be uninstalled first?).&nbsp; I've also
 seen a lot of issues regarding re-installing Office 2013 due to Microsoft's attempts at preventing piracy.&nbsp; I contacted GeekSquad online and ultimately was told to contact Microsoft to see if they knew what to do.&nbsp; An interesting footnote to all of this is
 that my Microsoft account info now lists this Office product as a "recent" purchase dated 09/30/2013 when I actually bought it on 08/04/2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>I never did get a response from the Community, but decided to physically go to the Best Buy store that had installed the Office 2013 for me and get their Geek Squad's advice.&nbsp; Turns out that they'd created another Microsoft Account in order to download the
 software.&nbsp; I was told that I should have received a document with the account name and password to use.&nbsp; I don't remember receiving this.&nbsp; With the help of the employee and his knowledge of how his fellow employees work, we managed to identify the account
 name and get the password changed to what I wanted it to be.&nbsp; When I got home, I used this to activate my Outlook and wasn't required to install anything.</p>

<p><span>Hi Abh,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems that you enable some add-ins in your Excel 2016 applications. I suggest you run Excel 2016 in
</span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a> to check if the issue goes away.
 If yes, I suggest you disable some add-ins to see the result in the normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, I suggest you check if you are using the latest version of the Excel 2016 application. If no, update the version first, restart the computer and then
 do a test to see the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, upload a full screenshot of the Account page in the Excel 2016 application you are using. You can access the page via File&gt;Account.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></p>

 can't remember enough to access it. As I said I made it many many years ago and so I probably didn't put much thought into what I wrote in the boxes&nbsp;<br />
Is there any way I can get in to my account?&nbsp;

<p>That application is not to be used with Outlook but with Windows Mail which is part of Windows Vista and not of Office. Which application are you using? Microsoft Office Outlook or Windows Mail?</p>
<p>Also note that th WMUtil application is a 3rd party application.</p>
