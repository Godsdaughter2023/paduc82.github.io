    <title>Printing problem in Excel 2003, 2007, 2010, 2013...Fixed in Office - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Printing problem in Excel 2003, 2007, 2010, 2013...Fixed in Office 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When spreadsheets contain text, the appearance on screen differs radically from what appears in print preview and actual printouts. Lines that fit perfectly on screen are suddenly too long and drop down, causing lines below to disappear. Even if everything
 looks perfect in print preview, content can be lost. I've had the same problem in successive versions of Office, on different computers, and with different printers, so I think it's a bug in Excel. It's one of many bugs, but it causes me the most grief.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I received a "Technet Flash Newsletter" from Microsoft announcing Office 2016. I'd like to know if this problem has finally been fixed. Otherwise I won't be paying yet again for another downward upgrade.

<p>
</p><p>I've had the problem with several different PDF converters and printers on several different computer. My drivers are up to date. I'm looking at an example right now. The word "Europe" is in the left column of a table. It fits perfectly with space to spare
 on the right. In print preview, the final "e" drops down to the next line. I'm seeing the same thing with PDF, XPS and Brother MFC printer drivers. Another box has three lines of text. In the editing screen, the text fits fine in the box, but in print preview,
 PDF, XPS and on paper, the line spacing expands slightly so parts of the text spill over the top and bottom lines.

            I should add, that tables, graphs and text print out exactly as shown on screen in Word and PowerPoint. The problem only happens in Excel.

<p>The ones I posted look that way because the screen shots were taken on a system running Windows 7 with Aero turned on. The dialogs in the same programs running on Windows XP, or in Windows 7 with a classic theme, would look like the ones you describe. This
 is not an Office issue, but a Windows one. On your system, do dialogs in any program have the new look?</p>
<p>The ribbon isn't affected by the same issue because it ignores the Windows theme. Only the color scheme that you can choose in the (Word/Excel/PowerPoint) Options dialog affects the ribbon.</p>

<h3> deanpaus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office has stopped working &#40;again&#33;&#41;&#58; &#34;A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if solution is available.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Last night I was working on Microsoft Excel, Word and PowerPoint files and this morning when I woke up my computer (i.e. didn't reboot) I had one Excel spreadsheet open and I could continue using it (e.g. using 'Data Analysis'), but when I closed it down (I
 didn't want to save the file) and tried to open a Word document, PowerPoint presentation or Excel spreadsheet NONE of them opened. The only thing I did with my computer yesterday was work on Office documents and use the internet (i.e. no programs installed
 etc.).<br />
<br />
The following happens when I attempt to open any Microsoft Office program.<br />
1) a pop-up window appears saying "Microsoft Word has stopped working" or "Microsoft Excel..." etc.<br />
2) the window message changes to "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if solution is available."<br />
<br />
I rebooted and tried to open files again. Same thing.&nbsp;<br />
When I'm prompted to start in Safe Mode the same error messages appear.<br />
<br />
I have tried to 'Repair' Microsoft Office through the Control Panel. After rebooting, I started up Word and got a message "Word failed to launch in safe mode. Do you want to start repair?" I answered Yes and went through the repair process again to no avail.</p>
<p><br />
I have tried to do a System Restore, selecting from all available restore points (5) before today. Each restore didn't work, I got a message saying "System Restore failed while mounting the registry from the restore point. An unspecified error occurred during
 System Restore. (08x800705aa)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 7 and have Microsoft 2010. I don't have the original installation materials/instructions to uninstall and reinstall (I can't even remember how I got Office on this laptop - it may have come with it installed.).<br />
<br />
This problem happened just over a year ago and I found a solution somewhere online that led me to uninstall all the recent automatic updates to Microsoft Office programs. That solved the problem. This time I cannot locate any updates in Control Panel to uninstall.<br />
<br />
I also tried instructions at https://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541 and https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-get-a-stopped-working-error-when-I-start-Office-2016-or-2013-applications-on-my-PC-52bd7985-4e99-4a35-84c8-2d9b8301a2fa?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US
 (steps 1-3) and some at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/921541/how-to-troubleshoot-problems-that-occur-when-you-start-or-use-word, but the problem hasn't been solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has happened and how do I fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dean</p>

<p>PROBLEM SOLVED (I can't find a way to delete my original question).</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI the updates magically appeared in "<em>Installed Updates</em>" after&nbsp;<span>"<em>No updates are installed on this computer</em>" had been showing when I tried to view them several times before. So I uninstalled all the
 updates for Microsoft Office (except two that failed to uninstall) and this solved the problem. I have now changed my update settings to prevent updates to Office by unchecking "<em>Give me updates for Microsoft products and check for new optional Microsoft
 software when I update Windows</em>", and also changed update settings to "<em>Download updates but let me choose whether to install them</em>". Hopefully I won't get this problem a third time.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open new tabs</h2>
                    I'm trying to get away from Firefox and use Internet Explorer, but this morning my "Open In A New Tab" option disappeared from my right click menu.&nbsp; I've updated from the Microsoft web site, I've right-clicked on the IE icon and opened it without add-ons,
 and I've started it from the start orb "run" option with the -extoff at the end of the command, but no matter what I do the result is the same.&nbsp; Here is a picture of my screen showing the menu I get when I right-click a link from the favorites menu.<br />

<br />
This is interesting becuase when I ckecked my shortcuts accessing them from&nbsp;Favorites in the Menu Bar I didn't have an option to open then in a new tab either yet when I accessed my Favorites from the Favorites Toolbar I DID have the option to open them in
 a new tab.&nbsp; Have you checked to see if this option is missing from both locations in your browser or if it is just missing from Favorites in the Menu Bar.&nbsp; Let me know what you find.<br />
<br />
Thanks,&nbsp;

<p>b) I transfer all the data produced (also OneNote Notebooks) to my new office 365 account&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Corinne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have asked three questions, I will answer them one by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">Q: How can I ensure that I do not lose any data.</span></p>
<p>A: Generally, the data won't lose when you transfer it, but in case this happens, we suggest you download the data to your local drive and check all the files after you finish the transfer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-style: italic">Q: How can I transfer all the data produced to my new Office 365 account.</span></p>
<p>A: We’d like to inform you that you need to manually transfer the data to your new Office 365 account since the data is related to the current Office 365 account. For example, you can download all the files from your current account and then upload them
 to the new one. While for the notebooks on your Office 365 school account, you can follow the steps below to merge the section to your personal account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Add both your school account and your private account on OneNote, open all the notebooks in your school account and your private account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Right click on a section and select <strong>Merge into Another Section </strong>
to merge it to the notebook stored on your private account. Repeat the action until all contents are copied to your notebook stored on your private account.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e341eb9-6feb-4db0-bc1f-69c7f7be94fc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e341eb9-6feb-4db0-bc1f-69c7f7be94fc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Q: How can I make sure the school I am at cannot access my data from the past.</p>
<p>A: After you transfer or save all the data to your new account, you can ask your school IT admin to delete your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>

<p>Hi Garry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We can see here that you are having issues accessing the Outlook.com. This can be an issue with the email application, browser or server itself. For us to properly identify what is causing this issue, we suggest that you follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Close your browser and perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong>. It will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers
 and start up programs. It will also eliminate software conflicts that could occur when you install a program, or an update, or when you run a program in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Many security programs includes "ad-blocking" protection. Go through your security programs currently running and check &amp; disable any ad-blocking feature, web blocking, antivirus etc. feature. You may also disable your add-ins.<br />
<br />
3. Optimize your browser, clear browser's cache and temporary internet files to make sure that this is not a browser issue. Once done, try to access again
<strong>https://outlook.live.com/owa/</strong> using a different web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, please check if you are able to access Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result of the suggested steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Anne and thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I have been using Firefox to open Outlook for a while now and this is a new issue for the last few days.</p>
<p>I can open outlook fine on internet explorer but I still am bombarded by constant advertising. That is why I went to Firefox in the first place.</p>
<p>As a personal preference the Firefox system is a bit nicer to use than IE and both are way nicer than googles and Mac. It is just all the the adds.</p>
<p>I am not going to take out the Firefox add ons.</p>
<p>I have opened a Thunderbird account and that works fine. Too bad as Outlook was nicer and easy to work with. It was my favorite.</p>
<p>I wish you well and good luck.</p>
<p>Garry</p>

<h2>            Samsung SGH-i917 Update</h2>
                    I am really getting irritated. It's June of 2014. I updated my Samsung SGH-i917 OS to 7.10. What about the software update?! The phone is at 7.5 and I would like to update the software to 7.8. So I go to Zune on phone and computer (Zune 4.8) and Zune on
 the computer tells me my phone is up to date but only the OS is up to date the software is still at 7.5. Do I need a valid SIM? I would like the advantages of Windows 7.8.

            <p>Howdy JosephSurling,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your mobile operator needs to approve the Windows Phone&nbsp;7.8 update before the Zune software will install it onto your Samsung Focus.&nbsp;You will&nbsp;want to contact them in order to see if they can help you upgrade your phone to that update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a mobile operator and the Zune software still says your phone is up-to-date, that is unfortunately as far as it goes. There isn't a supported way to go beyond that update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps to address your issue. As always if you have any additional questions or concerns, please feel free to reply to this post and we'll be happy to assist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Bryce B </p>

<h2>            EXCEL PREVIEW PANE ENLARGED</h2>
                    <p>I was upgraded to Microsoft office 365 pro plus. Now, the size of my Microsoft tools are all messed up.&nbsp; My outlook is really small, if I open an excel sheet from the file explorer, it is normal, if I open it from an email or from the "open folder" on an
 active excel sheet it is enormous.&nbsp; it isn't zoomed, I know how to change the size with Ctrl arrows, the header and everything is huge, including the filter arrows on each column, so bit it covers the text in the column head.</p>
<p>also, if I open a file from explorer and another from an active excel sheet they open in different workbooks so I can't Vlookup between them and this didn't happen prior to this upgrade.</p>
<p>when I open file explorer, the folders are normal size, the preview is , again, enormous.
</p>
<p>my Skype for business is enormous as well.</p>

            Hey&nbsp;Kathleen,
<div><br />
<div>What's happening when you try to generate the Bibliography? Are you getting any sort of message?</div>
<div><br />
<div>One of our fantastic Office for Mac MVPs, Jim Gordon, wrote the following guide that should walk you though the process of properly generating a Bibliography:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b><a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-insert-a-citation-in-word-2011-for-mac.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Insert a Citation in Word 2011 for Mac</a></b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Try following the steps there and see if you're able to properly generate the reference list.</div>

    <title>Completely Stop Outlook from Synchronizing Email Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinkoss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Completely Stop Outlook from Synchronizing Email Accounts</h2>
                    <p>I've been challenged with Outlook (office 365 ProPlus) constantly synchronizing emails even when there is nothing new to synchronise.</p>
<p>So many posts on the Internet refer to disabling IMAP synchronizing but that doesn't stop the synchronising of INBOX, Drafts, Junk, Sent and Drafts can't be disabled so synchronising continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use IMAP. Simple as that. Only Outlook insists on doing this crazy synchronising malarky every minute or so and takes longer to sync than to do any amount of sending and receiving even when there's nothing new to sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone from Microsoft can tell me how to disable this and get my sending and receiving performing quickly and without unnecessary delays constantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Martin</p>

<p>I'd love to tell you the exact version number but, as seems typical these days, I can't find it because it's not where Microsoft products have had the 'about' for 20 years and I have no idea where to find the version number. All I can tell you is that I
 am pretty sure it is the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah, I finally found it under 'Account' (who puts the product version number in Account?)</p>
<p><strong>Version 1905 Build 11629.20246 Click-to-run.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Repair Office tool and it did whatever it did and then I launched Outlook again for a while to see if I could detect any changes and it is still synchronizing the 2 IMAP accounts. Whether it is doing it as often or as slowly is yet to be seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Synchronising appears FOUR TIMES in the Progress window when there's only 2 accounts. Perhaps that is because 'All Accounts' and 'All Email Accounts' are both active for sending &amp; receiving?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The send/receive group settings is set for 'All Accounts' and 'All Email Accounts' to 5 minutes. Not sure why Outlook has 2 sets of send/receive rules but so be it... I have unscheduled the 'All Accounts' entry so the only send/receive entry that is active
 (every 5 minutes) is the 'All Email Accounts' entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, that means that Outlook should not be doing anything for 5 minutes in between checking for new emails but, within a minute (ish) I just saw 'Synchronizing Inbox' appear in the status bar - although it was brief. It seems Outlook is still Synchronizing
 Inbox every minute (ish).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to know what it is synchronising when nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst typing this I am monitoring the status bar and all activity and occasionally double click on the send/rec notification so observe progress and see that synchronising always takes much longer than the sending and sometimes a minute or so even though
 there's no changes to synchronise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the status so far. Although I've created a new profile I have not activated it yet because I did the repair and modified the send/receive groups first and will monitor this today. I have also not ran Outlook in safe mode yet and as far as I am aware
 there are no add-ins running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only Add-in I see mentioned when I view 'Manage COM Add-ins' is a TeamViewer meeting add in that we never use and have no need for. In 'Options &gt; Add-ins' there are no active add-ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook appears to be running better and the steps suggested have prompted me to look at various settings more closely and may have helped matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span>Hello MartinKoss,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for reply, so may I know how things are going there on this issue, if still issue persist would like to suggest you to check with new created profile and also check in Outlook safe mode. Please feel free in
 you end any further assistance from our end. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note:
</span><span>If you have local data that is not present on the Cloud/Server. In that case, we recommend that you backup/export the data before creating a profile.</span></p>

<p>Today I created and activated a new profile and am running it with the new profile to see if there's any problems. So far, it seems OK. I'm not getting too excited because I thought yesterday was ok but then Outlook stopped collecting emails and&nbsp;wouldn’t
 reopen after being closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far though, with the new profile and 2 email accounts added to it, all seems ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emails are coming in promptly.</p>
<p>Outlook hasn't suddenly stopped collecting emails.</p>
<p>There is not a constant 'synchronising' message in the stats bar.</p>
<p>Send and Receiving gets over and done with in acceptable and expected amount of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the one thing I have not done is ran Outlook in safe mode (yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your suggestions so far.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the new profile did not eliminate the freezing of synchronising.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The progress has been like this for quite some time this morning:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/120b614b-0a10-4a5d-96e3-0fbbcfa03b07?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/120b614b-0a10-4a5d-96e3-0fbbcfa03b07?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, once again, the problem is Microsoft Outlook running an unnecessary 'sync' and the end-user not being able to disable this. If outlook gets closed while this sync is in a never-ending progress, then Outlook can't be restarted without going into
 task manager, finding and ending the Microsoft Office task and then restarting Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know Microsoft have built some donkeys over the decades but surely this is the worst business grade product MS ever made!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Outlook in 'Safe Mode' makes little difference as it still runs the 'synchronising' for both email accounts whenever it does a send/receive. The only difference I notice is that it synchronises much quicker.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have done EVERYTHING that anyone has suggested and still the freezing is occurring while 'Checking for new mail in subscribed folders' (synchronizing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while of seeming to run smoothly, Outlook was synchronising for ages in Safe mode and I cancelled the progress. Then I closed Outlook and it would not reopen until I went into Task Manager and ended the Microsoft Outlook task that was still running.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">That was from Safe Mode!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back into Outlook in the normal way and were' back as we were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New profile but still the 'Checking for new mail in subscribed folders' (synchronising) is painfully slow and we are constantly waiting for the next time it freezes while synchronising and then we have to close it, go into task manager, end task, reopen
 outlook...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not the sort of workflow one expects for a premium product!</p>

    <title>Where Microsoft is failing in its competition with Apple - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ylluminate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where Microsoft is failing in its competition with Apple</h2>
                    I have used Microsoft products for 25 years (Beta tested Windows early NT products and Windows 95 even) and Apple now for 14 years. &nbsp;My background is computer science and software development as well as management and UI/UX design.<br />
<br />
While Microsoft has always professed to be all about developers, it has NEVER (not once) followed through with this mantra. &nbsp;For example, I am sitting here typing on this forum and I absolutely abhor the experience of typing on Windows computers. &nbsp;While I work
 on Windows computers in helping users on a daily basis, I always find comfort and release when I go back to my Unix (Mac OS X) system. &nbsp;The user experience is so much more cohesive and things work as expected. &nbsp;Further the keybindings are simply much more
 friendly to what I'm accustomed to. &nbsp;Surprisingly, I'm not actually here to bash Windows, but rather to offer some suggestive advice.<br />
<br />
The problem that Microsoft has had is that there is a lack of attention to detail and the inability to really perceive some things that are important to some of the most important would-be user base. &nbsp;I use Apple because it is better. &nbsp;This is not a statement
 of opinion, it is a fact. &nbsp;I am very pragmatic and would switch to Windows in a heartbeat IF things were to change. &nbsp;The *entire* user experience is better on OS X. &nbsp;Let me explain:<br />
<br />
First, the system benefits immensely by leveraging a Unix core and model. &nbsp;If Microsoft were to insert this one thing into Windows, it would change the entire ecosystem and add a new dimension that would improve many of the lacking points.<br />
<br />
Second, the user interface needs to pull in common editing facilities and tools across the board. &nbsp;For example, key bindings should be available for Unix / OS X / Cocoa users (control-a, control-e, control-s, etc. etc. etc.). &nbsp;Spelling, grammar, transformation,
 etc. services should be ubiquitous such that there is one spelling dictionary and grammar system for all apps as well as the general editing experience (right click options in text fields) existing in the same form across the board. &nbsp;That will make the editing
 experience on par with OS X and quite help developers to feel better about the system. &nbsp;One less thorn so to speak.<br />
<br />
On the Unix point, Cygwin would make an excellent point of acquisition as a core if MS does not wish to rework the underpinnings. &nbsp;Power Shell is a nightmare, don't make us use it. &nbsp;Give us ZSH, BASH and TCSH. &nbsp;We don't want to reinvent the wheel, but simply
 use better tools on the operating system. &nbsp;Make Cygwin and Unix services (daemons) first class citizens. &nbsp;Let us run SSHD and have a handy apt-get or Homebrew style package manager. NOT something new that you've created. &nbsp;Microsoft needs to quit reinventing
 wheels and use tools that exist and are proven. &nbsp;Heck, put full time developers onto existing open source teams or acquire teams that make open source services like Cygwin, ZSH, etc. &nbsp;Follow Apple's model with CUPS and so many other open source tools that
 they have made the foundation of their system.<br />
<br />
And admit it, the Event Viewer sucks greasy monkey balls. &nbsp;So do other tools to access Windows logs. &nbsp;Let us use the shell to pop on over to /var/log and grep through all of the Windows and service (daemon) logs! &nbsp;There is NO WAY (as a system and network admin)
 that I in any way shape or form appreciate using a GUI tool that has been poorly designed and simply is not easily accessible via SSH. &nbsp;Windows network admin is a nightmare when you want to do any serious troubleshooting. &nbsp;Sure, I know, you're trying to make
 a market for certifications, but you're doing it at the cost of creating hatred for Microsoft products. &nbsp;You're losing market share. &nbsp;MS is dying on the vine; just look at the stock market this morning. &nbsp;You've got to change.<br />
<br />
Could you imagine for a moment the thrill that it would give developers if they could drop to the shell and have the registry available as /etc/registry? &nbsp;You could use `find` and `grep` to do all sorts of things that we've been dying to do for two decades.
 &nbsp;We all hate the registry, but if you are bent on keeping it, then give us the RIGHT tools. &nbsp;Be open minded.<br />
<br />
You truly do not know how nice it is to be able to ssh into my iPhone (jailbroken) in order to check out /var/log/syslog to find out what is going on with various functionality of the device. &nbsp;Give users this kind of functionality on Windows phones and tablets.
 &nbsp;Don't lock it away to encourage hacking and jailbreaking, but rather open it up and just secure the parts you want to be more secure to discourage access because you'll never be able to lock it away entirely as has been proven time and again.<br />
<br />
Another thing that would really help the ecosystem would be to fund efforts to make ZFS work on Windows. &nbsp;OS X finally has a strong ZFS solution (albeit entirely open source driven), FreeBSD is amazing with regards to ZFS and Linux is great. &nbsp;I don't want to
 use a proprietary filesystem on Windows, I want to use one that I use elsewhere and understand and that is already exceptionally robust. &nbsp;ZFS is that answer.<br />
<br />
I can guarantee that if Microsoft pushed Windows 10 towards becoming a Unix distribution rather than its same old custom little beast that it would dramatically alter the landscape for the company. &nbsp;You would have people crawling out of the woodwork to shift
 over. &nbsp;Yes, the UI is still nicer in OS X, but that's not where you want to start. &nbsp;You have to make the hard core developers happy and you need to also appeal to the security and network analysts and admins. &nbsp;You cannot do that with your current infrastructure.
 &nbsp;Cut the fat and use what works. &nbsp;Heck, keep the fat if you want. &nbsp;I don't care. &nbsp;If you don't want to get rid of Power Shell, keep it, but give us the tools that work for us.<br />
<br />
The solution for developers is not to beef up Visual Studio. &nbsp;It is to give us the proverbial hammers and screwdrivers that we already know how to use. &nbsp;For the past two decades you've been trying to give us a better screwdriver that just doesn't have a handle
 or nibs that we're used to. &nbsp;The hammers you give us have two claws. &nbsp;They are funky tools that don't feel right in our hands. &nbsp;If Visual Studio simply had the editing features that I noted above and felt like using Emacs or Xcode or, heck, simply TextEdit
 on OS X, then you'd have people clamoring to use it.<br />
<br />
To me, it has been sad to watch Microsoft. &nbsp;I have known for over 10 years what to do to make Microsoft thrive as a company. &nbsp;To really make it something that would shine brightly in the operating system and application market. &nbsp;I have seen executive after
 executive come in and just break things further. &nbsp;Microsoft is caught in this vortex and cannot pull itself out because it lacks the vision and outside perspective to really think differently. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I can guarantee that if these relatively simple efforts were taken that it would dramatically increase the flow back towards Microsoft. &nbsp;There are some others as well, but these are the core and primary efforts that need to be taken.

<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple is collaborating with IBM to develop business-centric apps.</p>

            <p>This is precisely why they are failing. &nbsp;They have to refocus in order to get back into the game. &nbsp;They will not win the mobile market or gaming market, etc. until they get their priorities out of the toilet. &nbsp;You cannot do mobile without a solid core "desktop"
 experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple's core OS team is even suffering at the moment. &nbsp;It is interesting when you hear stories of what is going on in there right now from a first person perspective. &nbsp;Apple has its proverbial pants down in the OS area and Microsoft is a group of cats that
 needs to be herded. &nbsp;The noted goals above would go a tremendous way at getting things pushed together at the core level and would incredibly benefit mobile and gaming efforts.</p>

            <p>Sure sounds like you're better off on the Unix based platforms if you're so much into BASH, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Totally understand there are hardcore developers that use Linux and OS X and that's just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is not a bad OS at all and it's core is improving to the point that in many places it could be classed as superior to others. I do not at all think Windows should become based on Unix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also a high number of businesses that rely on closed-source code and would never use open source, sure you can say security through obscurity but that's the way it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, back to point in question.. I manage thousands of Windows and Linux machines and although tools like 'sed', 'grep', 'tail' &amp; 'cat'... and so on are all very useful I certainly wouldn't say Linux or Unix are better in every respect - they also have
 their own set of problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one example I have experience with and that is Linux KVM Hypervisor vs Hyper-V. As good as some things are in KVM it is just not good enough for mission-critical workloads. Hyper-V has been more stable with mixed workloads, much better DR and availability
 and overall just a better experience. The Windows core is only generally let down by bad drivers which I would blame the manufacturers for rather than Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is targeted at the mass market and it's focus should be on productivity, not the 2% of global power-users that want to fiddle - that's what Linux is for. :-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't mean to insult your opinion, but I hope you do see where I am coming from.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I certainly do see and understand you, however that is one of the damaging viewpoints at the moment that has stopped MS from progressing. &nbsp;The idea that must be garnered is to take the existing good things and make something better. &nbsp;Microsoft should *definitely*
 cater to the "2% of global power users" as well as the OS X users. &nbsp;These are the people who ultimately end up doing the most interesting things and exerting the most influence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I actively influence (directly and indirectly) 100k+ people and their opinions on Microsoft vs Apple. &nbsp;I make decisions on a daily basis on what technology will be used for consumers and businesses, etc. &nbsp;I have to say that I have seen a mass
 transit away from Microsoft in both areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am proposing is far less of an investment than purchasing Mojang and far more beneficial for their business, business model and ecosystem. &nbsp;It would most certainly make the solid changes that the company wants so badly right now. &nbsp;It would further,
 at the very least, place them on more equal ground with Apple and its ecosystem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they don't want to do that, that's fine, but it is a serious problem and folks need to wake up and see it. &nbsp;Cater to the power users. &nbsp;Draw the pragmatic OS X die hards over through superiority in the areas that they know and in which they are most comfortable.
 &nbsp;I'm no "fanboy." &nbsp;Never have been and never will be, but I can clearly see that Microsoft is losing the battle on multiple fronts and this one, as noted, is the most important one because it addresses the real movers and shakers of the industry who are both
 seen and unseen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately I don't really care. &nbsp;I use what works *best*. &nbsp;Frankly I have my own "operating system" and plans that are superior in every way to current paradigms. &nbsp;With about 30M USD and 2 years I could bring something to market that MS and  would clamor
 over for acquisition because of superiority in every single aspect, but I have had this in the works for about 15 years and simply never have the time or funding to really get things done for it and so I'm just poking about offering some suggestions to an
 organization that desperately needs some insight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure my remarks will be ignored. &nbsp;C'est la vie. &nbsp;I can accept that this is the way most valuable suggestions are seen unless someone picks it up and carries it to a decision maker who has appropriate vision. &nbsp;I simply am tired of seeing Microsoft (and
 now to a large degree Apple) making such incredible mistakes and mis-investments with such huge checkbooks.</p>

            <p>Definitely agree with GR25. Windows is a different platform. I see no reason to rebuild it under Unix. And ordinary users use mostly Windows based devices for several reasons:</p>
<p>1. Hardware is cheaper than Apple's.</p>
<p>2. In the segment of games: most haredcore gamers would use desktop PCs. I am not saying they do not own game consoles or that they do not play games on mobile devices. But they prefer PCs as they can customise the hardware, while such customisation of Apple
 products is limited and more expensive in comparison.</p>
<p>3. Nothing wrong with diversity of hardware. Drivers are problematic, but it depends on the manufacturer to fix any issues. And the manufacturer usually will not care after a while, as there would be a new product that would require new drivers for new buyers,
 etc.-much like the Android devices: they usually do not get updated with the next OS version, unless they are flagships. But still the majority of users outside the US do prefer the Windows/Android diversity. This does not necessarily mean they hate/dislike/would
 never use/buy, etc. Apple products or Linux distros.</p>
<p>The only thing that Microsoft might fail is the attempt to unify the platform or try to copy Apple/Google/Samsung or whichever else.</p>
<p>If you read the forums you will understand that most of the complaints that come from the Windows user base are targeted exactly towards those attempts.</p>
<p>Windows is different from OS X/Linux and I think it must continue to evolve in its own way.</p>

            <p>Well, I hate to say it, but you missed the point entirely. &nbsp;There is no rebuilding. &nbsp;There is nothing to do with hardware in my remarks or observations. &nbsp;Further, this is not an issue of forked paths of evolution, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way that anyone with proper perspective and understanding of my remarks can disagree with them since they neither take away nothing nor detract from the current offering in any way. &nbsp;This is entirely a non-destructive topic that only seeks to
 build up the platform to something more viable and appealing.</p>

            <p>I'm not ignoring you but just trying to be realistic. There is no way Windows 10 is going to switch to a different core anytime soon. It would immediately put Microsoft into serious trouble because it's existing user base with existing Windows-centric apps
 would not work. How the hell is any business going to adopt it? Furthermore, if they did change we would loose functions as part of that process as there is absolutely no way they can rebuild the whole of Windows from scratch in 4 years, never mind 1. &nbsp;Microsoft
 do have some projects that run on the UNIX kernel but that's another story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do want to add that I find the opposite, I prefer to use my Windows desktop to my Macbook Pro Retina and it's all down to OS X just doesn't work for me. Some things wind me up about the user experience, but I do feel it has some great points as well. There
 are some very bad UI/UX decisions in Mac OS and one of them is the menu bars and it is well documented if you look around. There is also the fact that Apple is not exactly pushing the boundaries of technology, if it had any sense it would have improved HFS
 by now. Microsoft has ReFS, which is probably going to come to desktop eventually. I don't have performance numbers in comparison to ZFS but ReFS is still an advancement while Apple (and 98% of it's userbase are rocking with HFS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think either Microsoft or Apple are perfect, but how can they be? Once you scale a business to this size you are going to trip up some of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Android is a whole set of problems, it's only worked out because it's cheap and can be rooted for power users. It pleased two markets. If you ask me, Android was seriously inferior to anything else on the market before it switched over to Android Runtime.
 In any case, the consumer won by choosing to buy and now Android is #1 in market share for mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft might be loosing some consumers, and has already lost in Mobile - but it's enterprise desktop share is huge. I think they will be just fine. It's too early to say what the Mojang deal brings, we just don't know yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you also have to bear in mind that it truly comes down to user preference at the end of the day and that's why we have the choices we do between Windows, OS X and Linux.&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>I have used Microsoft products for 25 years (Beta tested Windows early NT products and Windows 95 even) and Apple now for 14 years. &nbsp;My background is computer science and software development as well as management and UI/UX
 design.<br />
<br />
While Microsoft has always professed to be all about developers, it has NEVER (not once) followed through with this mantra. &nbsp;For example, I am sitting here typing on this forum and I absolutely abhor the experience of typing on Windows computers. &nbsp;While I work
 on Windows computers in helping users on a daily basis, I always find comfort and release when I go back to my Unix (Mac OS X) system. &nbsp;The user experience is so much more cohesive and things work as expected. &nbsp;Further the keybindings are simply much more
 friendly to what I'm accustomed to. &nbsp;Surprisingly, I'm not actually here to bash Windows, but rather to offer some suggestive advice.<br />
<br />
The problem that Microsoft has had is that there is a lack of attention to detail and the inability to really perceive some things that are important to some of the most important would-be user base. &nbsp;I use Apple because it is better. &nbsp;This is not a statement
 of opinion, it is a fact. &nbsp;I am very pragmatic and would switch to Windows in a heartbeat IF things were to change. &nbsp;The *entire* user experience is better on OS X. &nbsp;Let me explain:<br />
<br />
First, the system benefits immensely by leveraging a Unix core and model. &nbsp;If Microsoft were to insert this one thing into Windows, it would change the entire ecosystem and add a new dimension that would improve many of the lacking points.<br />
<br />
Second, the user interface needs to pull in common editing facilities and tools across the board. &nbsp;For example, key bindings should be available for Unix / OS X / Cocoa users (control-a, control-e, control-s, etc. etc. etc.). &nbsp;Spelling, grammar, transformation,
 etc. services should be ubiquitous such that there is one spelling dictionary and grammar system for all apps as well as the general editing experience (right click options in text fields) existing in the same form across the board. &nbsp;That will make the editing
 experience on par with OS X and quite help developers to feel better about the system. &nbsp;One less thorn so to speak.<br />
<br />
On the Unix point, Cygwin would make an excellent point of acquisition as a core if MS does not wish to rework the underpinnings. &nbsp;Power Shell is a nightmare, don't make us use it. &nbsp;Give us ZSH, BASH and TCSH. &nbsp;We don't want to reinvent the wheel, but simply
 use better tools on the operating system. &nbsp;Make Cygwin and Unix services (daemons) first class citizens. &nbsp;Let us run SSHD and have a handy apt-get or Homebrew style package manager. NOT something new that you've created. &nbsp;Microsoft needs to quit reinventing
 wheels and use tools that exist and are proven. &nbsp;Heck, put full time developers onto existing open source teams or acquire teams that make open source services like Cygwin, ZSH, etc. &nbsp;Follow Apple's model with CUPS and so many other open source tools that
 they have made the foundation of their system.<br />
<br />
And admit it, the Event Viewer sucks greasy monkey balls. &nbsp;So do other tools to access Windows logs. &nbsp;Let us use the shell to pop on over to /var/log and grep through all of the Windows and service (daemon) logs! &nbsp;There is NO WAY (as a system and network admin)
 that I in any way shape or form appreciate using a GUI tool that has been poorly designed and simply is not easily accessible via SSH. &nbsp;Windows network admin is a nightmare when you want to do any serious troubleshooting. &nbsp;Sure, I know, you're trying to make
 a market for certifications, but you're doing it at the cost of creating hatred for Microsoft products. &nbsp;You're losing market share. &nbsp;MS is dying on the vine; just look at the stock market this morning. &nbsp;You've got to change.<br />
<br />
Could you imagine for a moment the thrill that it would give developers if they could drop to the shell and have the registry available as /etc/registry? &nbsp;You could use `find` and `grep` to do all sorts of things that we've been dying to do for two decades.
 &nbsp;We all hate the registry, but if you are bent on keeping it, then give us the RIGHT tools. &nbsp;Be open minded.<br />
<br />
You truly do not know how nice it is to be able to ssh into my iPhone (jailbroken) in order to check out /var/log/syslog to find out what is going on with various functionality of the device. &nbsp;Give users this kind of functionality on Windows phones and tablets.
 &nbsp;Don't lock it away to encourage hacking and jailbreaking, but rather open it up and just secure the parts you want to be more secure to discourage access because you'll never be able to lock it away entirely as has been proven time and again.<br />
<br />
Another thing that would really help the ecosystem would be to fund efforts to make ZFS work on Windows. &nbsp;OS X finally has a strong ZFS solution (albeit entirely open source driven), FreeBSD is amazing with regards to ZFS and Linux is great. &nbsp;I don't want to
 use a proprietary filesystem on Windows, I want to use one that I use elsewhere and understand and that is already exceptionally robust. &nbsp;ZFS is that answer.<br />
<br />
I can guarantee that if Microsoft pushed Windows 10 towards becoming a Unix distribution rather than its same old custom little beast that it would dramatically alter the landscape for the company. &nbsp;You would have people crawling out of the woodwork to shift
 over. &nbsp;Yes, the UI is still nicer in OS X, but that's not where you want to start. &nbsp;You have to make the hard core developers happy and you need to also appeal to the security and network analysts and admins. &nbsp;You cannot do that with your current infrastructure.
 &nbsp;Cut the fat and use what works. &nbsp;Heck, keep the fat if you want. &nbsp;I don't care. &nbsp;If you don't want to get rid of Power Shell, keep it, but give us the tools that work for us.<br />
<br />
The solution for developers is not to beef up Visual Studio. &nbsp;It is to give us the proverbial hammers and screwdrivers that we already know how to use. &nbsp;For the past two decades you've been trying to give us a better screwdriver that just doesn't have a handle
 or nibs that we're used to. &nbsp;The hammers you give us have two claws. &nbsp;They are funky tools that don't feel right in our hands. &nbsp;If Visual Studio simply had the editing features that I noted above and felt like using Emacs or Xcode or, heck, simply TextEdit
 on OS X, then you'd have people clamoring to use it.<br />
<br />
To me, it has been sad to watch Microsoft. &nbsp;I have known for over 10 years what to do to make Microsoft thrive as a company. &nbsp;To really make it something that would shine brightly in the operating system and application market. &nbsp;I have seen executive after
 executive come in and just break things further. &nbsp;Microsoft is caught in this vortex and cannot pull itself out because it lacks the vision and outside perspective to really think differently. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I can guarantee that if these relatively simple efforts were taken that it would dramatically increase the flow back towards Microsoft. &nbsp;There are some others as well, but these are the core and primary efforts that need to be taken.

            <p><span>Hi Jason,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to optimize Internet Explorer and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/ro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/ro</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:
 The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note
 these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and try adding the site to
<b>Trusted sites </b>again:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Internet explorer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<b>Tools</b> button, and then click <b>Internet Options</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<b>Security</b> tab, click on <b>Trusted Sites</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>Sites</b> and then <b>add</b> the sites and click
<b>Close</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<b>Custom level</b> button.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<b>Settings </b>box, scroll down to the <b>
Miscellaneous</b> section, and under <b>Display mixed content</b> choose
<b>Enable</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:
 When this setting is set to <b>Enable</b>, Internet Explorer does not prompt you with the “<b>Only secure content is displayed</b>” message even if the webpage is using unsecure HTTP
 elements.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if it helps.</span></p>

            I, upon your suggestion, went through each step again several times to no avail.
<div><br />
<div>If Enable is set to display mixed content on Internet security I do not get the error, but when I set Internet security back to Prompt and set Trusted Level to Enable for display mixed content it does not work.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have removed the site from the trusted zone and put it back. Again, nothing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I should also mention that I have several computers at my disposal and have tried this in IE8 in XP, IE9, IE10PR for windows 7. I can not get it to work on any of them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could it possible be the Site?</div>

<h2>            Where&#39;s Harvard Referencing style&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    HI,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've recently purchased a MacBook Air along with Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 to use for my University studies. However, when I try to use the insert citation and bibliography tools there appears to be no option for selecting the 'Harvard' referencing
 style which I require. Please can anyone help shed some light on this problem? I'm desperate to get on with my studies as a deadline is looming! If anyone knows how I can access this, I would be very grateful.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks,</div>
<div>JeniMcD</div>

    <title>Mail Merge in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mail Merge in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>In WORD 2010, I would like a certain Mail Merge document to ALWAYS pull data from one specific data file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Old Word could do this, but Word 2010 refuses to remember! </p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Yes, Word can sometimes have trouble with this.
<div><br />
<div>What type of data file? Is it one that you created within Mail Merge (with a .mdb extension) a Word document, an Excel file,...?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Where is it? In a local folder or on a network share?</div>
<div><br />
<div>One thing worth trying is</div>
<div>&nbsp;a. open the Mail Merge document. Get through all the dialog boxes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. Click Mailings-&gt;Start Mail Merge-&gt;Normal Word Document. This disconnects the data source, any filters/sequences, any Mapping/Matching you may have had to do if you use ADDRESSBLOCK or GREETINGLINE fields, but leaves your merge fields intact.</div>
<div>&nbsp;c. Save and close.</div>
<div>&nbsp;d. Re-open</div>
<div>&nbsp;e. Re-attach the data source in the usual way.</div>
<div>&nbsp;f. Save and close</div>
<div>&nbsp;g. re-open and see if that has fixed the problem.</div>
