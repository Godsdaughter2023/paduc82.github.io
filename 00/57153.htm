<h2>            tired of microsoft charging me for things i don&#38;&#35;39&#59;t purchase</h2>
                    
<p>i was charged with 2 $9.99 one month subscriptions for xbox live that i didn't even purchase. all i did was update my payment options and i added paypal as a payment method so i could use it instead of my credit card. literally 2 minutes later, i get an
 email from paypal saying i had just got charged 19.98 to my paypal account. WTF? let me be perfectly clear here, i did not buy anything. I WAS NOT EVEN IN THE MENU that shows the prices for each subscription, i was in the menu that lets you update payment
 METHODS.</p>
<p>this is the third time i have been charged with something that i did not purchase. so i'm done. it's ***. i want to speak with someone about this immediately (at the moment i am on the support chat and have been waiting for at least an hour, and it says
 average wait time is still 186 minutes) this is the kind of thing that is done by those companies that are just out to steal people's money; they will charge you or overcharge you for things, and then they make it impossible to contact anyone about it so that
 you can't get your money back. pretty sad that microsoft is one of those companies</p>

<h2>            Windows store cache keeps being &#39;corrupted&#39; &#40;standard tricks already tried&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Dear community,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>after the recent creators update I've done a disk cleanup some days ago and actually everything works pretty decent, just one app is not working correctly and that's pretty annoying as it is my ToDo-list (the yellow one if you simply type 'todo list').&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here's the problem:</strong> I can open it without problems, type in a note and click 'add' - everything looks fine. But after closing and reopening the app I can see that the changes have not been saved, so that it is in the same state as it has
 been before trying to save a new note.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The funny thing (I just discovered by accident): </strong>after the step 'type in a note and click 'add'' I once opened my start where I have a 'live tile' of this app, and when this 'live tile' synchronized and displayed the change, the change was
 saved in the app - I could close and reopen it, the new note had been saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I have done so far: </strong>followed all deskmodder tips for resetting store (<em>wsreset, powershell repair, dism repair, deleting store cache, uninstalling store with powershell and reinstalling</em>), but store trouble shooter keeps displaying:
 store cache and licenses may be corrupted. Other apps didn't show problems so far, but it cannot be a problem of just the app as the troubleshooter says sth different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't have believed in a solution if this error must not be somehow connected to either the recent creators update or to the disk cleanup afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope somebody can help</p>
<p>Best regards, Vince</p>

            <p>Hi Vince,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have done most of the troubleshooting steps, kindly refer to this link
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Run the troubleshooter for Windows apps</a> to assess the Windows Store and repair any issues. Also, have you checked if you have any pending updates for Windows 10? You can also run the System File Checker to repair missing and corrupted files by following
 the steps on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us with the results.</p>

            <p>Hey Jomel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed your instructions and was more or less successful. There were indeed pending updates (I was wondering that I never saw them in the update section), but still after that was done, neither the WU-troubleshooter nor the Store-troubleshooter got
 to a point (after repeating all over again) where they did not show any more issues (and the given issues where always the same, though it said 'there may be' and I'm not sure if that's a standard message so you get the feeling the 'help software' is actually
 helping).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue is just with one app it is still possible that it might be some compatibility problem with the update...what do you suggest? Posting the same question again in some weeks? As this major update is&nbsp; just some days old I guess it takes some
 time until more ppl will have had my issue...and with 20GB deleting when I was doing the disk clean up, I guess there have been loads of changes with this update.</p>

            <p>So I've had contact with the very kind and professional tech service, </p>
<p>
</p><p>we've had a remote session and came both to the conclusion that it's most likely the not updated app (which was quite decent but probably programmed by a one man army, god knows if it will ever be updated). Though the troubleshooters kept displaying app
 cache COULD have problems, everything else is working fine so I'm just getting another app of this kind.</p>

<p>I&nbsp; just retired an very good old scanner which apparently couldn't handle the recent installation of Windows XP Service Pack 2 or 3, and went with a rather nice Epson V330 Photo.&nbsp;&nbsp; I uninstalled all the old software,&nbsp; want my JPEGS's and BMP's to open in
 Adobe PhotoShop Elements 8 for editing and enhancement.&nbsp; This is my work and my hobby, and involves technical photography.&nbsp; I have reinstalled the scanner, deleting the Arcsoft software with which it was furnished, which is not really suitable for what I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I cannot open JPEG's in PhotoShop Elements 8.0, and the below is the error message I get:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings\Jim\My Documents\My Pictures\img005.jpg is not a valid Win32 application</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to have something to do with fiddling around with the folder options after I dumped the Arcsoft as any kind of primary program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT I have to open JPEGS, and it MUST be in PhotoShop Elements 8, which I purchased.&nbsp; I can view, preview, and could open for the limited capability of some of the ArcSoft stuff, but I am not remotely interested in using that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get these files/folders to open into something useful????&nbsp; I was able to create JPEG's on the new scanner, but now my computer won't open those or old ones from my files.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the warning message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am in the process of uninstalling all that software now, and not reinstalling the Arcsoft stuff, which would not be useful to me in any parameter.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I do not think this will be the solution, since my computer can no longer open those key files in PhotoShop
 Elements 8.0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I figure it is something I did during the changeover, but I have done system restores and NO RESULT.&nbsp; NONE!!</p>

<div>I think you need to reset the file association for the programs that open the image files.&nbsp; Try right clicking on a jpeg and go to Properties&nbsp;and click on the Change button and then designate PS elements 8 as the program top open it with

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand you are unable to open OneDrive app and PC settings as it flashes when you click on that. Do you have this issue on any other application or program? It could be due to corrupted or missing system files, missing updates, software or hardware
 changes, corrupted drivers.</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>2. Did you make any changes on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the below methods and check.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1.</strong></p>
<p>I&nbsp;suggest you to check in Safe Mode. Starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start your PC in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes.</p>
<p>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode):</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2.</strong></p>
<p>Try to put the system in clean boot.&nbsp; Clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.<br />

Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" in the above link.</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you get an error ""windows store is corrupt", when exactly do you get it?</p>
<p>When do you get this error “This app does not support the contract specified or is not installed”.<br />
It could be due to missing updates or antivirus or corrupt apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows Store is corrupt you can try the below methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1.<br />
I would suggest you to clear Windows Store cache and check how it works.<br />
a) Press Windows logo key + R<br />
b) Type wsreset.exe on Run window and press enter.<br />
c) Restart the computer and check.<br />
If issue persists, then go to method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2.<br />
Try installing Windows updates, app updates, sync app licenses, firewall and try all other steps also if applicable.<br />

<h2>            Epson Stylus NX515 Driver installation &#34;The printer driver package cannot be installed&#34; error.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have Epson Stylus NX515 all-in-one printer and I'm trying to install its driver on my Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, but I'm receiving "The printer driver package cannot be installed" error in the beginning of installation. I'm using the latest driver, which
 was recommended by Epson tech guys, who tried to troubleshoot, but said it is a system error. I know this printer worked fine before and I don't know what's changed since then to make it fail to install the drivers now. Can anyone suggest how to troubleshoot
 this error?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Virtz</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Virtz</strong>,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from error message do you receive any error code?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you installing the recommended drivers for the printer?<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the drivers corrupted?</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Please note: This error could occur if you are installing a 32 bit version of driver on a 64 bit operating system.</p>
<p>I suggest you to download the drivers by visiting this below link and check if it fixes the issue.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?oid=128289&amp;prodoid=63083693&amp;BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;platform=Windows&amp;x=35&amp;y=13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?oid=128289&amp;prodoid=63083693&amp;BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;platform=Windows&amp;x=35&amp;y=13</a></p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You need to completely remove all the drivers and software installed for the printer on your computer.</p>
<p>And try installing the driver again and check for the issue.</p>
<p>To install the printer refer the link below:</p>
<p><strong>Install a printer: <br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Install-a-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Install-a-printer</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Install the printer drivers in cleanboot mode and check:</strong></p>
<p>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</p>
<p>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Network problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pauliw25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Network problem</h2>
                    I live in an apartment complex where a WIFI internet connection is included in the rent. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div>A few weeks ago, our landlord made two changes:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. He changed the Wifi repeater I use to a &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 1, 1)"><b>Amped Wireless SR10000 High Power Wireless-N 600mW Smart Repeater</b></span></div>
<div><font>2. &nbsp;He also changed my&nbsp;</font>personal<font>&nbsp;wireless network connection from "1333A" to "AMPed_SR"</font></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Since then, I have been able to connect my laptop to the repeater using an Ethernet cord - and the laptop would connect to the AMPed_SR network connection.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><font>Suddenly tonight, and with a<u>bsolutely no changes </u>made on my Window 8.1 Pro laptop - the network connection via&nbsp;</font>Ethernet<font>&nbsp;changed from what should be my current network connection (AMPed_SR) , back to &nbsp;the old
 network connection (1333A) - which is now a very slow connection.</font></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>If I disconnect the Ethernet cord and use the built in Wifi in my laptop - I am able to connect to the AMPed_SR network - the one I am suppose to be using.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><font>Why would my network connection when I use an&nbsp;</font>Ethernet<font>&nbsp;cord to connect to the repeater suddenly change from my current AMPed_SR network connection to the former 1333A connection - and how can I change it back?&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font><br />
</font></div>
<div><font>When I connect to the repeater using Wifi instead of via an Ethernet cable - my internet download speed drops almost in half.</font></div>
                </div>

<div>Unfortunately, I am not a "techie" and did not see anything that would really apply in this specific situation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, since my last post things have<b><u>&nbsp;deteriorated</u></b>.&nbsp; As of this morning, I am not longer able to connect to the AMPed_SR network via local or wifi with my laptop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I ran Windows 8.1 Wifi diagnosis, &nbsp;the "fix" it showed said in blue letters: Connect to 1333A automatically in the future</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then it further stated" Currently, Windows is configured to connect to the network only when you choose to do so.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>What in the world does this mean - and who/what/where/how did this happen?</div>
<div><br />
<div>How can I changed the computer's configuration so it will connect to AMPed_SR like it used to? &nbsp;Windows is refusing to connect to it now - even when I use the proper password.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ironically, my Windows 7 desktop is able to connect to the AMPed_SR network - using a Ethernet connection between the computer and the repeater - with no problems at all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thus - I conclude - there is something within Windows 8.1 Pro's settings that is causing the problem.</div>

            This is caused by the third party application "system explorer". I can see the tray icon to the lower right on the screenshot. Right click it and close it, and the overlay should stop appearing.

<p>
</p><p>There's no option to link or merge a Skype account to another Skype account. If you try and recover or reset&nbsp;your Skype account password and see your phone number as an option for recovery, then it's connected to your Skype&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to check what your previous accounts are but you can try signing in to Skype using all of the email addresses, Skype Names, or phone numbers you might have used to sign up for a Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need access to those Skype accounts for you to proceed with closing it. For more details on how to delete your account, click this link:

</p><p>For your video calling issue, the problem can be on your contact's end. Make sure that your contact has enough bandwidth to make the call.&nbsp;Ask your contact if he/she has&nbsp;a strong connection.&nbsp;It can also be an issue with your contact's
 microphone settings. Advise your contact to try the echo sound test service and see if his/her voice will be detected or recorded.</p>

<h2>            Payment for gamepass ultimate was made but i didn&#39;t get the service</h2>
                    Hello there, <br />
So i had problem purchasing xbox gamepass ultimate and i contacted one of the agents. I then allowed him to purchase on my behalf, as he did the payment he said that he got an error message , but the next day i got message from the bank that 4 sr was deducted
 from my card and that it went to Microsoft and the purchase was made from Finland, who was agent because i live in Saudi Arabia.<br />
This is completely unacceptable because i didn't even get the gamepass&nbsp;<br />

            It might have held the payment against your banking account, pending the transaction. But if the content you purchased didn't go through, then the amount should be refunded. How long ago was this done? And was it done over the phone with an official Microsoft
 Support employee? If so, and it's been a while and still isn't showing up for you, then contact Support for a refund or you can go through your bank, and you can try again if you wish to.

<h2>            Family Safety Screen Time Issues</h2>
                    <p>I have a child account set up to limit screen time. When he first starts the computer and logs in everything seems to be working fine. I am having two problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first problem is when the computer restarts the amount of time remaining is reset to the full amount allowed for that day.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second problem is when he signs out of his account and signs back in, the service does not start again. The activity monitor icon that displays the remaining time is missing and he ends up getting unlimited time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a lot of troubleshooting steps but have been unable to fix these problems.</p>

            A. Repair / Reset Edge
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Apps &gt; Click Edge &gt; Advanced Options 
<br />
<br />Repair - No data will be impacted.
<br />
<br />If repair doesn't work - Reset - You may lose some data in Edge including browsing history, cookies and settings but favorites may not get lost. You are recommended to take a backup of your favorites before resetting (Open Edge &gt; Click the 3 dots in top right corner &gt; Import from another browser &gt; Export to file)
<br />
<br />B. smartctl.exe seems to be a third party exe and that is the reason Defender is blocking it. If you are sure about this, you can add an exclusion in Defender.

<p>to vijay</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;thank you very much for answering my post but by your alternate solution i say,i already tried this way many times for weeks and nothing happens and as for my query concerning smartctl.exe now i understand why it is blocked by windows defender however
 my question is what is smartctl do good to a computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; regarding to microsoft edge problem,i think i just solve it today deep thinking why can i not play msn videos on edge where i am sign in with adblock and why can i play msn videos in incognito without adblock.this is the solution i disabled adblock
 on edge where i am sign in and it solve may be uninstalling and installing it the better.sorry to say it takes long enough for months to figure this idea for me thus resulting to posting this question.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; again thank you very much for your idea GOD BLESS.</p>

            <p>Hi KathyGooch, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Are you referring to the Internet Explorer (IE) download manager?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Which web browser are you using? Are you using Internet Explorer 9?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the system?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are facing the issue with Internet Explorer download manager, you may try the following steps and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/ie_performance_and_safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Improve performance, safety and security in Internet Explorer</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try to disable add ons and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>Run Internet explorer with no add-ons. Steps to open Internet with no add-ons mode:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on <b>start.</b></span></p>
<p><span>b. Type in <b>Internet explorer </b>in the start search box. </span></p>
<p><span>c. Select <b>Internet (No add-on mode)</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not facing the issue, then add-ons may be causing the error.</span></p>
<p><span>You try the steps provided to enable add-ons individually to determine which of the add-ons may be causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>For further information, you may refer to the article:</span></p>

            <p>I just don't want the hassel anymore, everytime I start to use the computer I have to wait for what seems like an hour for more and more updates. &nbsp; Plus, I have all the networks listed on my computer and they all state that my computer will connect automatically,
 I uncheck the connect automatically, but microsoft changes it back to connect automatically. &nbsp; I shouldn't have to change my router address to include the name optout in order to keep my private network from being accessed. &nbsp; It shares my wifi info with all
 my contacts, but many of my contacts are not friends they are contractors, buisness associates, and some enemies. &nbsp;Why do I want to share my wifi with them. &nbsp; Microsoft has just gone overboard. &nbsp; &nbsp;I don't care about the same stuff accross all my devices, I
 have different devices because I want the to be different. &nbsp; &nbsp;So, I'm experimenting with other operating systems now. &nbsp; It took me two hours to get my skype account deleted this morning. &nbsp; Why would I want to share my wifi with my skype contacts, what were
 you thinking when you came up with this. &nbsp; &nbsp;Plus I don't want personalized adds, I don't want anything personalized, if I personalize something I want to do it myself. &nbsp; I'm just sick of it. &nbsp; Maybe microsoft can get the youngesters who don't know any better.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;How about I start tracking the CEO of microsoft, would he give me his information so I can track it, I think not. &nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry, but this is over board. &nbsp; I don't want to close my account, I did my skype account, but I'll keep my microsoft account, I just want
 to delete all the contacts, but I have to link my account to windows 10 in order to delete the old contacts, that microsoft keeps telling me I'm going to connect automatically to their wifi, I don't want to connect to their wifi. &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm just done with it,
 you're just turning my computer into a dumb treminal and then eventually you will charge me every year. &nbsp; &nbsp;One thing to think about... that is microsoft is like any other business, it loses one customer at a time, until it's too late and bankruptcy. &nbsp; &nbsp;Take
 to GM about it, &nbsp;look at all the dead banks. &nbsp; Remember, one customer at a time, and really the only reason I stuck with microsoft was because I thought I had more control over the operation of my computer, I could purcahse software put it on my computer,
 that was all you had going for you. &nbsp; You re systems get progressively weaker, if Im going to be tracked, have my wifi given to everyone, **** I might as well use google or yahoo, or by and apple computer. &nbsp; Mircosoft is just becomming a phone company and
 I'm just done with it. &nbsp; But I would like to know how to delete all my contacts on outlook,com, or hotmail without using the people application as I don't want to link it to my microsoft program. &nbsp; I'd like to uninstall it.</p>

 but regardless I uncheck the connect automatically and when I return to the setting it has been enabled for me again my microsoft. &nbsp;That is just one issue, settings for my mouse and track pad are never retained anymore, im left handed, you would think that
 I could turn set the computer for me to be left handed and when I boot it again, those settings would be retained, but they are not retained on any of the three machines I upgraded to windows 10. &nbsp; The Vista machine stills works fine, I tell it to chance settings,

 issue as I am not the only one having the same problem. &nbsp; I can reinstall windows 7, not that it was so great, but I have the windows disks for each machine with windows 7 are you saying I should revert back. &nbsp; I read an article concerning how microsoft is
 gradually moving machines of people who didn't want &nbsp;upgrade to upgrade by changing their upgrade selection during update download without their knowledge. &nbsp; &nbsp;I just need to figure out a way to move away from microsoft. &nbsp; &nbsp;Since upgrading most of my photos
 will not work, most of my videos' wont play, well you can hear the sound but not see the picture. &nbsp; It is just a disaster. &nbsp; Setting wont stay, etc. &nbsp;It is just a disaster for me. &

            Hi, &nbsp; Microsoft is just becoming the same company that Google and Apple are. &nbsp; &nbsp;I guess that is the easiest way to compete. &nbsp; I always thought that microsoft was above that, that they provided systems that work, didn't track, and allowed you to own your
 own computer and software and could easily customize and intergrate other 3 party programs. &nbsp; That isn't the case anymore, microsoft has become google and apple with this update, so my reasons for staying for microsoft are no longer valid. &nbsp;I'm sure the other
 systems have their problems, but they have a better track record, and according to most reports their machines are more reliable. &nbsp; I think that as more users realize this they will move to the other platforms. &nbsp; Microsoft will continue to loose customers
 one at a time now that there is no advantage to staying with microsoft it is trying to be Apple, or Google. &nbsp; Microsoft wasn't true to it's niche. &nbsp;Windows 10 is a take control of your comp

<p>
</p><p>Microsoft doesn't track personal DATA, and still alows use of 3rd party stuff. You do own your own computer BUT Windows, Linux, MacOS and Unix will all try to stop a user from moving files that end up with a dead system. It has NOTHING to do with REMOVING
 freedoms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Linux runs on the same stuff as Windows does, so don't expect more hardware reliability. Macs are ostensibly made from better quality components than budget Windows or Linux machines, and should perform better, but only compared to BUDGET Windows machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You talk of Windows 10 taking control, but what it does is give ease of use to millions of people who are not in the least bit technical. If all Windows versions were locked down in the way tha Windows 2000 was, Microsoft would be struggling to sell to the
 general public now. Note that all settings in Windows 10 are on/off devices and will work as long as the system hasn't been corrupted by unauthorised actions/fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two account types usable in Windows 10 and there has always been 'accounts'.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Microsoft account.. gives access to all things Windows 8 and or 10.</li><li>Local Account.. gives the same access as was available in Windows 7, but Windows 7 never had the feature set of 8 or 10..</li></ol>
<p><em>"When I started working there were no pc's, everything was done on a main frame, no connection, no work. &nbsp; PCs came along and we could do some stuff at home, but now if you don't have an internet connection, then no work. &nbsp; &nbsp;When I was on vacation I
 couldn't use the computer to copy my pictures from the iphone to the computer because the computer would not recoginze the iphone, because apparently I had to log on microsoft using the phone app to get windows to recognize the phone, and couldn't log on because
 of no internet. &nbsp; And everytime I tried to use the computer, it woudl tell me, &nbsp;your not connected to the internet let's get you connected, but I like hiking in the mountains and in the wilderness and there is no connection, but there are some things that
 I used to use the computer for when I was hiking, but I can't do that now because I can't connect. &nbsp; If one travels to places where there is no internet connection, no cell phone towers, etc, well you're just out of luck as everything is going to require internet
 connection. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that there is no Rogers Cable service at the bottom of the Marianas trench. I guess I won't be going there anytime soon.. :-)\</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"&nbsp;The pc was invetend in order to allow us to use a computer without being connected to a mainframe, I guess the computer guys realized that didn't generate a steady income stream so now their requiring slowly that one must be connected. &nbsp; It's the 70s
 and early 80 all over, same ****, different name. &nbsp; just give them a dumb terminal and eventually charge them for time. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not true at all. the fact that home users didn't get into the Internet thing is because it didn't exist for them, but it was around.&nbsp; Re the cloud, we have been using variations for years, most notably email storgae and retrieval. I don't use the cloud for
 anything else. I switched it OFF.. </p>

 Your response was that you would be going camping, and that there was no connectivity in the madras fault so you wouldn't be going there. &nbsp; So, I guess that includes the grand canyon, yellowstone, etc.&nbsp; You employees are arrogant idiots. &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft does
 not care about customer service, it will end up like, sears, or kmart someday.&nbsp;&nbsp; You tick off customers one at a time, eventually, theyre all gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ofen before you actually realize it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p>I've been working on creating individual admin accounts for the rest of my team&nbsp; instead of using a shared admin account. So far, I have a group for server admins and another for the help desk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gotten so far as delegating permissions in ADUC for the groups and allowing them to use RDC for certain servers, including DCs. However, when remotely logging into a server, I am unable to open any administrative tools. A google search says to allow
 the groups the ability to log on locally, however, I don't want the Help Desk group to access all of the administrative tools. Is there a way to only grant access to the ADUC and Print Management consoles for the group?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help you can provide.</p>
