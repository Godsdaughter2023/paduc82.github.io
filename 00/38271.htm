<h2>            After an recent update to Windows 10 build, Wi-Fi not working.</h2>
                    <p>Original title : WIFI not working properly</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Lenovo U310 touch laptop. I bought it with Windows 8 installed. Recently I update the laptop with Windows 10 and later updated to the Windows 10 latest version. After that update My WIFI is not working properly. Connection was fine but very slow.
 Therefore I downloaded the latest driver for Intel PROSet/wireless and installed it and now the WIFI is not working at all. Therefore again I tried to reinstall the old driver and I got an error message saying some issues with Unicode language issue(I think
 its because I use dual language in my Laptop). Also I tried troubleshooting network adapter, tried disable and enable it. Nevertheless, currently my WIFI is not working and is there any way to solve the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>
                </div>

    <title>Xbox Live Account and Unpaid Balance - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Live Account and Unpaid Balance</h2>
                    
<p>So in January of this year XBOX informed me that my Gold membership was ending at the end of the month and that I needed to renew. Well I didn't have the funds at the time and the credit card I had on file was no longer in use. Here is my problem.
</p>
<p>Why does it say I have an outstanding balance of 59.99 when I paid for the year before and didn't renew my subscription. On top of that I cant use the deals they are using atm to do 1 or 2 dolarrs fot 1 or 2 months because of the balance.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can you charge me for something I haven't been able to use all year. I already paid for last year and when I couldn't renew with my credit card they still put a balance on my account to pay.</p>

<p>if auto renew is turned on MS will attempt to charge the card when the next installment is due. &nbsp;it is not MS fault the card is no good or the funds are not there. &nbsp;for future reference, turn off the auto renew by calling support so they do not try to attempt
 to charge a card that is not valid or funds not in that account.</p>

<p>Here is the thing though. I want to sign up again, but don't have 59.99 to do it. They have a deal now I want, but why should I have to pay the 59.99 for a service they don't allow me to use because of this balance. It would be like a magazine company charging
 me money for magazines they weren't sending me. Do they take away that balance?</p>

<p>you need to pay off the outstanding balance before you can switch to any other deal</p>
<p>no this is for a membership going forward</p>
<p>you are 27+ days into your current membership fee</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>magazines charge you before they send the magazines</p>
<p>like xbox they give you a brief period before they suspend you</p>
<p>you would be about 27+ days into the 1 year that you are supposed to pay for</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can stack memberships</p>

<p>I can understand this balance if they allowed me to play for the full year and then wanted the money. If after the year I don't want it anymore, my card is not valid, or I don't have the funds then you can have the balance because you allowed me to use your
 product without me paying. How do you charge someone 59.99 without giving them the service. Microsoft is charging me for something I haven't received or purchased. How does something auto renewal and when there is no money they hold the balance on your account?
 I owe 60 dollars while not being subscribed to Xbox Live Gold. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You say a membership going forward. How can some one legally charge you for something that you haven't even agreed to renew. The balance is based off of nothing. I can understand if I played for a year then had to pay. They charge me 59.99 just assuming
 I want a 12 year membership again. If the money isn't there then we go our separate ways and I don't owe anything because I didn't receive anything the next year. I haven't been able to play on Gold since my subscription ended. So what exactly should I pay
 for when I didn't sign up for another year? &nbsp;</p>

<p>it is based on the 1 year you have received</p>
<p>you are 27days in non payment</p>
<p>when yoiu get suspended you are&nbsp;already into the membership</p>
<p>suspension does not occur till 27 days of decline meaning 27days ago you renewed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if after 27 days you do not uphold your end of the&nbsp;terms of use</p>
<p>you will be suspended till you pay off the balance </p>
<p>they will&nbsp;not wait 1 year for you to pay off the balance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also you did sign up for a year</p>
<p>please read the terms of use</p>
<p>when you purchase a new promotion or a new membership there is 2 notes</p>
<p>1 underneath the price (this is upto you to read)</p>
<p>this membership will renew</p>
<p>2nd in the terms of use</p>
<p>inorder to have a billing account you&nbsp;must keep your billing info upto date</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you do not wish to have renewal simply call support and turn off autorenewal before the renewal date or skip all the free games and discounted membership fees and stick with prepaid membership cards</p>

<p>That is not true. When I first signed up they took the 59.99 out of my account for 1 year. After that one year I am no longer allowed the service until I pay again.
</p>
<p>My subscription was up &nbsp;4-5 months ago and I never renewed. Yet they still charge me for a service I can't use because I never subscribed. I have no idea where you get 27 days ago. I never authorized a renewal because I didn't have the funds. I signed up
 for a 1 year membership in January or February of 2010. One year later it was over and I no longer got the service. So how do I still owe them for an assumption Microsoft made in thinking I wanted another year?

<p>memberships do stack so if you purchase prepaid membership cards they only delay renewals so if you add 1month and a 3 month membership you would have 4months added before your renewal date</p>
<p>after the prepaid membership ended you will be back on renewal</p>
<p>you are also sent 3-4 emails before the renewal date warning you that you will renew (if you are going into suspension yuou will receive declined payment emails)</p>

<p>They took the 59.99 out when I did it. This is what they did and I know why they did it. The problem is it is wrong.
</p>
<p>In 2010 of January or February I signed up for one year. The money was then taken out of my account. After the 1 year was up I never renewed. Microsoft automatically renewed me with my credit card no longer valid so they didn't allow me the service anymore.
</p>
<p>Here is the part that is wrong. Why are they charging me a year subscription on my account when I never received a years worth of Xbox Live Gold. I already paid for my previous year and the money was taken from my account and given to Microsoft in 2010.
 In 2011 I never received Gold, but because of the auto renewal I got charged for a year they I am not allowed to play.
</p>
<p>Answer me this..... </p>
<p>If I don't receive the service how can I owe someone money? </p>
<p>It would be like me paying Microsoft to fix my car. If you don't fix my car how are you going to charge me 59.99 when I never received your service.

<p>if you didn't call to cancel or you weren't on xbox live till now of course you wouldn't see the suspension till now</p>
<p>btw 4-5months into a billing suspension for payment option you are going to have to call xbox support and ask that the write off be removed by payment
</p>
<p>or if you added prepaid memberships</p>
<p>it only delays a renewal</p>

<p>I got the suspension in January. I just didn't know until now I owed 59.99 for a service Microsoft hasn't allowed me to use since it ran out.
</p>
<p>The problem is I owe 59.99 for this year because of the auto renewal. If they allowed me to play since January I can understand this. However that hasn't been the case. I haven't been using their service or have had a subscription with them. &nbsp;My 2010 subscription
 was paid for last year. I still don't understand how you are allowed to keep a 59.99 charge on an account when
</p>
<p>A. Their contract/subsection with you ended and your 1 year was already paid for</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>B. They don't allow you the service for 2011 ( which is what the 59.99 charge is for ), but still want you to pay for a full year worth of service.

            <p>Hi Maxine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the information that&nbsp;you have provided, it seems that the registry that you have exported might not have processed&nbsp;all the&nbsp;registry keys that &nbsp;are required for it to replace the original&nbsp;one. In such a scenario, I recommend that you perform Repair
 In-place upgrade which will replace all the content of the missing registry files.

            Use your Windows Repair CD to boot the machine into Repair Mode, then launch the Factory Restore from there.<br />
<br />
If this fails too then you need to order a Factory Restore DVD from the supplier.

<p>Sorry to hear about that.&nbsp; You should be able to change the child's gamertag just as you would any other one.&nbsp; In order to make changes to it, the account has to be added as a family member to main family account.&nbsp; Information can be found here:</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and Quicken 2017 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rwuf52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and Quicken 2017</h2>
                    <p>Quicken has worked fine for the past year.</p>
<p>It worked fine yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I shut down the computer last night it said there were updates to install. Looking at the log it appears they were all for Office 2007 which is also installed on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tonight I tried to open Quicken and it will not run. I get the blue circle for about 3 seconds, then it goes away and nothing happens.</p>
<p>I assume this is related to the update, though it doesn't make much sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried clicking on the Quicken shortcut in the "recently used" program list.</p>
<p>I scrolled through the program listings and tried using that link without success.</p>
<p>I pulled up the qw.exe file in the programs directory, same thing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need Quicken to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>Actually I had found that page and had tried those but it still would not open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then chatted with Quicken online and they told me to download their mondo patch for Quicken 2017 at&nbsp;https://www.quicken.com/support/quicken-2017-windows-release-notes-updates-and-mondo-patch. It was a 631mb download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the patch fixed the problem. They said that it was because sometimes Quicken updates do not get installed properly. But the problem arose after a Windows 10 update. And I incorrectly said that all the updates were for MS Office 2007, I noticed that
 a couple of them were for the Windows OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm not sure where the problems was, but it is working well now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

                    I'm trying to make sure that my computer uses both cores at startup.&nbsp; I can open the msconfig gui, but once at the boot tab, I can change nothing. Not one thing.<br />
<br />
I'm on an Acer Aspire laptop with intel MOBO.&nbsp; The proc has two cores, and it takes about 20-30 seconds to boot even with 4 gigs of ram.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions how to unlock the advanced options under the boot tab?<br />

            Only thing that I can think of is a system file corruption. Have you tried a SFC scan?

2-how to stop it from pop up again.<br />
Tq for the helping hands.<br />

            hazren,<br />
To answer your first question, DFS Replication can be used to keep files synchronized across multiple computers on a network. It can update just the changed blocks from a file, so it is very efficient. If you don’t plan to synchronize files across multiple
 computers, you can disable the service but it is set to manual by default so should not be running unless being used, which obviously it is.&nbsp; If you have multiple computers DFS keeps the shared files synchronized so if you use the "People Near Me" feature
 all users will see the same files and folders that are being shared.<br />
<br />
There could be several reasons why DFS stopped working.&nbsp; You will need to check the entries in the Event Viewer logs for System to see what is causing the errors.&nbsp; If you are not on a network or don't need to share files between computers you can disable the
 service to avoid the pop up error notification.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Here is how to disable the service:<br />
Start&gt; type "services" in the search box and hit enter &gt; if it asks for permission click continue &gt; in the services panel find the DFS Replication service and double click it to open its properties sheet &gt; Click the down arrow next to Startup Type and select
 "disabled".&nbsp; Click "Apply" and close out of the Services management console.<br />
<br />
To find the errors in Event Viewer:<br />
Click Start &gt; type "event viewer" in the search box and hit enter, click Continue if asked for permission.&nbsp; Expand the Applications and Services Logs section and click on DFW Replication.&nbsp; You will see all the events logged by the DFS service.&nbsp; Click on any
 events that show red error or yellow warning read the detailed description.&nbsp; This will tell you what caused the service to stop.&nbsp; You can post that information back on this forum so that we can further assist you.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Professional - won&#39;t update</h2>
                    I can never get my Windows 10 Professional automatic check for updates to work.&nbsp; Manually doing it doesn't work either; it'll indicate updates are required, but they consistently fail to download with varying errors.&nbsp; A year or so ago someone from the
 Community (Dhiman2) provided a link to a compressed executable that installed and brought in all the updates.&nbsp; Is that something again necessary for my Windows 10 Pro laptop to GET updated?&nbsp; It's been almost a year and now my antivirus applications are saying
 I have security risks, but updates won't work. (Updates automatically download and install fine on other PC's in the house with Windows 10 'home' or whatever the standard edition is.)

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.

            I'm willing to try all this as a last resort. &nbsp;My concern is WHY on my Windows 10 Professional version, I have to jump through all these hoops to get basic (and mostly SECURITY) updates where on Windows 10 standard, they just download and update automatically?

            An additional observation: &nbsp;My laptop was originally a Windows 7 Professional version - where updates occurred automatically and without issues. &nbsp; I took advantage of the update to Window 10 Professional, and it's never been the same.

            Microsoft's servicing model with Windows 10 is significantly different from Windows 7 and earlier versions. The objective is, install those security updates at all cost. There hasn't been a thought process for what if some of these patches break your system. Right now, these are your only options or consider downgrading to Windows 7.
<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Downgrade to Windows 7.

            14393 is being phased out soon. The latest is 16299 which you need to upgrade manually.
<br />Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use any of:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade...</a>
<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

<p>Thanks. &nbsp;The links/options didn't do anything. &nbsp;I tried a couple different options and it just sits there at 0% for hours. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a similar issue the last time I tried to update Windows 10 and I believe one of you actually sent me either an ISO file or direct link to obtain it. &nbsp; I can't fathom why all the problems with Windows 10 Professional when the entry-level version on
 our home PC works and updates fine with no apparent issues.</p>

<h2>            New hard drive, but nothing&#39;s working&#63;</h2>
                    Okay..I have searched high and low in the internet world for two days now, and I can't get any sort of answer I'm looking for. SO good luck to those who try to help, and I thank you ahead of time! Please read fully so I don't get repeats of answers I already
 know don't work!!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My husbands laptop (an HP running Windows 7) wasn't running all too great for a while. Then one day, nothing. Black screen of death. So after a couple of days of him wanting to throw it out the window, I did SOMETHING (I forget what, I'm assuming the F11
 fix) and got to do a complete factory reset. There weren't any files or programs on the computer we really cared about sparing, and it made the computer boot again. I did have a recovery disk, but it didn't seem to do anything. System recovery just ran, nothing
 really happened. So after about 4 days of the computer working, it started to just randomly shut off, sometimes being preceded with a blue screen of error stuff, sometimes just going completely black. So we figured it was time to invest in a new hard drive.
 Here's where you guys come in!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>He chose to not wait for me to install the new hard drive, but I can only assume he did it correctly (I double checked connections, nothing seemed wrong to me). The computer turns on, goes to system repair, and then nothing. I have no operating system
 to choose from (when I have the recovery disk in, I thought it should show up??) and no restore options, since it's an empty hard drive. When I run chkdsk in command prompt, it doesn't do anything. When I go to the BIOS, I don't see any hard drive listed at
 all. The hard drive is compatible with the laptop (it's almost the exact same one as the original) so there's no real reason I know of that it shouldn't work. PLEASE NOTE: EVERYONE says to burn a disk and do blah blah blah.. If I had a functioning computer
 and could burn a disk, I would have done that already. All I have is a recovery disk and a problem. I cannot boot into any type of Windows, safe mode or otherwise, so I can't run disk manager because I can't access any type of Start menu, as has been suggested.
 I have a computer that does not boot beyond the system repair stage, and I have set the boot order to both the internal hard drive and the disk drive, I get the same result either way. I don't think the recovery disk is the issue, I just don't know what else
 to try. I don't know how to format or partition the hard drive (if that's necessary) without being able to get into Windows in the first place. I can get to command prompt and BIOS, and any other pre-booting menu (besides F11, that does nothing now, so factory
 reset seems impossible)..&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So please, help!! I'm fairly technology-literate, but I'm obviously running into a road block, and don't know what else to do.. thanks!!!&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Do you have, or can you get access to,&nbsp;a Windows 7 System Disc (DVD)? Or have&nbsp;access to another computer? If the former, you use that to start the formatting of the new&nbsp;hard drive. If the latter, you can download the System Disk (DVD) onto another computer
 and burn that to a DVD; you then use that DVD to format the new hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides letting me know which approach you want to follow, I need to know what version and Bit depth of Windows 7 is your Product Key for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can answer these questions, I'll try to provide additional assistance to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            I do not have a Windows 7 Disk, nor do I have a way to burn one. I can burn onto a USB but not a disk, my only other working computer does not have a disk drive, and I can't boot the computer that has one. I'm currently trying to figure out how to make
 my USB drive bootable so I can load from that, not much luck there. And I have the Product Key from my computer, the one that's not working can't be read off the sticker, it's too worn off, but I believe it's for Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>The problem is compounded by the lack of a DVD drive in your backup computer. Any chance the broken computer can lend its DVD drive to the backup computer? You could then&nbsp;download the Windows ISO and create a DVD which you could then use to format the broken
 computer's hard drive and load Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For making an USB drive bootable, check out this program, which will allow you to boot into MS-DOS:
<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Boot-Manager-Disk/Bootable-USB-Drive-Creator-Tool.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Boot-Manager-Disk/Bootable-USB-Drive-Creator-Tool.shtml</a>&nbsp;. From DOS you can navigate to the C:\Windows directory and start Windows manually.
</p>

<p>Let me know if this helps you out.</p>

            I've been trying to make my USB drive (an 8GB) bootable by putting the iso files onto it, but when it came to completing the process on the broken computer, it restarted with a nice blue screen saying a whole bunch of not so good stuff, so I'm starting
 over, cleared my USB drive, and I'm trying the steps again using a different program with an iso file I downloaded. So I'm not sure where the disconnect happened that caused the blue screen, if I get it again this time, I'm really starting to think I'm going
 to have to try to get the old hard drive back in to use the DVD drive, but I'm not even sure that's 100% possible.. This is getting very tough to solve!!

            <p>If you have to use the key code which the pre-installed Windows 7 was using, it has to be used with the manufacturer Windows 7 image. If you use a generic Windows 7, it will activate initially but after a couple of weeks, it will tell you that it is NOT
 genuine.</p>

<p>You would be best to get the manufacturer recovery disks from the computer manufacturer..

            That's the one I used. It got through most of the Installing Windows on the new hard drive, and then just when it's about to complete the installation, it would say it needs to restart the computer, and does so automatically. When it reboots, it just starts
 the process all over again I've let it go three times in a row, and the same thing keeps happening. So now I have put the old hard drive back in so I can use the DVD drive and try some other methods. Side note: I have the original product key for Windows 7
 from that computer, so if there's a way I can make my own Windows Install Disk using the old hard drive, that should work fine... right?!

            Okay, the computer I'm trying to fix, I have the broken hard drive, but I can still use that old hard drive to boot, it just doesn't work too well. It took me three tries to get the iso files onto a DVD so that I could boot from that once I put the new
 hard drive back in. That didn't work either, I just got a blue screen with a bunch of errors all over again, and now it's just not doing anything.

<p>OK, what about using a Linux derivative to boot your computer? You could&nbsp;download either a Live Linux CD, something like Wubi downloaded from here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Wubi/3000-2094_4-10701841.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/Wubi/3000-2094_4-10701841.html</a>&nbsp;; &nbsp;or a derivative version like BootMed, the very long download is here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/BootMed-64Bit/3000-2094_4-75450831.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/BootMed-64Bit/3000-2094_4-75450831.html</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there's the other (?best?) option, which is to either purchase a set of&nbsp;the DVD Recovery Discs for your computer, or buy an OS DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know what else I can do to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<p>In addition to what Gina has suggested, you might try the following: <br />
Try and see if you can download Yahoo Messenger&nbsp;and save it to your desktop.<br />
Then right click on the downloaded file, right click and select "Run as Administrator".&nbsp;<br />
You&nbsp;may have to temporarily disable the <span>User Account Control</span> (UAC).&nbsp;Then, once it is installed you can turn UAC back on again.<br />
<br />
On the Control Panel (Category View) choose User Accounts and Family Safety, next choose User Accounts, and then click Turn User Account Control on or off.</p>
<p>Please let us know if this helps.</p>

<h2>            Streaming&#58; can we login to Xbox One remotely&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>A real fan of streaming Xbox One to Windows 10 as it frees up the TV for other family members and, in my experience, it has worked really well.</p>
<p>One question: when turning on the Xbox One via the Windows 10 app, I cannot stream until I have signed in with my profile&nbsp;on the console itself.&nbsp; This is not difficult to do, obviously, but it does defeat one of the advantages of streaming because I then
 have to go to the TV and&nbsp;switch channel if somebody else is using it,&nbsp;to activate my profile on the console.&nbsp; I do not have my profile sign in automatically on the Xbox because I do not want younger members of the family playing more mature games on it.</p>
<p>Can I, therefore, sign in remotely from Windows 10 to initiate a streaming session?</p>

<p>I have the exact same problem. I purchased a copy of OneCast for my iPhone a while back. It partially helps because I have memorized the button sequence to login one of my kid's accounts. Then I can stream using OneCast so that I can switch accounts. It's
 friggin' retarded to have to do this. Would love to hear of any better solutions people might have. Ideally the XBox devs would come up with a way to login remotely. If you are logged in via the app, you are already authenticated so why not just allow me to
 click a button to also login on the xbox?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ONLY place you can legally buy keys is MS (or its agent - Digital River).</p>
<p>There's the heart of your problem!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/howtotell/windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/howtotell/windows/</a></p>
<p>Your 'IT friend' perhaps linked your PC (did he install W7 himself??) to the company server for the initial activation.</p>
<p>KMS licenses require reactivation from the parent server every (I think) 180 days - that period has obviously passed, for you (Xmas present? &lt;g&gt;)</p>
<p>You can go through teh Get Legal process, where they will give you a discount on a new copy of WIndows....</p>
<p>There's a link in the notification which says something along the lines of 'Get Genuine' or 'Get Legal'&nbsp; - follow that and jump through the hoops, and you'll end up withteh key immediately, and a legal set of disks in the post.</p>
<p>Before you do that, it may be a good idea to post an MGADiag report here - so we can check that this really is the problem.</p>

<h3> davemtl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Major bug&#58; After setting fingerprint, Windows 10 attempts to force you to create a PIN</h2>
                    <p>If you don't create a PIN and sign-out or reboot the computer, windows will not accept your valid password or fingerprint. It gives the error: "Before you can start using your fingerprint to sign in, you have to set up a pin"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This creates a catch-22 situation where your only choice is to reset the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is Microsoft forcing me to create an unsecure PIN when I have a real password and fingerprint combo ready in the system????? A PIN is useful if I need a 3 year old to be able to unlock the laptop, but it is useless in the real world and a complete joke
 in a business environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft: What is your logic here? Either you are serious about security, or you are not. PIN's are amateurish.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            lego marvel heroes patch</h2>
                    
<p>when this game hit the pc and otehr consoles it needed a patch to correct some infamous bugs (level 6 elevator anyone?). I got this game today for my xbox one and even though it supposedly installed a 105 mb patch the game still has a lot of the&nbsp;bugs that
 the patch fixed on the other platforms.</p>

<p>Hey YoungMoneyErb,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I looked up in the internet about the Iron fist here is what I found:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To begin with you have to do a mission in New York City to get a pizza scooter (green, white and red scooter, in a subway.) In the subway, Blade will ask you for a race, then pick up the car and win the race. After that, once you win, go to the map
 and there is a building where you can find Blade again, and he will ask you to help him fight ice dudes. After that fight is won, you unlock Iron Fist.</strong></p>
<p><br />
How are you accessing The alternate uniform? Did you win the race against Ghostrider? &nbsp;We have heard that redoing the "rebooted resuited level to unlock characters that are stuck.</p>
<p><br />
Give the suggestions a go and if anything you can reach out to the publisher or other sites on how to unlock characters.</p>

<h2>            Art programs have a little glitch after recent updates in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Art programs suddenly have no pressure sensitivity</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently gotten the Surface Pro 3 as a gift, and was very excited to use it particularly for drawing.&nbsp;<br />
I tend to use Paint Tool Sai, and initially it wouldn't work but I installed the Wintab drivers as I'd seen many people suggest before and then it worked perfectly, for a day or so at least.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure what did it, but in all of the art programs (Sai, FireAlpaca, Drawpile, even the Sketchbook app) all of the lines are jittery and off. I've tried removing and reinstalling the wintab, the art programs and even adjusting in the Surface app but
 nothing is working.<br />
I know it has sensitivity and can pick it up, it does so in the Surface app and One Note, just in no other programs where I need it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pen itself is fine, and I've tried another one that has no history of hiccups and it is all still the same.</p>
<p>The only recent major things that have occurred was the downloading and installation of Microsoft Word and such, and an Update, so perhaps that could have done it, but I can't work out how to fix it.<br />

</p><p>The only thing I'm unable to do is set the compatibility mode to Windows 10 as no option to do so is coming up in the drop down menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            The earliest update that I had was on the 29th of December and its KB number was (KB3119147)<br />
<br />
I've tried the compatibility once last time just to make sure and nothing has changed from that either<br />

            <p>The problem is still there, and I've done the only other thing I could think to try which was uninstalling the updates</p>
<p>though even that has changed nothing and all the art programs are pretty much useless to me</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only area I still get pressure sensitivity is in the Surface app and One Note<br />
this is a very frustrating issue for me as half the reason I was given this computer was for art work</p>

            I have been having this problem since yesterday. I've had it before and it usually goes away within a day so I haven't worried about it. However it was still happening today. As I former techie I usually know how to deal with these things. I've restarted
 my computer several times, and this morning I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I was actually able to play 3 games and when I started the 4th it crashed. I've now tried that game at least 3 times and it crashed every time.
<strong>It's time for somebody at Microsoft to do something about this!!</strong>

I am also running into this issue. Same with Mahjong...somehow, mahjong finally worked but it was not without issues. Now Sudoku keeps crashing. I ran the app troubleshooter, and it said that windows store cache may be damaged. No new installs of software was
 made. This issue popped up at 12:01 AM today. Tried wsreset exe as well. All to no avail. So your updates to Sudoku and Mahjong have corrupted the cache. FIX THIS!!! I also tried to uninstall and reinstall it, and still nothing. That is with uninstalling it,
 rebooting the PC, reinstalling it, rebooting the&nbsp;PC and trying it again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I have also had this problem. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, ran app troubleshooter, reset back to an earlier date, and ran file and&nbsp;windows clean up. MS Solitaire, and&nbsp;Caesars slots are working ok at this time. I have searched the web for answers,
 and all I find is that a lot of people have this problem, with very little as far a remedies.&nbsp; Any help with this would be appreciated.</p>

            I have also been having problems with Sudoku crashing. I uninstalled/reinstalled the app to no avail. Then I came here and found others with the same issue. I have run your Windows App Troubleshooter and it says the Store cache may be corrupted and it
 can not fix the problem. Come on guys, I've been playing this game just about everyday for years, now it won't work.&nbsp; What's up with that?<br />

I, too, have the same issue.&nbsp; I assume some update makes the Soduko squirrley.&nbsp; Regardless, I wish there was a fix.&nbsp; My Windows 10 is the 64 bit addition.&nbsp; Arrrggghh<br />

            Recently started having the same problem with MS Sudoku.&nbsp; I couldn't locate the .exe anywhere on my laptop.&nbsp; I am connected to the Internet via WiFi.&nbsp; Thinking that the program must be running in the cloud rather than on my computer, I switched to Airplane
 mode (turned off WiFi) and have had no trouble since.&nbsp; An inconvenient fix but perhaps a clue to what is wrong with the app.&nbsp; Switching back to WiFi on and the program crashes as before.&nbsp; Going back to Airplane mode fixes the problem as it did the first time
 I tried it.

<p>Can you please explain a bit more how you did this? &nbsp;When I &nbsp;tried switching to Airplane mode, the game wouldn't play at all and said I needed an internet connection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>ASUS laptop, i7 core, 8 GB ram, connected to the internet via wifi at home.&nbsp; I was going to change the compatibility mode and/or the privileges in the properties of the MS Sudoku execute file.&nbsp; Searched using Cortana and the file explorer and could not find
 the .exe file (perhaps a different name than Sudoku.exe?) I searched control panel&gt; programs to delete the app and reinstall but MS Sudoku was not listed as a program.&nbsp; I looked through other microsoft programs and did not find Sudoku. I thought that the app
 was running on the cloud and I needed an Internet connection to play.&nbsp; Tested this theory by disabiling the Wifi in the Control panel.&nbsp; There should have been no exec file on my computer but started it from the Start Menu as it was still listed.&nbsp; It ran without
 crashing for over an hour until I quit.&nbsp; Looked for the exec file (with the file explorer) and still did not find it.&nbsp; With WiFi up and running, started Sudoku and it promptly crashed.&nbsp; Turned off WiFi again, using the function key to switch to airplane mode
 - f2 on my machine.&nbsp; again, ran like a charm.&nbsp; It sounds as if our situations are different as the program did not tell me I needed an Internet connection.&nbsp; Did it say needs an Internet connection to run or to save scores?&nbsp; If you find the Sudoku exe file,
 let me know where you found it.&nbsp; thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Network upload speed limited under 1 Mbps within the last week &#40;today is 10&#47;19&#47;2018&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Within the last week I was noticing an upload issue after a windows update.&nbsp; I was being limited to under 1mbps, specifically around .7-.85.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first notified my internet provider, consolidated network, about the issue.&nbsp; I started with swapping out the router and the cable with new one's.&nbsp; Still same result.&nbsp; I even had a tech come over and test all the wires and such and they were getting a 1
 gig upload and a 1 gig download all the way to the PC.&nbsp; However once plugged in it would not go over .85 upload.&nbsp; But all the steps were taken to ensure my network provider was not at fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I read some threads online and did everything I could to figure it out but still no luck.&nbsp; Today, I went ahead and reformatted all my drives and installed a fresh copy of windows 10.&nbsp; THE SAME RESULT!&nbsp; Here is a screen shot of the latest result below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after disabling the windows firewall, going through msconfig services, disabling everything, startup disabling everything, still same result.&nbsp; I have not installed anything other than windows after formatting.&nbsp; Please help!</p>
