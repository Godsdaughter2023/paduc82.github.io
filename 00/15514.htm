<h2>            Text to Speech via bluetooth broken after 8.1 update 1</h2>
                    <p>I just updated to WP 8.1 Update 1 this week and I'm encountering the most annoying problem. &nbsp;While connected to my car (2008 Nissan Altima) via bluetooth, my phone no longer does text to speech, and if I hold the search button, the bluetooth gateway doesn't
 open, nor does the built-in microphone work, so other than receiving phone calls, my bluetooth is essentially useless. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I bought the phone and it was on WP8.0, this was the normal behavior. &nbsp;When I updated to WP8.1, bluetooth worked as it was supposed to, and as my WP7.5 phones did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone: Lumia 920</p>
<p>OS version: 8.10.14147.180</p>
<p>Firmware: 3051.40000.1347.1001</p>
<p>Hardware Revision Number: 6.0.0.0</p>
<p>Radio Software version: 1.0.202158.3</p>
<p>Chip SOC version: 8960</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having this issue? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm planning on getting a new phone sometime in November, or after they release the successor to the Lumia 1020. &nbsp;If future versions of the OS don't allow me to do text to speech, I may have to look into going to a different platform. &nbsp;As much as I prefer
 the Windows Phone interface to all of the other platforms, I have to have hands-free usability in the car. That's my biggest priority.</p>

            <p>Hello Zedrock:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having with text to speech over Bluetooth.&nbsp; This is certainly a feature that should be working after the recent update to 8.1.&nbsp; I have a few questions regarding your situation that I hope will
 give us a better idea of exactly what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would like to know is if you are able to connect the phone via Bluetooth to another device and use text to speech.&nbsp; I am looking to find out if this is an issue with bluetooth in general or just an issue with the phone working with your
 car Bluetooth system.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to have you try the feature via WiFi.&nbsp; Again, this is to just verify the feature works on the phone under other conditions.&nbsp; It sounds like you are very familiar with the process but just in case any others could use it this article further
 discusses the text to speech feature, <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/apps/use-speech-on-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/apps/use-speech-on-my-phone</a> .&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to some troubleshooting I would suggest the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>If possible, go to the phone and tap settings &gt; applications &gt; Cortana &gt; OFF.</li><li>Please delete the car from your listed Bluetooth devices.&nbsp; You should be able to do this by tapping and holding and then selecting delete.&nbsp; Once this is done, go to the Bluetooth advanced settings and make sure the box related to using alternative Bluetooth
 audio.&nbsp; </li><li>After doing the above, go to settings &gt; storage sense &gt; phone &gt; temporary files &gt; delete &gt; Internet Explorer settings &gt; delete history.&nbsp; After this is done press and hold the down volume button + the power button until the phone vibrates and reboots.&nbsp; After
 the phone has reboot, pair the phone and the car and try the feature again.</li></ul>
<p>For anyone else having this issue, let us know if you found any steps that helped and provide the following details.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make and model of phone.</li><li>Current OS version.</li><li>Current firmware revision.</li><li>Regional setting of the phone.</li><li>Language setting of the phone.</li><li>Your current location.</li><li>Make and model of the Bluetooth system you are connecting to.</li><li>Have you tried the feature over other Bluetooth devices and what was the result?</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to write back and give me some things to try. &nbsp;I have tried all of the steps in your message, and unfortunately, there was no change with my car (2008 Nissan Altima). &nbsp;I tested my phone with my wife's 2010 Hyundai Genesis, and
 it worked as it should. &nbsp;None of the software in my car has changed, so I can only assume that the phone's software is what has broken the feature. &nbsp;I also performed these tests in my garage with wifi enabled, and again with wifi disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a Windows Phone user for a long time, since the Windows Mobile 5.0 days, and unfortunately, the bluetooth connectivity has been very inconsistent from update to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current car is a 2008 Nissan Altima. &nbsp;I've had the following Windows Phones connected to this car: Verizon XV6700 (WM5), AT&amp;T Tilt (WM6), AT&amp;T Tilt 2 (WM6.5), AT&amp;T Samsung Focus (WP7), AT&amp;T HTC Titan (WP7.1 and 7.5) and my current AT&amp;T Nokia Lumia 920
 (WP8, WP8.1, WP8.1 GDR1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Windows Mobile phones, I was able to have some great Bluetooth features that worked with my car such as the incoming callers announced by the MS Voice Command, and being able to have the Voice Command open the Bluetooth Gateway. &nbsp;With a 3rd party
 add-on, I was even able to upload my address book to my car. &nbsp;When I got the HTC TItan with WP7.5, I was able to do text to speech in my car as well as take calls, but I couldn't upload my address book to the car, nor would it announce incoming calls (none
 of the WP7 and newer phones do this.) &nbsp;This made me happy. &nbsp;At least I could text in the car hands free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast forward to my current Lumia 920. &nbsp;With WP8.0 installed, I was unable to do anything in my car over bluetooth, except make phone calls (I had to originate the calls from the phone by pressing buttons) and receiving phone calls. &nbsp;The audio quality was
 rather horrible and choppy. &nbsp;After installing the Developer's preview and WP8.1, I was excited that the audio quality got better (much better) and the text to speech started to work again. Holding the search button would open Cortana, and the Bluetooth gateway
 to my car would be opened. &nbsp;After installing the update last week, the text to voice stopped working again, and holding the search button does not activate my bluetooth gateway in my car, and incoming text messages do not get announced. &nbsp;Other than the quality
 of the audio, my phone's Bluetooth is now functioning as it was when WP8.0 (stock image) was installed on my phone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compared to WP8.1, it would seem that the Update 1 would be a minor update. &nbsp;I'm patiently waiting for the Cyan firmware update to be available for my phone to see if this problem gets fixed. &nbsp;If the Cyan update does not restore my bluetooth functionality,
 I would find that to be frustrating, as I am not able to, nor should I be expected to upgrade my car every time there's an update for my phone.<br />
<br />
Bluetooth issues aside, the battery life on my phone has also become unusable. &nbsp;It takes about 2 hours for my phone to go from 100% to 35%. &nbsp;There may be about 10-20 minutes of email and internet usage in those 2 hours. &nbsp;With WP8.1 prior to update 1, &nbsp;I could
 easily get my battery to last all day with anywhere from 40% to 60% remaining at the end of the day. &nbsp;The surprising thing is that if I check the battery usage in the "Battery Saver" app, no apps are showing high battery usage.<br />
<br />
I'm an IT consultant who spends about 30,000 to 35,000 miles a year in my car, and I refuse to drive and use my phone without hands-free options. &nbsp;Being able to receive text messages without touching my phone is something that I use a lot when it's available.
 &nbsp;Being able to initiate a phone call by pressing one button is also an often used feature. &nbsp;I would absolutely love it if there was a way to restore those features without having to upgrade my car. &nbsp;I am slightly amused that it seems like with every update
 of the phone's OS (with the exception of 8.1) I lose some bluetooth functionality. &nbsp;Sadly, I still keep my old AT&amp;T Tilt around for the sole purpose of uploading my contacts to the car since my current phone will not do that.<br />
<br />
I apologize for the long note. &nbsp;I am an IT professional who has been using Windows powered phones since 2006 and I would like to share my observations with Microsoft in hopes that they can fix the few chinks in the armor of this platform. &nbsp;In my opinion, Windows
 Phone has the best and easiest to use interface, and when it works, the text to speech features are amazing. Outside of the Bluetooth issues I've experienced, the Windows Phones are just solid, don't break, and work as they're supposed to. The biggest problem/inconsistency
 I've seen is the reliability of the Bluetooth functionality over different versions of the OS. &nbsp;In the Windows Mobile days I've seen Microsoft alternate from the MS Bluetooth stack to the Brodcomm/Widcomm stack, where one stack would work with my car, and
 the other wouldn't (I can't remember which worked and which broke anymore.) &nbsp;It almost always seems like if a Bluetooth feature breaks on my car, it would work with a newer car, and most people I know can't upgrade their cars every time they get a new phone.
 &nbsp;If would be great if the fine folks at Microsoft could test the bluetooth on some older vehicles before pushing out the updates to ensure that Bluetooth still works with some of the slightly older cars. &nbsp;I'm not sure why backward compatibility is not retained
 with each update.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to read this note. &nbsp;I hope you are able to find my insights helpful.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,</p>
<p>Randy Lefebvre</p>

            <p>Hello All:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the feedback.&nbsp; We certainly appreciate it and will continue to gather information to see if we can find a common cause for these Bluetooth issues.&nbsp; We do not expect customers to upgrade vehicles when the phone updates.&nbsp; What I think is happening
 is that this is related to either missing firmware updates that will allow the phone to work seamlessly with other devices or incompatibility issues between the new OS and the OS/firmware running on the Bluetooth device in these vehicles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure how updates are pushed to the vehicles entertainment system but I might suggest you start here as this should be the least time consuming and invasive step I can suggest at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other things that can be considered at this time are a factory reset of the phone.&nbsp; This can correct issues with the OS.&nbsp; The other thing you might consider is restoring your previous OS via the Nokia recovery tool.&nbsp; If you have yet to get the official release
 of 8.1 I might suggest you give it a day after the recovery and check for OS updates to see if you can get 8.1 that should include the Cyan update.&nbsp; Once this is done verify that the text to speech feature is again working and consider reinstalling the developer
 preview and update 1.&nbsp; We would be very interested to know if the issue again returns once update 1 is installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We continue to encourage any others with this issue to post to this thread.&nbsp; If you can include some details related to the car infotainment system you are using that may be helpful.&nbsp; Details like the OS/firmware/version number of the system may help us
 further find the common link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue with WP 8.1 Update 1 on both Nokia Black or Nokia CYAN firmware.&nbsp; I posted this just moments ago:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wpdp-wptext/windows-phone-81-broke-bluetooth/f24d4cca-861d-41c7-9b66-96596893961e">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wpdp-wptext/windows-phone-81-broke-bluetooth/f24d4cca-861d-41c7-9b66-96596893961e</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, my car is a 2007 Infiniti G35, so likely a similar BT implementation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CYAN on plain WP8.1 seems to work best.</p>
<p>

            <p>I just got an automated email from the forum asking if my problem had be resolved, so I'm checking in to give an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, I received another update (OS Version 8.10.14157.200) and nothing has improved with my bluetooth connectivity in my car.&nbsp; Nothing other than placing a phone call will open the bluetooth gateway.&nbsp; Recently, I received a text message
 while my phone was dialing a call through bluetooth, and Cortana asked me if I wanted to hear the message.&nbsp; Other than that, incoming text messages no longer get announced, and pressing the Cortana button no longer opens my bluetooth gateway, even though it
 disables the internal mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the steps that I performed the update, including repairing the phone, clearing out the caches, and turning off Cortana.&nbsp; None of it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I visited a Nissan dealer and paired my phone with a 2014 Pathfinder.&nbsp; The bluetooth functionality works well with that car, and the car even wanted to upload my contacts to the car, which made me happy.&nbsp; With my 2008 Altima, I have to keep my HTC
 Titan with Windows Mobile 6.1 around, because it's the only way I can update the address book in my car.<br />
<br />
Also, while at the dealer, I asked if there were any upgrades for the software in my '08 Altima, and the answer was 'no.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Cyan has been released in some countries such as Germany and India, so I'm hoping it reaches AT&amp;T in the USA here. With any luck, that will get me working again.</p>

            <p>I have had similar problems since update 1. I'm on a Nokia Icon, and on the original 8.1 Preview, Cortana was perfect. Now I am seeing all sorts of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>holding down search connects for a moment then drops</li><li>Cortana skips words or syllable's. "You have a ..all from .... Would you like... Or ignore it?"</li><li>Cortana doesn't recognize places, only in reminders. "remind me to post bills when I get home". "ok, where would you like to be reminded?". "home". "ok, I'll remind you to post bills when you get home".
</li></ul>
<p>I have reset, rebooted, factory reset, deleted the phone from my car, turned her off and on, nothing works, it's very frustrating, I use her a ton.

    <title>Microsoft Teams Double Credentials Request Via Web Tab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Teams Double Credentials Request Via Web Tab</h2>
                    <p>Hello, my name is Gabriel Soto and I'm working around the Microsoft Teams Platform. My question is the following:<br />
</p>
<p>I have a team created called, "A". Inside this team I have a channel in which I added a Web Tab so I coulda add a Sharepoint page. I acknowledge the existence of the Sharepoint page or list tab. Nevertheless, I wanted to use the Web tab for this task.</p>
<p>Now, regarding this, I have the following issue:</p>
<p>Even though I'm logged in inside my Microsoft account on my browser, therefore I'm active in the Microsoft environment, when I go to the web tab I just mentioned in Teams, it asks me to log in again. How can I solve this using SSO, which is enabled within
 my organization?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings!</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hello gabriel,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your reply. Based on your reply I'd like to suggest that you can try to remove
<strong>Windows Credentials for Teams</strong> and then logging in again in Teams in desktop app.
</span><span>After login in Teams go to <strong>Website tab</strong> &gt; again sign in website but make sure to accept
<strong>Stay signed in</strong> option if you can see at the time of logging in website and try to check the result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For removing Windows Credential for Teams following are the steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Click <strong>Start</strong>, Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> and click on it, and then search field type
<strong>Credential Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Select <strong>Windows Credential</strong> section click on your Microsoft Teams credential.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click Remove all the Microsoft Teams Credential.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<h3> bruce manford  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Linked image cannot be displayed&#34; problem</h2>
                    <p><span>I wonder if you can help me with this.</span></p>
<p><span>I have been happily using Outlook 2013 for over a year.<span>&nbsp; </span>With no warning Outlook stopped showing linked images in incoming mail.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I get the infamous red X and the usual message “the linked image cannot be displayed.”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have tried every possible solution that I have been able to find on the web and in this forum.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have even removed Office 2013 and installed Office 2016 in its place, but the error continues.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am convinced that there must be a corrupt file or registry error somewhere, but I do not have the skill to find it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I do not use IE, but I have changed all the relevant settings there anyway and that makes no difference either.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I did not really expect that it would since , as I said, until about two weeks ago everything worked fine and I have not made any changes since.</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>I am running 32 bit Office 2016 on Windows 7 Home Premium with all Windows and office updates installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Is it a recent one of those that is to blame perhaps?</span></p>

            <p>That's the&nbsp;Windows Search Email Indexer add-in (mssphtb.dll) and it's disabled in Outlook 2010 and later since they have native support for indexing and no longer need it.&nbsp; To prevent any issues, Outlook 2010&nbsp;and up are programmed to disable it.&nbsp; I'm not

            Unfortunately you have proven to be right to be scepetical.&nbsp; On a reboot the problem is back.&nbsp; But it does suggest that that there is something else out of the ordinary going on.&nbsp; I only wish I could work out what.&nbsp; But it remains the case that on that
 one occasion activating that addin jolted the system into working as is it should for a while.&nbsp; The question then is:&nbsp; how, and how can I repeat that on a permanent basis?<br />

            <p>I know this is an older thread but just had this happen to one of my workstations and the solution is typical Microsoft!</p>
<p>In our case it has nothing to do with Outlook.......Its IE Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing to try is Disk Cleanup and make sure you check the temp folders box.&nbsp; After its done, reboot and try Outlook again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If that does not do it,</p>
<p>Do this:&nbsp; Create a folder on the root of C&nbsp; call it Temp. Go under Temp and create a second folder called Webpagetemp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then go into Internet Explorer/Internet Options under the general tab select "Settings" under Browsing history. Under the Temporary Internet Files tab select "Move Folder".&nbsp; Move it to "C/temp/webpagetemp"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will then tell you its going to move the folder and reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this works.</p>

<h2>            Mobile Devices Unable to Connect to Shared Mailbox</h2>
                    
<p>Split from This Thread.</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been accessing an Office 365 shared mailbox from my Samsung S4 phone successfully for the last couple of years, but for the last 3 days I have been unable to authenticate and access that email box. Nothing has changed in our Exchange settings or on
 my phone. Is Microsoft having a network issue that may be causing this problem?</p>
<p>I am able to access the account from a PC with Outlook just fine, but my phone continues to ask me to input the password, and when I do, it fails to connect.</p>
<p>It looks like I am having the same issue as the O.P.</p>

<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I'd explain&nbsp;this configuration should not be possible with a true shared mailbox configuration as these mailboxes are not licensed and have no direct username/password login information. If the mailboxes were originally created as user mailboxes and converted
 to shared mailboxes then the access could have been a remnant of the conversion but direct access to shared mailboxes in Exchange should not be possible. The recommended workaround is to convert the shared mailboxes back to user mailboxes and license them
 for access.</p>
<p>We are unsure why it worked as it did when it should not have or what change made them stop working but pls understand the shared mailbox access and will convert and license the mailboxes for access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Neo</p>

<p>Hi FarhatIqbal,</p>
<p>The error message indicates that the mailbox you’re trying to access is now being migrated. If that’s true, please wait for the migration to be completed and try to sign in later.</p>
<p>And if the error persists, I’d like to know if you’re an admin of your Office 365 organization. If yes, please provide the below details:<br />
1.&nbsp;Where did you migrate this mailbox from? Was it an Exchange on-premises server?<br />
2.&nbsp;Which migration method did you choose? A cutover migration, staged migration, IMAP migration, or a hybrid move request?<br />
3.&nbsp;Does the error occur to any other migrated mailbox user?</p>
<p>If you’re not the admin, please involve your admin to provide the information above for further investigation.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Gary<br />
</p>

<p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>1- We didn't migrate this mailbox. We are managing these mailboxes from Office 365 Admin portal and its synced with Active Directory.</p>
<p>2- We found this issue on two mailboxes. One mailbox worked again after one day. but other is still not working.</p>

<p>Hi Farhatlqbal,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Regarding “We are managing these mailboxes from Office 365 Admin portal and its synced with Active Directory”, please let us know if you have made any change to these two mailboxes before. To further troubleshoot the issue, I need some information below:</p>
<p>1. Which web browser did you use to login to OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>)? Have you tried different browsers?</p>
<p>2. Does the problematic user account already have a mailbox in on-premises? Please check if any error related to the sync can be found on the on-premises sync server’s event log viewer, and then provide it to us if any.</p>
<p>3. The outputs after running the command below in Exchange Online PowerShell for the two mailboxes.</p>
<p><b>Get-Mailbox mailboxname | fl</b></p>
<p>Note: Please replace the ‘mailboxname’ with the two mailboxes’ name. To connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx</a></p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the error log (if any) and the outputs. You can click the URL below to read and reply to it:</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations</p>
<p>In addition, based on my knowledge, this error seems to be caused by a temporary network resource allocation while the sync is in progress. Once the network resource is allocated, the process will resume correctly and the user should be able to access the
 mailbox.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Larry</p>

<p>The point of providing a Skype name is for an employer to locate your account. Many times simply providing your email address should be an ample way for an employer to locate your account. If you have an older Skype account, your Skype name will be whatever
 name you created. If you have a newer account and signed up with your phone number, it will be a generated set of alphanumeric characters. If you signed up with your email address, the name will be based off your email address in the form of live:email id
 (with or without additional numbers). There are many ways to locate your Skype name. One easy way is in the client. Simply click on your profile picture to view your profile containing your Skype name. Below is an example based off an edited version of one
 of my accounts:</p>

<p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I want to know what apps are you using? Teams desktop client or Teams web application. If you are using Teams desktop client, please let me know the detailed version number. If you are using Teams web application, you can try to use other web browsers
 to see if there is any difference. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Microsoft Teams, if you want to download a student’s assignment, first you need to click and open the assignment they submitted. Then click “<strong>…</strong>” and choose
<strong>Download</strong> to download the assignment to your computer.</p>

<h2>            Search not working on Outlook 2011 for mac - tried many fixed</h2>
                    My Outlook search seems to be&nbsp;irreparably&nbsp;broken.
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><u>Things I have tried to do:</u></b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Re index my entire hard drive from spotlight.</li><li>Rebuild my Outlook identity.</li><li>Copy my identity data into a new identity.</li><li>Mark my Microsoft User Data as private (within spotlight) then make it public again.</li><li>And finally, I created a completely new profile and started over from scratch. Adding each of my email accounts into a virgin profile.</li><li>I deleted these files: com.microsoft.Outlook.SyncServicesPreferences.plist , com.microsoft.SyncservicesAgent.plist ,&nbsp;OfficeSync Prefs</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yes, search does work from Spotlight so this is not a Spotlight problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I created the new profile last night search appeared to be working fine. This morning, search no longer works.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What's weird is that search is working erratically. For instance</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>In one of my accounts no search results at all are found.&nbsp;</li><li>In another account search seems to be working fine.&nbsp;</li><li>In another account search is barely working. What I mean by barely working is that most search terms get no hits but I have found a couple of terms that get two or three hits when there should be hundreds. The 2-3 hits are all from today, but even for today
 there are more than 2-3 hits so it's not even complete for today. And there are some search results that should have hits today but turn up nothing.</li></ol>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I suppose that #1 might be the same as #3 but I just haven't stumbled across any search terms that return anything in #1.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As I said, Spotlight seems to find everything that Outlook Search misses.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything was working fine until a few days ago and I did not make any changes on my end.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>**PLEASE before suggesting anything look at the list of things I have already tried. I scoured the Internet for a solution and already tried the most common fixes.</b></div>

            I don't know what the heck is going on but search results are vanishing. In instance #2, the account that search was working for earlier today, is no longer working. I get zero results.
<div><br />
<div>And in instance #3 I'm again not getting any search results.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So basically I'm back to Outlook search not working at all even though it works in Spotlight.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is ridiculous. I'm already kicking the tires with other email clients since I'm not getting any help here and this is one of a long line of issues I've had with Outlook 2011. However, it's the first problem I can't seem to solve, but it's a BIG one
 and it's the straw that finally breaks the camel's back. I don't have time to keep fixing problems with this buggy software.</div>
<div><br />
<div>ESPECIALLY since the main reason I am using Outlook 2011 in the first place is for the calendar. However, I can't even use the calendar since there is no way to sync Outlook for the Mac's calendar with Google Calendar. (You can on the PC where Outlook
 works great.) So there is nothing keeping me from making the switch to another email client. I hope someone from Microsoft is listening! And I hope someone can help me get search working.</div>

            I feel your pain!!! Went through all of the same steps but found this posted solution that worked for me today:
<div><br />
<div><span><i>We had this issue surface in my company, most were able to be fixed by reindexing the drive but we had a few that nothing seemed to work. So after a bit of digging it was determined to be a permission
 issue on the /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011 folder. On every person that nothing seemed to work they were the sole owner of that folder with drwx------ (700) as the permissions. Normally this would be ok, I mean the users can run the .app bundles. However
 Spotlight needs access to a Outlook.mdimport plugin contained in the Outlook.app bundle. With these permissions the mds (spotlight) service which runs as ROOT could not get there and thus could not successful import the Outlook database.</i></span></div>
<div><span><i><br />
</i></span></div>
<p><i>sudo chown root:wheel "/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011"</i></p>
<p><i>sudo chmod 755 "/Applications/Microsoft Office 2011"</i></p>
<div><i>sudo mdutil -a -i on /</i></div>
<div><i>sudo mdutil -Ea &nbsp;/<span>&nbsp;</span></i></div>

            <p>Workbook_Open is executed before Auto_Open, but both are later as the Update Links message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To disable the Update Links message, open your file, go into the Data tab, Click the Edit Links button.</p>
<p>Click Startup Prompt... button and change the behavior like you want.</p>
<p>Finally save the file</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you choose the "don't update links" option, you can update the links with the buttons inside that window or execute this little macro:</p>

    <title>Calendars merged in Android. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> basilrazi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendars merged in Android.</h2>
                    <p>I have 4 calendars on my outlook account. Today I got a new phone (Galaxy S7 on Android 6.0.1) and set up my outlook accounts, through the app as well as an EAS account. Just like I have in my old phone (Xperia z on 5.1.1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook app shows the calendars individually, however the native and my other calendar apps have merged all 4 calendars into 1 calendar named
<em><strong>***Email address deleted for security purposes***</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing the EAS and setting it up with the instructions here:&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/to-go</p>
<p>But that hasn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can go back to having my 4 separate calendars showing up instead of only the 1 merged one. Thanks</p>
                </div>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I appreciate you for your new phone and
</span></span><span>we are happy to help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to login to the merged calendar’s email account through a web browser (by logging into
</span><a href="https://calendar.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 106, 155, 1)">https://calendar.live.com/</span></a><span><span>website) from the computer and check for the individual
 calendars.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that, when you configure an email account in the Outlook app on your device, all the calendars will be synced and merged within the Google Calendar and
 also, in the Outlook app Calendar. You will not be able to separate individual calendars as it’s by design.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you need any further assistance let us know and we would be glad to assist you.</span></p>

</p><p>Where as in my new phone:&nbsp;http://imgur.com/a/i5T33 where the calendars have all merged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the account setting on both phones and I don't see a difference. I set up my outlook account on my new phone just like I did with my old phone i.e. as an active exchange account.&nbsp;</p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I applied the 14.2.4 Update a few months ago and then the 14.2.4 update a few days ago, and all the applications (Word, Powerpoint, Outlook) have all updated fine.</div>

            Hi Bob
<div><br />
<div>I found the solution in Facebook Office for Mac:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>how to create Web query files for use with Excel helps: http://bit.ly/L92EOd</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since I wroted I have investigated this issue and have tried to make a query (named: euroinvestor.txt or .iqy) but I get an error:</div>
<div><br />
<div>WEB</div>
<div>1</div>
<div>http://www.euroinvestor.dk/markeder/aktier/europa/danmark/omxc-large-cap</div>
<div><br />
<div>Selection=EntirePage</div>
<div>Formatting=All</div>
<div>PreFormattedTextToColumns=True</div>
<div>ConsecutiveDelimitersAsOne=True</div>
<div>SingleBlockTextImport=False</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I run this in Excel (Data menu, Get External Data, Run saved query, open, OK) I get this error:</div>
<div><br />
<div>'There is an unexpected error'</div>
<div><br />
<div>and nothings happens.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Answer:</div>
<div>Copy the query from this Facebook posting. Paste into a new, blank Word document. Save as Plain Text. Use MS-DOS encoding. Close the Word document. Re-open the Word document and you'll see extra ? characters. Delete them. Then click Save in Word. Now switch
 to Excel. Use the Data &gt; Run Saved Query feature and choose the saved text file. Should work OK now.</div>

            I'm not sure that a query to do this is a task for a complete newcomer to working with MS Access.&nbsp; You won't do it with a simple query.&nbsp; It could be done by calling a function in a query, whose code loops through the first table's columns (fields) per
 primary key value, and within that loop examines the second table's corresponding column, incrementally building a string expression as the function's return value where the values do not match.&nbsp; This is not too difficult if you understand how to work with
 recordsets in code, but is not trivial and might be outside the comfort zone of someone new to the subject.<br />
<br />
Another way of presenting the mismatches would be to do so in a report.&nbsp; The report would be based on a query which joins the two tables on the primary key columns, returning all columns from each table.&nbsp; The values could then be presented in the report's detail
 section as two rows, with the corresponding columns from each table vertically aligned with each other.&nbsp; Conditional formatting could then be used to change the ForeColor and/or BackColor of each control if its value differed from the corresponding one above/below
 it.&nbsp; The report would show all values for all columns in both tables, but where the values differ these would be readily apparent by virtue of their different colour.&nbsp; Such a query and report would be very easy to create, and no code would be required. It
 would merely require you to build the simple non-equality expressions for the conditional formatting of each control.<br />

<p>Thank you Ken, even though I am familiar with algorithms and coding. My experience is with Java and XHTML, whereas Access uses SQL. That's just to much work for a side project at work. I just wanted to confirm with some others that what I was hoping to accomplish,
 could not be simply achieved. I apologies for the lack of information I provided in my example; it sounded better in my head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At work, we have 2 databases that don't communicate with each other, and are maintained by 2 different departments. So there are some errors when inputting the data. The necessary data that requires correction can be exported in to excel, but with over 1800
 rows and 9 columns it can become time consuming pinpointing the errors. It was expected that locating the unmatched values could be done rather quick using Microsoft access. Like I previously stated, I was able to create a query to return the primary keys
 that have unmatched values, but the unmatched values could occur in any of the nine fields. So the query will return roughly 400 PKs with all 9 fields. 400 is much better to work with than 1800, but it would be nice if I could pinpoint the exact field for
 the PK that had the error.</p>

            I think this can be done using Conditional Formatting in a Report. Create a Query joining the two tables on the PK, with criteria on the other fields to find mismatches; use OR logic so a record will be retrieved if any field is mismatched. You can then
 display the query on a Report, using the Conditional Formatting feature with an expression on each field, to display the matches in black and white and the mismatches in (say) green on red background.&nbsp;

            <p>You say you've already created a query which returns the primary key columns of rows with mismatches.&nbsp; If you join that query to both tables to return all columns from each table and create a report as I and John have described, returning two rows per key
 value, and highlighting the mismatches by means of conditional formatting, then, if we assume 12 pairs of rows per page and 400 rows with mismatches are returned, that's only 34 pages to scan.&nbsp; Provided that you select a prominent colour for the mismatches,
 they'll stick out like sore thumbs as you scan the pages, so it's not going to be a particularly onerous task to identify the culprits.<br />
<br />
As I said earlier, you can return a result table like that which you described, but it needs a knowledge of VBA more than of SQL as the hard work will be done in the function called by the query.&nbsp; If you can post a file with cut down samples of your two tables,
 say 100 rows each with 10 or so mismatched rows, to a file sharing site such as OneDrive, and post a link to it here I'd be happy to have a crack at it.<br />
<br />
If you'd prefer not to put a file in the public domain you can mail it to me at the following munged address:&nbsp;

<h2>            pc keeps restarting during windows boot startup</h2>
                    I updated my laptop to windows 10 but it didn't work that well. The screen kept on flashing and then it would turn black with just the mouse cursor moving. So I decided to reset my PC, keep my files and then reinstall windows as it said on the recovery
 options. Was waiting for like half an hour or so for the resetting part and then the screen showed the windows 10 reinstalling. It paused at 15% for quite a while and then the screen just went black. up until now my laptop would just get stuck at the booting
 screen and then it restarts every time. can there be a fix to this problem?

<h2>            OneNote Not Backing Up to Designated Location</h2>
                    <p>I am using Win7 and Office 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have pointed&nbsp;the "backup folder" to "D:\dropbox\david's stuff\computer_tech stuff\onenote backup\14.0\backup 2", I run the backup, but there are no files within the folder once the backup is complete. I had the same problem when dropbox was on my c drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>I did change the location of the backup to my dropbox folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, I did move my notebook to the same folder as my backup. It seems to be backing up now as I have the folder "14/backup" in my dropbox. I did not add this folder thus I assume OneNote added this folder per my manual backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, it appears that my backup is now working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply Guruprasad.</p>
