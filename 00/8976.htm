<h2>            Some footnotes lose their style after joining documents</h2>
                    <p>I have a multi-chapter document. Each chapter is in a separate Word file, and each one is supposed to use the same styles. Each chapter also has more than a 100 footnotes (with reference within text). The footnotes all have the style "Footnote Text"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before rendering the final document, I join all chapters by inserting a section break and and then Insert -&gt; File.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that some footnotes (maybe 5 out of more than 100 in a document) lose their style and become Heading 1 or Heading 2. What strange is, that it is usually the "same" footnote text (reference to the same book for example). But if I check the
 source document, the whole text of that footnote really has the "Footnote Text" style, I don't see even one character from that note having another style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I did was to remove formatting of that note in the source file, re-apply the "Footnote Text" format, and try to re-join the documents. The note in questions then shows up OK, but another note, previously fine in the first join attempt, now has the
 wrong "Heading 1" style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I thought this might have had something to do with copy paste from another document, with the footnote text somehow "retaining" the style from the file it was copied from, but since it seems to happen to a new note after fixing one, I am a bit lost.
 Besides, even if the style was retained, I should see something else than "Footnote Text" in the style in the original chapter document, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known problem when joining documents? Am I doing something wrong?</p>

            The problem may be indicative of some corruption in one or more of the documents. It's difficult to say whether that corruption is in the source documents or the target document. Corrupt documents can often be 'repaired' by inserting a new, empty, paragraph
 at the very end, copying everything except that new paragraph to a new document based on the same template (headers &amp; footers may need to be copied separately), closing the old document and saving the new one over it.

            The Registry keeps changing and also a lot of internet traffic on the netstat -na, if search in the CMD&nbsp;or just the netstat, from what I read online, seems there is a BO on here too or something, what ever that means, my computer acts like in control of
 something or someone, like can't even get secure pages, not sure, not a computer tech, just reading online of what may be the issues, or what virus or malware or Trojan I may have picked up, this computer sat a long time, was remanufactured I think, then never
 has been put online, until 9/5/17 that I know of. But seems to got a virus or hacked. My other computers were acting same way, my phone too, all act weird. They like open fake sites or redirects, was bad before and now worse. I am so upset that keep getting
 hacked. Has to be due to my IP or ??????????, Maybe Router ??????????, Have no clue. &nbsp;

            It would be nice, but can't load any programs, seems I'm redirected to a Bot or Server that is Rogue or something, not sure. This is worse then last bug had. Last bug was just pop ups, redirects to guess you call paste over pages, &nbsp;click one thing get<br />
another, was really weird, also if left computer on, there was pages open that were not open when turned off screen, almost like someone had control of computer, or had remote access, I couldn't power computer down, if did it was hard to get started back up,<br />
tried new power supply, but think it fried something else&nbsp;too. Power surge from tree landed on house,&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is like the Virus or Malware from Hades, I have tried everything, on my own, but can't get rid of it, about ready to give up. Never seen or had<br />
a bug this bad. Maybe Router&nbsp;attacked&nbsp;or???. Thanks&nbsp;though, will try a few of the things in your posted link.&nbsp;I'm at wits end. &nbsp;

            No not resolved yet, can't get virus scanners to load or any tools to scan PC. So not sure what bugs are on here, but can't get to secure websites to load virus scanners or anything. Seems like Virus blocking me and disables anything we try. My girlfriend
 tried too, she better at computers then me, she gave up too. Seems hopeless. Accounts have been hacked for a while it seems. Seems like something or someone has remote access to all our electronics, computers and phones, weird. Maybe we got email bug or something.
 Thanks. Could be a router hacked or ??????. We have no clue yet. Just guessing. Thanks.

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;Ashish Singh,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for sharing your experience here. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In Office 2016, if you have many instances, the existing workbook will open in the latest instance.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a normal behavior in Office 2016.</span></p>
<p><span>One workaround is to drag the file to the first instance, and the file will stay in the first instance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We understand this may cause inconvenience for you, so we kindly invite you to submit your feedback in&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UserVoice
</a>which is actively monitored by related team and many features have been designed or updated based on Users' feedback.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>

<p>This was not the case in excel 2010 and this change has some serious implications , such as the new workbook waiting forever in case latest instances of excel.exe is running a long running vba macro. Can you please check with your team how to fall back to
 old behaviour ( i.e. use 1st instance if exce.exe for opening new workbooks ) &nbsp;with a config change ? This is extremely important for me.

            Hi Ashish,<br />
<br />
I can see you've created a thread in Uservoice, you can also vote in the Uservoice Link Jerry Shared below.<br />
(It has been merged to another thread so the thread title has changed, I think that's why you think Jerry provided random urls):<br />
<a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/31707034-reinstate-the-ability-to-open-multiple-workbooks-i?tracking_code=2ddaddb4686f3533837db0661f034efa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reinstate the ability
 to open multiple workbooks in a single instance in Excel</a><br />
<br />
Now let's focus on the "open file in random instance" issue. I understand the issue behavior is:<br />
Sometimes after you double click an Excel file, the workbook opens in Latest instance and sometime it opens in First instance.<br />
<br />
By default Excel 2016 will only create one instance, and if you manually create a new one, the newly opened files will still be opened in First instance. I'd ask:<br />
<br />
a. Could you please share your detailed steps before you encounter the issue for our reference? You can attach a screenshot.&nbsp;<br />
Will it open the first instance (expected) randomly using the same steps?<br />
b. Does this happen to any files?<br />
c. To check if it's related to Office update, do you remember the "old behavior" Office version and the "random behavior" Office version? Please check File &gt; Account and share the subscription and version number.<br />
<br />
In addition, regarding the issue you mentioned "new workbook waiting forever in case latest instances of excel.exe is running a long running vba macro", you can refer to this article as a workaround:<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had two step verification enabled initially but it could not log in and it told me I logged in too many times and must wait. Then I disabled 2 step verification but it still made no difference. Even without 2 step verification it tells me that my username
 / password is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is this possible that I can log into ALL my Microsoft services with that very same username and password, but it does not allow me to sign in to Office 365 from my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify what I am doing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open the Office app on Windows Phone 8.1 (with latest developer preview installed)</p>
<p>2. Go to Places&nbsp;and select Office 365</p>
<p>3. Click "set up"</p>
<p>4. Type in my username and password and get the error message "Couldn't sign in. Check your user name and password, then try again"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating as I want to edit some spreadsheets on the phone but from what I understand I need to log in to my Office 365 account to do this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
        </p>

            <p><span>Thank you for the reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As explained in the article given below, when you turn on the ‘Two-step verification’, some phones or devices will show an incorrect password error because you can’t get the prompt to enter a security
 code when you sign in. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, if you've turned on two-step verification, and you see an incorrect password error with an app or device, you'll need to get and enter a unique app password to sign in.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you’re unable to turn on the ‘Two-step verification’ then you may contact support team to resolve this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to ‘Need more help?’ section to contact support team.

            <p>I thought I was clear about this.... Like I said, it does not matter whether 2 step is on or off, I still get the same error. So :</p>
<p>-&nbsp;If 2 step is on I get the error</p>
<p>-&nbsp;When I turn 2 step off I still&nbsp;get the same error. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I get in contact with support? I&nbsp;contacted support&nbsp;and then they said it was paid support and I must post on this forum to get support. Now you tell me that I must contact support again. You guys are really confusing me with inconsistent messages
 about where I should go and what I should do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate it if someone can give me a clear answer. Preferably I would like to talk to someone via online chat to sort this out. Can you please give me a URL I can go to where&nbsp;I can get proper support?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think that it is fair that Microsoft charges me money for something I cannot use properly</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have the issue of not being able to sign Office Mobile, on a Microsoft/Nokia Lumia phone running Windows Phone 8.1, into my Office 365 account.&nbsp; I've always tried to set up the sign-in in the presence of Wi-Fi, so, I believe, the fact that my phone's
 carrier is AT&amp;T should not matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never have enabled two-factor authentication, although I recently linked authentication apps to the account in question.&nbsp; In my case, however, the Windows Live/Microsoft account is neither an older Hotmail email account, nor a newer Outlook.com email account;
 it is a non-Microsoft account that I have maintained for&nbsp;years.&nbsp; I <strong>can</strong> sign into Outlook.com using the particular account that has my Office 365 subscription associated with it, but I haven't been able to get Office Mobile on the Lumia Winphone
 to "sign in" to the account of my Office 365 subscription.&nbsp; It shouldn't matter that the account doesn't end in "Hotmail.com" nor "Outlook.com", right?&nbsp; Any help or helpful suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>I wish you good luck, as I have never been able to solve it. Neither has any MS support agent also ever shown any genuine interest in getting it resolved. For a week I was passed from one support agent to the next, each telling me they cannot help me, I
 need to speak to another "department". </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office 365 people blamed the Windows Phone team. The Windows Phone team blamed the Live team. The live team blamed the Office team. The Office team blamed the Windows Phone team and so I went round and round for days until I finally gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each support agent was obviously just getting interested in getting rid of the problem and "closing" the ticket as soon as possible. Heaven forbid they actually spend time with a client in trying to resolve an issue because come the end of the month it will
 look bad on their statistics if they took too long to close a ticket.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So each support agent did what they do best - closed the ticket in a few minutes by passing the customer along somewhere else and resolving the support ticket by marking it as "Another department's problem".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was honestly the worst customer experience I have ever experienced. And not a single one of the support agents showed any hint of caring. Next time MS wants to lay of a few thousand people they should perhaps start by getting rid if the support people...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hanging on the my Office 365 subscription for the unlimited OneDrive and the Skype minutes. And honestly the product is not bad. Just hope and pray you do not ever need support.</p>

            <p>Hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the same problems as you (I am using Nokia LUMIA 635). &nbsp;And this is the solution I found out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With 365office already preloaded on your phone, you do not have to login to office365 and as you know it does not allow you to login anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you you got to office and swipe to recent and not places, you get a + icon at the bottom of the screen. &nbsp;If you click on the + icon, you can start a new word and excel documents and &nbsp;you also have a couple of template options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p>My dream phone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A nokia e72 with a dual sim. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only a real traveller with business interest in multiple countries will know the true value of a dual sim phone. &nbsp;I have been using nokia phones for over 15 years now. &nbsp;I always carried 3 to 4 phones at any given time, until 2006 when I stumbled upon a chinese
 make dual sim touch phone. &nbsp;It worked alright ( I mean it served the purpose) but the user interface was lousy, it had no wifi and couldnt sync my contacts. &nbsp;And worst of all it just stopped working after a few months. &nbsp;Then came Samsung D880. &nbsp;A very good
 phone indeed ! but again no wifi. &nbsp;So am currently using the D880 for my overseas trips. I have one etisalat sim installed permanently in the second slot of the D880 and I insert a sim slot 1 wherever I go. But I love my Nokia e71 and can not do without it,
 so I have a second etisalat sim with the same number installed in my e71. &nbsp;So when I am in Dubai, I switch the samsung D880 off. and use my e71. &nbsp;When I am abroad, I put my e71 in offline mode and switch on my D880. &nbsp;Keeping y e71 offline, still allows me
 to access my emails thru wifi when I am outside my office or home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also looked at the new samsung touchscreen dual sim phone, but was not impressed. &nbsp;No wifi ! and I hate using a stylus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So until such time Nokia brings out a dual sim phone with wifi and all the other usual great features, I guess I have to stick to my samsung d880 for my travel needs. &nbsp;And as for my e71, I am happy with it but will surely grab an e72 as soon as it appears
 in the stores. &nbsp;I did a mistake of buying the N97 last month, got carried away actually, but after a couple of days of playing with the resistive touch screen I gifted it off to some one dear. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong, the n97 is the king of smartphones as on date
 in the market, with its awesome features and 32 gigs of memory, but it simply is not for me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Shaks</p>

<p>There is a very high demand for a Dual SimCard GSM phone. Many like me have to carry two mobile phones because of:</p>
<p><br />
1. Mobile operation connectivity in different areas<br />
2. Frequent travel domestic and international<br />
3. Different business and personal numbers<br />
4. Price of calling different mobile networks<br />
5. Old phone number which needs to be gradually phased out<br />
6. Support engineers having to carry bersonal and support mobile after office hours... etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are all compelling arguments for having products with dual sim capability and this perhaps why Smasung has launched 5 different dual sim models in a short time span.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dislike samsung because of its usability and try to only stick with IPhone or Nokia when it comes to mobile phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>India is a huge consumer base for mobile phones and a dual sim phone in my opinion can go a long way to increase the market share of apple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web search engines show a large number of search hits for dual sim phone and dual sim ghost cards. For travelers like me it has become a higher priority to choose a mobile phone with dual sim capability over camera and other features.</p>

<p>i third that opinion that we, in the 21st century, need to be technologically mature enough to not to have this discussion.<br />
dual sim phones are in demand and it is strange really that phone manufacturers not willing to include this future.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
PS by the way, is it known when to expect E72? i would be glad to see this phone somewhere in January in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Hi ahsayeed, I am in desperate need for a dual SIM handset cause I have multiple SIM cards, but I don't want to purchase a cheap, inferior chinese made phone. I rather use a Nokia or will&nbsp;even consider a S*msung but I doubt they incorporate this function
 with their high end models like Omnia HD which every handset should emulate.</p>
<p>I had thought of purchasing a dual SIM adaptor but it has limitations such as cutting the SIM card or turning on &amp;&nbsp;off to switch between SIMs is a big inconvience.:manmad:</p>

            Well, in my experience of them, maybe not knock the current range of "cheap, inferior Chinese phones" too much. I suspect many vastly exceed the specifications of Nokia and, indeed, I suspect that many of them are made in the same Chinese factories as
 Nokias are anyway!&nbsp;

<p>Hello wilson63,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samsung currently have 3 handsets with dual sim capabilities. &nbsp;I am using the D880 but the newer version is a touch screen phone. &nbsp;But it does not have wi-fi !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until Nokia comes out with one, you might want to check out the samsungs, their interface is not bad actually but certainly no way near to Nokia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>i want to post a new message but dont know how. so i just clicked your post and the reply button..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and besides you talk well... hehehe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>like you, im also looking for a nokia phone with dual sim capability.&nbsp; ive tried samsung but i got lost in its not-so-user-friendly&nbsp; features.&nbsp; Nokia features are the best for me, except, it doesnt have a dual sim capability.&nbsp; i tried MYPHONE... a china
 phone with TV feature..&nbsp; the features are similar with nokia: simple and user-friendly except for one thing, it doesnt have a draft storage capability.&nbsp; when you type a text message and somehow you pressed a wrong button, your message got erased and you have
 to retype your message all over again..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>how i wish, nokia would find it in its heart to manufacture the phone we need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or maybe, in this world,&nbsp; we cant really have everything...</p>

<p>Hi all, Nokia suppose to be an innovator in new ideas &amp; for others to emulate, but unfortunately they seem to be lagging behind with the dual SIM feature. I have both the E90 &amp; E71 &amp; I think other aspects of them&nbsp;are great.</p>
<p>Dual SIM is not too difficult to implement, I am not surprised&nbsp; if other brands will over take Nokia if they don't smarten up.:smileysad:</p>

            This is a pervasive issue that occurred just today (3/9) with Office 360, but, as usual, Microsoft blames it on the user.&nbsp; Of course this is a Microsoft issue, and they will quietly fix it while the rest of us suffer, then pretend there was no issue at
 all.&nbsp; Why, oh why, were we corralled into using Office 360?

<h2>            Error Code 80004005 &#38; Error Code 9C57 - Update&#40;s&#41; KB2670838 &#38; IE 10 - Repeated Installation Failures</h2>
                    Two weeks of repeated failures when attempting to install Windows 7 Platform Update KB2670838 &amp; IE 10.&nbsp; I'm running Win7 Home Premium with SP1 &amp; all current updates (save those addressed herein) on a Samsung QX410 with 2nd gen Intel Core i5 &amp; Nividia 310
 graphics. Repeated attempts over 3 weeks to install KB2670838 result in failure error 80004005. This is a platform update required to install IE 10, which will also not install &amp; generates error 9C57.<br />
<br />
Repeated attempts have been made to install KB2670838 &amp; IE 10 jointly &amp; individually on each occasion of attempt. Troubleshooting tools have been run multiple times with results stating errors have been found &amp; fixed. Text reporting the fixes made is shown
 below, &amp; is identical on every occasion:<br />
<br />
- Potential Windows Update Database error detected 0x80070002&nbsp; - fixed<br />
- Windows Update components must be repaired &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; - fixed<br />
- Problem with Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - fixed<br />
<br />
Anybody know what gives????&nbsp; At this point IE 9 is also non-functional &amp; it will not re-install either.<br />
<br />
A fuller background of record, I had attempted to install the Release Preview (not Pre-Release) of IE 10 some 2 months ago. This attempted IE 10-RP installation failed &amp; broke IE 9. When attempting to re-install IE 9 I'm greeted with a message that advises
 the installation has been refused because MS, (while rooting about inside my machine), has determined that I have a "newer" version of this program installed. I'm not confident that my expertise is sufficient to &amp; root around in the Registry &amp; remove any vestiges
 of IE 9 &amp; IE 10 (to try a clean install of either 9 or 10), given the extent of the dependency with which an MS browser is integrated into the Windows platform.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help that can be provided. There's plenty that has been written about these problems by many people but no solutions to be found among the responses I've been able to find.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Edited on 3/11 @ 03:39 EST - removed my P.S. whiney little rant about my ever so delicate &amp; woefully bruised sensibilities regarding support blah blah blah. Good grief; given that I'm in a position to be contending with such 1st world "problems" I should be
 delighted for opportunity to learn a little something here!<br />
<br />
(<i>unless of course</i> ....... <i>yes, that's it</i> ..... alright, <i><b>Come Clean Here Balmer!</b></i> You've been
<u><b>targeting me all along</b></u>, haven't you, <i><b>Balmer?</b></i> <i>YYyeeessss!</i> Of course ... it's all becoming quite clear now! I don't know
<b>How</b> I could have missed it before.!?!?!?). Ok, so I'm maybe still just a bit delusional but, well you know, eh,&nbsp; whad ah ya gunna do?<br />

</p><p>I spent hours researching and attempting to fix this on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution that worked was to call MS Helpdesk.&nbsp; They also spent hours attempting to fix this and it wasn't until "Janet" from India save the day...</p>
<p>
</p><p>She explained the problem was due to corrupt registry files.&nbsp; She fixed the problem by performing a repair installation of Windows (which takes hours)....</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the repair installation was completed, all the updates worked and I was able to upgrade to Explorer 11...</p>
<p>
</p><p>She all cleared all the files under:&nbsp; Temp&nbsp;&nbsp; %temp%&nbsp;&nbsp; Prefetch</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then ran a clean disk to eliminate unused files...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything is working well again.</p>

</p><p>Hi Nemanja</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have experienced the same error when I access Recipients -&gt; Migration -&gt; Add a plan in Exchange Online EAC. T<span>he issue seems to follow my account while other member of Global Administrator doesn’t seem to have the same issue. And more interestingly
 I have no problem at all in using other functions in Portal.Microsoft.Com other than that.</span></p>
<p>I look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>BTW, using different browsers doesn't seem to be a fix.</span></p>

<p>Apparently it works again itself. I don't know why though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried a few things on my computer, for example, removing cookies, using different browser etc. I had other Global Administrator move me out of the group and add me back in. Nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I ended up logging a ticket through the Portal to Microsoft. However, the suggestions I was given didn't seem to be any helpful. :-(</p>
<p>

    <title>Mixed page size double sided print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curtis stone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mixed page size double sided print</h2>
                    <p>I have a document that is mostly normal letter size pages in portrait orientation, but have a couple of large charts that are on 11 x 17 pages in landscape orientation.&nbsp; When I put the document together for binding, I fold the large pages using an "engineer
 fold" which makes them 8 1/2 x 11 to match the rest of the document, then the pages are bound along the 11 inch edge.&nbsp; You end up with a normal 8 1/2" width x 11" height document but with some pages that fold out to 17" width x 11" height.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...I have a section of 8 1/2 x 11 portrait pages, then a section of 11 x 17 landscape pages, then a final section of 8 1/2 x 11 portrait pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I print, I set the printer to double sided, flip on long edge, but that means in the 8 1/2 x 11 sections the long edge is the left edge as it should be, but in the 11 x 17 sections, the long edge is the top.&nbsp; The end result is that the reverse side
 of the 11 x 17 pages ends up being printed upside down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to specify in the document that a specific section is supposed to be printed "flip on short edge" rather than the standard "flip on long edge"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, is there a way to rotate the even number pages 180 degrees in that section of the document so they'll print properly?</p>

            I don't believe there's any method that will permit you to print the entire document in one pass. I think you will have to print the 11x17 pages separately. If they have 8<span>½ x 11 pages printed
 on the back, you'll probably have to duplex those manually.</span>

<h3> rueful rabbit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t add&#47;edit picture hyperlink</h2>
                    <p>I have been asked to edit a powerpoint slide created by someone else that contains several picture objects where clicking on the picture is supposed to open a file.&nbsp; With some of the pictures, I have no trouble -- when I right-click on the picture, I get
 an "edit hyperlink" command and when I click on that I get a file dialog.&nbsp; With at least one picture, however, when I right-click on it there is no "edit hyperlink" command and the Insert--&gt;Links--&gt;Hyperlink command in the ribbon is disabled.&nbsp; Why would that
 be?&nbsp; How can I add/edit a hyperlink for that picture?&nbsp; Is it necessary to replace the picture in some particular fashion?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some other cases, I get a Hyperlink... command when I right-click on the icon, but when I click on the command I don't get a file dialog, but instead only options to affect actions on mouse-click or mouse-over.&nbsp; I may not have to set a hyperlink on those
 pictures, however.</p>

            For the pictures that give you the Action Settings Dialog box for On Click and On Mouse Over, choose the Mouse Over option, and then click on Hyperlink To... You can then choose to hyperlink to a file. It drives me nuts that this dialog is very different
 from the standard hyperlink dialog even though they do many of the same things.<br />
<br />
For the other pictures, they might have been inserted in a placeholder or something. If you can save the pictures and re-insert them as regular pictures, you should be able to set a hyperlink.<br />

</p><p>I scan an A4 Paper with an rule on it as centimeter. I scan full image without any scale or crop jobs. I print that A4 scan image again and i measure the rule on that paper and i realize that rule length is not correct anymore. 14 cm on print rule will be
 shorter than 14 cm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could do it very well when i embedded that image into PDF by Arobat Pro and i print it as A4 Paper size with option "Actual Size". I wonder that i could that jobs for Word, Image Print or any default Windows / Office software option?</p>

<h2>            Importing contacts</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I wonder if somebody can help me, I am trying to import the contacts from my Dads E65 to his 8600 Luna - the import seems to be working O.K for the landline number, however, my Dad has up to 3 numbers (landline, mobile, fax) saved to one contact and the import
 doesn't seem to want to send over all of the information despite all numbers being recognised on the back up file in the PC. I'm not too hot with these things so if someone with the know-how can give me some sort of step-by-step guide I'd be really grateful.<br />
<br />

    <title>Hebrew Lunar Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hebrew Lunar Calendar</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to create repeat calendar entry for Jewish Holidays. The date is according to the Hebrew Lunar Calendar which is different from the Gregorian calendar. It has less than 365 days per year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select frequency of 1 per year (Every 1 year), the date is entered and stored correctly. I verified it across multiple years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I set the frequency to 2 years or more (every 2 years), Outlook changes the date and saves the wrong date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any fix for this or any workaround?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eyal</p>

<p>Hi M.Knoppert,</p>
<p>The default language of a SharePoint site is defined when the site collection is created. For the users’ OneDrive for Business which is part of the user’s personal site (MySite), the default language is same to the MySite Host which depends on the language
 you selected when signing up your Office 365 tenant. This language setting can’t be changed afterwards.</p>
<p>Given the situation, we suggest you ask your users to change the language by themselves. Here is an article about two to change the language settings I’d like to share with you:

<h2>            Microsoft Office Professional Plus - BCM install - code 8007002</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>Hello microsoft support,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Please can you help me.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I have recently purchased a copy of office professional plus -[Removed for Security Purposes]- and have had some difficulties when installing the Business contact
 manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I downloaded and installed the office suite successfully and restarted the computer as instructed by the system. I then downloaded the BCM app and went through the
 installation procdedure. It installed sql server and then instructed me to restart the computer which I did. On restart, the system gave me the following error:-</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Script: C:\users\henry barnard\local\temp\BcmSetup.en-us\SpawnCmd.js</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Line: 9</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Char: 1</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Error: The system cannot find the file specified</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Code: 80070002</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Source: null</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Needless to say the BCM is not present in outlook although all other functionality seems to be ok as far as I can see.</span></span></p>
<p><span>I have tried re-sintalling from scratch but get the same error.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Please can you advise how I resolve this problem as the only reason I purchased office professional plus 2010 was for the BCM functionality. I now need this urgently
 for a current project I am working on.</span></span></p>

<h2>            In Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 Client HTML Contents get jumbled but the same email is formated fine in Outlookweb access and other non Outlook email clients</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We are sending HTML emails from our business application. While in most email clients Like Lotus Notes, iPhone etc format the email contents as they are expected to but in&nbsp; Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 Client , HTML Contents get jumbled.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the same email
 is formated fine in Outlookweb access .</p>
<p>Couple of our customers are complaining and we are not sure how to fix this issue. Is this realted to&nbsp;any Preview Pane settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also, clicked on the view source option in the reading pane and copied the contents to a notepad and saved it as a .HTM file with out doing a single change, and when i open the saved html in the broweser the contents are formatted fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since i am not allowed to attach anything here, i was am not able to attach the screen shots.
</p>
<p>Note in both the cases it is the same email .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>You can certainly include screen shots (see <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>The most common cause of the issue you describe is because something interferes with the proper reception of the message by Outlook, causing Outlook to be unable to render it. Add-ins like antivirus programs scanning incoming mail is a huge source of the
 problem. There's no need to scan incoming mail as long as the AV program has a real-time or on-access scanner. If you scan mail, disable that feature in the AV program and try again. Once the message has been received improperly by Outlook, it can't be repaired,
 so you'll have to try new messages for testing.</p>

            <p>Hi Guru,</p>
<p>Thanks for responding. below are my answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>What type of email account you have setup in outlook (POP, IMAP or an Exchange)?</div>
<div><strong>EXCHANGE</strong></div>
<div>What 'Business application' you are using to compose emails?</div>
<div><strong>SAP CRM</strong></div>
<div>Are you facing this issue with all Outlook 2007/ 2010 clients?</div>
<div><strong>BOTH.</strong></div>
<div>Did HTML emails show up fine in Outlook if they are not sent from the ‘Business application’?</div>
<div><strong>YES. I Receive HTML email from other sources and the contents are fine.</strong></div>
<div>If so, contact the 'Business application' vendor for help on this issue.</div>
<div><strong>I would have ideally done that. But the problem is this occurs in specific Domains only E.g</strong></div>
<div><strong>Some customers on @coca-cola.com or @piccadilly.com who use outlook 2010 do not face this problem . and in Outlook this email is rendered fine.</strong></div>
<div><strong>But for some e.g @hp.com and @comcast.net when they receive in Outlook 2010 the contents loose the like break/formatting.</strong></div>

            Just wanted to let you know that you are not the only one experiencing this issue. We are using an excel 2007&nbsp;file that generates an HTML formatted email in Microsoft outlook 2007 (where it appears correctly). The big thing is that i contains very inconsistent
 merging of cells (each row has different cell columns merged together).&nbsp;We hit send and the large distribution list recieves the email. The issue is very sporadic, but it is linked to iphones only (no android issues have been reported, but 90% of users have
 iphones... i have an android and have never had an issue). The iphone user can get it one day and it comes in jumbled the next day with no changing of the email formatting. There is no discrimination of iphone models or iphone operating systems or email iphone
 app... it seems to be random.

            When I submitted the question, the only issue I had was sending to any hotmail account. All other emails were working correctly. I was trying to send without using any login and password credentials. I don't know what has changed with our setup since then,
 but no external emails are working anymore. There isn't any use in persuing it as it's not a consistant enough for any future use. I appreciate your time.

<h2>            OneDrive for Business</h2>
                    
<p>I have 365 trial running, I go to OneDrive and click on sync, I get a window showing me which library to sync and is populated with my sharepoint details, I click on sync now and receive a alert saying this shouldn't take long. &nbsp;I get another window asking
 me to verify and to enter my email address which I do, another window pops up now asking for a password, this I enter, I then click on the big shiny blue sign in button which fades as I click and that is where I am after 4 hours of trying, in this time i have
 reset my password (which works when i browse to 365) I have uninstalled. I really need some help and answers, I am and have been using Google docs for my company for a while now and was looking to transfer across but now a little worried that a simple cloud
 storage app can cause so much problem. I have search the question as there is some discussions regarding credentials and unable to display the sign in window, this is not a problem for its getting past the sign in window. looked like a browser issue so tried
 them all and to no avail. Further information, if you cancel and try to sync again you get an error message saying " The server you are trying to access is using an authentication protocol not supported by this version" WOW!</p>

<p>PLEASE HELP</p>

<p>hi martin,</p>
<p>about the issue, i would like to confirm if you run into the issue after resetting the password for your account. if so, can you try the following steps to see if there is any improvement?</p>
<p>1. stop syncing your current onedrive for business libraries via right clicking on the onedrive for business icon and selecting<strong> stop syncing a folder</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=56b20f76-0921-4df8-8887-e3ca5642e62c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d56b20f76-0921-4df8-8887-e3ca5642e62c" /></a><br />
2. exit the onedrive for business sync client. <br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ff4aa0c7-a409-4b19-ac0d-0a16e7570436" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dff4aa0c7-a409-4b19-ac0d-0a16e7570436" /></a><br />
3. use the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">“fix it”</a> tool to clear the cache, then delete or rename the current “onedrive for business” folder.<br />
4. remove the<strong> windows credentials</strong> via<strong> control penal &gt; user accounts &gt;</strong> select the current account<strong> &gt; manage your credentials &gt; windows credentials &gt;</strong> remove all
<strong>microsoft credentials</strong>. <br />
5. go to your onedrive for business library in the browser and re-sync it. type your work or school account and correct password into the
<strong>sign in</strong> window to check the result.</p>
<p>if this is not your situation or the issue persists, to clarify the scenario, can you confirm the following details?</p>
<p>1. can you sync the onedrive for business library as normal before resetting password?
<br />
2. about” as i click and that is where i am after 4 hours of trying, in this time i have reset my password (which works when i browse to 365) i have uninstalled”, more details are appreciated so that we can try to reproduce the issue.<br />
3. can you share with us a screenshot about the error saying “the server you are trying to access is using an authentication protocol not supported by this version"?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>This is the first time I am trying to sync, if I go to the cloud icon on my desktop I have no other options showing like in your description just "sync a new library". I may have not made myself clear, when I click on the sign on button nothing happens or
 changes its like it has not registered me clicking, I get no response of acceptance or an an error at all really weird.</p>
<p>I have recorded the error but it is straight forward the sign in button just does not seem to respond</p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>We haven’t heard from you for a while. Are you still experiencing the issue?</p>
<p>If so, may I know if you are using Edge to open the library? Can you change another browser to check the result? In addition, concerning “when I click on the sign on button nothing happens or changes its like it has not registered me clicking”, please try
 using “Tab”+“Enter” via keyboard to proceed.</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, please post back at your convenience and we will continue to discuss the situation based on the update.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Shirley</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay. Yes it is working. I have to put it down to a PC issue I guess, what i discovered was on every action up until the sign in I have used my mouse and this worked even when I cancelled the process but for some reason the mouse did not work
 on the sign in button "Weird" if i pressed enter on the keyboard the process was completed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately since then I have started to move my domain across and mail (this is all good) but now I have my proper domain name login when I clicked on SYNC in Onedrive instead of an icon in windows explorer saying "onedrive for business" I get Sharepoint
 and a folder with my name, i then added a folder and files via the browser and tried to sync many times but I get nothing shown on my PC, I checked my windows phone onedrive app and the folder and files are there.</p>
<p>If i stop the sync and try again all I get is a repeat but saying my name with the digit 1</p>
<p>I have also repaired online as suggested in a previous post</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>hi martin,</p>
<p>thanks for your information.</p>
<p>from your description, i would like to confirm if you got an empty local folder where there is nothing to be synced to the original pc and don’t run into any error messages when clicking
<strong>sync</strong> on the onedrive for business portal. if so, it seems that the issue is caused by credentials. therefore, can you try the following steps to see if there is any improvement? (some of the steps you may have done before, please go through
 again)</p>
<p>1. reset ie to clear the cache data and cookies by referring to this link <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a>.<br />
2. delete the previous credentials via <strong>control panel &gt; credential manager &gt; windows credentials</strong> and remove the credential one by one.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0f4ca51e-a7d4-4021-ad00-ca2850d9221a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0f4ca51e-a7d4-4021-ad00-ca2850d9221a" /></a><br />
3. after that, right click onedrive for business app and choose "<strong>stop syncing a folder</strong>" to stop syncing the previous libraries, restart the onedrive for business app (right click app icon and choose "<strong>exit</strong>").<br />
4. then you can sync your new office 365 libraries via right click &gt; sync a new library and type in the library url you want to sync. you can also click<strong> sync</strong> on the portal and click
<strong>change</strong> to change a different local folder to sync the library.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=597906d8-8525-42dc-bdc1-3fb3c846e416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d597906d8-8525-42dc-bdc1-3fb3c846e416" /></a><br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a5979511-3320-4b6d-989c-e09ed90d18d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da5979511-3320-4b6d-989c-e09ed90d18d5" /></a></p>
<p>note: there is a login box will pop up and prompt you to input your office 365 account when resyncing the library. then use “tab” + ”enter” via keyboard to proceed.</p>
<p>if the issue persists, please post back with some details and we will&nbsp;continue to discuss the situation based on the update.</p>

<h2>            Reading mode in Bing news app - smooth scroll</h2>
                    request for smooth scroll. In the bing apps, the readers eyes need to start from the top left and make their way to the bottom right. I like to keep the text that I'm reading in the middle of the screen, scrolling content so that I can maintain this preference.
 The lack of smooth scrolling in Bing apps prevents this method of text consumption. This issue is exacerbated on wider screens.
