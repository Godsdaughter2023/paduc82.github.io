<p>Howdy CleighK,</p>
<p>The WM Start Menu is located in <strong>\Windows\Start menu\</strong></p>
<p>Then there is <strong>\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Games\</strong></p>
<p>Here 'normally' all games install... though not all programmers/developers <em>
<strong>R</strong> growing</em> 'Globe wide', from English speaking/writing Nations, worldwide. Therefore (as U know) it differs here and there 'somewhat'.</p>
<p>Now that's not <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">IT</span> ! <em>It</em><strong>R</strong> the *.lnk (shortcuts) which
<strong>R</strong> located in <strong>\Windows\Start menu\ </strong>.. Here reside only *.lnk files (short 4
<strong>L</strong> i<strong>NK</strong> ).<strong>I</strong> n <strong>O</strong> ther
<strong>W</strong> ords; there are no *.exeCUTABLES within this directory...</p>
<p>My advice; set Explorer to 'show all files', and move all your games their *.lnk files to the above mentioned directory and your kids 'll be happy campers ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Stuck in a restart loop</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;Good afternoon. I recently upgraded to windows 10 from windows 7. &nbsp;After installation was complete I tried to update my drivers as there was some issues with devices not working properly. When it said it was complete I did the restart it requested and
 now it is stuck into a restart loop. It wont even go to automatic recovery. It just cycles to the screen that says restarting for you. I get a code that says stop code. Page fault in nonpaged area. I have put the windows 10 onto a dvr but it isnt reconizong
 the disc from the start up. Even when i put the cd rom as primary boot device. The files are on the disc but it isnt reading them for whatever reason. Can you help me i really dont know what to do. I paid to upgrade to windows 10. And now it seems i may have
 spent the money for nothing as my computer is useless. I dont need any files on the computer i have all my docs and pics saved to a jump drive. I just want a fresh install of windows 10.&nbsp;

<p>Firstly, you should know that support for Windows XP is already ended and we might help you to temporary resolve this issue but because you no longer receive any new security update, your PC remains at risk and you should upgrade to supported version of
 Windows, take a look at:</p>

<p>Hello, you should read this thread and my answer below&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdapps-mdlumia600/windows-10-mobile-cant-reset-uninstall-or/922a42cf-3994-4c2e-9aa3-bd12d14832a0?auth=1&amp;rtAction=1505652904606&nbsp;First, please
 excuse my English, I'm French.<br />
So, if I understand correctly, every time I will change my SD card on my phone, I will either way not be able to reinstall my apps or loose all my settings with an hard reset. That's pathetic. My Lexar 169$ Sd card has failed for the second time and double
 punishment I got an hard reset to do in order to get back my apps !What the heck! Microsoft, that is really not productive. It is really a problem that you are not able to send a fix for this major bug. Especially considering that a lot of consumers are concerned
 with this problem, as you have probably noticed the numerous claims on the comments hub.</p>

</p><p>I can only give you my experience and that is I have had two SD cards go bad (Lexar and a Samsung) but have never had any difficulty with any SanDisk card so I stick with SanDisk now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also do not install any programs on an SD card as a general rule although I do install a couple on the SD card that are rarely used and do not require a lot of interaction between the device and the card. That is a personal choice and my device has plenty
 of memory so it is not an issue for me. Pretty much I just store movies, pictures and a huge collection of CDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of the two cards that went bad, I was able to replace one card , insert a new one and I was off and running. On the other card I did have to perform a hard reset. I just dealt with it and I was able to get up and running quickly. That said, even if an app
 is installed on an SD card, small parts of it have to be stored in main memory otherwise it would not know where to get the info to run the app. If a card goes bad it seems to me that even if you replace the card the program still thinks it is stored on the
 other card so you would need to uninstall. If it can't be removed then it just won't work and you would have to hard reset.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just my thoughts on how I think it works....</p>

<h2>            JAVA - Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>JAVA – Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very few users actually need to install JAVA.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There are only a few legitimate needs for it, generally speaking. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, why does almost everyone install this beast that poses such a security risk?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While not a MSE issue, I would like a discussion on this un-necessary piece of software.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It would help users understand that it IS A SECURITY RISK, it is rarely needed, and should be avoided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also carries with it un-needed toolbars (ASK) and anti-virus (McAfee) that are checked by default, and thus add more un-necessary software to the users PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen web sites report, incorrectly, that they need JAVA installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen some webinars – some require JAVA, some do not.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, let’s say that only a few video apps require JAVA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let the discussion begin,</strong> and see if we can reduce those 3 BILLION INSTALLS of JAVA by few, eh?</p>

            <p>Hi Selt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The add-ons can be avoided with a bit of care.&nbsp; Java isn't the only download that uses that trick (so does Adobe and Google and host of others).&nbsp; That's a separate issue that I belive we should exclude as it distracts from the main point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree if there's no reason to have it that there are quite a few reasons NOT to have it (uninstall it if installed or don't install it unless a legitimate reason comes up).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there are some situations where it can't be avoided:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In my case, my wife sometimes uses my computer to login to her heavy domain enterprise office system with all sorts of different needs from a variety of servers for different things (Lotus Notes, file sharing servers, DOD-level security (including stuff
 she can't even let me see)) and they absolutely mandate Java on computers remoting into the system.&nbsp; It's not a maybe it'll be OK without Java - the connection will simply either be impossible or will crash mid-session when a Java-related thing comes up.&nbsp;
 So I have absolutely no choice.&nbsp; Yes, it's only on her profile on the PC, but it's installed nonetheless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I'm 99.9999% sure but not positive as I dont use it myself, but I believe that people using the free&nbsp;OpenOffice (rather than MS Office or in addition to some parts of MS Office) need Java.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I'm not into HD Blue-Ray disks or videos (like from the Sony site), but I believe that either the devices or the software to use that functionality - or the ability to view that type of quality through a computer requires Java.&nbsp; I don't know why and
 and I don't know if there are ways around it (I don't do that myself), but I've read that there are situations where the full features cannot be utilized or accessed without Java.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Some websites do seem to need Java - but not as many as most people think.&nbsp; I suppose one could disable Java and visit all their important sites and see if they get errors or get blocked or have problems - then activate Java and see if the problem goes
 away.&nbsp; If so, then Java may truly be needed if those sites are truly needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Installing Java on one user profile only and switching to it when the need for Java comes up and closing that profile when the need is over might be helpful (though perhaps annoying depending on how often the need arises).&nbsp; While having it installed
 at all is partially problematic, if it's installed only for a specific profile that is not opened unless needed that should provide some level of resistance to java-based problems.&nbsp; It would be better not to need it, but if you do, I'd try to set it up this
 way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Browser settings can be set to higher Java security.&nbsp; Java can be disabled at startup and only enabled if/when needed.&nbsp; Again, not as good as not being installed, but it may help some if there's no other choice but to have it installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; If you must have Java, be sure that where it's installed is kept updated with the latest version and older versions are removed.&nbsp; I use Secunia PSI to help me keep me aware of update status but if you have it in a special profile, then you need to check
 it periodically to make sure you're current.&nbsp; I also recommend periodically clearing the Java cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those are just some initial thoughts.&nbsp; I may add more, but those were the ones that immediately came to mind.&nbsp; And keep in mind, if you use more than one browser that needs Java, keeping it updated and controlling things just&nbsp;becomes that much more difficult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>A&nbsp;more&nbsp;complete&nbsp;way of saying all of these things is that Java is a development environment, similar to the Windows Win32 or more specifically the&nbsp;.NET application development environments that can also be added to Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that over time, various&nbsp;applications such as the OpenOffice that Kosh mentioned and at one time various website applications like games, which often included simple video animations, were developed using Java.&nbsp; Since the original developer
 SUN had tried to increase its acceptance for use in business, they also pushed PC manufacturers like DELL and HP&nbsp;to pre-install it on their systems, likely by paying a small royalty for each installation though I'm not certain of that last part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What this meant was that an additional development environment that was nearly as complex as Windows itself and so inherently contains many bugs (vulnerabilities)&nbsp;became both common on PC based systems&nbsp;and somewhat regularly used on websites that wanted
 to provide simple games and occaissionally other applications for more important purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the rich development environment of Windows iteself also lends itself to similar problems of large numbers of vulnerabilities and in fact to some extent then this&nbsp;adds to and amplifies the potential for vulnerabilities for the combination
 of the two.&nbsp; So even if Windows itself doesn't have a specific vulnerability, the combination of the two might result in an otherwise relatively minor bug in Java creating a more dangerous vulnerability when installed on Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Java itself is a relatively portable environment, it can be developed to run on most other operating systems, so it often has, especially on those that are much less rich to start with than Windows.&nbsp; This portability makes cross platform development
 of software for different hardware somewhat easier, which is obviously an aid for those wanting to run their programs on as many systems as possible and has only increased its popularity.&nbsp; However, some bad blood in the history between Google and SUN may have
 lessened its compatibility on the Android platform to some extent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/the-real-history-of-java-and-android-as-told-by-google/3924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/the-real-history-of-java-and-android-as-told-by-google/3924</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though Kosh's points cover some of the possible specific cases to some extent, the true issue is far more complex and still mixed up in the situation that virtually no other development platform will run on almost all of the currently popular hardware platforms
 out there today, including Apple's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until either Oracle backs off it's push to keep the platform running on most major hardware (not likely) or another method of cross-platform development becomes available on at least most popular hardware, Java is likely to remain the choice of many who
 develop for different hardware and operating system platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question of whether many consumer users will continue to need Java, or in fact ever really did in the first place, is far more difficult to answer.&nbsp; Though it can be answered for a specific user at a point in time, there's no simple absolute rule that
 can be stated, some of which is brought to light in Kosh's comments above and very much of which isn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My own attitude though has been to remove Java from all of the home systems of friends and relatives I support for several years now, with re-installation of the most current version only if an application is discovered that is truly important to the owner
 of the PC.</p>

<p><br />
With&nbsp;your response you've noticed the most important point within my own.&nbsp; This is not only true for Java, but actually for all add-on software that you consider installing on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The core reason for this is exactly the same as with Java, because every application you install will inherently contain bugs and thus vulnerabilities that can eventually be disovered and then exploited by malware.&nbsp; The only sure way to keep this to a minimum
 is to not install the additional applications in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many PC owners believe that to get the most value from their systems they must install absolutely every free application they can find, creating a cluttered filing system full of uselesss software, most of which is never used or only very rarely at best.&nbsp;
 The actual truth is the exact reverse, since finding the fewest applications that will provide everything you really need will not only make the PC more useful, but also provide the most easily secured and managed (updates, upgrades, etc.) system in the long
 run.</p>
<p>Since many applications today are web based and only require a browser and possibly some on-the-fly browser add-ins to be installed, most consumers really only need a very few installed applications in addition to Windows itself.&nbsp; Running a system this way
 not only provides better and easier maintenance and security, it also costs far less in terms of hardware upgrades, since less disk space is wasted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically though, most operate their computer like their car or their home, filling it with lots of useless 'stuff' that simply clutters it and makes it look like a mess to others, rather than a clean streamlined device that provides the improvements in
 productivity and personal organization that were the original promise of these systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way this is finally being resolved to some extent is the move to the leaner and smaller specific purpose devices like smartphones and tablets, since these inherently don't have the space or to some extent even the ability to install things like additional
 browsers and other major applications.&nbsp; These systems are actually far more appropriate for consumers, since they don't require the same level of technical expertise to either operate or maintain that a general purpose PC does, and are also&nbsp;less expensive
 to own&nbsp;in most cases as a result.</p>
<p>This is really a better direction for most consumer and light business users, which we're already seeing is obvious to many of them due to the popularity they have had recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though this doesn't resolve the specific Java issue that started this thread, the parallel moves of these devices and even Windows itself towards the richer HTML5 and similar enhanced browser capabilities as well as&nbsp;animation and video standards will likely
 eventually remove the need for Java for these purposes.&nbsp; This will leave only the issue of cross-platform application support, which many development groups such as banks are resolving by producing their applications directly for the specific popular operating
 systems such as Android and the iPhone/iPad rather than Java.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            The recent Java exploit was reported in the Washington Post. &nbsp;Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, and the Department of Homeland Security advised people to disable Java. &nbsp;I wouldn't install Java but OpenOffice requires it and that's the hitch. &nbsp;I have OpenOffice
 3.4.1. on my PC and my mother has it on her netbook. &nbsp;We're not going to pay several hundred dollars each for Windows Office when OpenOffice does all the same for free. &nbsp;I can't locate Java, or Java Control Panel, on my PC as I'd like knowing if, and what
 version, I have. &nbsp;Also, my step mother has two revisions of Java 6 and the unpatched Java 7 on her laptop. &nbsp;My step mother asked me to uninstall Java for her, but she loves playing various games on Facebook and I fear she needs Java for that.
<div><br />
<div>I tried in vain to contact Oracle support about Java's vulnerabilities but they seem to require me to open a support ticket which makes me think I have to pay for it. &nbsp;Moreover, Oracle seems to contradict itself. It acknowledges the recent vulnerabilities
 of Java and advised to download the patch, keep Java up to date, and uninstall older versions,
<i>but </i>some applications need features from the older Java versions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Altogether, I'd love knowing:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>1). &nbsp;How can I determine if Java is on my Windows 8 Pro PC (can't find it in search under "Java" or "Java Control Panel")?</div>
<div>2). &nbsp;Does my step mother need Java to play Mahjong, Brick Breakers, and Slots on Facebook?</div>
<div>3). &nbsp;How can I setup Java to automatically update our computers?</div>
<div>4). &nbsp;Should I uninstall older versions of Java anyway? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

    <title>Bing Bar v 7.1.362.0 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave  r mm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bing Bar v 7.1.362.0</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried to download this add-on from the Bing website and was informed that my system was not compatible. Clearly this is not the case. I finally managed to download via another browser. I have now installed this but each time I start IE11 a warning
 re compatibility shows. Provided I click on 'use anyway' the add-on loads and seems to have full functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is IE11 not 'reporting' its correct version or, indeed, maybe the incorrect version of Windows?</p>

Yes it is. The problem seems to be with IE11 - I also cannot download file with this browser.

<h2>            Stop Windows Search Opening Using Word Online</h2>
                    <p>Recently (Jan 2018), Windows 10 search has started opening search results online rather than locally, i.e. a browser window opens rather than my local copy of Word 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I force search to use my local software, not the online (limited and slower) version of Word? I am a home user, not part of a company.</p>

<p>Hi Jamshed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for that link, however, when I search, I do get my local files showing, but when I click on a word document, instead of my local copy of Microsoft Word opening on my PC, the web online version of Word opens. This is not what I want -&nbsp; I want to
 use the full local copy of Microsoft Word (or any other Office application).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me to prevent Windows search opening Word Online by default, please? &nbsp;</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />On your PC, double-click the My Computer icon or click Start &gt; My Computer.
<br />On the Tools menu [or View menu], click Folder Options…
<br />You will need to repeat step 4 for each Microsoft Office document type [DOC,
<br />PPT, and XLS.]
<br />
<br />Click the File Types tab.
<br />In the Registered file types list, click the specific Office document type [e.g.,
<br />DOC for Microsoft Word documents, PPT for Microsoft PowerPoint
<br />presentations, XLS for Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.]
<br />Click the Advanced button.
<br />In the Edit File Type dialog box, uncheck the Browse in same window check
<br />box (or uncheck the Open Web documents in place check box).
<br />Click OK.
<br />Click OK.
<br />
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.

<p>Thanks - no, it doesn't help. The problem seems to be intermittent now. I think Microsoft have been quietly messing about with OneDrive, myself. Most searches now open correctly. I'll post again if things change - you've been very kind to try to help. Thank
 you again.</p>

    <title>Why does Outlook 2010 main screen &#34;stay on top&#63;&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nellivs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Outlook 2010 main screen &#34;stay on top&#63;&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>When I try to open an email in Outlook 2010, the message opens but is always "hiding" behind the main screen.&nbsp; It's like it has been coded to "always stay on top."&nbsp; The screen remains on top even if I try to reply or forward a message without opening an
 email, or if I want to switch from the main screen view to another program.&nbsp; It insists on staying on top; I have to minimize the screen so that I can see an email or another program.&nbsp; I am hoping that someone can help me fix this and make Outlook 2010 easier
 to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks much to anyone who can assist me!</p>

<p>Often, some add-in can have this side effect.&nbsp; Try starting Outlook once in safe mode (hold Ctrl when you start it) and see if the behavior changes.&nbsp; If so, start Outlook normally and visit the Add-in Manager (File tab&gt;Options&gt;Add-Ins&gt;Go) and disable the
 add-ins you see.&nbsp; Stop and restart Outlook again.&nbsp; Enable one add-in and test.&nbsp; If it still behaves normally, enable another add-in, stop and restart Outlook and retest.&nbsp; By following this approach you should be able to isolate the add-in causing the problem.</p>
<p>If you have no add-ins or this doesn't help, write back.</p>

            I have disabled all of the add-ins, and the problem still persists.<br />
<br />
I have seen information about checking the registry and the Load_behavior key, but I'd rather not mess with the registry unless there was a proven solution.<br />

            You can certainly examine the load behavior value without changing it.&nbsp; That isn't "messing" with the registry.&nbsp; If it's already what it should be, at least you'll know that's not the problem.

            I'm not sure what the load behavior should be though. Someone said if should be 3, someone else said it should be 2. I don't know what would be considered the correct value.<br />

            For me, I was having this problem after installing a Saleforce.com plug-in. &nbsp;I tried everything I could find on the Internet. &nbsp;None of the tricks seemed to work for long so I opened a case with Microsoft. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am also using the Google plugin to use gmail as the backend mail server. &nbsp;When starting Outlook, I always got a choice of which email profile to use. &nbsp;Microsoft support had me set the "gmail" profile as the primary profile so it would not ask and the
 "hiding window" problem went away. &nbsp;Not a real solution to the actual problem, but I just had to move along. &nbsp;Good Luck!</div>

            What plug-in do you think you need to use Google as the mail server?&nbsp; Outlook can access Google Mail via IMAP without any extras.

            I have found 2 different possible problems that have caused this.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>The first one, is corrupt PST files. After running SCANPST.EXE on some of the files, there were errors that got fixed, and the issue stopped.</li><li>We run a Shoretel Phone System, and they have a calendar integration feature. After uninstalling this, we noticed the issues when away as well.<br />

            Yeah, same here. Never had a problem until about a week after installing the Salesforce.com plug-in. &nbsp;Just started noticing it this afternoon. &nbsp;Have to minimize the Outlook main page every time I want to open a reply mail, forward, or even go to my internet
 browser.
<div><br />
<div>It is really aggravating - Outlook 2010 was working very smoothly until today.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Maybe Steve's workaround will help. &nbsp;At least it sounds familiar to my issue.</div>

<p>After you hit CTRL + End to find the last cell of data, you need to highlight all of the rows after 35,000 (where your actual data ends) up to and including&nbsp;the last row that CTRL +&nbsp;End finds for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do this by clicking and dragging the mouse on those row numbers, then right-click in the range and select delete.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd save the file after doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then hit CTRL + End again to find the last column of data. Repeat above, but this time do it for columns. Save again. After you do this, if you hit CTRL + End again, it should take you to the last cell in column 3 that has data (assuming 35,000 based on
 your initial comment)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will tell you that it worked. Now check what the file size is...</p>

<h2>            Calendar not showing in stand-by mode</h2>
                    I got a problem with my calendar planning not showing up in active standby-mode. It's disappeared completely. I have deactivated and re-activated the calendar in my settings to no avail. All other options in active standby is working (even the calendar's
 todo entries), it's just the calendar planning that won't show up. Has anyone alse had this problem? Have I accidently deactivated the option in some other way? Is there another way to get this back other than settings -&gt; programs in active stand by? Or perhaps
 the only way is to update the device software? (But somehow I don't think that'll help). Any help is greatly appreciated since I'm a bit lost without seeing my planning on the main screen. :(

            You don't say what phone you are reffering to but try backing up important data such as Contacts, Calendar messages etc an then perfoma a hard reset by following these simple steps.<br />
<br />
Turn the phone off<br />
Hold down the green phone, key number 3 and the * key all at once whilst getting someone else to turn the phone back on.<br />
<br />
Keep the keys in until the phone plays the startup sound, then restore your data and try again, if all else fails visit a Nokia service point. :)

            If it is a web address then Ctrl+Click should work. But that won’t work for internal document links.

            <p>Thanks Shyam, but ctrl+click doesn't&nbsp;work because it is a box link. Also doesn't&nbsp;help with&nbsp;mobile version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions to get this work. I was hoping MS would fix issues like this by now.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 starts update to build 14257, arrives in 95&#37; and reverts to build 11099 &#40;7 times already&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello community, could you guys help me? I am Windows Insider and I've tried to update my Windows 10 by 7 times and on every attempt it returned to build 11099 at 95%. I already googled several outputs, including alternating registry keys, but nothing resolves.
 I thought it'd be disk space, but I have about 150 GB free and still the problem persists. Upon system returns to the build 11099, it doesn't even reports an error code (such as 0x80240031).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really discouraged and starting to bother me with these recurring problems. Unfortunately I can't format this machine and do a clean install. Any solution that stands out from this problem?</p>
