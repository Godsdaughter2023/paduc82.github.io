<h2>            How to use Oki B2500 All-in-One Printer with Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    Original Title: Oki B2500 All-in-One Printer<br />
<br />
Has anybody found a work-around for the following issue?<br />
<br />
Because Windows 7 apparently hasn't got a Twin driver device, the multifunctionality of the Okidata B2500 MFP is compromised. To wit, the Companion Suite Pro II software won't work, meaning that the scanner is inoperable.
<br />
<br />
Please advise, if you've found a solution other than purchasing a new printer. <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Julie<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Did it ever work fine on your Windows 7 machine?<br />
2.&nbsp;Which Operating System were you using before?<br />
3.&nbsp;Are you getting any error while connecting/installing/using this printer to your computer?</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: &nbsp;</strong>Please<strong> </strong>refer to the article mentioned below:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> The printer manufacturer Okidata does not provide drivers for the printer model you have mentioned for Windows 7. That indicates this product is not compatible with Windows 7.&nbsp; However, you may download the drivers for Windows
 Vista and run it in compatibility mode. To do so, follow the steps provided below:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;Download the driver from the link mentioned below for Windows Vista Operating System:<br />

b)&nbsp;Right click on the setup file and select Properties.<br />
c)&nbsp;Select the compatibility tab.<br />
d)&nbsp;Put a check mark on "Run this program in compatibility mode for:‚Äù<br />
e)&nbsp;Select Windows Vista and click Apply and Okay. <br />
f)&nbsp;(If selecting Windows Vista does not work, try with Windows XP Service Pack3 mode)<br />
g) Doulbe click on the setup file to continue the installation.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In any option of safe mode, it does the same thing which is reboot and goes back to the menu for safe boot. Sometimes rather than reboot it just switches off. Ive tried with battery in or out. Its an Acer 5100. Ive tried all options on the menu and it does
 the same thing. Thanks.</p>

            Same thing happened to me.&nbsp; Now I cannot access my computer (A Dell with Windows XP) using any modes that are listed.&nbsp; Stops in the middle of the process and gives me the blue screen of death with a very similar coding (STOP: 0x000000BE (0x806E3800, 0x006E3121,
 0xBA4C3784, )x0000000B)).&nbsp; I was able to use one of my Dell diagnostic disks and ran a check on all the hardware (took about 20 hours) without any errors reported.<br />

 Mode, Safe Mode with Networking, etc.&nbsp; My computer is also a Dell (Dell XPS running Windows XP Professional).&nbsp; When I shut it down last night I didn't notice if any Windows updates were applied.

<h2>            Ethernet does not have a valid IP adress.</h2>
                    <p>A week ago I got a new computer and was connecting to my router without a problem. Today however, I tried to use a Ethernet cable because my internet was super slow. It kept saying that my connection was limited so I opened the control panel and did a troubleshooting
 search with my network. It said that the Ethernet does not have a valid IP address but it did not specify how to fix this problem. Please help! Thanks.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Emma,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could occur due to some incorrect network settings. If the connection is listed as limited, it means the PC has successfully connected to the router, but the PC wasn't assigned a valid IP address, so you can't actually get to the Internet.
 It can also indicate that a valid IP address was assigned but that the PC doesn't have Internet connectivity. I would suggest you to try these steps and check if they help:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, restart the router by completely powering it down and then switching it on again. Now check if the issue persists. If yes try the next step.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Windows network diagnostics troubleshooter can automatically detect and fix most of the incorrect settings. Right click on the network icon in the task bar and select ‚ÄòTroubleshoot problems‚Äô and run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to try these steps and check.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key +X, select ‚ÄòCommand prompt (Admin)‚Äô.</span></li><li><span>Type the following commands and press Enter after each command:</span></li></ol>
<p><span>ipconfig /flushdns</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>ipconfig /registerdns</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>ipconfig /release</span></p>

<p>Hi Grant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for keeping us updated with the reply. May I ask if you are getting the message concerning the servers about the Xbox Live Servers or the servers for Apex Legends themselves? If it is for the Apex Legends servers directly, then you'll want to
<a href="https://help.ea.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">get into contact with EA</a> about what may be happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Live Server Status</a>, everything on our end seems to be up and running at this time. For further troubleshooting, you'll want to give our wizard for the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 One Network Connection Error Solution</a> a try if you get any messages when you ran the network test. Of if you're on a wifi connection, you may wish to try an Ethernet cord (wired) connection to decrease any lag or drop-outs. If you wish to remain off the
 wired connection, then&nbsp;<span><span>I recommend

            Hello,<br />
Call of Duty often requires open NAT type and UPnP, check if you have those.<br />
Evolve, infortunately, has a very low population, so it might be the reason for difficulties in matchmaking.<br />
Apex might have similar requirements as CoD, plus it's a pretty fresh game, so servers might not function right, or matchmaking isn't perfected. Happens with many f2p games, especially under EA

<h2>            Looking for the best free video downloader for Vista</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I am on Vista and Firefox.<br />
<br />
I am not that good on computers but I've watched many videos on the internet and wished that I could save some of them.
<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a good experience to share?&nbsp; I would like to have the best free video downloader that can download from all sites including YouTube. It should also be easy to download and use.<br />
<br />
I was told that Firefox has an add-on that'll do it. True?&nbsp; How?<br />
<br />
I need good advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

==========================================<br />
It's hard to say what the 'best' is but maybe the following <br />
info would be useful:<br />
<br />
1) Some sites are set up for you to download the video<br />
files and you just right click the thumbnail and choose...<br />
Save Target As...you can try this on Steve's Digicam site:<br />
<br />
Scroll down to the last thumb and you can download the<br />
sample .avi file...right click / save target as...or ...save link as...<br />
<a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/camera-reviews/canon/powershot-a1100-is/canon-powershot-a1100-is-review-7.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.steves-digicams.com/camera-reviews/canon/powershot-a1100-is/canon-powershot-a1100-is-review-7.html</a><br />
<br />
2) On some sites...the video is cached in your Temporary<br />
Internet Files folder as you watch it online...in this case<br />
you can simply copy the video file from your TIF folder<br />
and paste it in a folder of your choice.<br />
<br />
How to find your TIF ( Temporary Internet Files ) folder.<br />
<br />
Open a folder and go to...Tools / Folder Options / View tab.<br />
<br />
Tick..."Show Hidden Files and Folders" / Apply / OK.<br />
<br />
Now...you'll find you TIF folder at the following location:<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\Your User Name\Local<br />
Settings\Temporary Internet Files<br />
<br />
Look for the files with the video extensions...flv, .mpg, .wmv...<br />
<br />
3) If you download and install the Mozilla Firefox Browser<br />
and the Downloadhelper add-on you will be able to<br />
download video from many sites.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Mozilla Firefox<br />
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/#desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/#desktop</a><br />

<br />
Once installed...launch Firefox and go to a site with video /<br />
start the video / go to...Tools / Downloadhelper / Media /<br />
Select the media file / Download...<br />
<br />

<br />
4) The following freeware video downloader can be useful:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Freemake Video Downloader<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_video_downloader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_video_downloader/</a><br />

I do know of people who download and watch YouTube for as long as they like.<br />
<br />
I am also aware of people who download entire movies and watch them happily later.<br />
<br />
Both above are on Windows computers and their computers run fine. <br />
<br />
Everyone downloads free antivirus, anti-spyware, cleanup and diagnostic programs and other useful applications from various sources and continue to use them happily.&nbsp; I do too.&nbsp; &nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So why should video downloaders be any different when YouTube downloaders show no problems?<br />
<br />
My reason for asking is because there are so many out there and I need advise which one is the best and most appropriate.<br />

Hi Volunteer J<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your prompt response and your abundant resources offered. <br />
<br />
Me being a simple user and not wanting anything complex, I would appreciate a bit more advise from you:<br />
<br />
I think it would easiest to have the firefox add-on since I am quite familiar with firefox. Would you agree?<br />
<br />
From what I've tried some time before, during the saving process the program asks what file format would I like it to be saved to, or is it the media file? That gets me stumped. From a simple usage point which file format(or Media File) should I choose?&nbsp; There's
 one AV1 I think that is the most simple and straightforward. Would you agree? As I don't want complexities but just a simple system.<br />
<br />
Will the firefox addon download YouTube and others? Are there certain ones that I would not be able to download?<br />
<br />
I like Freemake also. Can I download that too in case firefox addon does not download certain videos so I can use Freemake?&nbsp; There are certain stock market tutorials I would like to download and save and some webinars from internet mearketers.<br />
<br />
Hope I didn't bother you with too much.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            Q: I think it would easiest to have the firefox add-on since I am quite <br />
familiar with firefox. Would you agree?<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
A:&nbsp; <span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I use the Firefox
</span></span>Video DownloadHelper and find that it works well.<br />
Maybe you could give it a try and see if it works to your satisfaction.<br />
<br />
I use Freemake Video Downloader also and usually find it to be the <br />
easiest to use. <br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
Q: From what I've tried some time before, during the saving process <br />
the program asks what file format would I like it to be saved to, or is <br />
it the media file? That gets me stumped. From a simple usage point <br />
which file format(or Media File) should I choose?&nbsp; There's one AV1 I <br />
think that is the most simple and straightforward. Would you agree? <br />
As I don't want complexities but just a simple system.<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
A: Some sites offer more options than others. I usually choose the <br />
highest resolution .FLV or .MP4.<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
Q: Will the firefox addon download YouTube and others? <br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
A: Yes.<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
Q: Are there certain ones that I would not be able to download?<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
A: I suspect you can download all YouTube clips but yes...you <br />
will find some sites that are hard to download from.<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
Q: I like Freemake also. Can I download that too in case firefox <br />
addon does not download certain videos so I can use Freemake?&nbsp; <br />
There are certain stock market tutorials I would like to download <br />
and save and some webinars from internet marketers.<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
A: As I previously stated...I use both and find them to be useful...<br />
and there are some video clips that they will not work on.<br />
<br />
The simple solution here would be to try everything that is available <br />
to you and decide for yourself what works for you.<br />

    <title>Games from MS Store not going actual fullscreen, causeing multiple - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertfaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games from MS Store not going actual fullscreen, causeing multiple problems.</h2>
                    <p>So, I originally posted about this over&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/games_windows_10/xbox-controller-not-working-properly-with-ori-and/e4780b75-ce3f-4aa5-b389-79a8ef372f33?tm=1561679322322&amp;auth=1">HERE</a>
 when I&nbsp; thought it was just a controller problem with one game, after testing a few others I have worked out that it's a problem with the Windows Store games. Despite being toggled to "Fullscreen" in the video options, they act like they're in borderless windowed
 mode and when using a controller, specifically in my case a "Wired Xbox 360 controller for Windows" it's trying to play the game
<em>and</em> control windows itself at the same time, so any button associated with control of windows, ie, right stick for the mouse pointer, left stick for scrolling, etc, has a sort of dual effect so that whatever other button would be assiciated with the
 windows function as well as the corresponding button of the game get pressed at the same time. In the case of Ori and the Blind Forest, it causes multiple abilities to be used at once, and in the case of a game like Hellblade, or We Happy Few, where the right
 stick is used for looking around it causes the mouse pointer to leave the game area and thus, when a button is then pressed causes the game to minimise. I have tested multiple Windows Store games and this happens to
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ALL</span></em> of them so far tested, where as using the same controller testing games from Steam, Epic, Uplay and Origin this does
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>NOT</em></span> happen in any of their games, meaning it's clearly a problem with installations from the Windows Store. Presumably because it associates everything as an "App" instead of as an exe programme, like
 all other games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this issue as I'd like to be able to play the games from windows store as I tried out MS's new "Xbox Games Pass for Windows", and there are a few games I'd absolutely love to play more of, but as it stands they're either unplayable,
 or difficult to get around in, due to this issue. And while I have cancelled any further payments for the sub, I'd really like to keep it so I can play these games to their completion.</p>

            Hi Robert
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Check if it happens in the Xbox beta app.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-beta/9nblggh1j27h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-beta/9nb...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.‚Äù 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

            Well, this is likely a bug, another customer has been reporting something similar. 
<br />
<br />file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.

<br />
<br />My recommendation is you either wait for an update to fix it or downgrade back to Windows 10 1809.
<br />
<br />download Windows 10 1809 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1809 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)

<p>I suffer the same problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit frustrating and amateurish. I'll bet the main culprit is the way all the games are launched in the Xbox Windows app overlay. I hope they fix it soon because as now, my GamePass is barely worth it and when the subscription price arises surely it will
 not be worth if all these problems continue.</p>

<h2>            Error&#58; &#34;This app cannot run on this version of Windows&#34; while connecting to internet on Dell Vostro 3500 computer running Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I successfully upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 on my Dell Vostro 3500 computer, but when I tried to do the same on my Dell Vostro 3700 running the very same operating system, I ran into trouble.<br />
<br />
On the Vostro 3700 everything in Windows 10 seems to be okay, except I cannot connect to the Internet. To make Windows 7 run properly after a complete system wipe and reinstall, I had to install two network drivers which I obtained from the Dell site. They
 work in Windows 7, but one will not install in Windows 10.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the Vostro 3500 can run Windows 10, it seems that the Vostro 3700 should be able to, also.<br />
<br />
If I cannot fix this, I will have to revert to Windows 7. But I have already cleaned my disk, so I might need to do a complete reinstall of Windows 7 from the manufacturer‚Äôs CD. That will be three days completely lost to the ineptitude of Microsoft and its
 inability to make its products work properly.<br />
<br />
Dell Vostro 3700 uses Broadcom DW1520 Wireless-N Half-Mini Card network adaptor</p>

            <p>Thank you for your advice.<br />
<br />
I have used the Windows Network Diagnostics tool, and it responds with the message:<br />
‚ÄúThere might be problem with the driver for the Wireless Network Connection adapter.‚Äù<br />
<br />
So I went to the Dell support site to find the current drivers, which are for Windows 7 64 bit. I removed the previous drivers using the method you outline, and I tried to install the new drivers, and one does install, but the other does not. I tried to install
 it in compatibility mode for Windows 8, Windows 7 and Windows Vista. All attempts to install result in the error messages: ‚ÄúThis app cannot run on this version of Windows.‚Äù or ‚ÄúBluetooth broadband software does not work on this version of Windows.‚Äù</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have no Internet connection on that computer.</p>

            <p>I have spent hour upon hour exploring every option I can find, and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I bought an external network adapter that is advertised as compatible with Windows 10. I installed the manufacture's driver from their mini-CD. But the adaptor does not work, and Windows 10 diagnostics comes up with the very same result as for the built-in
 network adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will have to go back to Windows 7.</p>

            <p>I have purchased an external USB wifi dongle. I have downloaded the latest driver from the manufacturer, which specifies Windows 10 compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the dongle does not connect to the interest, and all operations and investigations produce exactly the same outcomes as when I try to connect with the built-in wifi adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled the built-in wifi adapter, to make sure that I am using the dongle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that the problem must be due to Windows and not to the dongle which is functioning, and which has an up-to-date driver that specifies Windows 10 compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice on the message boards that MANY people are having wifi connection problems after updating to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wouldn't be quite so bad if Microsoft hadn't pretty much rammed Windows 10 down our throats.</p>

<h2>            System Recovery keeps failing &#40;5th time trying&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there, I decided to restore my laptop because it had a lot of junk on it, and there were also some errors while I tried to download certain software like iTunes or installing my printer. I can't restore my laptop, though. My laptop is a Vista x64 bit
 Toshiba Satellite L300 Series and every time I insert my recovery disc into my laptop and hold the C button, a screen pops up saying which option I would like to choose after. I chose the "Restore to out of box" option, and it's not working. It makes me wait
 40 minutes, and then gives me an error: Error 10-FA12-045D. So I tried again and this time, I clicked erase hard drive. This too did not work, and it told me it was done recovering. Then, it tells me to click "OK" to restart the computer. I click OK, and then
 it loads to a page that says Start Windows in safe mode, de-bug mode, etc. I click safe mode, it loads after 15 minutes, and then there is a message that tells me Windows cannot install something on Safe mode. So I restart the laptop again, wait another 15
 minutes, and then run my laptop normally. Now Windows is downloading some "sysprep" device, but then it fails to download and gives me an error. Here is the error:</p>
<p>"C:\Windows\SysWOW64\sysprep\WBDEN44I.DLL is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for your support."</p>
<p>How do I fix this? Please, Microsoft, I don't know who else to turn to...</p>

<p><span><br />
<span>As you are not able to recover using the recover disk as well, it is better to get in touch with the system manufacturer for further assistance.<br />
This looks like a hardware problem.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open Windows Store, how can I reinstall it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've had this problem for several months now and wanted to try fixing it again. &nbsp;I've tried wsreset, the powershell commands.. Neither really work successfully. There were always a handful of apps that continued working after this problem started and now
 after trying the powershell commands again I was able to restore access to several others somehow. The ones that don't work either don't open at all or open and instantly close.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The store itself is the key here imo.. If I can reinstall that I could reinstall the other apps. I don't think it's actually installed on my computer currently. Doesn't come up anywhere when searching for it, can't launch it from microsoft's site when trying
 to download apps. Sometimes I'll get this "you'll need a new app to open ms-windows-store" message, and that's it.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Under C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Local\Packages\
 there is no Windows store folder there, just a bunch of folders for the other apps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to reinstall Windows or even "refresh" just to get the store to function properly.. There's gotta be some way to make this work. I'm on Win 10 Pro, all up to date.<br />
</p>

            The best place to get drivers is from the manufacturers website:<br />
<a href="http://support.creative.com/welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.creative.com/welcome.aspx</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>Download Drivers
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Go to the website of the manufacturer and select your model (this is usually done in the Support section). You should have the option to download drivers for your model. Download
 the driver(s) and follow the instructions to install - every computer is different so I can't give you exact directions. You can also try using Windows Update to get drivers - it's located in the start menu.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If they don't have windows 7 drivers, download the newest ones and try compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot Compatibility</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next windows click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.
</span></p>
<p>

<br />Where exactly are you seeing this error, is it on a popup dialog or on a blue screen?
<br />
<br />Does this happen when Windows starts up or does it happen when you are doing something in Windows?

</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most programs designed for the 32-bit version of Windows will work on the 64-bit version of Windows.</p>
<p>However, we are unaware if the program you are referring to is an exception. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer to the software manufacturer's website/forums to check if the program is designed&nbsp;to work with&nbsp;64-bit version of Windows or not.</p>

<h2>            33&#37; Off Xbox Live Gold And 2 Free Games - Dashboard Deal</h2>
                    
<p>Purchased Jan 06, 2011</p>
<p>Dashboard only deal - 33% off xbox live gold 1 year membership and 2 free unspecified games.</p>
<p>Thiss purchase was made during the pperiod that Microsoft was having payment service issues, if that matters or makes a difference.</p>
<p>I forget the free games that were supposed to come with it i don't know i they were specified, it said 2 free gifts and specified XBLA games as the gifts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The email address associated with the account is valid. As i had to return one of my consoles for warranty and the emails for that process came iin fine.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've already checked my spam and do not see&nbsp; any emails. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Help playing system link co-op on Halo Anniversary. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Help playing system link co-op on Halo Anniversary.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there, I know you might not be able to help as this may be an issue with the game rather than anything to do with my xbox but I can't find an answer anywhere online and I can't find an appropriate place to ask the developers either.</p>

<p>Anyway, firstly I need to know if its possible to play the Halo: combat evolved anniversary campaign co-operatively between 2 xbox 360's? And, of course with 2 copies of the game. I'm well aware that you could do this with all previous Halo's, as I've done
 it may times with no trouble but for some reason I can't manage it with Halo Anniversary. I do all the same steps as I have done with Halo reach for example- I connect 2 xbox 360's with an ethernet cable, use 2 game discs, then on each console go into campaign
 mode, press Y to select network, choose system link games and nothing shows up on either party list ie I cannot detect the other console to join to.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong or is it just not possible to play co-op on system link for some reason. All other options are the same on both consoles, mission, difficulty etc and when we swap out both discs for Halo Reach the consoles are immediately joinable
 when following the same process.</p>

<p>Any help would really be appreciated as I want to re-live some of my glory days of Halo 1!!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Yes it is possible to play between two consoles. I'm curious as to what kind of Ethernet cable you've chosen - depending on it's age, it may not be the right "type." Can you try a different cable perhaps? :)

<p>Its just the standard grey ethernet/system link cable that comes with the xBox. Its a bit battered but works for everything else including, as I said, Halo Reach. It detects other consoles just fine on that game. I'm sure also that we have all the newest
 updates</p>

    <title>explorer.exe causing 100&#37; ssd disk usage for &#126;2 minutes after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pstojnic  say:</h3>
<h2>            explorer.exe causing 100&#37; ssd disk usage for &#126;2 minutes after booting</h2>
                    <p>I'm running i7-4770/8GB ram/samsung evo 850 (with over 180GB free)<br />
<br />
The problem is when booting all processes would start and explorer.exe would keep the ssd usage I/O at 100% even though nothing is happening.<br />
<br />
Things I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>performing a clean boot</li><li>running system maintenance and optimize drives<br />
</li><li>running windows update manually</li><li>disabling windows update (is on now)</li><li>sfc and chkdsk<br />
</li><li>running safe mode (happens even in safe mode)<br />
</li><li>disabling certain services like BITS, windows search, prefetch/superfetch<br />
</li><li>scanning the system with nod32, malwarebytes and hitman pro<br />
</li><li>disabling and deleting the antivirus all together<br />
</li><li>disabling pagefile and hibernation<br />
</li><li>deleting graphics drivers and reinstalling them</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Now I've installed Windows ADK and I recorded the usage while restarting the explorer.exe. It uses 100% disk activity for around 40 seconds. This is what it looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ccff8d1-cb38-4b7c-b2e8-4cbad854470b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm certain that this wasn't happening earlier and it can't be normal. I don't have experience with Windows Performance tools, could someone take a look at this and help me debug this issue?</p>

<h2>            I have done nothing wrong and am about to loose hundreds of dollars due to fraud investigation&#33; Someone please help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, i am hoping this gets to someone's eyes that can be truly of help. I have called customer support countless times, and no one seems to be of help, i even spoke to supervisors and TWICE they have hung up on me both times. On May 19th i was victim of
 fraud, there were three very big purchases on my xbox gamertag halopower67 and so i called for help immediately after i received email from the bank about these purchases. &nbsp;It all went well that day and i was advised to change my login information and that
 my account would be locked while a fraud investigation went on. I was told to wait 15 days. I call back 15 days and nothing has happened, the investigation still went on and was told to wait another 15 days. I called back, and still nothing has happened and
 was told to wait a month. I waited a month and called and STILL NOTHING has happened. So i call the bank and tell them that nothing is being done on Xbox's part so they start investigating. A couple of days pass and all of the sudden Xbox calls me to say that
 the investigation has come to a close because the name of the fraud claimer (me when i called May 19th) is not the same as the name on the account (halopower67). So i give my family members name because i have purchased xbox live once with their card so i
 thought maybe that could be the problem. But no, i called today and was told that on Wednesday July 27th i am going to receive a call to tell me that the investigation is closed because of the name discrepancy. So now, not only will i not be refunded my money
 which was STOLEN from me when these purchases were fraudulently made on May 19th, I will also be unable to play ever again on my halopower67 gamertag&nbsp;because it will be locked forever due to this name discrepancy! I have spend hundreds of dollars on this account,
 have never done anything wrong, been a member of Xbox live for a bit more than 6 years! and I am getting this from Microsoft. HOW ON EARTH has no one EVER noticed this name discrepancy that Xbox investigation team tells me about 2 MONTHS into the investigation?
 And how is it possible that they have been accepting my money knowing that something is wrong for 6 years!? And most importantly, all this name discrepancy business is all wrong! I have had my name the same ever since i signed up for Xbox live 6 years ago.
 I feel i am being cheated by Microsoft on this and will not stand for it, i was told that sometimes the investigation team looks at these forums so PLEASE someone help me with this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have been very cooperative with Xbox support these past couple of month but the conclusion to this matter that they have come up with is completely unacceptable. I am being robbed money for things i DID NOT purchase, and am being robbed an account with Xbox
 Live that has a ton of games purchased on Xbox Live Arcade, Indie games, DLC, etc.. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If someone that has the ability to help me here could contact me, i would greatly appreciate it, I just want this Xbox account nightmare to end on the note it should end. And not be cheated for so much money and time spent these past 6 years. Please.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well two things first and foremost noone can help you here as billing issues is only handled by billing support over the phone. You must work with the investigations team.
</p>
<p>Secondly if no unauthorized access of the account occurred then the question is did it happen on your pc or your xbox it requires the account to be not within your control</p>
<p>If the purchases were made by a child or a guest at your house then it's not a case of fraud but a case of lack of user security as you are responsible for all actions of your account at all times that's like lending your car to your bestfriend and he makes
 1000dollars in parking tickets do you think you are not responsible? Not according to the tickets or the courts or the police after they impound your car. You can sue your friend but that's on you .</p>

<p>Ok so to answer whether the purchase was made on my Xbox.. it was not. I was just waking up that day when i saw the emails, the Xbox is always in my room so it wasn't some family member or some kid on my Xbox since i was with my Xbox while i received those
 emails. It was someone that got a hold of my account somewhere else. &nbsp;There was fraud definitely committed on my card. Now as to the first thing you said, the main reason i came here is because i have tried countless times (i have about 10 service request
 numbers) contacting support over the phone, they have been completely unhelpful. And finally, It's impossible to work with the investigations team because there is no number that i could call to contact them. Xbox support does not provide that number either,
 they just tel me that the only people i can talk to is Xbox customer support ad that they work with the investigations team. So im kind of in a situation where i am unable to do anything but just let all the money i spent on this account go to waste unless
 someone could help me. </p>

<p>sharing a pc or using it on a family pc doesn't mean that noone loged into the account on that pc and not made purchases as it would still goto your console as a result and it would be associated with your console</p>
<p>no there is no direct communication between you and the investigations team that is what frontline support is for</p>
<p>they pass on the notes from the team and pass on notes to the team</p>
<p>if someone logs into your computer and makes the purchases then its not unauthorized access but user security</p>
<p>just like the parking example</p>
<p>so unless a comprimised account case is proven the account would've been in your control

<p>I get what you are saying, but the problem is that I was not stupid enough to give my account password and credentials to another person. The ONLY person that knew how to log in on my account was me. And on top of that I make sure that every time I purchase
 something it's on my personal computer that no one has acces to either so no, I was not careless with my account information. I have no idea how those purchases were made on that day and I had full faith that the investigation team would get to the bottom
 of it and see that I was a victim of fraud. But what seems to have happened is that they are using some lousy excuse to not refund my money and leave me with this mess. If a case like mine does not fit to be fraud then I don't know what would, because a simple
 look at it shows that it is obviously fraud. I did not authorize the purchase, did not give account info to anyone EVER, and was not careless about where I leave my information. Again, I was obviously wronged, even some support representatives acknowledged
 that, but since they "can't do anything further on the matter" then I'm stuck with this myself.</p>

<p>Posting on the forums was the last suggestion a customer rep had for me. She saw what was the status of my situation and I told her everything that had happened and she completely agreed that it is unfair for Xbox to jut drop my case like this. She said
 that sometimes the investigation team looks over the forums and so here I am.</p>

<p>if the investigations team found no unauthorized access then it would've been done by your local pc or xbox</p>
<p>not knowing your password doesn't have to be the case as PCs do save passwords or if you leave your pc loged into your windows live id</p>
<p>so if you leave your pc on infront of your family or friends and they hop on and make purchases then it still is your responcibility with either you loged into xbox.com or live.com website or on your console</p>

<p>I don't know how to explain this further, the only purchases for xbox I make is on my personal computer, which is in my room, which the only person that could POSSIBLY have acces to is my mother, who doesn't even know how to browse the web and would be completely
 impossible to go buy something on xbox.com (aside from the fact that I was with my computer when these purchases were made). On top of that my computer is password protected so no, no one had acces to my computer or xbox (which also has a sign in code and
 I was sleeping RIGHT NEXT TO IT while these purchases were made. </p>
<p>Also, I feel I need to state this, the investigation team never said there was no fraud done. They just said that they have to stop the investigation due to some name discrepancy. Which infuriates me and most importantly hurts me financially for no reason.</p>

<p>if you read the terms of use you are responcible for your own account regardless if it was a friend or family member accessing your account and making the purchases as you gave them permission to access the account</p>
<p>if you weren't in control of your account which usually the other user would change your password then you can claim unauthorized access for fraudelant purchases</p>
<p>but as stated before the account would only be returned to the true owner</p>
