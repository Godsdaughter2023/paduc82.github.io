            <p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both the device you have and the device you want to display to need to support Miracast.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Miracast is built atop the Wi-Fi Direct standard, which lets devices directly communicate with each other, no outside network necessary.
</p>
<p>Some helpful links:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15053/windows-8-project-wireless-screen-miracast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Project to a Wireless Display with Miracast</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/accessories/wireless-display-adapter-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter</a></strong></li></ul>
<p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

 how to get the "connect to a wireless display" option back? thanks for the reply

            <p>I'm not sure I understand. my monitor wouldn't be used once I project to a wireless display. the smart TV would replace the monitor.

            <p>From the pictures you provided with your original post, I saw that you've already added your smart TV to your Devices. Since you wanted it to replace your monitor, try customizing your display settings to
<strong>Show only on 2</strong>:</p>

            <p><span>You can solve many problems by installing the latest drivers for your PC and the latest firmware for your wireless display or Miracast adapter. To update firmware on your wireless display or adapter, go to the Support section of the manufacturer's
 website, search on your specific device, and follow their instructions to download and install that firmware.

            <p>I have same issue. From all the searches across few days, I shall to an extent confirm that NVIDIA graphic card driver not supporting miracast especially with windows 10. If your pc have integrated graphic card like in my case HD 530, you will see the option
 "Connect to wireless display"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though some mention maxwell geforce cards support but many complained NO (GTX 970, GTX 1XXX series)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Either MS or Nvidia should handle this issue!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>anyone know how to keep Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3185614) from downloading. It takes a lot of time to download and slows the system down. I've given up on the suggested fix since that doesn't work either. it has failed to install
 over 10 times. mean while, other updates seem to work fine.</p>

            <p>Stephen, it is better to ask a separate question for your issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest update to Windows 10 is V1607 and you are on v1511.</p>
<p>Is there any update named Feature update to Windows 10, v1607 in Windows update list?</p>

            <p>V1511 update blessed me with a bug which caused my pc to go from a 20-30 sec restart/boot-up to a 5-20 minute boot-up. &nbsp;I stopped restarting my pc after that update.. in fact I was leaving my computers run for 3-4 days afterward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The precious Ver. 1607 update *spits* that they forced me to accept turned my main pc into a paperweight, and my secondary into a slow boat to China. &nbsp;My only pc that merely maintains the forever start-up.. 100% disk drive usage bug was the one running AMD
 cpu and gfx card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF the update has not already downloaded to your pc, then you can stop it yes. If it has and you are looking at the same choices I had &nbsp; UPDATE and Shut Down or Update and Restart as your only choices. then you are snookered. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If u try the install and it fails, you might be able to jump back in and try this to see if it works..&nbsp;</p>
<p>go to</p>
<p>Control Panel</p>
<p>Services</p>
<p>scroll down to windows update and then double click it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should see a pop up window, and 3/4 down the window is a drop down. Prolly shows Automatic atm.. change it to Disable... Manual is useless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI.. no matter what your settings are.. You are forced to take the security updates..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Side Note: Many people (confused people) will tell you that the above fix/work around is dangerous to the health of your computer. &nbsp;Since 1/3 of the people that have updated are having pc breaking issues, I have am gonna agree to disagree with them. &nbsp;You
 will, however, want to watch for major updates and when they have stopped breaking computers with them, turn your setting in services to manual and get at least semi current with updates then,..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this message sticks around long enough for you to see it.. and hope that you don't catch any flame over it.. if so just lie to them and tell them that Fish dude was nuts.. flame him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck mate.. hope this tiny bit helps you some at least.&nbsp;</p>

Under Windows 7 there are exactly two types of accounts: ordinary and admin. What makes you think that your admin account is "limited"? How do you know it is an admin account?

            You can change what privileges which users have even if they are an admin. You can make settings that do not allow password change of your super admin account.&nbsp;One way to do this is to right click the hard drive where your windows software is and to go
 properties, and security. There you can change which users can do what.&nbsp;The problem is, by forgetting the super admin password, I have no idea how to get back to that account from the limited account I made by changing the limited account's settings.

            When you first loaded Windows then you were prompted for the name of an account and password. This account was automatically given admin status. This is the one you should now use when carrying out admin tasks. Did you perhaps demote it? When?
<div><br />
<div>If you forgot the password to this account then you can use one of the many of options built into Windows to help you get out of your predicament:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Reboot the machine with your Windows Repair CD, then use System Restore to set Windows back by a few days (works only if you changed the password recently).</li><li>Log on under your spare admin account, then reset the password to your usual account (works only if you set up a spare admin account).</li><li>Insert your USB flash disk with the password keyfile (works only if you took the time to create such a keyfile).</li><li>Use the password hint (works only if you created a hint and if it is good enough to let you guess the password)</li><li>Check your paper records (works only if you jotted down the password somewhere)</li></ul>

            I mentioned previously that the admin account I am using right now has limited access to this computer, and I did not set up a backup or a hint. I changed this account's access though right-clicking the hard drive, properties, security. You can modify
 a user's permissions there, so I made this account not able to write and modify and it has no special permissions.

Changing folder permissions has nothing to do with forgotten passwords. Since there is no much confusion in this thread I feel that you need to clarify your question like so:
<div>
<ol>
<li>Go to the screen that causes you a problem.</li><li>Make sure the error message is visible.</li><li>Press PrtSc on your keyboard (or use SnippingTool.exe if you are familiar with this tool).</li><li>Open paintbrush.exe.</li><li>Paste the screen shot into paintbrush.</li><li>Save the file.</li><li>Upload it to the common area of some cloud storage, e.g. www.skydrive.com.</li><li>Paste the link here.</li></ol>

            The picture tells me that your current account does not have admin privileges. It tells me nothing about your other accounts, In particular it says nothing about the very first account you created when you first loaded Windows. It is automatically created
 as an admin account. What happened to it?

            <p>I really can't find much on that error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What media are you using for the installation media...&nbsp; A CD/DVD, a USB thumb drive, etc. and where did you obtain this installation media?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that the installation media is afflicted and it wouldn't hurt to create some new installation media and you can use your existing Windows Product Key to activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visit this site and download their Windows ISO download tool:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-iso-download-tool</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then download the ISO installation file that is right for your system and Windows product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An ISO file is a special kind of bootable installation file that can be burned to a CD/DVD or USB thumb drive and you can boot your system on that to begin the install.&nbsp; Simply copying the ISO file to the media will not work so don't do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create an installation CD/DVD from the ISO you can use a third party tool (like<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> ImgBurn</a>) or the built in Windows tool:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd451080.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd451080.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To make a bootable USB thumb drive, Rufus is a popular tool:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rufus.akeo.ie/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Like many free (but good) programs ImgBurn will want to install some things you might not want so pay attention during the installation and click these links to customize the installation (both places) and UNCHECK the extra things they offer:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97cf83b1-56ab-487c-bac8-6af6734bb28d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97cf83b1-56ab-487c-bac8-6af6734bb28d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can always uninstall ImgBurn later if you don't like or want it.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Elder</span></p>
<p><span>First thanks for your advice. I bought a full version of Window 7 ultimate 64 bit on DVD from PCWorld when it was first released and installed it and it worked fine. I thought because the DVD was
 a few years old now I went onto Microsoft website and put my product code in and download a new copy but I still had the same trouble.</span></p>
<p><span>With the IOS tool how does that work? Do I just burn off a new copy of windows using Nero onto DVD and try and install that.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m at work at the moment to when I get home in a few hours I will try your suggestions. Once again Elder thanks again for all your advice and help. I will let you know how I get on.</span></p>

            <p>If you used Rufus to apply the ISO to a USB thumb drive you then need to adjust your motherboard BIOS settings so it looks to boot from the USB port first and that is on page 4-35 of the English users manual that you can find here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/M3NHT_DeluxeHDMI/HelpDesk_Manual/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/M3NHT_DeluxeHDMI/HelpDesk_Manual/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when a system powers up there will be some F key to press to get a boot choice (F11 for me) so if you don't see that you will have to adjust the BIOS to tell the system to look at the USB port as the first priority.</p>

<h2>            UAC shield on some icons and Chrome Icon will not open Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrading to W10, I have noticed that, even though I'm logged on as Admin and UAC is turned off, there are still some icons with the UAC shield overlain on them. Is there a way of removing them? The program icon in the Programs folder has the shield
 too so I can't simply replace the icon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my Chrome icon is the only icon that refuses to open on a double click. &nbsp;Even though it is set to run as Admin I still have to right click and choose Run as Admin. &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            The age of the system might suggest it is too old to run Windows 10 32 bit. The NX error means it doesn't support that security instruction at the processor level. Sometimes doing a BIOS update might help, but its a lot.
<br />
<br />I personally leave the system as is and let it run its course. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC.

    <title>Can&#39;t save to internal secondary drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bookenout  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t save to internal secondary drive</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting an error when using an application. When I need to save a file to an internal secondary drive, the system stops me saying I don't have permission to access that drive. It creates a 0kb file and I cancel the save; I try saving again and it
 works. It works kind of on and off. Sometimes it will let me save and sometimes it won't let me, randomly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also having a problem where my windows explorer randomly takes FOREVER to recognize folder content. It also randomly can't display the navigation pane to the left of the window. Searching within folders takes a long time if never to return results.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running my programs as admin</li><li>Changing permissions of folder and user groups to allow full access</li><li>Restarting</li><li>Ran a System File Checker (sfc /scannow) and it came back 100% good</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a graphic designer and my main programs I use and noticing these issues with are:</p>
<p>Adobe Illustrator CC 2018</p>
<p>Adobe Indesign&nbsp;CC&nbsp;2018</p>
<p>Adobe Photoshop CC&nbsp;2018</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really not sure what else to do and can't find anything to help me with this issue. I would greatly appreciate some guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I can save to my main C drive without any issues. I only have one user account, mine, and it's the admin account.</p>

<h2>            How do I enable intel rapid start technology</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Dell Inspiron 7720 laptop. It started up like it was suppose to when I first got it. But about a month ago, it started taking a long time for W8 to load.&nbsp;The dell logo screen would come on, and just stay there for a long time. I can hear the

<h3> lorenaperson  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Xbox 360 E&#58; hot, making noise, and freezing</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.&nbsp; I am new to Xbox.&nbsp; My Son just recently traded his PS3 for the new slim version of Xbox 360 that just released last week.&nbsp; Anyway, from the day we had set it up (6/25/13)&nbsp;and he began playing, 15 minutes after playing we noticed that from the main
 ventilation where the fan is, was very hot.&nbsp; Hotter than PS3 ever got.&nbsp; I only let my Son play for 30-1 hour to not get the console hotter than it is.&nbsp; However, the console, surprisingly, instantly cools off after turning it off.&nbsp; I have brought up the problem
 to GameStop and had read all the comments in the Xbox forums.&nbsp; Everyone seems to say it is normal.&nbsp; I'm a single mom and worries about fire especially when he is home by himself most of the time.&nbsp; Now this week, new issues started to happen.&nbsp; Buzzing noise
 sounding like a fan started making only during play time.&nbsp; Also, it froze once so far playing Worm games and had to turn off system to restart game.&nbsp; System is not connected to internet.&nbsp; Has lot of open space around it for ventilation and is set horizontally
 to be sure all ventilations are not blocked.&nbsp; Any suggestions.&nbsp; Just got this system on 6/25/13.&nbsp; My Son is irritated that he is not able to play for more than 2 hours at a time like he did with PS3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestion for Xbox maker or video game system maker.&nbsp; Find a way to build the system without them overheating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and help.</p>

<p>Hello my xbox slim also gets very hot and the creaking/groaning from the fan is fine mine makes the same sounds and back to the heat there is times i play for 10-15 hours straight no problems then continue to do so the next day if your son is playing disc
 games try installing them on the hard drive this should stop freezing</p>
<p>PS keep an eye on it make sure the fan is working </p>
<p>good luck </p>

<p>Hello, Eggy! That doesn't sound right to me. &nbsp;If you've already followed the standard troubleshooting for overheating, you may want to just take that system back to the store and ask for an exchange. &nbsp;Please let us know how it goes!</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>For those that are having problems with your xbox 360 running hot. Try placing your Xbox 360 little lower towards ground level and not on carpet but can place on hard surfaces. Also do not place anything on top of the xbox 360 like games or anything covering
 the holes or place it in an enclosed area. Lastly if your Xbox 360 is running hot.. may be best to turn it off and put a fan on it or place it by a window and let the hot air exhaust for a bit. I can honeslty say I did the mistake of placing games cases on
 top of my xbox 360 E and found out later when I picked up those game cases it was hot, of course I turned my xbox 360 E off immediately after and let it cool down. &nbsp;Just becareful and make sure you have your Xbox 360 in a good area with plenty of air flow
 and not high above the ground.</p>

<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>Do not use device manager it may tell you the device is up to date but will not tell you if it is corrupt&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Search</strong> Google for the name of the driver, or go to the computer makers site.</div>
<div><span><br />
<strong>Compare</strong> the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong> the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />
<br />
The most common drivers are listed on these pages:&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Sign in impossible &#58; control code sent only to an old e-mail address</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>when I try to sign in, after giving my right user-id and password, I always receive this 2nd control check : &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Only this address is shown.<br />
But I don't use it anymore. <br />
So I asked to change it (already 1 month ago) and received last january 29th, this message in my "hotmail.com" account :
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But this update seems not to have been done, as everytime that I start the <strong>
program</strong> "Skype" on my computer, the <strong>same old address</strong>, and only this one, can be used to send "the code" that I need to complete my sign-in. Why not the new one ??? (I've un-installed + re-installed Skype today : same happens again
 !)<br />
Remark : On "https://<strong>web.skype</strong>.com/en/", this change has been successfully done : But I prefer working with the app')<br />
<br />
Thanks if you can help me !</p>

<p><span>Hi lolojojoZV </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Greetings from Skype!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One reason why Skype is sending the verification code to your old email address is because you have not updated the security information saved on your account. Just to let you know, changing/updating the primary address of your Skype account doesn’t
 mean to change the security information where the code is being sent. The purpose of having a primary email address is for you to receive updates from Skype. Nonetheless, if you want to change/update your security information, please follow below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Sign in to account.live.com</span></li><li><span>Click on Security tab.</span></li><li><span>Click on Update security information.</span></li><li><span>Take note, after updating the security information saved on your account it will take 30 days for the changes to take effect.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If you don’t have any access to your Skype account. I would highly suggest to answer our
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account recovery form</a> and wait for an email update coming from account recovery team within 24-48 hours.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Should you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reply!</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox One hdmi with rca audio accesory.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, on my 360 set-up I currently use the official vga adapter which goes from my console to my monitor it splits of with 3 rca plugs to provide audio from my speakers(as the monitor has no inbuilt speakers) as it's coming up on Xbox one launch I'm unsure
 of how to go about this as I understand it has only hdmi output and digital audio output. Is there a cable similar to the official Xbox VGA cable for HDMI that has HDMI video with the 3 RCA plugs splitting of for seperate audio source? thank you I'd much rather
 be prepared for launch day with the right cables!</p>

            <p>Hey there Specialist!<br /><br />As of right now, no cables of that sort have been announced. So, given the equipment we currently have at hand and your desire to be ready prior to launch, the best suggestion I can think of would be to get a <a href="http://vga-to-hdmi-review.toptenreviews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HDMI to VGA converter</a> (you don't have to get one of those in that link, that's just so you can see what I mean) and get a set of speakers/headset that can plug into the Optical Out (the audio plug) on your console.<br /><br />I hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other questions. =)</p>

<p>I am looking for the same thing. I have an older Receiver that I still want to use for my gaming, but it doesn't have any HDMI inputs or outputs, only RCA's. Right now I have the One audio through my weak TV Speakers. I have been looking at HDMI/RCA converters
 but I am thinking that will include video as well so, not good. If anyone figures this out, I would be very interested in NOT having to buy a whole new Audio system. I know the standard is becoming HDMI, and that's fine, but I don't want to pack up my $600
 receiver just yet.</p>

<p>I was looking for an official solution to this problem too. Don't have one, but my audio setup seems to be a solution for you: if you want to use your existing Receiver get a Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC) for it. My soundsystem is vintage but my audio
 sources are all digital, the DAC bridges that gap and can be very inexpensive.</p>

<h2>            How to stop windows from restarting automatically</h2>
                    <p>This is becoming a big issue for me - I have lots of windows open like spreadsheets, documents, web pages, etc.&nbsp; I never shut my computer off but at night, windows keeps rebooting my machine and I'm losing a lot of work. It seems to be getting worse - rebooting
 more often of late.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I paused updates but it's still restarting.&nbsp; After that happens, I have to go into each office document and try to "auto-recover".&nbsp; This is very annoying Microsoft. Not to mention other programs that are abruptly killed on a reboot and the amount of work
 lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

<p>You cannot stop the restarts. You <em>can</em> control them, but at some point your computer is going to need to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can control restarts in two ways, one of which requires that you have the Professional edition of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all editions of Windows 10, you can set&nbsp;<em>active hours</em>. These are times when you are considered to be actively working on your computer. Windows 10 will not restart during active hours. You can set aside up to 18 hours per day to be your active
 hours (and that number may increase.) For most users, their non-active hours fall during the middle of the night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Professional edition of Windows 10 you can&nbsp;<em>delay</em> quality updates for up to 30 days and feature updates for up to 360 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Between these two features, you can exercise substantial control over when your computer restarts. But eventually, it needs to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an update fails to install, it will try to install again at the next conclusion of active hours. If this is happening often, you need to find out why the update is failing and fix whatever needs fixing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, you can minimize data loss by backing up frequently. Third-party backup software makes this easy and you can continue to use the computer while the backup is happening in the background. You could, for example, schedule incremental&nbsp; backups to occur
 every 15 minutes.</p>

            Brilliant. Thanks for the hint - I set it and we'll see but I cannot believe that setting is hidden so far deep. I will write back if it prompts me to reboot.&nbsp; I will try the other suggestions also just to see what settings are. I'm on windows 10 pro.<br />

    <title>Camera Error 0xA00F424F and Settings not opening - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Camera Error 0xA00F424F and Settings not opening</h2>
                    <p>So I know this error is a common one in the community, I've spent the last few days searching for a fix that would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error only occurs after taking a single photo (first photo is free!) and I had no issues opening settings prior to this error, even now it will sometimes open without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an optimus vii computer I recently bought, running Windows 10. The camera built in is BisonCam, NB Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried already:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Going to properties and security and checking the permissions- all are fine, even when making an 'everyone' permissions profile, the error still occurs.</p>
<p>- Changed where the images save to from OneDrive to This PC. No difference, also no option to move back to OneDrive?</p>
<p>- Running the app troubleshooter. Surprise surprise they found an error and 'fixed' it. Upon restart it worked for about five minutes before reverting to 'something went wrong'.</p>
<p>- System restore. Yup. Did a system restore to a point prior to this starting (it's only been the last few weeks, the camera worked fine previously). Again, worked great for about five minutes until 'oops, here's the error code!'</p>
<p>- Checked for driver updates. Both for windows and the built in camera. No option to roll back driver either. Reinstalled the camera drivers also. Again. Worked for about five minutes.</p>
<p>- Checked for app store updates. Apparently all is well.</p>
<p>- Cleaned up the registry. CCleaner'd the heck outta my machine. Nope.</p>
<p>- Made several blood sacrifices to numerous gods. It wasn't pretty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my camera a LOT because I have numerous nieces and nephews that love to play around as well as updating several arts and crafts blogs. I'm at a loss of what to do next so I'd really love some advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>1. I'm pretty sure I'm a Microsoft user account as &nbsp;OneDrive was already set up when I went through the initial setup, and things like the Windows App store etc were there and I sign in with my password. Please feel free to tell me if I'm incorrect.</p>
<p>2) Nothing that I would consider to effect the running of the machine? Aside from a few steam games, dropbox, and other similar bits and pieces- I don't have any real bulky software on this pc yet, aside from photoshop which I had quite a lot prior to the
 issue, and I cannot recall installing anything immediately prior to the issue. I wanted to keep this machine as smooth as possible so I've not really messed around with moving things or installing anything. There have been no hardware changes as this is almost
 a brand new machine and I've had no need to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched several times for windows updates, driver updates, etc, but it continues to say everything is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't quite understand is how the app is perfectly happy to take a single photo, but then decides it wants to throw up the error message if more than one photo is taken whilst the app is open. Closing the app and reopening it 'fixes' it for, again,
 a single photo. I was trying to get a good shot of my twin nieces the other day and taking a single image with a couple of two year olds on your lap first time is tricky when you have to keep closing and opening the camera app. Sorry to be awkward.</p>

    <title>Why is cortana completely useless&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is cortana completely useless&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've tried about 20 times over a year and a half to find various answers via the search bar and cortana, I don't think either has ever returned an answer, I always end up on Google (not bing) or forums (not microsoft). I waste time asking cortana things
 then get sent to a link that says "talk to a human". Then a form comes up, c'mon, cortana can't even find MS apps on my computer. I can't even hit a letter to jump to an app in the app list, I tried S for sound and R for Recorder, after searching the web,
 I discover it's called Voice Recorder, none of my 50 search words to cortana could be deciphered to find me that? You hide apps in the windows folder because maybe we'll uninstall them. We MUST install 3rd party apps because yours don't work. Can't even print
 a folder list, so ridiculous.</p>

<p>Hi RL'Hamm,<br />
<br />
<br />
There are some terminologies and commands that Cortana might find confusing. You have to make sure that the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027882/windows-10-activate-hey-cortana-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"Hey Cortana"</a></strong> feature is activated. You need to tell her the exact name of the app you wanted to open.<br />
<br />
When you ask Cortana for something that she doesn't know how to answer, it will automatically route you to Bing search for some results.<br />
<br />
We appreciate your feedback regarding Cortana. You can post or upvote this concern in our Windows Feedback hub. Submitting your feedback in Windows Feedback hub will help us gather information regarding your concern so we can determine what's causing the issue.
 Your feedback will also help collate bugs and known issues, as well as the suggestions that will help improve the Windows operating system. Using the collected data, the engineers will come up with an update that will improve Windows operating system.<br />
<br />
In order to submit a new feedback, please follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On a Windows 10 device, search for "Feedback Hub" in <strong>Cortana search</strong>, and then launch the app.<br />
</li><li>Navigate to <strong>Feedback</strong> in the left menu, and then press <strong>
+ Add new feedback</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select the <strong>Problem</strong>, and share any details you think are relevant, and then choose an appropriate category and subcategory.<br />
</li><li><strong>Important</strong>: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking
<strong>Begin monitoring</strong> (or <strong>Start capture</strong>) near the end of the form;
<strong>Stop monitoring</strong> when you're done.<br />
</li><li>Once you've completed the form and monitoring, click <strong>Submit</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Continue using Feedback Hub</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>My Feedback</strong> at the top, and then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear).<br />
</li><li>Open the item you submitted, and then click <strong>Share</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Copy link</strong>, and then paste the link in your response (it will look like
<strong>https://aka.ms/ link&gt;</strong>).</li></ol>

<p>It ran very smoothly when i first began using it, but i have noticed 1 major problem recently... i am having trouble playing a particular .WMV file in windows media player. The file takes about 10 seconds to start playing and while it does play, the video
 but not so much the audio, begins to lag and stutter during playback.</p>

<p>Hi JoshuaMarsilio:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How large is this .WMV file?&nbsp; How much <strong>RAM</strong> is installed in your machine, and if you open Windows Task Manager while you play this video what % Physical Memory is being used?&nbsp; Does it help to close unnecessary programs like browsers, etc.
 and free up RAM while you're playing the video?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a lack of free RAM isn't an issue, I'd suggest installing VideoLAN's 32-bit
<strong>VLC Media Player</strong> from <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/</a> and see if it plays this video correctly.&nbsp; VLC Media Player v3.x will be fully supported for Win XP and Vista until the upcoming v4.x is released, and that official download page should automatically detect your OS and offer
 the current 32-bit v3.0.7.1 installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If playback also stutters in VLC Media Player, please note that there is currently a known issue on Vista SP2 computers where
<strong>Windows Update can hang on "<em>Checking for updates..</em>." for several hours (or even days) without throwing an error message</strong>. This problem was first reported in August 2015 and these slow Windows Updates have become progressively worse
 over time and <strong>can cause serious performance issues</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to see if you're affected by this problem, <strong>run a manual Windows Update</strong> (Control Panel | System and Maintenance | Windows Update | Check for Updates).&nbsp; If Windows Update runs to completion in 5 or 10 minutes and reports there
 are no available updates then your operating system should be fully patched to the end of extended support on 11-Apr-2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If your manual Windows Update gets stuck on "<em>Checking for updates...</em>"</strong> for more than 30 min then disable your automatic Windows Updates [Windows Update | Change settings | Important updates | Never check for updates (not recommended)],
 close the user interface, and <strong>re-boot</strong> to terminate any Windows Update sessions currently running in the background on your system.&nbsp; There is a workaround for this Windows Update problem on page 1 of m#l's thread
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/updates-not-working-it-has-been-searching-for/92cd6922-17f6-4730-b46b-91a480b95dd3?page=1&amp;messageId=1ef00080-91e9-4ffa-a5a3-92f6ecd69c32">

<p>The file is nearly 700 MB. The VLC media player is performing worse than wmp 11 which i was using before. I don't know what has changed recently, but the file played smoothly a few months ago maybe a year ago. I can't update anything because windows vista
 is no longer being supported.</p>
<p>I am planning on simply buying a new PC, but it is unfortunate that my wmp is no longer functioning smoothly.</p>
<p>I am having many other problems with this pc, one is that i can no longer play 8ball pool by miniclip or texas holdem poker at aol games.com, because of adblocker not working on firefox, and because of comcast lowering my connection speed.</p>
<p>I can only hope getting a new pc and possibly new internet will resolve these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My pc is a toshiba satellite amd athlon x2 dual core 2.1 ghz with 2 gb ram</p>
<p>32-bit windows vista. While it ran quite smoothly years ago, Its performance has gone to hell in the past year.</p>
<p>I tried increasing buffering and enabling playback helpers in windows media player. The media player does not seem to be honoring the buffering options and is playing the video with stuttering no matter what i do.</p>

</p><p>Hi JoshuaMarsilio:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your machine is a bit under-powered (especially with 2 GM RAM) and I agree it's probably time for a new computer, but I'm still not sure why why the performance has degraded so significantly in the past year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you confirm that your Vista SP2 OS is actually patched to end of support on 11-Apr-2017 and that a manual Windows Update reports that there are no further updates available?&nbsp; Open your IE9 browser, go to Help | About Internet Explorer, and see if you
 have Update Versions <strong>9.0.60 / KB4014661</strong> as shown below.&nbsp; Let me know the KB number if you have an earlier version, since this would indicate that you have the "<em>Checking for updates..</em>." problem I described in my earlier post.&nbsp; Your
 computer is going to be very slow if you have this issue - when Windows Update gets stuck it saturates an entire CPU core (e.g., 50% activity on a dual core CPU) for hours or days at a time, and most users who are just discovering they have this problem are
 typically missing Vista SP2 / IE9 updates dating back to <strong>June 2016</strong> or earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions on page 1 of m#l's thread <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/updates-not-working-it-has-been-searching-for/92cd6922-17f6-4730-b46b-91a480b95dd3?page=1&amp;messageId=1ef00080-91e9-4ffa-a5a3-92f6ecd69c32">
<em>Updates not working, it has been searching for updates for hours</em></a> and my manual Windows Updates now run to completion in under 5 min and reports no further updates are available.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is the 700 MB video stored on your hard drive or are you trying to stream it over the internet?&nbsp; I assumed it was stored on your hard drive since it sounds like you're trying to play it back in WMP or VLC instead of your Firefox browser.&nbsp;
</p>

</p><p>I can't help much if Comcast has lowered you connection speed (I have a fairly slow 5 Mbps connection and my actual speed today at
<a href="https://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.speedtest.net/</a> was 5.38 Mbps download / 1.00 Mbps upload), but if you're looking for a good ad blocker I use the latest

<strong>Adblock Plus</strong></a> v3.5.2 (released 19-Apr-2019) in my Firefox ESR v52.9.0 browser.</p>

<p>But then i will have to reinstall service packs and updates (if microsoft even allows it anymore for Vista)</p>
<p>I don't think my recovery media will allow me to reinstall only windows media player.</p>
<p>I have some paranoia about the fact that my computer has been sabotaged by microsoft as i seem to have been given updates that cause my computer to perform poorly.</p>
<p>oh and yes the wmv file is on my hard disc.</p>

</p><p>Hi JoshusaMarsilio:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using Comcast's free <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/downloading-the-norton-security-suite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Norton Security Online</strong></a> as your antivirus? As previously noted, I use a paid version of Norton Security Deluxe v22.15.2.22 (the legacy version for Win XP / Vista) and it's always possible your Norton installation
 was corrupted during a product update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that video playback is worse in VLC Media Player than Windows Media Player, so there must be some issue that is common to both programs.&nbsp; Do you have a discrete
<strong>graphics card</strong> in your Toshiba Satellite laptop (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce, AMD Radeon, etc) and do you have the latest available Vista-compatible graphics drivers?&nbsp; If you aren't sure let me know the exact model of your Toshiba laptop and I'll see
 if I can find newer graphics drivers for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't worry about the Update Versions of IE9 , as long as you use <strong>Firefox ESR v52.9.0</strong> as your default browser.&nbsp; I was only hoping to use the KB number in the version number of your IE9 browser to estimate the last time Windows Update ran
 successfully on your computer, but if your IE9 (or perhaps IE8?) browser is stuck on KB956196 (released around May 2010) that doesn't tell me what I need to know.&nbsp; If the suggested workarounds to
<strong>purge your browser history and disable all add-ons</strong> in the support article
<em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/956196/internet-explorer-cannot-display-the-webpage-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage" error</a></em> you referenced didn't solve
 the problem then I wouldn't worry about it for now, as long as you have your Firefox ESR browsing history set to clear on exit (Tools | Options | Privacy | History |
<strong>Clear History When Firefox Closes</strong> | Settings).&nbsp; You should be able to purge your entire browsing history on exit unless you use Firefox's built-in password manager or absolutely need to keep a critical browser cookie.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I'd still suggest you try the step-by-step instructions on page 1 of m#l's thread
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/updates-not-working-it-has-been-searching-for/92cd6922-17f6-4730-b46b-91a480b95dd3?page=1&amp;messageId=1ef00080-91e9-4ffa-a5a3-92f6ecd69c32">
<em><strong>Updates not working, it has been searching for updates for hours</strong></em></a>. STEP # 3 explains how to search your installed updates at Control Panel | Programs and Features | View Installed Updates for the 4 or 5
 critical "speed up" patches [<strong>KB3205638</strong> (rel. 13-Dec-2016); <strong>
KB4012583</strong> (rel. 14-Mar-2017); <strong>KB4015195</strong> (rel. 11-Apr-2017);
<strong>KB4015380</strong> (rel. 11-Apr-2017) plus <strong>KB4014661</strong> if IE9 is installed (rel. 11-Apr-2017)] that must be manually installed to get Windows Update working again and speed up your system if any of those security updates are missing .&nbsp;
 Be sure you search for the full KB number (e.g., for "<em>KB3205638</em>" and not "<em>3205638</em>").</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/842a9157-c7bb-44d5-8355-3cd092d1f83a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/842a9157-c7bb-44d5-8355-3cd092d1f83a?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
If you don't want to (or don't need to) patch your Vista SP2 to the end of extended support (11-Apr-2017), at
<strong>a very minimum</strong> you should follow STEP # 1 of those instructions in m#l's thread and
<strong>disable your automatic Windows Updates</strong> and then re-boot your system a few times to ensure a background Windows Update session isn't eating up your system resources for days at a time.</p>
<p>___________________________________</p>

I don't know if this would help your slow internet connection, but you might want to try one of the
<strong>free DNS resolver services</strong> like CloudFlare (1.1.1.1 / 1.0.0.1) or IBM's Quad9 (9.9.9.9 / 149.112.112.112) described in Lifewire's
<em><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-and-public-dns-servers-2626062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Free and Public DNS Servers</a></em>.&nbsp; The companion Lifewire article
<em><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-change-dns-servers-in-windows-2626242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Change DNS Servers in Windows</a></em> explains how to set the preferred and alternate DNS servers for IPv4 and/or IPv6 connections for
 your wired (Ethernet / Local Area Connection) and/or wireless (WiFi) adapters from Vista's Network Sharing Center.</p>

<p>Thanks, i haven't tried any of these things yet. And while i'd be more than happy to have a smooth- functioning computer, i'd rather have a kind-of functioning computer than one that doesn't function at all, so i am reluctant to take any of your suggestions
 into action.</p>
<p>But i must ask one thing, you mention that i could make my internet go faster somehow by changing my dns and ipv settings... how could this be possible if Xfinity is purposely slowing my internet on their end? As i mentioned, my internet router would make
 a grinding noise when it transferred quickly months ago. Xfinity kind of admitted to me that they slowed it on purpose and won't make it go fast again until i pay more money per month. So how could something&nbsp;<em><strong>i</strong></em> do possibly make it
 run faster???<br />

</p><p>Hi JoshuaMarsilio:<br />
<br />
Please see the How-To Geek article <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/426515/how-to-speed-up-your-internet-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>How to Speed Up Your Internet Connection</em></a>.&nbsp; There are lots of helpful hints in that article, including the sections titled "<em>Change Your DNS Servers</em>" and "<em>ISP Throttling You? Use a VPN</em>".<br />
<br />
As previously noted, though, speeding up your internet connection isn't going to help if the .WMV file is saved to your local hard drive and you aren't streaming this video over the internet.&nbsp; If you aren't sure if your Vista SP2 OS is patched to the end of
 extended support (11-Apr-2017) and don't want to make any changes to your system then my only other suggestion would be that you download a fresh copy of the .WMV file and see if it plays normally in the latest
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">VLC Media Player v3.x</a> (currently v3.0.7.1).<br />
