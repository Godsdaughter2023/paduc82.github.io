    <title>Windows 7 64 very slow to shut down - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 64 very slow to shut down</h2>
                    <p>Hello - hoping to get some help with this issue. &nbsp;In the last couple of days my PC has been shutting down very slowly. &nbsp;It will get to the blue shut down screen saying "Shutting Down..." and will hang for 5 to 10 minutes before shutting down. &nbsp;I don't know
 where to start troubleshooting the issue so I was hoping to get some advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some searching online and I realize its probably related to some process that is having a hard time closing during the shut down process but I don't know how to identify what process it might be to fix the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

 was reported for calling someone on a game who was spamming the chat for half an hour a C U Next Tuesday and they reported me; my question is why when I already had one active suspension from two days ago did I receive another one yesterday WHILE I was at
 work? I can no longer play any multiplayer game or use any chat or online features. I don't mind abit the first soft ban because I did something "wrong" even though some trash talk is allowed but this second one?? What a joke. As I tried to apply for a review
 it says I can't apply for a free case review because I don't meet the standards. Am I SOL? Or is there some way to get in contact with someone who can fix this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ban was time stamped at 8:40PM</p>

    <title>Why does Windows 10 not create a dump file&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deadlysilverfox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows 10 not create a dump file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a modern Surface and it continually blue screens. Unfortunately it never creates a dump file so i am not able to debug the cause of the crash. I have validated the correct settings for dump file creation e.g. following instructions such as these:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/130536/windows-does-not-save-memory-dump-file-after-a-crash</p>
<p>
</p><p>and</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/d445ff20-516e-4cea-962e-64b359c0b88a/bsod-does-not-create-dump-files?forum=WindowsInsiderPreview</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to get to the bottom of the issue and i don't just want to perform a clean factory install until i have attempted to determine the issue in case it is hardware related. My surface is only 4 months old and it has been plagued with BSOD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to anyone that can provide me some other ideas.</p>

<p>Hi DeadlySilverFox,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know if you have third-party applications that automatically cleans temporary files on your computer. Do you have something like CCleaner or
<strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> a-like programs? Can you check if you have background processes that automatically deletes these kinds of files without your consent?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi Johann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying and sorry for the delayed response. I have no disk clean-up programs but I do use Acronis True Image which does have a protection profile for detecting and blocking ransomware. I have however now uninstalled Acronis and I still get no
 dump file. It just sits on 0% whenever a BSOD occurs (which it usually every two days or so).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if anyone has any other ideas as to why my Surface will not create a Dump File following a BSOD. Possibly I need to bite the bullet and re-install clean but would like to determine why the system is crashing before doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All and any ideas gratefully received.</p>

<p>Really appreciate any help with this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Machine boots properly but failures are sporadic. Most common BSOD errors are UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION, KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR and SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows 10 Pro - Version 1803 Build 17134.228 running on the latest Surface Pro.</li><li>No changes made to the system I keep a static set of applications as I use this machine for work and I have been plagued with this issue since buying the device new. Sometimes I will get days without an issue and other times 4 BSODs a day. Cannot determine
 the issue though as I never get a dump file.</li><li>In terms of troubleshooting steps I have run all the diagnostic tools to check for storage failures (disk), RAM issues, etc. I have removed all non-essential applications that I thought could be providing kernel level hooks like BitDefender, Acronis TrueImage
 Backup (with its always on ransomware protection) in case this was causing issues in the storage layer. I have scoured event viewer and looked at all errors and warnings and attempt to either remove or find posts/descriptions that conclude they are "expected"
 or not to be worried about.</li><li>I have run a full AV check but as with the point above I have now removed BitDefender and returned to Microsoft AV. No threats found.</li><li>I have lots of free space available on my hard disk 320GB fee of the 476GB disk. Storage sense and other auto-deleting features are disabled.</li><li>I make extensive use of Office 365 and OneDrive Syncing - my hunch is the these BSOD issues are being caused by the background saving and syncing.</li><li>I can be running nothing more than the browser but typically I am running Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive, Outlook, VOIP Studio, Zoom Meeting Client and Chrome (occasionally Visual Studio and PowerBI but this is not the norm). Slack is always running too. I
 have a password vault app (StickyPass) and iCloud integrations and the Adobe Cloud app is running in the background. Typically I will be in PowerPoint or Excel when the BSOD occurs but occasionally it will fail if the screen lock is on. Office Apps are all
 through my Office365 subscription and I am not joined to a corporate domain so no weird and wonderful group policies or lockdowns in place.</li><li>One thing might be of note that I extensively use the Surface Dock. My surface is docked most of the time but I have also seen the BSOD happen when I remove the dock connector and the machine changes power state and so I have never ruled out some form of
 hardware issue with the Surface itself.&nbsp;</li><li>I have worked through the Troubleshooting Bluescreen Errors and I even contacted Microsoft support who wanted to start with a complete re-image back to the factory default. I like to get to the bottom of issues however before just wiping clean and seeing
 if that solves the issue so I am really keen to get some help.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Thanks again and sorry for the delay in reply. I will attach the BSOD images.</p>

<p>Unfortunately not. I can’t help but think there is some form of hardware issue (i believe its the SSD) but i cannot prove it. With no dump file it becomes almost impossible to track down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you do a clean build or perform a device factory restore? I assume you also get no dump file?</p>

<p>1) In the above images there were three different BSOD bugchecks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) There may be some steps or tests that you have already done but whatever the findings in the logs there may new or repeat tests.</p>
<p>For all tests please post images into the thread using zips and / share links (one drive, drop box, or google drive)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) To evaluate the BSOD please post logs for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Using administrative command prompt copy and paste this whole command.<br />
<br />
4) Make sure the default language is English so that the logs can be scanned and read.<br />
<br />
Choose the applicable link for the operating system:<br />

<br />
The command will automatically collect the computer files and place them on the desktop.<br />
<br />
5) Then use 7zip to organize the files and one drive or drop box to place share links into the thread for troubleshooting.<br />

<br />
This command will automatically collect these files:&nbsp; msinfo32, mini dumps, drivers, hosts, install, uninstall, services, startup, event viewer files, etc.<br />
<br />
6) Open administrative command prompt and copy and paste the whole command:<br />
<br />
copy %SystemRoot%\minidump\*.dmp "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\"&amp;dxdiag /t %Temp%\dxdiag.txt&amp;copy %Temp%\dxdiag.txt "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\SFdebugFiles\"&amp;type %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts &gt;&gt; "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\hosts.txt"&amp;systeminfo &gt; "%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\systeminfo.txt"&amp;driverquery

<p>1) In the prior post see step #8.</p>
<p>The virtual memory image was missing.</p>
<p>Please post an image of the Virtual memory windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) For startup and recovery system failure:</p>
<p>a) Change complete memory dump to automatic memory dump</p>
<p>b) Reboot to maintain settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) For any BSOD post two share links into the thread using one drive, drop box, or google drive:</p>
<p>a) one share link for the results of the administrative command prompt command
</p>
<p>b) one share link for the memory dump &gt; if the file size is &lt; 1.5 GB then zip &gt; post a share link</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Please run the administrative command prompt command now and post a share link with dxdiag.</p>

<h2>            Skype won&#39;t let me connect</h2>
                    When I try to log in to Skype on my laptop, I get a message saying "Skype can't connect". When I follow the "Can't access your account" link, then I can reset my password (doesn't fix the problem) and I can sign into my Skype account online, but I still
 can't make the Skype desktop version work (version 6.18.0.106 which is what my employer allows me to install - locked down machine). So I have a functioning account with credit in it, but can't actually use it. I've been round the loop of "Can't access your
 account" instructions multiple times, but I just end up in the same state. What should I do?

<h2>            Dell XPS 10&#58; ERROR&#58; Unable to find a bootable option. Press any key to shut down.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an error I've never seen before and I've worked with computers for quite some time now. I own the Dell XPS 10 tablet with Windows RT 10 installed. When booting I get the error: "ERROR: Unable to find a bootable option. Press any key to shut down."
 and a black screen. This seems to have happen out the random. I am able to launch Windows Recovery Mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refreshing - I get an error saying that it failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resetting - it finishes and I still get the same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Letting Windows try and fix it - Windows said it couldn't fix it.</p>
<p>Manually going into R:\RecoveryImage\install.wsd from recovery CMD Prompt but unfortunately I only have install.esd. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried searching Google for a recovery image so I could just reinstall from USB. No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cortana does not identify music sound tracks - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cortana does not identify music sound tracks</h2>
                    <p><span>Contana not recognizing music, Win 10</span></p>
<p>I am u<span>sing&nbsp; a 15" HP Spectre x360 laptop&nbsp; running Win 10.</span></p>
<p><span>I want to use Cortana to identify some of my music tracks but it says “I cannot hear the music” or something to that effect.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Yet Cortana will recognize voice speech when I talk to it.</span></p>
<p><span>I found that when I right click on the speaker icon in the taskbar and left click on “recording devices” that there are two recorder devices shown under the “Recording tab”; One is “Microphone
 Array” (set as default) and the other is “Stereo Mix”; See attachment.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>By trial and error, I found that the “Microphone array”<span>&nbsp;
</span>is what responds to speech from the user to Cortana and the “Stereo Mix” setting responds to music playing when Cortana is set to identify music when the musical note icon in the upper right corner of Cortana is checked.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When both recording microphones are active at the same time, neither one works.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It must be one or the other.<span>&nbsp; </span>This does not seem right to me but that’s the way it is.
<span>&nbsp;</span>So, set “Microphone Array” as the default mic for regular use with Cortana and when you want to identify music titles, manually switch to “Microphone Array” as the input device.</span></p>

            Hi Linda, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />Note down the letter associated with that new drive
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter (replace X with the correct drive letter)
<br />
<br />select volume X
<br />
<br />remove letter=X
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC       
        </p>

            It has been happening with new update that new drive is getting uncovered. You can do following to hide it and there will no harm anywhere.
<br />
<br />Type diskpart in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Right click on Diskpart and run as Administrator
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />select volume g
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />remove letter=g

            This is one of the known issues with the update as Recovery partition should be hidden and is accidentally assigned a drive letter. 
<br />Right-click Start&gt;Command Prompt(admin) 
<br />Type in the following: 
<br />diskpart 
<br />list volume 
<br />select volume 3 
<br />Replace 3 with the number of the volume which is assigned a drive letter. (In hundreds of MBs) 
<br />remove letter="G" 
<br />Replace G with the Recovery drive letter. 
<br />
<br />Don't worry, removing a drive letter would not cause any harm to your device.

    <title>Windows 10 Pro Bitlocker will not auto unlock on boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve103297  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Bitlocker will not auto unlock on boot</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded two identical PCs from Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 10 Pro (</p>
<p><span>Version 1511 Build 10586.36)</span>. &nbsp;One of the PCs is having trouble with the Bitlocker Auto Unlock feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PCs are both Intel NUC5i7RYH. &nbsp;Each has a Samsung internal SSD and two Western Digital External hard drives. I have enabled bitlocker on all three drives. &nbsp;The external drives on one of the PCs will not auto unlock on boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The details on the problem PC:</p>
<p>I have enabled bitlocker on two external hard drives with auto unlock enabled. &nbsp;However, after every boot from a power off state the external drive is still locked. If I log out and then in again the drive is auto unlocked
 as expected. &nbsp;But, if I power down the PC and restart then the drive is not auto unlocked and requires a password be entered. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know of three ways to enable auto unlock and have tried them all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have entered the drive password by double-clicking the locked drive. &nbsp;The drive asks for the password and then in the advanced area I have checked the box to auto unlock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have right clicked the drive in Windows Explorer and chosen Manage Bitlocker. &nbsp;I have Turned off Auto Unlock and then Turned it back on. &nbsp;This doesn't fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have run the command line tools from Power Shell as an administrator:&nbsp;Enable-BitLockerAutoUnlock -MountPoint "E:". &nbsp;The command reports that the drive is auto unlocked. &nbsp;However, it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone run across this one before? &nbsp;Any ideas as to what else to try? I reported this issue through the Microsoft Answer Tech and was told that they couldn't fix it. &nbsp;If it can't be fixed is there a way to add it to a list for future consideration of bug
 fixes through the Windows Update process?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice. &nbsp;I'll try your recommendation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a question though. &nbsp;Given my feeling that this is a defect in Windows 10, I was curious as to how to report defects and get them added to a fixit list somewhere. &nbsp;So far, I've visited two different Microsoft branded "Help" forums with a similar
 response, i.e. "please go somewhere else, we can't help you". &nbsp;It seems as if there should be a formal process available to submit defects in the product. &nbsp;Quite frankly, part of this posting was an exploration of how Microsoft supports end users when the
 experience is less than satisfactory. &nbsp;There are other companies in the industry that are renowned for taking care of their customers. &nbsp;I was curious as to where Microsoft fit in the continuum. &nbsp;Thus far, I'm troubled to report, the experience has been less
 than exemplary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, perhaps the next leg of my journey thought the support maze will prove more fruitful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>

<h2>            win10 anniversary problem AMD HD4650 driver</h2>
                    Although I have an old computer with AMD HD4650 AGP graphics card I managed to upgrade to Win 10 from Win 7. Everything works, monitor is set to maximum resolution 1920 * 1080, no problems with driver (8.970.100.9001 dated 13/01/2015 - downloaded direct
 from AMD via Windows update when Win 10 was installed). When I try to update to the Win 10 Anniversary edition the standard Microsoft graphics driver is installed - the AMD driver is no longer compatible. I have tried the AMD site, nothing is available, although
 they state referring to cards which work under Win 10 <a href="https://community.amd.com/docs/DOC-1313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> jane_parsons46  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t log in to my profile on my PC</h2>
                    Randomly, a couple of weeks ago, when I tried to log in to my home PC (which contains my profile and all my pictures of my children), I could not. It was recommended that I try signing out and in again. That did nothing. When I went to log on, instead
 of the usual screen, I got a message which says "preparing to load windows". I have therefore lost my profile and I really want it back. I can log in to my Microsoft account, but that's pretty useless. I'd be grateful for help with this.

<p>I doubt it very much that you have lost your profile folder. Have a look at the folder "C:\Users". What subfolders do you see?</p>

    <title>ASUS Smart Gesture and Windows 10 November Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daviddubya  say:</h3>
<h2>            ASUS Smart Gesture and Windows 10 November Update</h2>
                    <p>After applying the November Update to Windows 10 on my ASUS PC, touchpad Smart Gesture was not in the System Tray.&nbsp; The touchpad tap to click feature was enabled, which I find annoying and hard to use properly.&nbsp; There is no option in Windows 10 Mouse and
 Touchpad Settings to turn off tap to click.&nbsp; That option is included in ASUS Smart Gesture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Smart Gesture was retained during the November Update, and&nbsp;appeared in Control Panel, Programs and Features.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a prerequisite to Smart Gesture - a download from ASUS called ATK Package.&nbsp; ATK Package was not&nbsp;retained during the November Update.&nbsp;
 To fix this problem I uninstalled Smart Gesture.&nbsp; Then I went to the ASUS Drivers site and downloaded and installed the ATK Package.&nbsp; I then reinstalled ASUS Smart Gesture, also available on the ASUS Drivers site.&nbsp; After a restart Smart Gesture appeared in
 the System Tray and I was happy to disable touch to click.</p>

            <p>I followed your instructions and it worked, with one exception.&nbsp; Somehow my system had retained the 08/2015 version of the ASUS ATK package, so I had to uninstall it in addition to uninstalling the ASUS Smart Gesture driver. I then restarted my laptop, downloaded
 and installed the ASUS ATK package and the ASUS Smart Gesture driver from the ASUS download site, restarted my computer and VOILA!!&nbsp; There in the system tray was the Smart Gesture icon which I promptly disabled using fn/f9 keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that others might find useful is the following link to the ASUS download page where these apps are located, as I had a little difficulty finding them.&nbsp; The ASUS site is NOT intuitive or user friendly for an older computer hack like me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.asus.com/us/support/Download/3/516/0/5/iDj76sQprYFuQe5J/45/

 restart, and reconfigure all of my settings from defaults.</p>
<p>After finding this I just tried uninstalling Smart Gestures and the ATK package, and will reinstall the two from scratch. Hopefully that will fix my problems. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Professional product key</h2>
                    
<p>a while ago my raid setup crashed because one of the hard drives died.&nbsp; One was still intact so I reloaded my Windows 7 Professional onto that.&nbsp; it was working fine.&nbsp; My new harddrive came in, and then the other old one died.&nbsp; So i reloaded Windows 7 Professional
 onto the newly received Harddrive.&nbsp; When I first installed WIndows 7 and again after the first harddrive died.&nbsp; Windows 7 Professional product key worked.&nbsp; now it is not.&nbsp; nothing has changed.&nbsp; all the numbers and letters are correct.&nbsp; I get the error code
 0xC004xf01 stating the product key is for upgrade only.&nbsp; The first time I installed it, it was an upgrade from Windows Vista Ultimate. the second time I installed it, was a clean install.&nbsp; I don't know what to do.&nbsp; If anyone can give me an answer tonight that'd
 be great.&nbsp; If not I will call microsoft tomorrow</p>

<h2>            Get genuine copy now --- Error&#58;&#160;0x80070005</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title: </em><strong>Tried to move partition, Now Windows 7 looks like its corrupt</strong></p>
<p>Long story short, I was trying to move a partition on my hard drive, and it froze halfway so I was forced to shut of the computer manually. I had dual-booted Windows XP professional and Windows 7 Professional (both 32-bit). Now my Windows 7 partition is
 somewhat corrupted, but all.. or most of my documents and programs etc are all still on there. The Windows XP partition is still working fine though.&nbsp;
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>
<div>-EDIT, I tried Startup repair-&nbsp;</div>
<div>So then I login, it shows the message "Logging in" and then "Preparing your desktop" and when I login all it is, is a black screen, and in the bottom righthand corner a message "Windows 7 Professional not&nbsp;genuine&nbsp;copy" or something like that. I can't right
 click, there is no taskbar, nothing. And yes, I have a REAL product key.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then a message pops up saying "Get genuine copy now" so I click that, and then an error box pops up saying Error:&nbsp;0x80070005.&nbsp;<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So what does this mean?? How can I fix windows...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>From booting into the working XP partition, in computer management it says my Windows 7 partition is healthy, and all there. I also checked my documents, pictures etc. and they are all still there as well. What could be the problem? I can take a video
 of what happens during bootup if that would help.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried running startup repair again, and it said "Could not find any problems" so I clicked details, and under all the hard disk checks is said "Completed successfully 1 error: 0x0" and it says that for all the HDD checks.&nbsp;</div>
</span>
<div><br />
</div>
-EDIT 2-</div>
<div>I started the task manager using Ctrl Alt Del, and manually started explorer.exe, now I can see the taskbar and all that, but most of the functions don't work. It says I'm logged on using a temporary profile (I suppose because it thinks windows isn't genuine?)
 &nbsp;&nbsp;

            As long as both Win7 are 32bit, You're good. If by any chance it doesn't work (which I doubted), just find a Win7 Home Premium 32 computer and follow the steps of

            OK, this is weird, I did the repair, I restarted, and Windows 7 boots up fine, comes to the home login screen, I can see both my accounts with my custom avatars (so they must still be there).

<br />Sorry to hear you're experiencing this issue!
<br />
<br />I'm Ramzi, an Independent advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />1st off all, you need to run the WMR system check app and see if the app detect any hardware problem.
<br />Click here to download it :

            I tried with another 5400rpm hard drive that I had lying at home, and I had the same problem. So I tried with another 7200rpm drive I had at home, still the same problem. They are both slow drives, but supposedly faster than mine, and I have seen non-ssd
 builds online that are supposed to work. How can I make sure it'll work? Any other reasons why this could be happening? The computer has never and does not freeze under any other circumstances aside from Windows Mixed Reality, not even HDD benchmarks which
 should push it the most. I have already purchased an SSD because I was planning on doing it anyway, but I want to make sure that it is indeed the problem.

            Hey Bensas,
<br />
<br />What it's strange is that you was using a hdd lower than 5400 rpm !

<p>Well, the SSD didn't work :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC runs really fast now, which is great, but it still hangs completely when I connect the headset and open un the WMR Portal. I tried the headset on my Macbook and it worked fine, so the problem is definitely the PC.</p>

<h2>            Many seemingly unrelated errors at once</h2>
                    <p>Hi! </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After returning from a two week vacation, my brothers computer has started acting up. After startup, it slows to a crawl before freezing altogether. Before this happens, I get a lot of error messages. These include:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Errors and error codes:<br />
MOM.exe - Fatal Error<br />
CLR error: 80004005<br />
This program will now terminate.<br />
-------------<br />
Windows Explorer has stopped working.<br />
-------------<br />
Tablet Driver<br />
The tablet driver is not running.<br />
-------------<br />
CS5ServiceManager.exe - Application Error<br />
The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000006). Click OK to close the application.<br />
-------------<br />
MOM.exe - Bad Image<br />
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\mscoreei.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error.Try installing the application again using the original installation media or contact the system administrator or the software vendor
 for support.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, the Windows Explorer crashes occasionally. These errors appear inconsistently; I get different messages each time I boot it up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All this also happens if the computer is booted in safe mode with networking.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't see the common denominator in these errors. I tried searching the web but found different solutions; one page suggested reinstalling the Microsoft .NET framework, another suggested doing the same with the AMD catalyst, and one page suggested that
 one of these errors is a sign of approaching harddrive failure.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Does someone know what this means?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

            <p>Hi Blue Microwave,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>no software was used to speed up the computer. I guess there's always the chance that a virus is causing this, but I didn't find any indication for that when I searched the error messages on the web.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I attempted to run error checking on the harddrive, but somehow that didn't work: I set up the scan like described in the link you posted with both boxes checked (in safe mode). Then I restarted the computer. After the BIOS screen, a message told me that
 C: was currently being checked for errors. However, that message appeared for less than five seconds before the computer continued booting, without showing any results of the scan :S</p>

<p>Your System Information shows a "Problem Device": <br />
RTL8191S WLAN Adapter USB\VID_13D3PID_3306\00E04C000001 The drivers for this device are not installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install Utility and Driver Auto Installation Program version 1086.48.0809.2011

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the driver and copy it to a folder on your desktop. Write down the path to the folder. If the driver has been zipped you will need to right click on the file and extract to your folder.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next type Device Manager in the Search box above the Start button and press ENTER. Locate and right click on the device and select Properties. Click on the Driver tab and the Update Driver button. Click on “Browse my computer for driver” and click the Browse
 button. Type in the Search box the file path to your folder and click on Next. The system should find the driver in your folder and update. If it does not find the driver recheck that the driver is not zipped.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update the BIOS to version 1.08:<br />

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updating the BIOS is not without risk so back up your data files to external media before downloading. It helps also to print the installation instructions in the previous link before downloading.

<p>Log Name: System <br />
Source: atapi <br />
Date: 16/07/13 10:38:48 <br />
Event ID: 11 <br />
Level: Error <br />
Description: <br />
The driver detected a controller error on \Device\Ide\IdePort2. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error results causes the FREEZE when you boot in normal mode resulting in pressing the user POWER button with an unexpected shut down&nbsp;as the outcome. This problem has existed at least since 5 March 2013. What is strange is that it does not seem to occur
 in safe mode judging by what you say. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is your WDC WD15EARS-00Z5B1 drive still under warranty? My suspicion is you may need&nbsp;a firmware update. I think you should speak to Western Digital about your problem.

            <p>Oh boy, hard drive failure does not sound good..</p>
<p>The computer is 3 years old.</p>
<p>It does not get hot. The fan runs very quietly.</p>
<p>The computer is a tower computer, and has been used on a flat, steady table throughout.</p>
<p>It's speed is mixed: The boot time is very long (the login screen is reached in a "normal" time, though), and browsing with many tabs open is very slow, but recent games run well and generally without hiccups.</p>
<p>The answer to the last question is a definite yes - it crashes often and without warning, showing a broken picture (multicolored snow) on the monitor.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The name of the computer is P7530 D (or MD 8860, both codes belong to the same model).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I will try to update the drivers, but because of the problems the computer is having, that should be tricky. Also, I'd be surprised if this is a driver related issue, especially concerning the WLAN card - my brother has been using a LAN cable and had the
 WLAN deactivated on his computer for about a year now.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm a little anxious about updating the BIOS, though. Backing up data is not really an option right now, not without taking the harddrive out of the tower itself, so I'm going to pass on that one :S</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can't imagine the hard disk still being under warranty, given the age of the machine..</p>

            <p>Hey there, shemy! Looks like you're in the NXOE update. Since you're plugging this in to your Xbox One where it isn't working, you will want to submit feedback through your console, and then check out the Update Preview Forums to see if there might be a known solution there to help you out. Thanks for understanding!</p>

    <title>How can I obtain a replacement copy of Windows 7 64-bit&#63; I have - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seandb11  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I obtain a replacement copy of Windows 7 64-bit&#63; I have lost my disc and only have my 32-bit disc.</h2>
                    When I built my current PC, I purchased a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium to use as the OS, it's working great, but I'm thinking about doing a full system reinstall to fix some things that I messed with I shouldn't have. I originally installed 64-bit, but
 since have lost my 64-bit install disk, and only have the 32-bit disk (I still have the case with the product key). How could I get a new copy of the 64-bit install disk?

<p>
</p><p>Doing what you intend will make system images more cumbersome as they will include all the data as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A system image of the C drive [containing Windows &amp; applications but no data] will be about 30-40GB so can be made quite frequently on an external drive.&nbsp; Such an image would take 20 mins to make and 20-30 mins to restore from.&nbsp; The image could be restored
 in the event of system problems and is a marvellous facility.&nbsp; Whilst I always check my D drive backup is up to date before restoring an image, I have never had any problems restoring the C drive image - my data partition contents have never been disturbed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How big is drive C?&nbsp; </p>
<p>How much space is left on it?</p>
<p>What is stored on it?&nbsp;* </p>
<p>
</p><p>How big is drive D?</p>
<p>How much space is left on it?</p>
<p>What is stored on it?&nbsp;* </p>
<p>

            <p>"Logical partition" doesn't sound right for Windows.&nbsp; You probably mean "Logical drive."<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows has "primary partitions" and "extended partitions."&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A primary partition that has the operating system on it is an "active partition."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Windows permits up to 4 primary partitions on a "basic disk."</p>
<p>
</p><p>An extended partition can be subdivided into "logical drives."&nbsp; There can be an "unlimited" number of logical drives on an extended partition (until you run out of drive letters).</p>
<p>
</p><p>See <a href="http://www.theeldergeek.com/hard_drives_01.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.theeldergeek.com/hard_drives_01.htm</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand your description, the system has a single hard drive that has both a primary partition (C:) and an extended partition.&nbsp; The extended partition contains one logical drive (D:).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Putting aside the issue of saving the data that is now in the D: drive, when you delete the D:
<strong>logical drive</strong>, you just create "free space" within the extended partition (which doesn't have a name).&nbsp; You then have to delete the extended partition in order to create "unallocated space" into which you can then expand the C: partition.</p>

 in the event of system problems and is a marvellous facility.&nbsp; Whilst I always check my D drive backup is up to date before restoring an image, I have never had any problems restoring the C drive image - my data partition contents have never been disturbed.</p>

<p>"Logical partition" doesn't sound right for Windows.&nbsp; You probably mean "Logical drive."<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows has "primary partitions" and "extended partitions."&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A primary partition that has the operating system on it is an "active partition."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Windows permits up to 4 primary partitions on a "basic disk."</p>
<p>
</p><p>An extended partition can be subdivided into "logical drives."&nbsp; There can be an "unlimited" number of logical drives on an extended partition (until you run out of drive letters).</p>

</p><p>See <a href="http://www.theeldergeek.com/hard_drives_01.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.theeldergeek.com/hard_drives_01.htm</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand your description, the system has a single hard drive that has both a primary partition (C:) and an extended partition.&nbsp; The extended partition contains one logical drive (D:).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Putting aside the issue of saving the data that is now in the D: drive, when you delete the D:
<strong>logical drive</strong>, you just create "free space" within the extended partition (which doesn't have a name).&nbsp; You then have to delete the extended partition in order to create "unallocated space" into which you can then expand the C: partition.</p>

<p>How do I do that as the options in Windows are greyed out?<br />

            <p>Tommy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion is that you&nbsp;use the repartitioning advice the others are providing you to make C drive 100GB and to use the rest as a new D drive.&nbsp; [In addition to Computer Management, I have used
<a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">EaseUS partitioning tool</a> even though it has some annoying interface elements and Paragon also provide a free
<a href="http://www.paragon-software.com/home/pm-express/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Partition manager</a>&nbsp;that I have not tried.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>You then go to <em>C:\Users\EachUserName</em> and "relocate" the user folders to the D drive.&nbsp; [To see what I man, just have a look at
<em>C:\Users\EachUserName\Documents </em>/<em> My Documents</em> and right-click, Properties, Location tab - this is what you want to alter for each of the user folders.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start&nbsp;the procedure by creating a D:\Documents folder &amp; moving&nbsp;the data files into it.&nbsp; Then set the Location tab in C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em>\Documents to point to D:\Documents.&nbsp; Then set the access permissions for D:\Documents to the appropriate user
 by right-clicking on it &amp; selecting <em>Share with</em>, <em>Specific people</em> or right-clicking on it &amp; selecting
<em>Properties </em>then the <em>Sharing </em>tab.&nbsp; Then repeat the procedure for the other folders</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">possible folder paths</span> [these are the ones I decided on]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Documents&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D:\Documents</p>
<p>Music&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D:\Documents\Music, </p>
<p>Pictures&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D:\Documents\Pictures, </p>
<p>Videos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D:\Documents\Videos, </p>
<p>Favorites&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D:\SystemSettings*\Favorites [these are IE Favorites],
</p>
<p>Links&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D:\SystemSettings*\Links [these are the entries within Windows Explorer, Favorites],</p>
<p>Searches&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D:\SystemSettings*\Searches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[* <em>It just suited my backup plan to separate these settings into&nbsp;a different folder group</em>.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The separation of your data files from your OS &amp; its applications does not just free up space, it also allows you to make regular system images of the C:\ drive that are almost certainly going to be 40GB or so [and only take 20-odd minutes to do].&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would give you excellent disaster recovery capabilities as your response to serious system corruption could then simply be to boot from&nbsp;a
<em>System repair disk</em> or Windows 7 installation USB/DVD and restore that image, i.e. restore the system drive, to exactly what was on it at the time the image was made.&nbsp; This restoration also only takes about 20-30 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did this a couple of years ago and would never configure my system any other way now.&nbsp; I had previously&nbsp;only regarded system images as a tool that IT departments used.&nbsp; I now make regular system images on external drives and can therefore recover from
 disasters reliably &amp; quickly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>With separate system &amp; datafile drives, you would continue to make straightforward file backups of your own files on D:\ using Windows Backup or any of the other utilities available for that task.</em></p>

            <p>Because you have not created the necessary space by deleting the D drive volume first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a full procedure for you:-</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Repartitioning your hard drive</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You’ll need admin permissions for most of these tasks so it’s easiest to just log on as Admin now.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><span>I had no problems with this stage but it is a risky one.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I had a high level of confidence because of the preparations I’d made [installation USB made &amp; tested, full system image made, all user files copied to an external drive].</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>If anything goes wrong you can try again or can just get out of it all then boot from your Repair Disk / Windows 7 installation disk &amp; restore the entire system from one of your images then start again.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Type “management” into the Start menu search box then right-click on “Computer management” &amp; select Run as Admin.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You need to do this even though you have logged in to an Admin account when starting Windows [</span><em><span>this might be why you reported options being greyed out before</span></em><span>].</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Click on the help icon on the toolbar [</span><em><span>this is an additional Help file not the standard Windows Help</span></em><span> - this file can also be found at C:\Windows\Help\mui\0409\diskmgt.CHM without opening Computer Management].</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>In the Help file, select Disk management, Manage basic volumes - read Extend a basic volume and Shrink a basic volume [including the final part about “Additional considerations”].</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I could not find a section on deleting a volume but reading these other two sections made me comfortable enough to proceed.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">1.</span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Partition the hard drive</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In Computer management itself, click on Disk management, then select your D:\ drive.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Right-click on it, select Delete volume....</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This all went so smoothly that I’ve made no notes about any further dialog boxes for this stage of the procedure.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Still in Computer management, Disk management, select your C:\ drive.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Right-click on the C:\ drive &amp; select Extend volume...</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>The system will then calculate what it can extend into &amp; offer you the chance to do it.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>It will show you the maximum you can extend it by.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><em><span>Note that it will ask you how much to extend it </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>by</span></span><span> and it will calculate the resultant size – it’s not asking you what to extend it
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>to</span></span><span>.</span></em><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I suggest that you extend it by enough to get the C drive to 100GB since you have the space to do that [I made mine 70GB but many people say that can be risky even though I have had no problems].</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This all went so smoothly that I’ve made no notes about any further dialog boxes for this stage of the procedure.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Still in Computer management, Disk management, select the unused space where your D:\ drive used to be.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Right-click on it &amp; select Create a new partition &amp; let it use the whole of the available space.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><em><span>Once again, this all went so smoothly that I’ve made no notes about any further dialog boxes for this stage of the procedure – I think that formatting the new partition then assigning a drive letter happened as part of this stage but
 I might have had to do them separately straight afterwards [again just by right-clicking then selecting from the context menu].</span><span><span>&nbsp;
