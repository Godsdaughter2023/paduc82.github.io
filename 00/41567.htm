<h2>            XBox One settings won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>"Wait a full minute, then give it another try."&nbsp; If you keep seeing this, press the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide.&nbsp; Go to System and choose Restart, then try your action again. (0x80070bfa)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done this 3 times, rebooted it, and still no change.&nbsp; I'm trying to access the console settings but it won't allow any access.&nbsp; Is there a bug in effect?</p>

            Hi, with the Xbox powered on press and hold the power button for around 10 seconds, when the Xbox powers off wait for maybe 5 seconds and then power on again. Should that not work then try again but this time pull the power cord out of the back of the
 Xbox for 30 seconds, reconnect the power cord and power on again.

<p>Hi! As mentioned, a power cycle/hard reset is different from a normal restart. See this link for more info:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the hard reset still doesn't work, do&nbsp;a factory reset with keeping your games and apps (so that you don't have to install them again):

<p><strong>Okay i have read many threads about problems that are almost like mine. However this one is one step worse. I got this new acer 24" full-hd display and I connected it to my computer (OS windows 7) and everything worked great. The display adjusted
 itself to the right resolution (1920x1080) and it looked great... For a week or so I used my computer as usual and without problems until one day when the electricity went out and my computer got shut down.. now when I rebooted it, the screen resolution had
 changed to 1440x900, and I can't get it back to 1920x1080! Why is that? how can it suddenly change itself? And when i go to "change screen resolution" the maximum resolution available is 1600x1200.. where did 1920x1080 go?? please help me. I've tried everything
 i could come up with.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>As some extra info that maybe could help I might add that when the electricity went out I was currently playing an old game with resolutions on 1024x768...</strong></p>

            Download the latest WHQL drivers for your video card and save these to disk<br />
<br />
Boot into Safe Mode <br />
<br />
Uninstall the Monitor "entry" from Device Manager<br />
<br />
Uninstall the "installed" video card drivers.<br />
<br />
Reboot into the "standard" Windows modem<br />
<br />
Install the new video card drivers and then attempt to adjust the resolutions.<br />

            Ok.. so I tried what you told me to, but it didn't work. I tried many times in different variations but it never worked... In the "change screen resolution" meny, the maximum resoultion available is still 1600x1200... Don't know if this information could
 be helpful but in the same meny right above where you change the resolution, there is another box that is named "Display:"... in it stands "generic non PnP monitor"... &nbsp;could this have something to do with why I can't get the resolution right??

            Check with Acer's web site and see if you can get a "better" driver for the monitor.&nbsp; Generic PnP monitor "might" be limited.&nbsp; This was the same on my Acer 22inch LCD until the x223w driver was installed.

            <p>Hi Vakio</p>
<p>I just stumbled across your post here not sure if you&nbsp;ever resolved it. Your issed as stated occured after that power outage so my thoughts are either something got scrambled, or damaged. A couple of questions.</p>
<p>1. Is this a single port video card or more than one? If so try switch that same cable to the other port and see if you get the same result. (does the problem follow)</p>
<p>2. How are you connected, DVI or HDMI cable? If you have another cable lying around try changing the cable it could have gotten damaged during that power outage as silly as that sounds.
</p>
<p>3. Have you contact ACER.? The EID in the monitor (what identifies the monitor to the video card) could have gotten scrambled and can usually be reset with a firmware&nbsp;update (not driver)&nbsp;from Acer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this was helpful or maybe you already figured it out, if so drop me a quick line to let me know I am curious.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><br />
If you use to be able to run 1920x1080 graphics through VGA and all of a sudden its not working, or you reinstalled windows do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1: Make sure your video card is up to day</p>
<p>2: Make sure your computer is set to "Projector Only" by holding down "Windows key + P" and selecting projector only .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is set to Duplicate only your tv will only display the maxium graphic settings your standard 15.4" or 17" screen can handle on the laptop</p>

                    <p>
</p><p>Hi, when upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 I am getting the following message: 0x80070428 - 0x3001A - The installation failed in the FIRST_BOOT phase with an error during BEGIN_FIRST_BOOT operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the install over a dozen times now, using the MCT, an ISO, Windows Update. I have tried resetting Windows Update, removing all USB devices, upgrading all drivers and firmware. PC is an HP 800 Elite - Corei7 - 16Gb RAM - 256Gb SSD. I have upgraded
 over 150 PCs on our domain with exactly the same build with no issues. The only software on it are printer drivers, iTunes, Office 2016,&nbsp;MS Intune, Samsung Xchange, all of which upgraded fine on other PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of the 150 PCs, I have only had 2 upgrade failures, just this one happens to be our Managing Directors's PC, so it is quite urgent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Dan.</p>

<h2>            Purchasing a game on game pass. and then not renewing my game pass</h2>
                    I'm wondering if I get the Xbox game pass, purchase sea of thieves or any game, and then cancel or don't renew my game pass, will I still be able to play the game I purchased without the game pass.&nbsp;

            Do you get a discount on all Gamepass games if you decide to buy them? If so, could you use the 14 day Gamepass trial and then buy a game or 2 with a small discount?

    <title>Toshiba Satellite updating from windows 8 to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin d legg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toshiba Satellite updating from windows 8 to windows 10</h2>
                    Hi, I recently acquired a Toshiba satellite L75D A7283. I reset it to factory settings which is Windows 8, and then tried to upgrade to windows 10 using the free online version. The installation seemed to go fine, but when I restart to complete the installation
 it freezes on the Toshiba splash screen. Im wondering if the problem is because I didnt allow windows 8 to update before I upgraded to 10, I went from the fresh factory install straight to the upgrade. Theres 188 important updates that im now letting it do
 before I attempt the upgrade again. I dont know if this is the problem or not any ideas or help would be much appreciated, thank you.

<h3> david umpteen  say:</h3>
<h2>            My computer can&#39;t connect to the internet.</h2>
                    <p>My computer generally hasn't been able to connect to the internet for the past week. I was able to connect once Friday, but made the mistake of turning off the computer. Now I restart the computer occasionally, but it doesn't connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm hardwired to a DSL router. My computer's "Local Area Connection" works when I start the computer. When I turn the router off, I get the message "Local Area Connection&nbsp; A network cable is unplugged". When I turn the router on, the connection doesn't resume
 until I restart the computer. I've tried typing 19.168.0.1 into the browser, but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to "Diagnose Connection Problem" in Internet Explorer, I am told to check all the cables and turn the browser off and on. When I continue to the next step, I get a "Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library" error message: "Runtime Error!&nbsp; Program:
 C:\WINDOWS\Network Diagnostic\xpnetdiag.exe&nbsp; This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application's support team for more information." I don't know whether the diagnostic problem&nbsp;is the same&nbsp;as my inability
 to connect, or a separate problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have another computer that has no problem connecting wirelessly&nbsp;when the router is on. I am told I am not connected when I turn the router off, so I know I'm using&nbsp;my own wireless&nbsp;connection rather than a neighbor's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions are appreciated, for solutions I can try without a connection, or for things I might try if the connection temporarily resumes again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Let’s follow these methods &amp; check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may try to perform system restore which will restore back the computer to the point when it was working fine.</span></p>

            <p>I should have answered Debleena's initial question earlier. I'm trying to think what all software and hardware changes I've made.</p>
<p><br />
Probably the big one was recently plugging in a USB hub.&nbsp; I have been using it for a while.&nbsp; I usually plug it in to 2 USB ports, one for the actual USB connection and the other for extra power.&nbsp;Sometimes it works fine, sometimes the computer doesn't&nbsp;detect
 it, and sometimes the computer makes a high-pitched hum when I plug in the hub's power cable to the second USB port. Almost 2 weeks ago, when I plugged in the power cable, the computer switched off. I don't know what damage was done to the hardware or software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then had to re-activate Windows because of that.&nbsp; I've also replaced system restore, because that hadn't been working properly for months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that's everything.&nbsp; I hope someone can suggest what I can try next.</p>

Have you tried booting into <a href="http://bertk.mvps.org/html/safemode.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode with Networking?</a> If you are able to connect in that mode then chances are one of the startup programs are preventing the connection in Normal Mode.<br />

    <title>Strict NAT on ATT mobile hotspot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mottley78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strict NAT on ATT mobile hotspot</h2>
                    
<p>I have a ATT unite pro mobile hotspot that is my only internet option for where I live (near the city so i have good speed but off the road enough that don't have cable). &nbsp;I can play my Xbox one online and have great speeds however i have a strict NAT that
 limits me joining some games and chatting. &nbsp;I have tried doing port forwarding, uPNP, and using dmz all without any change in NAT. &nbsp;I have&nbsp;done these with a static ip. &nbsp;Since it is through ATT and basically using cell phone internet is it even possible to
 ever get an open NAT? &nbsp;when i do the detailed network statistics it says I am behind a port-symmetric NAT. &nbsp;Can anyone tell me if it is possible to get the NAT open for this ATT hotspot and if so how?</p>
<p>Thank for your time and help</p>

<p>G'day Mottley, sorry to hear about the connection troubles. Unfortunately mobile hotspots are not too flexible when it comes to setting the NAT type and opening ports, so the connection tends to stay moderate or strict. It's one reason why we don't recommend
 using hotspots for an Xbox Live connection. Officially I recommend you look into obtaining a home network, but if that's not possible then you may also want to play around with other hotspot devices to see if one yields better results.</p>

<p>Hey there, Mottley. Like Mrs. Joust said, mobile hotspots are not a recommended (or supported) connection type for your Xbox. This is for two reasons. First off, the nature of a cellular signal does not provide a stable enough platform to allow for smooth
 gameplay. Next (and more specific to your issue) a lot of cellular networks do what we call "back-end NATting". Unfortunately there is no way for you to change that. It is not a setting that you have any control over. It is performed on the cellular network
 side, and cell provider won't make those kinds of adjustments. I wish I had better news for you.</p>

<p>I feel your pain! &nbsp;I'm in the same situation using an AT&amp;T hotspot. &nbsp;I hate it when someone says to get a better network. &nbsp;They have no clue how hard that is out in the sticks. &nbsp;As far as stability goes, my hotspot is more stable than other isp's I've had.
 &nbsp;I get a good LTE signal and I have gotten speeds up to 40.0 mbps down and 20.0 up with a low ping! &nbsp;The average is 10.0 - 15.0. &nbsp;But the NAT problem is a pain and it does cause issues when gaming. &nbsp;I can get an open NAT on my xbox 360 but never on my xbox
 one with my hotspot. &nbsp;So that tells me its just as much a problem with the xbox one as it is using a hotspot. &nbsp;I wish I could tell you how to fix it. &nbsp;I've worked hard on finding a solution the past few months.</p>

</p><p>I had to reset my Copy of windows 10. After the reset I put my 3 different email accounts back in the mail app. Now I haave to use a drop down menu to see the different accounts. Before the reset they all showed on the left hand side. My other computer still
 shows them all. Is this a setting (if it is I can't find where to change it). I like to be able to glance and see that I have 10 emails in Outlook and 20 in gmail.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for coming back to us with the details.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At first, I suggest you to check if any Windows update is pending. If yes, install all the Windows updates.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type <strong>update</strong> on Windows search bar and select <strong>Check for updates.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on Windows update on the left pane and click on <strong>Check for updates</strong> button.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, let’s try un-installing and re-install the mail app and check. Follow the below steps to un-install the app.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type Windows in the search box and right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type <strong><span>get-appxpackage *microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps* | remove-appxpackage</span></strong> on the PowerShell and hit Enter.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Once you uninstall the app, you can install it from Windows store.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that does not helps, I suggest you to create a new user account and check what the status is.</span></p>

            <p>I'm not hired by Microsoft, but yet I solved the problem last week on my own.<br />
<br />
I had to re-install Windows 10. It'll upgrade all your standard apps, including the Mail app to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">17.6769.40891.0.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The drawback with this method, however, is that all the apps you downloaded will be gone, and any email address accounts you had associated with those apps will have to be inputted again.<br />
<br />
An inconvenience but I ended up getting the latest available Mail app back on my PC.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</span></p>

<p>But when the computer restarts the problem happens again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sfc scan only allows it be work once it's been started or finished. Looking for a long term solutions with instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi AshleySamuels,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />If the issue persists can you provide the following information which may help determine any issue(s): 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type msinfo32 in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .nfo file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site. 
<br />
<br />Also, can you do the following: 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type eventvwr in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .evtx file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site. 
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:

<h2>            Blue screen error &#34;Bad Pool Caller and Page Fault in NonPaged Area.&#34;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Titile: Blue Screen on Shutdown</strong></p>
<p>It seems that every time I go to shut down my W7x64, I get one of 2 types of BSODs: either Bad Pool Caller and Page Fault in NonPaged Area. After the crash, after the restart,&nbsp; I can shutdown right away, but it takes about 2 or 3 minutes (on an SSD).<br />
<br />
If some one who can make sense out of dumps (it's greek to me, although I think greek would be easier to learn), I would really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
http://www.mediafire.com/?7f66g0dvmk0ndzs<br />
<br />
The research I've done all says it probably a driver, but how can I find WHICH driver is causing the problem?
<br />
Before I pull out the rest of my hair, maybe some brain that can understand a mindump can point me in the right direction.<br />
<br />
THANK YOU!!<br />
<br />
Tanger<br />

            <p>Hi Tanger,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the dump file, it appears that the issue could be with truecrypt.sys and ntoskrnl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>File truecrypt.sys is located in the folder C:\Windows\System32\drivers. Known file sizes on Windows 7/XP are 192,960 bytes (18% of all occurrence), 188,672 bytes and 12 more variants.
<br />
</p>
<p>Ntoskrnl is the kernel image for the family of Microsoft Windows NT operating systems. It provides the Kernel and Executive layers of the Windows NT kernel space, and is responsible for various system services such as hardware virtualization, process and
 memory management, etc., thus making it a fundamental part of the system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Were there any changes made in the Computer prior to the start of this issue?<br />
<br />
<strong>I would suggest you to try the methods mentioned below.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Check for the issue in a clean boot state. To do so, follow the steps as mentioned below.<br />
a. Click Start, type “msconfig.exe” (without quotes) in the Start Search box, and then press Enter to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
b. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box.<br />
c. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> If the issue does not occur then, follow this article to find out the cause if the issue.</p>
<p><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</p>
<p>Note: Make sure you put the computer back to Normal Startup once you are done.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> Update the chipset, video card, display and network adapter drivers to the latest by visiting the computer manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a><br />

<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> You may also scan your computer from Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.<br />
The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>

<h2>            Wireless Driver keeps disappearing in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have Hp pavilion laptop </p>
<p>product ID 00326-10000-00000-AA035</p>
<p>windows edition Window 10 Home version 1607</p>
<p>bought it with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Wireless network name Broadcom BCM43142 802.11 bgn</p>
<p>
</p><p>everything was okay until few weeks my Wireless driver started disappearing first thing I did was &nbsp;restarted my laptop and everything was back to normal. But not even half an hour later it disappeared again I tried to restart my laptop again it didn't worked
 this time so I tried every recovery possible. Nothing. Then I tried to reinstalling windows 8.1 and the problem passed on to it. So I installed windows 10 again. Problem still here. I tried to driver update, command prompt, manually uninstall and install wireless
 driver. Nothing works. Only thing that works is laptop reset and even that don't work all the time. At times that it does work I have less then an half an hour after that wireless icon gets yellow triangle and then it is replaced with ethernet icon with red
 x and screen freezes. Can anyone help me please.</p>

<h2>            How do I allocate unused disk space to my existing C&#58; drive to leave me with one HDD&#63;</h2>
                    I have an existing hard drive (C:) to which I would like to add the 120GB of unallocated space on my netbook. I'm using Windows 7 starter and so far all the answers I've found are related to partitions. I already have the small drive labelled "System"
 and another small drive labelled "Healthy recovery partition". I would like to have all my other available memory allocated to the C: drive but I'm having great difficulty achieving this. I should point out that I'm pretty technically inept and so I would
 really appreciate any help you could give me. Thanks.

            <p>You can only do this if the unallocated space is contiguous with the original C drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press the Windows key +R to open the Run box and enter<strong> diskmgmt.msc</strong> to open Disk Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the lower box check the layout of the drive. If the "Recovery" partition lies between the C "System" drive and your unallocated space then the drive cannot be extended into it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your alternative is to create another partition in the unallocated space and use the Location tab in many of the user profile directories to relocate them to the new partition to free up space on the C drive.</p>

<h2>            Ipod nano 6 gen not detected</h2>
                    Hi I have an Alienware M14 running windows 7. I just got an iPod Nano 6 gen and installed iTunes. My computer&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;the device. I have never had an issue like this. I have uninstalled and&nbsp;re installed&nbsp;iTunes and rebooted several times and still
 nothing. I have used 2 used cables and just bought a new one and still nothing. I have also tried my other 2 ports. Stillllll nothing. It does charge very well though. I have posted this same question over on apples web site a week ago with no&nbsp;response, so
 I hope people are smarter here. Thanks for any help.&nbsp;

<p><span>c. Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers</span></p>

<p>Turn on the computer. After the Gateway BIOS logo appears, repeatedly press the F8 key. The Advanced Boot Options menu opens.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do not say why you need to reinstall the Operating System.</p>
<p>If you have problems using the Gateway Recovery methods, you may have a Hardware problem.</p>

</p><p>There are several factors that affect the resolution of the video. These includes the image quality of the video itself, the capabilities of the player, the cable used to transmit the video signal from the device to the screen, and the capabilities of the

<p><span><span>Ok, from now on, I'll be posting a guide a Side Quest and a Unmarked Quest in this topic, to help those of us who are a little stuck. In total, their are 80 side quests, but
 some of them are those stupid "Dont Tread On The Bear!" style quests, and their are 80 unmarked quests, but some of them have multiple parts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All the information that I will use will come from personal experience and information courtesy of

<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Side Quest: Classic Inspiration</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This quest will be given when you first enter Michael Angelo's Workshop, located in the southwest corner of the New Vegas Strip, opposite the NCR Embassy. You'll be instructed to talk to Michael
 Angelo, or Sheldon Weintraub, brother of the chick who hangs out at Vault 21. He'll seem pretty stressed, which the player can make worse by passing a few skill checks. The player can continue to bully him for Xp and Caps through a 50 Speech skill check, or
 use a 55 Medicine check to start the quest. You don't have to pass the skill check, just select that option.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It appears that Michael (*Cough* Sheldon) is running out of inspiration, and will enlist the player to go find him some, as his isloated time in the Vault has made him "Scared" of the outside
 world. He wants the player to take pictures of signs around the Mojave to give him inspiration. To do so, he'll gove the player 24 Camera Film and a very special Codac R9000. You'll need to take pictures of these five landmarks:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>The Dinosaur Thermometer in Novac</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>The Bison sign on the roof of the Bison Steve Hotel in Primm</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>The sign above the entrance of Camp McCarren</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>The sign above the main doors of HELIOS One</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>The big bottle at the Sunset Sarsaparilla Headquarters</span></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>When you have taken a picture of one landmark, you can return to recieve upto 200 Caps. After all pictures have been taken you can return and recieve 500 - 5000 caps, based on quality of photo.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Successful photos earn 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 Xp immediately. Completion of this quest results in an additional 200 Xp, giving the player a total of 950 Xp.</span></span></p>
<p><br />
<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Unmarked Quest: Suites You, Sarah</span></span></p>
<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Unmarked Quest: Suites You, Sarah</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To start this quest, the player will have to talk to Sarah Weintraub at Vault 21, and after following through the right dialougue tree, you can offer to fetch Vault jumpsuits
 for her. This will result in Caps, Strip Reputation and a discounted stay at Vault 21. But she will not accept jumpsuits stolen from guest rooms in the Vault. After passing a Barter check of 65, you can give her Boomer Jumpsuits and Flightsuits, a stockpile
 of which can be found at the Nellis AFB. Vault 11 suits can be found in the Vault 11 Living Quarters, around 20 or so can be found in there. Vault 3 suits can be purchased from Mick &amp; Ralph, they'll have around 1-4, but they don't restock them. For a full
 list of locations, follow <a href="http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Vault_jumpsuit_%28Fallout:_New_Vegas%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> link.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After bringing her the 30 Vault Suits, upon revisting she'll mention "missing" the player charcter. You will be then able to, you know, woohoo, with her as you both "Catch
 Up" with one another. Doing this will give the player a "Well-Rested" bonus, which is no longer surprisingly absent from the beds she usually offers. Also, after passing two speech checks, 50 and 75 respectively, she will agree to such acts after recieving
 suits, inclusing Boomer suits.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You have to go to your room (which is the room left to Sarah's room) after work hours and she teleports to your room immediately. If you also put a sexy sleepwear in her inventory,
 she wears it for you. If you remove her vault 21 jumpsuit while she is still sleeping she will put on any other form of clothing you put in her inventory but won't remove it again.

 I need to reenter credentials 2 dozen times -- apparently once for each file or folder on the shared drive, but once done, future access is easy.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are IE9 settings in Security or other Internet Options that need to be relaxed to make this work, I am fine with that (I am speculating that the problem may be related to attempts by MS to close holes in IE with the upgrade to IE9).</p>

Nevermind.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Tech Support at HP (where I bought my new laptop) was able to provide a solution from their knowledge base within 2 hours.&nbsp; 3 steps and the problem is solved.&nbsp; In short: 1. enable Webclient service (not sure why that's not enabled by default?)&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Add the
 domain name for your SharePoint site to the IE9 Trusted Sites area.&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Change the data value in a registry key for WebClient&nbsp;(BasicAuthLevel = 2 (default is 1) ).</p>
<p>Not sure why MIcrosoft couldn't provide this solution...?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
From what I remember, the Alienware 14 does NOT have a number pad, therefore there is no num lock, etc. You'll need to either purchase an external PS/2 or USB keyboard, OR you can map NUM LOCK to a different key or set of keys using 3rd party software (most
 use Sharpkeys) - <a href="http://sharpkeys.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sharpkeys.codeplex.com/</a><br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<h2>            Xbox One&#58;  ESP &#40;Microsoft Complete&#41; Nightmare</h2>
                    
<p>Before I begin, I want to give you a little background. &nbsp;Since the day the Playstation platform came out, I have owned each one of them and at times multiple consoles of the same generation. &nbsp;I was an avid Playstation gamer and was a dedicated loyal customer
 to them. &nbsp;I never owned an XBOX, nor a Wii for that matter. &nbsp;This all changed this past week. &nbsp; I had pre-ordered the PS4 and went to the midnight launch here locally in Fort Worth TX. &nbsp;I went home, plugged it all in, played Killzone for all of 5 mins and
 played around with the PS OS for about 10 more minutes. &nbsp;Moments later, it all went on Craigslist and sold within hours. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;I HATED it. &nbsp;I won't go into detail - it's really only my opinion, but it was enough to make this loyal customer make the decision
 to switch. &nbsp;Enough was enough.</p>
<p>Fast track to yesterday. &nbsp;I picked up an Xbox One the night before last NIB. &nbsp;Yesterday, I got it all setup and couldn't have been more pleased - and I still haven't even played any of my games. &nbsp;I decided this was the console for me. &nbsp;I even thought to
 myself - what have I been missing? &nbsp;So yesterday, in a matter of 1 hour, I posted my PS3 setup on Craigslist for a straight up trade for a 360 for our bedroom (so I can play NHL14 with a buddy online). &nbsp;Again - couldn't be happier. &nbsp;Shame on me for not ever
 even trying the XBOX platform. &nbsp;Needless to say - I am here to stay!</p>

<p>Now - here is my issue and I encourage all of you to be careful how you do the Extended Warranty program. &nbsp;According to this website (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/warranties-and-repair/complete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/warranties-and-repair/complete</a>)
 a 3 year extended warranty for my XBOX one though a few avenues:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can purchase Microsoft Complete when you purchase your Xbox product at a Microsoft Store location or through an online retailer.
</li><li>You can purchase Microsoft Complete by contacting a Microsoft Store support agent. To do this, go to the<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store website</a>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<b>Contact us</b>&nbsp;to find a regional sales number.
</li><li>You can purchase Microsoft Complete directly from Microsoft through the&nbsp;<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/pages/managedevice.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Online Service Center</a>.
</li></ul>
<div>I logged into my XBOX account, registered my XBOX One and Kinect and all showed devices showed up on there just fine. &nbsp;It's when I went to "Buy and ESP" that things got out of hand. &nbsp;I tried 4 different PC's, all different browsers and each time I selected
 the device I wanted to buy the ESP for, it took me to "Register your device" screen again. &nbsp;When I tried to enter the serial number again to register the device (keep in mind I had done this already) it tells me "I cannot register the device because it is
 already registered to me". &nbsp;For 4 hours I tried, nothing would work. &nbsp;I decided I would take route two - calling the Microsoft Store. &nbsp;I mean, how bad could this be?</div>

<div>Of course, not to be rude or anything, but the lady who answered was VERY difficult to understand. &nbsp;However, after taking my information and such - she was able to buy the Microsoft Complete ESP for my XBOX One - but went so fast that after it was all
 said and done it dawned on me - she never asked for the serial number of my XBOX One. &nbsp;When I asked her how a purchase like this could be completed without knowing the device name - she said it would show up on my account after the Standard Warranty expired.
 &nbsp;I logged into my XBOX account and went to devices - and didn't see any extended warranty applied to my XBOX One. &nbsp;She assured me not to worry. &nbsp;I went a few hours bothered by this and thought I would give XBOX Chat Support a buzz and find out for sure. &nbsp;Long
 story short they didn't see any extended warranty applied/bought for my XBOX One. &nbsp;They said I would need to call or chat with Microsoft Store support - so I went to their chat. &nbsp;Long story short, my order is there with the Microsoft Store and their support
 told me over and over I had to go back to XBOX Support and have them apply the warranty yo my device. &nbsp;Back and forth back and forth I go. &nbsp;All the while having the chat transcripts emailed to me. &nbsp;</div>

<div>I had XBOX Support escalate the case (they told me they did last night and even gave me a case number). &nbsp;I was told I would be contacted by a supervisor by email or phone within 30 minutes. &nbsp;That didn't happen. &nbsp;So today, I got back chat with XBOX Support
 (on with them now). &nbsp; Nothing had been done when I gave them the case ticket number. &nbsp;Again - they kept telling me I had to work with MS Store Support. &nbsp;I showed them the chat scripts and am stuck at a stand still.</div>

<div>During this time, I thought I would give the website a try again. &nbsp;I went to my devices and found that the standard warranty date had changed (but still no ESP). &nbsp;Yesterday, the Standard Warranty showed 2/21/15. &nbsp;Today, it is showing 11/25/14. &nbsp;Very weird.
 &nbsp;So I thought I would give buying the ESP on the website another shot. &nbsp;Doing exactly the same thing I did so many times yesterday I selected my device and am apparently able to buy the ESP now on the website.</div>

<div>What the hell do I have to do here to get this resolved? &nbsp;Support in both cases has been nothing but a waste of time. &nbsp;I bought a Microsoft Complete warranty for nothing apparently. &nbsp;Do I need to call MS Store and cancel the MS Complete I bought from them
 and attempt to buy the ESP from the XBOX website now?</div>

<div>Very upset I am even here posting this - but it has to be done. &nbsp;</div>

<p>Now I am quite pissed. &nbsp;The link I gave everyone above says three years. &nbsp;Even the lady who barely spoke English said 3 years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go through the motions on the website now, its changed to 2 years for $69.99, not three years. &nbsp;WTF! &nbsp;See below:</p>
<p>Microsoft Complete - Xbox One - 2 Year</p>
<p>Covers hardware issues for 2 years from date of device purchase. In the event of a device malfunction, plan provides an Advanced Exchange replacement option at no additional charge (no upfront charge; credit card hold required and charges apply if original
 unit is not returned). Also covers up to 2 controller replacements during the coverage period. Exclusions apply. Review contract terms and conditions for details. USD 69.99</p>

<p>Been through exact same.</p>
<p>i was worries it was 2 but its actually 3.</p>
<p>i also originally bought through Microsoft store via telephone and support could not see it so i panicked. re-rang lots of times and they never saw it.</p>
<p>in the end i cancel my uk store one and reorder via 'my service xbox'.</p>
<p>now its shows up for 3 years.</p>
<p>only problem is uk store (the one i cancelled only charged me the correct amount as advertised, but 'my services xbox' charges me VAT on top of that price (the weird thing is my invoice from uk store said vat included at the correct advertised price, so
 to me it looks like we are being charged twice on VAT</p>

<p>lol the ps4 is way better , you are crazy selling it for a x1 . I have both and the games are a down grade and most companies have already stated that the games will be made on the ps4 and then ported over , 1000 times longer to install , plus nothing works
 so we have to wait for stuff to be patched in , you deserve any bad luck you get for pulling off a stupid move.</p>

<p>Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.</p>
<p>Personally i never play my PS3, but frequently play my 360. I have even sold PS3 games and re bought them on the 360 as they just felt better (controller / achievements etc)</p>
<p>I went from PS1 to N64 and back to PS1.</p>
<p>There are no wrong or stupid decisions, you just go on what feels right at that particular point in time (gut feeling).
</p>
<p>Whether you decided against it later in hindsight does not make any early decision stupid (just lack of being able to predict the future - which i nor anyone i know can do).</p>
<p>The jury is still out there for which is better. I'm voting for X1.</p>

<p>Well i hope the op don't live in the uk &nbsp;?as the uk has totally been shafted by Microsoft. &nbsp;High RRP 429.00 with limited features, it might have a better game line up then the PS4 but not one site has stated any of these new machines are worth getting as
 yet. &nbsp;Enjoy your 360 as obviously the 360 is a far better console right now with a decent back catalog of games to play on it. &nbsp;Yesterday new pics was posted up on the net of the new Steam box does look quite interesting. &nbsp;It will be interesting to see how
 it has a impact on the console market. &nbsp;Current gen is the way forward right now till the next generation start having a bigger impact in the market.</p>

<p>Kish,</p>
<p>I'll tell you what. &nbsp;When you move out of your mothers basement, pay for the console yourself and get an education (you can't type for ***), then I will reconsider going back.</p>
<p>Until then, choosing the XBOX One over the PS4 is still my solid choice. &nbsp;It's customer service that sucks - but that's true for any company nowadays. &nbsp;To each his own, but please leave this thread. &nbsp;You have not anything beneficial to anything said here.

</p><p>I have been troubleshooting this for weeks and am now bald from ripping my hair out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer: Dell <span>Inspiron 537s Slim Desktop<strong> &nbsp;</strong></span>w/ Pentium Dual-Core CPU E5200 @250GHz</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network Card: Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller (checked it out several times, via Windows, it is functioning properly)</p>
<p>System: Windows 7 Home Premium, 64bit w/ Service Pack 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Router: Netgear N600 Model #: WNDR3400v2</p>
<p>Cable Router: Motorola SBV5220 Surfboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now several months ago, this desktop once again had SOME programs lose the capability of accessing the internet over a cable ethernet connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effected programs:</p>
<p>MS Internet Explorer</p>
<p>Mozilla Firefox</p>
<p>Avast! Security Suite</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Security update works</p>
<p>Pinging sites (Yahoo, etc) works</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other computers connected to this network via WiFi - no problem getting on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the Network Troubleshooter advises all is working properly, no suggestions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Attempted fixes:</p>
<p>Turned off all extensions on IE (but remember Firefox and Avast! are also unable to access.)</p>
<p>Disabled all Start-up and ongoing non-MS processes</p>
<p>Restarted in Safe Mode - still no ability to access.</p>
<p>Ran full virus check, then ran virus check again from boot-up. Minor ad-ware "viruses" found, all auto-corrected.</p>
<p>Rebooted router and computer to infinity and beyond!s</p>
<p>Tried other computers using the same ethernet cable connected to the same wireless and cable routers, no problem accessing the internet.</p>
<p>Disabled all non-MS functions</p>
<p>Turned off MS Firewall</p>
<p>Reset IP configuration (from memory: netsh ip net reset c:\resetlog.txt - PROBABLY NOT EXACT - FROM MEMORY. Command worked)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, this had happened previously and then miraculously fixed it self after a short (less than 1 weeks) period of time. This time, no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is obviously either one of two things:</p>
<p>1) A configuration issue I just can't find/figure out.</p>
<p>2) The weirdest, most selective, hardware issue in the universe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?</p>
<p>
</p><p>More thanks than I can possibly express for any and all assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May you win the lotto and have many beautiful children!</p>

<p>Hello Team ZigZag,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to thank you for your help. I finally broke down and reached out to our friends at Microsoft directly for assistance. They had me role through all the things you suggested (again). And finally (after many hours of chat and phone discussions) came
 up with an answer: "*shrug* we don't know what's wrong - pick a restore point and go back to that." Which I did. This solved the internet access problem, but created other problems I am working on (nothing I need to post here, these are specific to a particular
 non-MS program).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I just wanted to thank you for your time and effort on my behalf. I greatly, greatly appreciate it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my best,</p>
<p>Kel</p>
