<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums. Your interest on Windows 10 is appreciated.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per the issue description you could not access anything as the screen is blinking. The screen flickering/blinking issue that we are experiencing after an upgrade to Windows 10 is mainly due to the security software (Norton Antivirus).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try the method provided below and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
</span></span><strong><span>Boot the computer in safe mode.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a. Hold down the Shift key when clicking the Restart button.<br />
b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click Troubleshoot.<br />
c. Next, hit advanced options followed by Windows Startup Settings from the next screen.<br />
d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:<br />
•&nbsp;F4 for Safe Mode <br />
•&nbsp;F5 for Safe Mode with Networking <br />
•&nbsp;F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information you may refer to the link given below:<br />

<h2>            Random Glitches in Media Player Behavior</h2>
                    
<p>I have had a number of strange behaiors crop up in Windows Media Player 12 (64 bit)&nbsp;in Win7 Home (64 bit).</p>
<p>At Random intervals:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;I click on a song, and it plays the wrong song.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;I delete a song, and it deletes the wrong song.</p>
<p>3. It selects any one image from an album and plugs it into all the albums that have no images.&nbsp; This image selection differs from one use to the next.</p>
<p>Anyone else see these bugs?&nbsp; Anyway to fix them?</p>

<p>Try resetting the media library manually, by following these steps:</p>
- Reboot the PC.<br />
- Go to Start - Run, type&nbsp; <strong>services.msc</strong> , and press Enter. In Services, find the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service</strong> . If its status is&nbsp;<strong>Started</strong> , double-click the service and click&nbsp;
<strong>Stop</strong> .<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong> in the search field, and press Enter. This folder will open up in Windows Explorer.<br />
- In this folder, rename the&nbsp; <strong>Media Player</strong> folder to something like&nbsp;<strong>Media Player old</strong> . If you can't see the folder, then it's probably hidden. Set Explorer to show hidden files and folders, and to show protected system files.<br />
- Start WMP, your library will have been reset and will be rebuilt. Check if the issue still occurs.

    <title>Windows 10 November update frozen at 24&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drcmptrman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 November update frozen at 24&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded and attempted to install the November update for Windows 10. It downloaded then told me to restart. When I restarted it first showed me the screen that it was installing updates. When that reached 100%, then my pc restarted. I now see a black
 screen that reads "Updating Windows" and "Your PC will restart several times". </p>
<p>
</p><p>The circular status indicator was moving, as well as the Copying Files percentage indicator at the bottom of the screen. They now seem frozen, the circular status at 24%, and the Copying Files at 83%. It has been frozen for over an hour now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked up&nbsp;this online, and all I could find was something about an SD card or bus causing this update to freeze at 44%, but I do not have a SD card reader on my pc. Also, the only peripherals I have currently attached is my mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if it is safe to reboot my computer, so I am hoping someone can tell me what to do. I will leave it as is for now.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I will be glad to assist you with the issue you are experiencing with the computer. I understand the difficulty when things won’t work the way they should.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I would suggest you to follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Method: 1</strong><br />
Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with Windows Update. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your Windows Update. Refer these steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Press Windows key +X, select Control panel<br />
2.&nbsp;Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons<br />
3.&nbsp;Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel<br />
4.&nbsp;Run Windows Update troubleshooter.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the issue still persists, try the below method and check if it helps or not:<br />
I would recommend you to reset the windows update component manually. Resetting Windows Update Components will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Updates quickly. Follow the below steps:<br />
1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.<br />
2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver<br />
3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ren &lt;C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ren &lt;C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old&gt;<br />
4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start wuauserv<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start cryptSvc<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start bits <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start msiserver<br />
5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I also suggest you to refer to the suggestion by Ananya from the following link and check if it helps..

</p><p><span>Hi Laura, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for the reply and update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have a laptop then plug in the power cord to the socket. Shut down the pc or hold the power button for about 15 seconds and the pc will shut down completely. After 5 minutes restart the pc and check the status. If you
 are able to get to the desktop screen and if the update has failed to install then put the pc in a clean boot state and then start the update installation one more time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere
 with the program. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></p>

    <title>Suggestions for creative ways to destroy my SP4 128 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Suggestions for creative ways to destroy my SP4 128</h2>
                    <p>That's it. Had enough. Tired of trying to get this lame horse to walk, let alone run. The SP4 is so unfit for purpose I cannot continue to hope that the next software update will magically fix it's problems. Crashing into black screen of death whenever I
 leave it alone for more than a few minutes, it's getting boring now with the constant hard resets and reinstalls. And yes, MS experts, I have "installed all the latest updates......" which appears to be the only panacea you have to offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the UK we don't have Microsoft stores and I can't face the vicious return/refurb cycle. Nor would I inflict the miserable experience of being an SP4 owner on an unsuspecting Ebay buyer, so I have decided to destroy this shockingly misconceived fail forever,
 in the hope that by doing mankind a favour in this way I will offset some of the remorse I feel for trusting Microsoft in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am open to suggestions (legal and safe of course) as to how I can derive the most satisfaction from its destruction....any ideas?</p>

            &nbsp;A youtube video of you taking a sledgehammer to it might get some press, especially if you forward it to the right people. Honestly, though, if you're buying a new computer anyway, I'd suggest just just doing the return/refurb cycle in your spare time.
 Remember, every support call and every refurb sent out costs MS money, and if there's one surefire way to get a company to fix something it's by hurting their bottom line.<br />

In Disk Clean-up.&nbsp;Is it safe to delete files like "Hibernation File cleaner (3.9 gb)", offline web pages, debug dump files, system memory dump files, and system archived windows error files.&nbsp; Because of the size of hibernation File cleaner, I am hesitant to

            Yes they will no longer be there ,it is now apps. Don't kill it, this is very easy just click on the left hand side of the screen down by the windows icon where it says search and type in Spider 8 to begin the download of the app.

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry, you are completely wrong. Keyboard is working in Chrome, Office, games and so on. Just Windows startup, Edge and Cortana are in trouble. If the driver is couse, as you and many from MS suggest, it would not work at all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here is solution, silly, but works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter this in command prompt (you get it with Win + R) and type&nbsp;<em><strong>C:\Windows\system32\ctfmon.exe
</strong></em>every time you start Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have more traces of DOS in Windows I would show you how to execute it in startup, by itself. I made it in Windows start menu, but it is not working,
<strong>obviously there is something that runs later and reverses it</strong>. I remind you there is no problem to enter password for Windows user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel bad to write so sharp response to you, my son is working in MS too. Windows is huge OS and it &nbsp;is not easy to fix problems, but it is not as simple as you think. There are many people like me with similar problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer me to this question: Could you go around your building and ask some people how to make some program to run
<strong>after </strong>everything Windows need is loaded, automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice day.</p>

    <title>Three computers unusable after Fall Creators Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gary manis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Three computers unusable after Fall Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>We have 6 computers running Windows 10. All 6 now have the Fall Creators Update installed. Three of them are now unusable. After login, the affected systems run the hard drive at 100% non-stop. The 6 computers are all totally different hardware. All are
 running Avast Antivirus except one of the affected systems, which is running Windows Defender. All three affected systems have the latest drivers installed. Interestingly, our two oldest computers and the very newest computer are running fine. There is an
 obvious difference between the affected systems and the unaffected systems. Memory. 100% of the affected systems only have 4 Gb of RAM and the running systems all have 8 Gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running fine:</p>
<p>HP XW4600, Intel Quad-Core, 8 Gb RAM, Radeon R7-260X, Avast AV</p>
<p>HP DV7 Laptop, Intel i5 Quad-Core, 8 Gb RAM, Radeon, Avast AV</p>
<p>HP Beats Audio SE, AMD Quad-Core, 8 Gb RAM, Radeon R6, Avast AV</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unusable:</p>
<p>Asus F102BA Ultrabook, AMD Dual-Core, 4 Gb RAM, Radeon HD, Windows Defender</p>
<p>Dell Latitude E6500 Laptop, Intel Dual-Core, 4 Gb RAM, nVidia Quadro, Avast AV</p>
<p>Intel Desktop, Intel Quad-Core, 4 Gb RAM, Radeon R7-260X, Avast AV</p>
<p>
</p><p>The memory is not upgradable on the Ultrabook, and too expensive to upgrade on the Dell Laptop. I'm not sure if these systems will run well enough to roll back the update. Is there a solution other than reinstalling the OS? If I need to reinstall, is there
 a way to prevent this update from being installed?</p>

<p>Hi Gary,<br />
<br />
<br />
There could be a number of factors as to why you are experiencing performance issue in Windows 10. This could be caused by software conflict or due to insufficient memory.<br />
<br />
You can boot your computer in Safe mode. <strong>Safe mode</strong> starts Windows in a limited state, where only the bare essentials are started. Check if you will encounter the same issue while in Safe mode. You can choose whether to boot your computer from
 Settings or from the sign-in screen. To do this, refer to the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows logo key</strong> + <strong>I</strong> on your keyboard to open
<strong>Settings</strong>. If that doesn't work, select the <strong>Start button</strong> in the lower-left corner of your screen, then select
<strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Under <strong>Advanced startup</strong>, select <strong>Restart now</strong>.<br />
</li><li>After your PC restarts to the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Restart</strong>. <br />
</li><li>After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select 4 or F4 to start your PC in Safe Mode. Or if you'll need to use the Internet, select 5 or F5 for Safe Mode with Networking.
<br />
<br />

<p>The Ultrabook has recovered for the moment. The cumulative update for Windows 10 1709 KB4074588 has failed to automatically install 11 times. The last attempt failed with error code 0x8024200d.&nbsp; Apparently, that is what is making the system unresponsive.
 Unfortunately, this morning it is automatically downloading the update again. The system is now unresponsive, again. My daughter uses this computer at school. How can I get the system to stop trying to install this update?</p>

            The Ultrabook has finally recovered. After automatic install #12 failed, I downloaded the standalone installer and installed the update. That succeeded. It still had some slowness, though. Task Manager showed 100% disk activity with no displayed processes
 responsible. Process Explorer showed that a combination of OneDrive, Cortana, Search Indexer and Windows Defender were the culprits. After OneDrive finished syncing, I was able to disable Cortana and disk activity returned to normal. I have a memory upgrade
 coming tomorrow for the Intel Desktop. I will try it next. Yes, that system and the Dell laptop are in a Windows Update fail loop, but for the Flash security update.

<p>Here is my follow-up:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I upgraded the Intel Desktop to 8Gb of RAM, manually installed the failed update with the standalone installer and that resolved the issue with that system. It has successfully installed updates since then and that system is running fine.
</li><li>The Dell Laptop is somewhat useful now that I have tweaked several settings limiting the resources that Windows Update can use. The CPU usage stays between 50% and 60% constantly with Windows Module Installer Worker using around 45%. The latest cumulative
 update took days to install, but it did eventually install. This was a good all around system and after the Fall Creator's Update is now only good for browsing the Internet and doing email.</li><li>The Ultrabook is back to being unresponsive with the latest cumulative update in a fail loop.&nbsp;Logging into the Ultrabook is very difficult. The login times out before completing about 90% of the time. Even after logging in, the system is only responsive
 for about 3-5 seconds every 5 minutes or so. I can't do much with it. Maybe someday it will stop attempting to install the latest update and I can work on it or do a full new install of Windows 10 or perhaps Ubuntu. The Fall Creator's Update isn't going to
 work on this one.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Tirade alert!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I'm a Technical Lead Developer for a Software Production Support team with more than 25 years of development experience. I fix software bugs for a living. Product testing is crucial to the success of any product, especially software. The biggest problems
 I have seen with Microsoft's products are indicative of either a lack of testing or a lack of bug fixing and retesting prior to release. Failures like this will drive away customers. We now live in a world where the operating system is becoming more and more
 irrelevant. As long as users are able to access a network and have a compatible browser, it doesn't matter whether they are running Windows, Chrome OS, Android, IOS, Linux or some other OS. Companies are finding it more and more difficult to justify their
 dependence on Windows. Right now, I can't recommend Windows 10 as a business platform or even a reliable OS for student use. Historically, Microsoft has had mixed success with operating systems. Windows 2003 Workstation was never released, Vista was a good
 OS, but failed because it was released before hardware was generally available to run it, in contrast Windows 7 was great (Was this really the never released Windows 2003 Workstation with a face lift?), Windows 8 was mostly a failure because Microsoft failed
 to do adequate market research and produced an OS that didn't work for any market. Windows 10 shows promise, but isn't solid enough for general use. More and more business users are unhappy with Windows 10 and are requesting tablet PCs running either IOS or
 Android. What the market wants is an updated and optimized Windows 7. Why can't we have that?

    <title>Error checking on startup on every boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aw24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error checking on startup on every boot</h2>
                    <p>So as of around one week ago, I have been getting the error-checking dialogue for my C:/ drive on every boot. The error-checking itself does not seem to run as it finishes very quickly (within 15 - 20 seconds) and doesn't display a % complete number at all,
 after which the computer goes on to the login screen without issue. Every time I try to run error-checking on drive C: from the Properties &gt; Tools window, it gives the dialogue "We found errors on this drive" and gives a prompt to repair the drive, which further
 goes on to prompt me to restart to fix the issue. But once I restart, the same error-checking process happens on boot but behaves in the same way (finishing very quickly), therefore not changing a thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On running chkdsk from the command window, it returns normally giving "Windows has scanned the file system and found no problems. No further action is required."</p>
<p>Furthermore, running chkdsk /r prompts the same message to check for errors on rebooting, which leads to the same error-checking screen on startup as mentioned previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On running sfc&nbsp;/scannow, there seems to be no issues (Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On running fsutil dirty query c:, I get the message "Volume - c: is Dirty"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS ROG G752-VT that has run with no issues for more than a year, until last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be much appreciated, as I can't backup my C:/ drive as Windows Backup and Restore says the C: disk is corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: On further investigation, I have found this thread (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-power-winpc/disk-checking-issue-with-windows-10/efb2daa6-2a9e-40a2-be5b-96d5839c4ee4) that details EXACTLY the same problem, which leads
 me to think it's an Asus ROG related issue. Unfortunately, the fixes suggested in the thread have not worked, but the error-checking on startup behavior is exactly the same as the one I'm having.</p>

<p>On running both the Powershell commands you have replied with, it returns "NoErrorsFound". Also,&nbsp;fsutil&nbsp;still shows Volume C: as being marked Dirty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have avoided defragmenting the drive as it is an SSD, but when I go to defragment it displays the drive as \\?\Volume followed by a string of numbers and letter in brackets. Not sure if I should proceed with the defragmentation.</p>

<h3> harold court  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing problem&#58; unable to use Print Selection option</h2>
                    <p>Whilst I was on Windows 7 and using a MP series Canon Multifunction, I had Print All, Print Pages and Print Selection (extract from a page) options all fully available to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, having upgraded to Windows 10-64 bit, and having bought a Canon MG6800 series Multifunction, the Print Selection radio button id greyed out, and so printing an extract from a page is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Canon have referred me back to Microsoft, giving me a phone number, but at 80 I found the options too confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anybody here who can assist, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the Print Selection to be omitted seems a totally illogical step on either or both parties</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I bought a computer from an ebay seller about 5 months ago. It said it had genuine windows, never gave me a problem, but suddenly it is saying it's no activated? I have windows 10. it gives the following message:</p>

</p><p>We can’t activate windows on this device as we can’t connect to your organization’s activation server. Make sure you are connected to your organization’s network and try again. If you continue having problems with activation, contact
 your organizations support person. Error Code: 0x8007232B</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sadly, it's more of custom made, so I really have no one to contact. Have any ideas? Thanks!</p>

            Hi WE.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The error normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops reinstalling Windows, unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.
<br />
<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install. Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here: <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-</a>...
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of retail Windows 10 to reinstall (if necessary) and activate it. I would buy only from a major retailer who backs their sales or Microsoft here: <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US</a>...
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I should add that if you paid with Paypal they will often protect you from pirated software if you report it within a certain window of time.  
<br />
<br />It is piracy when someone resells Windows with no way to legally activate it.  You can report this to Microsoft here:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/r...</a>.  In the past when victims cooperated with an investigation they would sometimes give them a free copy as thanks.  
<br />
<br />You can also contact the seller and let him/her know you are taking these actions and that to avoid prosecution for felony theft and piracy they need to make the activation good.
<br />
<br />I hope having all possible options helps.

            Glad to hear it.  It must have had an underlying good Digital License reactivated by the Generic Version key after removing the VLK.

            Hi Trevor,
<br />
<br />Are you running Windows 10?
<br />
<br />If so, have you checked the functioning of your Microphone?
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy - Microphone 
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your microphone' is turned on and make sure the appropriate app (Skype) is also set to On
<br />
<br />
<br />Then in Settings, go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Recording Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter

<p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>I try the echo test and the video works fine; can see</p>
<p>my image.&nbsp; I have a Logitech C922 webcam with microphone.</p>
<p>The skype voice asks me to speak a message after the beep</p>
<p>and see if it plays back.&nbsp; It doesn't.</p>
<p>I go into control panel/sound/recording</p>
<p>select my microphone device, click all the tabs</p>
<p>and the levels setting is at 0% and the mute icon is</p>
<p>set to muted.&nbsp; So I change the setting to 60% and un-mute.</p>
<p>Then repeat the Skype echo test and get the same result.</p>
<p>I go back to microphone settings and see that the volume level</p>
<p>has been reset to 0% and mute icon is set to mute.</p>
<p>Many repeats yield same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tested the microphone audio on another computer</p>
<p>and it works fine.</p>
<p>I am running&nbsp; Windows 7 Ultimate on an AMD computer.</p>

<p>been suspended for two weeks, the suspension is completely done and I can't use the button to dispute the suspension because it's lifted. Support says same ish wait 3 days and contact enforcement via the button next to your suspension case, the &nbsp;I've tried
 cycling my chat settings and hard restarting my xbox. this issue is somehow not a priority as support said sorry you just have to "wait and see if the button appears on your case" so I can contact enforcement about this issue. I feel like they permanently
 suspended me from talking and are just not willing to care about fixing it. I have a 350$ (Triton warheads)mic for my Xbox 360 and a 300$ (a 50s) for my one and this suspension and the previous suspensions on my account are B S. i pay a lot of money for communication
 equipment and Xbox just randomly suspends who they feel like and act like its a methodical approach. I was suspended for two weeks on oct. 8th until oct 22nd and it's the 23rd... I have had one complaint for messaging on my account and one complaint for cheating
 (because I'm that *** good) in 5 months May - October 2015 ( <a href="http://imageshack.com/a/img910/2641/D9pvTR.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://imageshack.com/a/img910/2641/D9pvTR.png</a>&nbsp;)&nbsp;i'm rated as a good player and I got suspended for two weeks (communications) and now my suspension is indefinitely extended due to a button for dispute not being on a website and enforcement has no phone
 number. I'm told to go to forums...who the hell runs enforcement team help through forums?! Anyways we will see if buying this console was even worth it. Looking forward to any help in this issue from anyone from Microsoft or Xbox live. Been online since 2001.

<p>Hey there GR1MxXREAPER,</p>
<p>One of the Enforcement Team Members have made a thread about this here: <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4276/t/2050832.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If I'm reading this right you are saying that your suspension was extended? You can go here -&gt;
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/Enforcement/ShowEnforcements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enforcement.xbox.com/.../ShowEnforcements</a> </p>
<p>Once on that site click on "Enforcements on your account". Once there you can choose to apply for review. That is the only way anyone can talk to the Enforcement team anymore. They are not operating on the forums since August 2015.</p>
<p>If the problem just has to do with not being able to talk to people and not about your suspension, I would make sure your controller firmware is updated and if that doesn't work I would delete and recover your account and then go from there.</p>

<p>I have done this reboot process already and no luck at all, basically I'm in the same situation. I know that my communications suspension is definely extended regardless of what they say with no answer to as when it will end.("we're working on it") This
 has inconvenienced me greatly and continues to do so. I was misinformed multiple times by Xbox support and did not know about case review and I could probably gotten the suspension lifted or at least have this issue looked at by someone on enforcement, seeing
 as how I'm a good player and I don't have a bad rep. Since I don't have a case review button I'm stuck in forums. Thanks for posting and showing me this link. At least I know that they know. Lol</p>

<p>@godthesniper if I can't communicate and they say we're working on it I'm basically suspended still, since the communication is disabled on my console, the suspension is Lifted on the website under my cases so I cannot use a case review as a way of telling
 them it's still muting me. That's what I mean </p>

 would you?</p>

<p>No I just bought this console and the GameStop didn't have a mic for it, (mic was for a 360???) I took it back and they tried to give me a used One i told them no, I ordered the a 50s and they came right when I got suspended so I have been without communication
 for like almost a month now. Super bugs me because I play destiny and evolve..... Everything is up to date (including controllers) and I'm running a regular dash.

<p>Hey I had this problem for 3 weeks following a 7 day suspension. I finally got my chat working again even after I tried EVERY troubleshooting step given to me by Xbox support.</p>
<p>What I did was: </p>
<p>1: update controller to the latest firmware in device settings. </p>
<p>2: hold the power button for 5 seconds or until console powers down. </p>
<p>3: disconnect power brick from both the wall socket and the console and leave disconnected overnight.
</p>
<p>Number 3 is the most important step! I disconnected power supply numerous times for the 5 minutes like support tells us to but it wasn't until I left it disconnected overnight that my chat started working again.
</p>
<p>I didn't think this would work but it did and I'm very happy about it. Please try these steps and get back to us on the results.

<h2>            Leadtek WinFast A340 T 128MB Graphics Card</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I had installed this Graphics Card on my Windows 7 32-bit computer and it worked very well, also&nbsp;with aero. Some months ago, my motherboard died (it was a Gigabyte) and I had to buy a replacement, but i couldn't find the same motherbord, so I bought another
 type (from ASRock). After switching the boards, my video card only displays at 640x480x16 resolution and i cannot install it or make any changes to the resolution. What can i do to fix this issue?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Solution: The Motherboard has an AGI slot, not an AGP, which is compatible only with certain video cards. A340 T is not one of them.

    <title>Battlefield 3 premium expansion packs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azureanimator99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battlefield 3 premium expansion packs</h2>
                    
<p>I have had the same problem as most people with this premium package.&nbsp; I bought the bf3 premium game that is supposed to come with all 5 expansion packs and I still haven't been able to access them to play them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded everything that I was suppose to with first playing the game including the code given to you for the premium membership.&nbsp; After that was all done, I went into the store tab on the game menu and downloaded all 5 expansion packs and even downloaded
 all the updates for each one too.&nbsp; When I go to the xbox live market, it only shows that I have downloaded that free updates and still have to purchase the expansion packs for 1200 points?????????????&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very confused on what is going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should have access to all the expansion packs right?&nbsp; Where I am to go to even play them?&nbsp; They don't even show up in my games area of the dashboard.&nbsp; Should I delete the whole game and start over in downloading everything?&nbsp; Please help from anyone who
 has had a similar problem or knows what to do to fix the problem.&nbsp; Thanks. </p>

<p>Its because you got the DLC from the Battlefield 3 In-Game Store and not the xbox live marketplace upon downloading the content you have access to the content and you play the maps just load up your multiplayer and look for maps that are new to you those
 should be the DLC maps. Hope this helped.</p>

<p>When you go into the store section. The tab you need to worry about is Premium on the far right.</p>
<p>You can get to this by pressing RB twice.</p>
<p>If you're premium code is applied correctly you will have a tick in a green box next to "Battlefield &nbsp;3 Premium" at the top</p>
<p>If you have all the add-ons downloaded and installed correctly each of these will also have a green tick next to them.</p>
<p>If you do not have some of the add-ons installed. select them individually using the A button and they will be free for you to download and install.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help. &nbsp;I do have the green ticks next to the 5 DLC's but on the Battlefield 3 Premium the tick is still blue. &nbsp;I have entered the code that was given to me and it is says that I have already use that code. &nbsp;I will go and try it again and
 see if that still works. &nbsp;But if not, should I just go and delete that whole game from my xbox and start over with the downloading? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Just bought the game and the code is not working.</p>
<p>I contacted EA support and they start asking for copies of the box, the purchase receipt and of the code. I told them I'm gonna bring back the game to the shop and get Call Of Duty instead and they are happy with that... so basically... [Mod Removed] off
 EA</p>

    <title>creating a system restore point causes printers to stop working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amundarken  say:</h3>
<h2>            creating a system restore point causes printers to stop working</h2>
                    <p>I have two HP printers (Laserjet 1536dnf &amp; Officejet 6500) installed on a PC running Win7 64-bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Up until January these were working fine after Win7 updates (restore point created automatically).&nbsp; Since then, any time&nbsp;a system restore point is created
 I lose access to both printers.&nbsp; Clicking on "Devices &amp; Printers" opens the window and the progress bar goes on forever with nothing found and the process has to be closed with Task Manager.&nbsp; Printers can't be accessed but no error messages appear.&nbsp; Any reference
 to a printer causes that particular process to hang and must be closed with Task Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both printers are wired via Ethernet to a Cisco E3000 router and are set up to be shared in the same home group.&nbsp; Oddly, a second PC running Win7 that is wired via Ethernet to the same router, using the same two printers can&nbsp;create system restore points
 without any impact on these two printers.&nbsp; The main difference between the two is that the affected PC runs an AMD-based system&nbsp;while the unaffected one runs an Intel-based system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Printer functionality is restored when I&nbsp;roll back to&nbsp;the system restore point from early January.&nbsp; Using any later restore point simply reproduces the problem. I have searched every FAQ and forum but can't find any cure.</p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">A print spooler is software that temporarily stores print jobs on the computer hard disk or in memory until the printer is ready to print them. If you've been waiting
 an unusually long time for a document to print, or if you see an error message about the print spooler, spooler subsystem, or spooler resources, you might need to change and then restart the Print Spooler service on your computer.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">To do this, we recommend that you save your work, and then restart the computer to restart the Print Spooler service. If you don't want to restart the computer,
 try these steps instead.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">To change or restart the Print Spooler service, you must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps:</font></p>

    <title>Windows Firewall Missing.. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Firewall Missing..</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 Bit OS, on Toshiba Satellite L505</p>
<p>Question 1.&nbsp; I was trying to manually allow a program through my firewall. I went to the firewall through the control panel (control panel &gt; system and security &gt; firewall &gt; allow a program or feature through firewall etc)&nbsp;However, the only option i have
 is "use recommended settings" which is in a box saying "update your firewall settings"&nbsp;with a red bar going down the left side so i click it but all it says is "Windows firewall cant change some of your settings. Error code 0x80070424" How do i fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 2. I try to click on advanced settings and it opens up a new window "Windows firewall with advanced settings". Says something about restarting windows firewall on my computer and then error code 0x6D9. How can i fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question 3. (start button &gt; type in services in search bar &gt; click "Services") I cant even find Windows Firewall and im pretty sure it should be in there. Any ideas on where to find it or how to reinstall it if i need to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I kinda have a feeling that these are all connected (besides all being associated with firewall) and i know it seems like alot but hopefully someone can figure this out...</p>
<p>Appreciate all the help.</p>

            Hey CRKS,
<div><br />
<div>I have two links to check out that should fix the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>0x80070424 error:</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_firewall_diagnostic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Automatically repair Windows Firewall problems,
 such as Windows fails to start Windows Firewall service (0x5) or Windows remote assistance is not working.</a></span>
<div><br />
<div>The above tool may not do the trick, but it will not harm your system so that is the easy fix. The next link is to a thread for the same error, and everyone is reporting good things. This I am confident should do the trick.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/error-code-0x80070424-with-windows-firewall/ec3fc3b8-69ec-4b4b-a703-4b745fe6e8ee">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/error-code-0x80070424-with-windows-firewall/ec3fc3b8-69ec-4b4b-a703-4b745fe6e8ee</a>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this was helpful. If you have any issues or it does not do the trick, just come back to this thread and explain your results, and we will&nbsp;figure&nbsp;it out.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for posting to Microsoft Answers!</div>

<h2>            running check disk caused bad image errors</h2>
                    Yesterday I followed the advice in this thread http://getpocket.com/a/read/219901270 and ran check disk, as I was having the problem of a usb device that used to work malfunctioning, and in general the laptop was being problematic. It is my mums and I
 am giving it back to her soon so wanted to get it cleared up. However this seems to have just caused more problems. the check disk took 12 hours and now when I try to start up the computer I get to the home screen then get a load of 'bad image' errors and
 it shuts itself down shortly after. I have tried to start up in safe mode with command prompt then run sfc/scannow but it gets stucks at 41% through verification. Can anyone help?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
We can't see that thread without creating an account which many of us will be unwilling<br />
to do. <br />
<br />
However running checkdisk did not cause the issue, it only helped define it. Sounds like<br />
there are definite hard drive problems. Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would
<br />
thoroughly check the drive now and be sure to keep redundant backups of your important<br />
<br />
Use the <strong>Advanced Methods</strong> and/or the<strong> Manufacturer's Diagnostic Utilities</strong>.<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way <br />
out then restart.<br />

These are much more efficient methods to check the disk. <strong>&lt;- Advanced <br />
Methods.</strong><br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or <br />
from a Vista disk - if you do not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friend's <br />
(it needs to be same 32 or 64 bit and they are not copy protected) or make one. <br />
Also your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already <br />
own Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
Space after k and before /&nbsp; and after f and before /<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
Space after c and before /<br />

This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi there you could've had it repaired but do to the fact you opened the console you nullified the warranty. Now your likely to have to purchase a new one. A 360 power supply will not work with xbox one.</p>
