            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When does it occur?&nbsp; Does it happen at startup or randomly or when you try to do something (and if so, try to do what)?&nbsp; How often does if happen?&nbsp; When did it start happening?&nbsp; What changes have you made since it started happening?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have a Lexmark Printer (make and model please)?&nbsp; What version of Windows?&nbsp; When it closes, what doesn't work (if anything)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do a full search for lxcetime.exe and post back with the exact and full pathnames to each of the files (there could be 3 or more).&nbsp; Make sure it is a full advanced search including system and hidden files and non-indexed files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Run and type msconfig.exe and enter.&nbsp; Go to the startup tab.&nbsp; Is there anything listed there like lxcetime.exe or lxcetime.dll?&nbsp; What other information does it say about those entries?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please go to Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer.&nbsp; Check for anything errors involving lxcetime.exe in any of the sections (especially System and Applications - but check them all).&nbsp; There MUST be an entry for this event - so look
 until you find it.&nbsp; When you do, double click it to get details and then please copy those details and paste them into your next reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck!</p>

<h2>            KB2641690 has made computer unusable on the network</h2>
                    A recent reinstall of XP-SP3 on a Dell has been running smoothly for the last three months until I installed KB2641690. Now the machine has disappeared from the local network; cannot access other shared machines or allow others to use the laser printer;
 however it can still use the Internet. Running a network trace shows it is not responding to any ARP requests which would explain the result but not the cause. It has also slowed up significantly.

            <p>If you uninstall the update - that fixes it?<br />
(If not - then that may not have been your issue.)</p>

<p>You can turn off hibernation if it is on and you don't use it..</p>
<p>When you hibernate your computer, Windows saves the contents of the system's memory to the hiberfil.sys file. As a result, the size of the hiberfil.sys file will always equal the amount of physical memory in your system. If you don't use the hibernate feature
 and want to recapture the space that Windows uses for the hiberfil.sys file, perform the following steps:</p>
<p>- Start the Control Panel Power Options applet (go to Start, Settings, Control Panel, and click Power Options).<br />
- Select the Hibernate tab, clear the "Enable hibernation" check box, then click OK; although you might think otherwise, selecting Never under the "System hibernates" option on the Power Schemes tab doesn't delete the hiberfil.sys file.<br />
- Windows will remove the "System hibernates" option from the Power Schemes tab and delete the hiberfil.sys file.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your System Restore can use...</p>
<p>1. Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br />
2. Click the System Restore tab.<br />
3. Highlight one of your drives (or C: if you only have one) and click on the "Settings" button.<br />
4. Change the percentage of disk space you wish to allow.. I suggest moving the slider until you have just about 1GB (1024MB or close to that...)<br />
5. Click OK.. Then Click OK again.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your Temporary Internet Files can utilize...</p>
<p>Empty your Temporary Internet Files and shrink the size it stores to a size between 64MB and 128MB..</p>
<p>- Open ONE copy of Internet Explorer.<br />
- Select TOOLS - Internet Options.<br />
- Under the General tab in the "Temporary Internet Files" section, do the following:<br />
- Click on "Delete Cookies" (click OK)<br />
- Click on "Settings" and change the "Amount of disk space to use:" to something between 64MB and 128MB. (It may be MUCH larger right now.)<br />
- Click OK.<br />
- Click on "Delete Files" and select to "Delete all offline contents" (the checkbox) and click OK. (If you had a LOT, this could take 2-10 minutes or more.)<br />
- Once it is done, click OK, close Internet Explorer, re-open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:</p>
<p>Ccleaner (Free!)<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br />
( just the disk cleanup - don't play with the registry part for now )</p>

.... and save it to the<strong> root of your C:\ drive</strong>. After saving it to the
<em>root of the C:\ drive</em>, do the following:</p>
<p>Close all Internet Explorer windows and other applications.</p>
<p>Start button --&gt; RUN and type in:<br />
%SystemDrive%\windowsupdateagent30-x86.exe /WUFORCE<br />
--&gt; Click OK.</p>
<p>(If asked, select "Run".) --&gt; Click on NEXT --&gt; Select "I agree" and click on NEXT --&gt; When it finishes installing, click on "Finish"...</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Now reset your Windows Update Components with this FixIt (you will <strong><em>*NOT*</em></strong>&nbsp;use the aggressive version):<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I reset Windows Update components?</a></p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that your system is generally free of malware (assuming you have an AntiVirus application), &nbsp;you have cleaned up the 'extra applications' that might be running and taking up your valuable memory and processor, you have cleared out some valuable drive
 space and made sure there are no issues with the drive itself and your Windows Update components are updated and should be working in top shape - there is only one other thing you
<em>may</em> wish to do:</p>
<p>Obtain and install&nbsp;the latest hardware device drivers for your system from the system/hardware manufacturers' support and/or download web site.</p>

    <title>Mouse half responds at random times - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryanriddick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse half responds at random times</h2>
                    <div>
<p>My computer is a custom build. Asus mainboard, Logitech M705 wireless mouse and accompanying keyboard connected using a Unifying receiver. Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrading my computer from Windows 7 to Windows 10, I have noticed some strange behavior from my mouse. The problem is not consistent, but does seem to occur after the mouse sits idle for a time, whether that be while the computer is asleep or just
 unused for a time. It also does not seem to happen every time, at least not as far as I have noticed thus far. What is happening is that when I move the mouse, the cursor moves around the screen, but is accompanied by an unusual rhythmic beeping. At the same
 time, I am unable to click anything. Every click produces only two of those same beeps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The really odd part is that I am still able to use the keyboard to restart the computer. As I stated above, the keyboard is connected using the same Unifying receiver. After restarting, the mouse works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for the real twist. I purchased an Acer R3 series laptop, upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. It appears that the problem is not specific to my custom desktop rig or the mouse I am using on it, as just last night, the built-in touchpad on the Acer
 laptop started doing exactly the same thing, The only difference is that the laptop corrected itself very quickly. Before I fully had a chance to realize what had happened, the beeping ceased and it was business as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a complete loss. Both computers are up to date according to&nbsp;Windows Update. Both devices are running the most current drivers available. I did not experience anything like this with Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Smart Gesture not working after Driver Update</h2>
                    <p>After a few updates automatically installed this weekend, my Asus Smart Gesture isn't working. &nbsp;I reinstalled the ATK Package and repaired Smart Gesture, which did not help. &nbsp;I also tried changing the permissions for Smart Gesture as seen in another post
 on this site... didn't do anything either. &nbsp;One of the updates that just installed is "Windows Driver Package - Asus (ATP Mouse)" from 11/15/15, v 1.0.0.262 - which I figured must be the culprit, but when I try to uninstall it, I get error messages stating
 that the files cannot be found. &nbsp;If I can't uninstall it, I don't know what to try. &nbsp;Any suggestions? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<h3> miketinva  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 update KB300850 unsuccessful</h2>
                    <p><span>I am helping my 85+ year old neighbor with her HP Pavilion 23 AIO desktop (~2013) running Windows 8.1 with &nbsp;6GB RAM. &nbsp;Since at least April (as far back as WU shows history), her computer has been attempting to install several updates. &nbsp; They get installed,
 then "undone"&nbsp;during the next reboot. &nbsp;And, very time consuming -- hours to install and to&nbsp;"undo".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I ran Windows Update Troubleshooter utility.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I ran sfc /scannow which was able to fix "some" of the&nbsp;detected&nbsp;corruption.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I was able to get &nbsp;all of the updates in by taking them one at a time, EXCEPT &nbsp;KB 3000850. &nbsp;Once or twice &nbsp;WU gave the message that WIndows 10 was ready to install after the next restart, but that option goes away after the restart which undoes the
 updates. &nbsp;I assume I need KB3000850 for Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, Task Manager shows me that CPU usage is routinely&nbsp;high at &nbsp;60 - 99%. &nbsp;HPConnectedRemoteService is&nbsp;the highest user of that resource.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I ran WU Troubleshooter again.&nbsp; I did a clean boot and tried again to install KB3000850 (from a “.msu” file that I had downloaded).&nbsp; And,&nbsp; same result: &nbsp;KB300850 undone during reboot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, how do I get KB300850 &nbsp;installed OR do I need it? &nbsp;What if I just HIDE it.&nbsp;
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Is it needed for Win 10?</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I could try the PC refresh option, but that would involve reloading and setting up several programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any suggestions for next steps would be appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Mike T in VA</span></p>

            As I said, Asus didn`t help me at all, &amp; this time I posted a complaint on their site, which is what I should have done a long time ago. The matter did sort itself out, but I didn`t do anything, the warnings just stopped &amp; it stopped closing internet explorer.
 Guess it`s just one of those things. Just thought this would be a great opportunity to advice people not to get an Asus laptop (mainly if you`re not a computer wizard, &amp; you need some after support).<br />

            Hi Lensan,<br />
<br />
You may try these:<br />
<br />
<strong>1)</strong> Temporarily disable the security software and check if you are able create system restore point.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to enable the security software’s after completing the troubleshooting and identifying the issue so that the computer is protected.<br />
<br />
<strong>2)</strong>&nbsp; Make sure that you have sufficient disk space on all the drives where System Restore is enabled.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>3)</strong> Type Services in Start Menu Search Box, hit Enter. Make sure that the Volume Shadow Copy Service is running and set on Automatic. If the Status of System Restore Service is not Started, Start it. Also set it on Automatic if it is not. A
 reboot may be required. Reconfirm again, and now try.<br />
<br />
<strong>4)</strong> If that does not help, run the system file checker tool. This will scan protected system files and replace incorrect versions, with the correct Microsoft versions of the files.<br />
<br />
i. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow. <br />
ii. Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <strong>sfc /scannow</strong><br />
<br />

            Thanks for these steps.&nbsp; Unfortunately I have followed all of them and they do not resolve the issue.&nbsp; SFC reports that several files were corrupt and they have been fixed exept for tcpmon.inf and Settings.inf.&nbsp; It recommends to get a clean copy of these
 files.&nbsp; I'm not even sure if this is what is causing the problem with creating a restore point because these two files are associated with printer services, I think.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks.

<p><span>Hey,</span><br />
<br />
<span>Starting with Windows
<span>Starting with Windows
 10 build 10586, enabling hardware encryption with BitLocker following a clean install is no longer possible. It is possible with the RTM build 10240 prior to the November update. The error on the newer build is 'Parameter is incorrect (code 0x80070057)'.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
The only way to get it working on build 10586/Version 1511 is to enable encryption on build 10240 and then perform an upgrade. This isn't perfect because if you then disable encryption on the updated build, you can't re-enable it afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hoping for a fix.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

    <title>Lost Printer driver after last Win10 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tfreed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Printer driver after last Win10 Update</h2>
                    <p>After last Win10 Update I lost ability to communicate w printer through USB 3.0 port. I have a nice Lexmark X6550. Boils down to " printer not compatible with USB 3.0 ports". I've used it for years. Everything else works fine on those ports, Backup drive,
 speakers, backup printer(HP).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I did <strong>Everything</strong> to reload driver. I have a Toshiba laptop. I got hooked up w Tech support in Philippines, they could not fix it by logging onto my Laptop . Say they escalated my ticket but they let phone ring ONCE and hang up then I get
 E-mail saying I missed call and must reschedule. Been through the hang up BS twice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Can Anyone help me/tell me how to restore a lost Printer driver, Lexmark X6550, Toshiba laptop S855. All was Fine until last Win10 Update.</p>

<p>The Windows built-in driver search will almost never find anything, because it only searches a database that other companies (like Lexmark) have to voluntarily use, and most companies don't participate in that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The download from Lexmark's website directly should have worked, but since it didn't I'll try to suggest a few things I can think of.&nbsp; First thing I know, try plugging the printer into a USB port plug that is not blue.&nbsp; If you only have blue plugs, you may
 need to go to your computer manufacturer's website and get an updated BIOS to resolve compatibility problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A colleague of mine also suggested opening device manager (right-click the Start button to reach it) and removing your USB controllers, then scanning for hardware changes to have them picked up again. I haven't encountered this myself so I'm not sure what
 the resolution rate on that might be.</p>

<p>Thank You for helping with "Lost Driver to Lexmark X6550 after Win10 Update". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything. I was a Mainframe programmer for 15 years w Cobol IMS DB2 and all IBM Utilities. I'm just helpless w this Driver problem for my PC printer. Just got Monthly(Tuesday) Windows update. Still cant locate/find Lexmark printer, USB 3.0 or
 Wireless. My HP printer sucks but works. I Have come to depend on that Lexmark X6550 n have 2 sets of printer cartridges ready for office work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Truly ODD that the Lexmark Website Driver downloads, checks out and does NOT work.&nbsp; I'm pissed at Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me more about Editing my BIOS or what I need&nbsp; to do next. Sincerely, Loyal Microsoft customer. Ward Freed,</p>

            Really the absolute best contact would be Lexmark.&nbsp; You mentioned you downloaded the driver software from the Lexmark website and it checks out but does not work. Does it claim to have installed successfully?

<p>Yes. No problem downloading Lexmark Driver, or Any driver through Troubleshooter.&nbsp; My OLD printer works and my backup drive works and speakers. Anything I connect to my USB ports works fine ! EXCEPT my Lexmark X6550 printer. Happened just after one of the
 last big Tuesday Win10 Updates.&nbsp; Can't get a printer error till it spools for a while then kicks out "USB 3.0 not compatible w device Lexmark Printer" .&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I just Hate losing this printer that works great(still will make a copy), I bought extra ink. I just feel like I can always fix anything. NOT this time !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side note : The Philippines' help desk is part money pit and part scam. They call back, verify my name then hang up. I immediately get an e-mail saying "We tried to contact you but were unable to." and the TICKET gets closed. I just got passed back n forth
 between level 1 and level 2 Tech support, trying to get me to hang up. I hung in there. I'm happy more or less w WIN10 but the SCAM Philippines' help desk is to be avoided at all cost.&nbsp; Plus I have to go through the Virtual Agent to even get connected to Help
 Desk.</p>

<h2>            blue screen when charger is removed</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I am having an issue with a blue screen on my laptop, I don't know what it is because of. It has happened three times in the past two days. The first time I'm not sure what happened before it went to the bluescreen I just opened my laptop and
 it was there. The other two times it was when I removed it from the charger. However, It does not do it every time I remove it from the charger (I checked by plugging in and pulling it out). I have the three mini dump files available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I should note that I replaced a fan inside the computer, with an hp certified replacement, and I changed the network card to an intel one, but my computer found the drive and it works perfectly fine. However, the blue screen was after the network card
 change.</p>

<p>problem is I am on the internet, I have no problem surfing websites and this error has been going on for ages and the setup never works, it always give this error message.</p>
<p>I've also tried downloading the lifecam installer file (v4.25) from Microsoft and that produces the same error. I also tried running the setup file in compatibility mode and that doesn't work either. wtf do I have to do to get this to work?</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the response.<br />
<div><br />
<div>I had implemented VPN software on a client's PCs, network access was readily available on all PCs for 2 months, when out of the blue a key PC&nbsp;decided that it was a good time for "login failure the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this
 computer..".</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was looking to regain network access through the VPN subsequently I have added the network IPs/Device Names, username &amp; passwords to the credential manager &amp; restored "guest" in the&nbsp;"deny access to this computer from the network" policy.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not too sure why credentials were not stored in the credential manager in the first place as it retains other credentials and the network functioned flawlessly, with exception to the below.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The PC I'm talking about would also be&nbsp;unavailable on the LAN&nbsp;unless it was in a home group scenario, which was fine at first until the VPN &amp; credentials&nbsp;decided&nbsp;they would not play ball. This issue has also been resolved &amp; I have them set to a "work"
 network location/type.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any idea what would cause the negative above outcome in the first place with mirrored configuration&nbsp;throughout?</div>

            Hi danajen,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Answers forums.<br />
<br />
Microsoft doesn’t have any information about the compatibility of this game with windows 7.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=football manager 08&amp;results=50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=football%20manager%2008&amp;results=50</a><br />

I would suggest you to try installing it in windows XP or vista compatibility <span>
mode. <br />

 </blockquote> <p>Thanks for the details, it sounds like they are popping, but just taking more time than normal to do so and in different scenarios. As I mentioned, we're still looking into it, but due to the nature of the beast and having to wait 72 hours to fully reproduce the issue, it may take a bit of time. I'll be sure to come back and update you on this thread and see what we find out. In the meantime, it looks like you're using wireless to connect. For the purpose of troubleshooting this, can you try a wired connection for us, just to see if it has any effect? Please make sure to fill out the survey for any Achievements that have this issue as well when you get the time (after the 72 hours have past).</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks!</p><p><br /></p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>

    <title>Missing network adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> canuck1473  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing network adapter</h2>
                    When my laptop resumes from sleeping for more than 10 minutes my wired network adapter is missing from the Device Manager. The only way to make it reappear is to re-boot. When it is present, my connection to the Internet works fine. The adapater driver
 and Vista are fully patched. The adapter is a Marvell Yukon 8036 PCI-E in a Sony Vaio laptop.
<div>The driver is configured so that power management is disabled.</div>
<div>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</div>

            Canuck1473,<br />
I have not found any other things in Vista that could cause this, but will continue searching for you.&nbsp; In the mean time I have a couple of questions / suggestions.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You said that power saving was turned off on the network adapter.&nbsp; I just want to be sure you have it turned off in all places.&nbsp; Each adapter has different property sheets so your tabs may have different names but basically there are two places on the network
 adapter properties sheets where you can control the power saving - one is on the Power Management tab where you want to disable "Allow the computer to&nbsp;turn off&nbsp;this device to save power" and enable "Allow this device to wake the computer".&nbsp; You also want to
 look on the Advanced tab and see if you have power saving features there that you can turn off or on.&nbsp; Each card has different advanced settings but you should have some settings like "Link Down" or "Power Down" or "Wake Up".&nbsp; You want to be sure any Advanced
 settings are configured to not let the network adpater go to sleep and to allow it to wake up the computer.<br />
<br />
You should also check out your computer manufacturer's web site to see if they have any information regarding this issue, if they have a forum where other users of the same computer may have posted similar issures, etc.<br />
<br />
This article provides a wealth of information on how Vista's different power states work along with instructions on running a command line utility to see your computer's power settings and make changes to those settings.<br />
