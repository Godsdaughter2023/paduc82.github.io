            Are you trying to say that you want your phone to change its theme by its own on daily basis? If yes, then it is not possible at the moment. Use Feedback Hub to share your ideas so that it could be added in the next phone update, if possible!

<h2>            can&#39;t load the &#34;soa.dll&#34; format</h2>
                    <p>I've got the following error message, whenever I'm trying to use the "Export to Excel" feature of the MS Access:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>can't load the "soa.dll" format</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, this error message is displayed only on some computers in our company. Do anybody know, what can be a reason for such behaviour? As this is a native part of the MS Access, I don't see any option, how to solve it. Quite frankly, I'm not much willing
 to program this fetaure again, when this is already a part of the MS Access :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>

            <p>Many thanks for your reply. Finally my colleague Kennedy Simon compared registry keys related to the "SOA.DLL" between a computer, which worked well and the other one. There was a difference in one key name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
The easiest way how to find the right place in the registry is to use the Edit &gt; Find menu option in the Registry Editor, then&nbsp;within the Find dialog check only the "Data" option and try to find the "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\SOA.DLL" string.
 One of results should be the following key name:</p>
<p>00004109110000000000000000F01FEC</p>
<p>But in our case the bad computer had the following key name:</p>
<p>00004109510000000000000000F01FEC</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we have replaced the wrong number "951" with a new "911" value, the Export to Excel started to work without any problems.</p>
<p>It seems, that this registry key is not handled correctly during the upgrade phase of the MS Access program to the new 2010 version.<br />

    <title>My Access 2003 database suddenly broke&#33;&#33; When a form loads it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robfm  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Access 2003 database suddenly broke&#33;&#33;  When a form loads it doesn&#39;t &#34;see&#34; any records in the table that is the record source.</h2>
                    I have been working on an Access 2003 database that will be used to create and manage purchase requisitions.&nbsp; With a bit of help from people on this forum, I had everything working just fine, but somehow things have gone off track.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The database has a table called "ReqsTable" and a form called "ReqsForm".&nbsp; The record source for the form is the table. &nbsp; When a user opens the form, they can fill in the fields to create a new record,or they can use the standard navigation/arrow keys at the
 bottom of the form to move around and review or edit existing records.&nbsp; it is all pretty basic and has been working fine for several weeks.<br />
<br />
But now when I open the ReqsForm it behaves as if ReqsTable has no records in it.&nbsp; It opens to a blank form and the text at the bottom of the window says I am on record 1 of 1.&nbsp; The navigation buttons are greyed out or non-functional.&nbsp; There is no indication
 that any filter is applied and if I go back and open the table, all records are intact.&nbsp; If I enter new data into the form and then close the form, that new data does appear as a new record at the end of the table, so the link between the form and the table
 is intact.<br />
<br />
At first I thought there must be a filter applied, but there doesn't appear to be.&nbsp; (The word "Filtered" doesn't appear on the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen and the filer icon on the menu is clear.)&nbsp; The form simply acts as if the table is empty.<br />
<br />
I checked all the properties for the form.&nbsp; Most properties are blank, and I don't see any that seem to be set incorrectly.&nbsp; The record source is correct and there doesn't appear to be any filter on the form's property list.<br />
<br />
I did discover however, that I can "fix" the form by going to the "records" menu at the top of the screen and clicking on either "remove filter / sort" or "apply filter / sort".&nbsp; If I click "Remove&nbsp; filter / Sort" all records become accessible.&nbsp; If I click
 "Apply Filter / Sort" a sub-set of the records becomes available but it is not clear to me where the specific filter parameters come from.&nbsp; That same menu also has a "Refresh" command on it, but that one doesn't fix the problem.<br />
<br />
One of my co-workers has speculated that Access must somehow run a query behind the scenes whenever a form opens and that it uses that query to link the form with the data in the table that acts as the record source. &nbsp; If that is true, it seems that the query
 is not executing for some reason.<br />
<br />
I think I can recover functionality by restoring an older copy of the database from my backup system, but I would like to understand what happened as I suspect it will happen again at some point.<br />
<br />
Any explanation or suggestions will be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

1- It sounds like the form property 'Data Entry' of the Data tab is set to Yes.&nbsp; If so then change to No.</p>
<p>2- If you look at the 'Record Source' property of the Data tab it will either be the name of a query OR a SQL statement that is indeed a query.</p>

    <title>MS Project VBA - how to target specific Task Usage cells - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Project VBA - how to target specific Task Usage cells</h2>
                    <p>Below is an image of a Task Usage view of a dummy MPP file I've created to experiment with some VBA coding issues. &nbsp;In particular, I am trying to understand how to correctly target particular cells, and have run across a confusing situation: &nbsp;there appear
 to be two separate custom Text1 fields related to an assignment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to read/write to each of the cells (marked below as A, B, &amp; C) as illustrated by the code below. &nbsp;My questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) &nbsp;Where can one view the contents of item "C" outside of a Debug.Print command in VBA? &nbsp;(i.e. can you manually edit this data somewhere; or is it only accessible via VBA code?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) &nbsp;Why are there apparently two separate Text1 fields available to an assignment (items B &amp; C)? &nbsp;MSP's help system at&nbsp;http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project-help/text1-30-fields-HP001025925.aspx?CTT=5&amp;origin=HA010236930 gives me reason to believe that
 only one Text1 field should exist for a given assignment. &nbsp;I also note there are different means of accessing them - one via the ActiveCell object, and the other via ActiveProject using an index number on the assignment, and wonder if that explains anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the insight, which I am clearly lacking.</p>

            <p>Little bit of faulty thinking by Microsoft on Project 2007 I think.</p>
<p>Basically, in a one task, one resource one assignment schedule,</p>
<p>ActiveProject.Tasks(1).Assignments(1).Text1 is a different custom field from ActiveProject.Resources(1).Assignments(1).Text1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people use VBA to copy the same value across so at least they have the same values.</p>

<p>Having slept on it for inspiration, I took another look at this and realized that the statement</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ActiveCell.Assignment.Text1</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">actually targets the Resource version of Text1, (I found the "XXYYZZ" dummy text there) - not the Task version of Text1. &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;This time I looked
 at the Resource Usage view, not the Task Usage view I have been staring at while writing the code.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">That's confusing - why would ActiveCell imply the Resource side and not the Task side?</span></p>

<h2>            Access 2010 Database commands&#47;buttons will not work in Access 2013</h2>
                    Have several databases that I created over the years that started with Access 2000.&nbsp; Converted to Access 2010 and everything worked fine.&nbsp; Just upgraded to Access 2013 and the databases will load, but all of the commands and/or buttons will not work.&nbsp;
 Click on a button and I get an "installing" screen that pops up and goes away really quickly. &nbsp;I've tried&nbsp;to import databases and nothing seems to work&nbsp;to get these buttons to work again.&nbsp;Any ideas?

<h2>            Too many comments on 1 page&#58; strange cursor jumps and window switches</h2>
                    I got too many comments on one page from my co-authors. That is not so much of a problem to me, but it is to Word. If I try to edit a comment-balloon on one of the too-full pages, the page-pane will turn into the comment-pane and the cursor will jump to
 a comment on another page (like 5 pages further). I can still type in the comment box, but without seeing on screen what I am doing since the screen shows the wrong page. If I delete something, it will show up like deleted (track changes is switched on).&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It looks like a very annoying bug. Does anybody has a work-around?</div>

            <p>For the time being, until comments are addressed and then deleted, try making the right-side margin 3 or even 4 inches wide, to allow adequate space for comments and creating better maneuverability while reading reviews/comments.</p>

            Thanks for your help, Mary. Changing the Right-side margin helped a bit. Still, the strange jumps and window-changes occurr, but it is manageable by increasing the margins even further.&nbsp;

<h2>            Office 365 freezes</h2>
                    Since the upgrade of Windows 10 recently, any action other than opening an email causes Office 365 to freeze.&nbsp; The worst is when entering a Calendar item.&nbsp; 30 seconds to over a minute 90% of the time.&nbsp; No, it's not an Internet connection speed issue.&nbsp;
 I had the same problem a few months ago, but it seemed to have resolved. What is going on now?&nbsp; This is supposed to be productivity tool...&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hello JR,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I want to confirm that the Office 365 freezes means Outlook 2016 for Windows client right?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this kind of issue, to help you narrow down the issue, please do the following points:</p>
<p>1 . <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Open Outlook in safe mode</a> to see if there is any difference. Generally this kind of issue may be related by the add-ins and this can help exclude whether this issue is caused by the add-ins in Outlook client.
</p>
<p>2 . Capture a screenshot of the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook version number</a>. Please check for updates if it is not the latest version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have tried safe mode and updated to the latest version but the issue persists, I need to collect some related information:</p>
<p>1 . How many accounts did you configure in Outlook client and what the type of these mailboxes(Exchange, IMAP or POP)?</p>
<p>2 . Let me know the quota of your mailboxes. Go to <strong>File-&gt;Info-&gt;Mailbox Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to contact us when you have any updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

                    I am having a problem viewing Rich Text email. If I receive a new Rich Text email, (not a forwarded email) I am unable to read it. It is just blank. I can create a Rich Text email and people can forward me a rich text email. I have no idea what could be
 causing it.&nbsp;

<p><br />
From what I can see, it happens with any sender. McAfee is my anit-virus software.
</p>
<p>When I started Outlook in Safe Mode, I had the email in question recreated. This time, it come through in HTML format. When I closed Outlook and restarted it normally, it came through as Rich Text format and blank. I looked at the Add-in list and there is
 nothing there I can close. My guess is that requires admin rights to my laptop, and that I dont have.

<h2>            I want my old menus &#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just bought a new Windows 7 PC and Office 2007 to replace my old Windoes XP / Office XP system.</p>
<p>I can not stand - really not stand - the replacement for the traditional menus in word, excel etc.</p>
<p>Is there any way to restore the traditional pull down menus (file, view, edit insert etc.) in the office products and get rid of this very unproductive&nbsp;bloat &nbsp;where the real menus used to be??</p>
<p>I know that I'm several years late with this request - but OMG this is horrible.</p>

<p>Not natively. Did you not try the TRIAL version before purchasing?</p>

<p>I would suggest that while at the moment it might seem hard, if you have any sort of application skills you will very soon be up to speed with the new interface.</p>
<p>I also am a long-term user of Office and actually find it easier than the many many menu items...</p>

<h2>            Insert image from Onedrive to Word online, Excel online and Powerpoint online</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im IT admin at a school. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are trying to use Office 365 online. </p>
<p>But it seems that you cant insert an image into any office online program. . ???????????<br />
<br />
Is this true? Is this really true?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the whole point, in uploading images to a OneDrive, when you cant even use them afterwards?
</p>
<p>It seems extremely ridicules, and i was amazingly surprised when teachers told me that they couldent figure out how to
</p>
<p>insert an image from Office 365 to Office 365. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, there is an option for inserting local images and images from Bing........ SIGH.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole idea of using Office 365 on a school kinda dies, when images cant be inserted into Word/Excel/Powerpoint online.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know Google slide has it downsides vs. Powerpoint online, but at least you can insert an image which TOTALLY overtake any advantages of using Powerpoint online.
</p>
<p>Im very dissapointed and cant for now NOT recommend the use of Office 365 for schools where students share PC's or ipads.

            <p>To make everything even more frustrating, OneDrive online does not allow for copying images.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you cant even go to your OneDrive (online), open an image, right click it and copy it, then paste it to Powerpoint online.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And NO. We wont be aiming for Office 2016 offline installation. That is just not the way forward.

<p>I wont go too much in details, but the whole idea of going online kinda dies when you cant insert an image into Powerpoint/Word online from you file archive.

</p>
<p>And you cant even copy an image from Onedrive online</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is not a good design, the whole point of cloud computing is that we should not have to leverage our local PC's to do something as basic as inserting an image from our Onedrive or our Outlook Groups.&nbsp; These options&nbsp;are in Outlook when you "add an attachment"
 so why isn't the same feature in Word and Powerpoint online?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even the local apps do not allow for seamless access to your Onedrive/Outlook Groups unless you have&nbsp;Onedrive for Business app set to sync all of those libraries which on a shared computer completely destroys any SSD and is not even possible to use in a
 Terminal Server environment unless you want to have 10TB+ of local storage on it which then defeats the purpose of roaming terminal profiles.</p>

 from the web but not from our Onedrive or Outlook Groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, Google Apps allows you to insert into slides and docs directly from your Google drive, no local sync required at all.</p>

            Im more than frustrated about Office 365. Specially when last year Techsoup (microsoft for non-profit) was 2.99 /month with all license. Now that i use the cloud at 7.99 / month... Nothing is working as itsupposed to. Im really pissed off... I think i
 will go back to pirate version for all my clients!

            You can actually open the online excel file using 'Edit in Excel' not 'Edit in Browser' with 'Auto Save' ON. It can solve a lot more complications which you are facing online. As it opens a copy of excel in your local system, which helps you to insert,
 copy, delete images as per your wish. You can also save a copy of the excel in local after editing. Also, there is a download option for online excel sheets.

 then why do in not get an option of inserting images. when i select insert image it give me my local computer to select images.&nbsp; If i have to be bound to a local PC then how can I move to online versions.</p>

            You can select all the text on those pages and paste it into a new document, or you can save a copy of the document and delete all the pages except the ones you want to send.

I had ever used Nokia 6730 classic. I never face problem like that. Did you ever do something on its software, delete certificates or something else? Did your phone can instal Java apps previously?

            I got the same problem. I can't install any jar or java application. Previously I can install java but the problem happen when I update my firmware at cellphone technician. And I also can't personalize my profiles and as well as certificate management.

<h2>            E55 Constant internet connnection - WHY&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Forum,</p>
<p>Please can one of you help me? I cannot stop my E55 from connecting to the internet via my service provider (T-Mobile).</p>
<p>Everytime I stop it by either pressing and holding down the end call key or by disconnecting via the active connections icon, you can be sure that withing 60 seconds it will connect again. This happens almost all the time I cannot stop it.</p>
<p>I have updated the phone's software to version 022.009 (14th October 2009), but this doesn't seem to have cured the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a known bug with the E55? Why does it do it and is there anyway that I can stop it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to anyone who can help,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            You probably have an application that it set to go online regularly. Typical suspects are messaging applications, navigation applications, weather and news applications etc. Most of these applications usually have settings you can for access points which
 you can change. One or more is probably set to go online automatically. &nbsp;

<p>Check whitch programs are using your connection. Check the settings of these apps and set accesspoint to always ask. In the packet data connection setting swich from when avaiable to when needed as explained in the manual on page 141.</p>

<p>Hi guys, thanks for your reply, but I'm afraid I've tried both suggested solutions and neither have worked. I closed every single app on my phone and shut down the connection, then 30 seconds later, it connects to the T-Mobile internet. There is no data
 being transferred apart from the initial connection of packet data, at the moment it's 610b/762b, so I will leave I untouched for an hour and see if there is anything transferring data. I don't have any applications apart from Opera which uses the internet,
 I've switch off all other GPS/Maps etc, it's annoying me! :mansad:</p>

<p>FOUND IT !!! Guys, thanks for your help. It transpires that when you load Hotmail/MSN onto your phone, it defaults to ALWAYS synchronise in the HOTMAIL settings... it's hidden away deep in the bowels of the application, but it was winding me up so much that
 I looked and looked until I found what was causing it to happen.</p>

<h2>            Email Address error when sending invoices from Quickbooks through Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Quickbooks 2016 accountant</p>
<p>Outlook 2010</p>
<p>Windows 7 64bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click to send an invoice from Quickbooks via email the outlook window comes up with the correct information. &nbsp;The problem happens when I hit send. &nbsp;The address in the "to" field goes blank and Outlook gives the error saying:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Could not complete the operation. &nbsp;One or more parameter values are not valid"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The address in the "to" field becomes invisible, and the field itself cannot be entered into anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to get it to work is to delete the address in the "to" field, and then enter it again. &nbsp;After that, it sends normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any advice you may have for this issue.</p>

            You will need to open Cortana and sign in with the same Microsoft Account as the one you are using in Windows Mobile and you will see all your notes and Cortana activities on your Windows 10 device and they will be sync.

<p>Actually that does not work, because Cortana saved the notes as One Notes. So, I downloaded the One Note App and synced it with my phone and that solved the problem.</p>

<p>If by "contacts lists" you actually mean "Contacts folders", then you should click the Contacts or Folder List view button at the bottom of the Navigation Pane or press Ctrl+3 or Ctrl+6, respectively.&nbsp; The Mail view is the default Navigation Pane view and
 the Mail view shows only folders containing mail items.</p>

            I understand that the Mail view is the default setting.&nbsp; My contact lists in my address book used to be in the Contacts folder list at the bottom of the Navigation Pane.&nbsp; Now all I have in the Contacts folder at the bottom of the Navigation Pane is the
 basic contact list - not ones that I have created ie: Family contacts.&nbsp; I can only access the contact lists I have created by opening the address book now.&nbsp; My created contact lists used to be available in the address book and in the Contacts folder at the
 bottom of the Navigation Pane.&nbsp; I would like to have access to my contact lists in the Navigation Pane as I did prior to following the steps I mentioned in my first communication.

    <title>Paragraph styles not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Paragraph styles not working properly</h2>
                    I use Word paragraph styles regularly (Office 365 for Mac 2016), and have included in many paragraph style definitions the style for the following paragraph, which saves keystrokes or clicks. Beginning in one of the later updates to Office for Mac 2011,
 that stopped working in several of my defined paragraph styles. For example, when I finish typing the NAME line in a resume, the following style is supposed to be ADDRESS, but Word took to making it another NAME paragraph. Other defined paragraph styles worked
 as defined. I had hoped I might get full functionality for that back in 2016, but I installed it today, and now it appears Word fails to recognize the following paragraph definition in most or perhaps even all of my defined paragraph styles. Is there something
 we can do to make this feature work properly? I also have the Office 2016 installed on a PC as part of my Office 365 subscription. The feature works fine there.

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's get the first thing out of the way. Don't compare Office 2016 for the Mac to Office 2016 for the PC. They are different products, different Operating Systems controlling them, and though they may share some code, the name was determined by MS Marketing,
 whose concepts and proclamations have never been based on reality. In other words... don't compare the products... they are absolutely not the same!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to get down to business of your problem... since we cannot see how you have setup these styles we need to see screen clips of the Modify Styles dialogs both for the Style that you say is not passing the "Style for the following paragraph" setting over
 to correctly and the Modify Style dialog that shows the settings on that next paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once we've got those then maybe someone will be able to see what's causing the issue you are having.</p>

            <p>Rich is correct: the two products are almost unrelated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to take a wild guess here that your issue has sprung from the Linked Style bug (sorry: "feature").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you know styles well, you will know that they can be of multiple types, and those types determine which properties they can contain. &nbsp;The three types in play here are "Character", "Paragraph", and "Linked".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As its name implies, a Character style can store only font properties, such as the name of the font, bold or italic, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Paragraph style can store all of the paragraph properties: such as space before and after, line height, etc. &nbsp;It can also store the "Style for following paragraph" property that you are relying on here: a Character style cannot store or use that property.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we come to a "Linked" style type. &nbsp;Microsoft considers it a feature, many others consider it a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A linked style is a composite style that contains a Character style and a Paragraph style linked together. &nbsp;If you change the font name in the paragraph style, it will also change in the character style of the same name. &nbsp;Any paragraph style can be a linked
 style. &nbsp;Any paragraph style can BECOME a linked style if it is used a certain way. &nbsp;When you apply a linked style, you are never very sure whether you have applied the whole thing, or just the Character style half of it. You can't prevent the change, control
 it, or undo it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens depends on the selection you had when you applied the style. If your selection is simply an insertion point ("no" selection) and you apply a paragraph style, you will get a paragraph style. If your selection includes the paragraph mark at the
 end of the paragraph, you will get a paragraph style. If your selection is more than one character, and does not include the paragraph mark: &nbsp;1) &nbsp;Word will instantly split the paragraph style in two and create a Linked Style with two halves. &nbsp;It will 2) apply
 only the Character half to the selected text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From that point on, you can never be quite sure what you have in your document, and the style is permanently changed into a style of type Linked. &nbsp;You cannot change it back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's assume that when typing the NAME in your example, you did not have your paragraph marks and other non-printing characters displayed. &nbsp;So you did not see that you have not selected the paragraph mark at the end of the name line. &nbsp;You applied the Name
 style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word would instantly split the Name style into Character and Paragraph types, and apply ONLY the Character half to the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you hit Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word will create a new empty paragraph: at this instant it has no formatting properties at all contained in the paragraph (Word shows this kind of paragraph as a "Normal style" and copies all of its properties from the document defaults).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word will then read the style applied to the previous paragraph to decide what to do. &nbsp;It's a Character style of name "NAME" (remember: Word made your Name style a linked style and applied only half of it). Because a Character style can't contain paragraph
 properties, there is no "Style for following paragraph" property. So Word simply continues the Character style Name for the paragraph, setting its paragraph properties from the Normal style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are we having fun yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were to notice the error, triple-click the paragraph, and re-apply the Name style, next time you hit Enter it would work. &nbsp;Because this time you DID have the paragraph mark selected, Word applied both the Character and the Paragraph halves of the
 linked style, the paragraph properties including the Style for Following Paragraph have been correctly applied, and will work. &nbsp;Until next time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Around year 2002, I called this the "Partially applied styles bug". &nbsp;I complained long and hard during the beta. I tried desperately to explain that a document professional needs to KNOW exactly what their styles contain, needs to know exactly what is being
 applied to the text, and needs to know that only he or she can change the style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was ignored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leading to the "Corrupt style table" bug, in 2007. &nbsp;Internally, Word indicates a "Linked" style by appending the label "Char" to the end of the style name. You can still sometimes see these labels if you look at the style table in the Organizer. What can
 happen is that each time the user mis-applies a style (because they have their paragraph marks switched off...) Word copies from the current linked style, and simply appends another "Char" flag to the end of the name. &nbsp;I have seen nine "Char Char Char Char
 Char..." applied. Eventually, the space for the style name overflows (I think it's 127 characters, doesn't matter exactly how long...). &nbsp;from that time on, the style is corrupt. &nbsp;You can apply it to text, but you can't change it (it goes read-only). &nbsp;It appears
 your changes are made, but they are silently ignored. &nbsp;You can't re-name them or find them. &nbsp;If you delete them, everything they were applied to reverts to Normal style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Char char char" part of the bug has now been fixed (Word will resolve the name back to only one Char label). &nbsp;But the original Linked Styles bug remains. &nbsp;It's a design bug. &nbsp;A mis-feature. It causes the problem you are reporting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it won't be fixed because they think we LIKE it that way. Because whenever Microsoft asks about it, nobody knows what they are talking about. &nbsp;Rather than admit they have no clue how styles work, everyone just says "Yeah they're fine".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long answer, but I think this is the source of your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In which case, the 'cure' is ensure that you always have the whole paragraph, including the paragraph mark, selected when applying a style. While your document style table will remain ruined, at least your styles will then do what you expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that having to triple-click every paragraph to ensure you have a whole selection is a pain, I made a series of macros that do the same thing. &nbsp;Here is one:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sub</span> ApplyGraphicStyle()</p>
<p>' Apply Graphic Style</p>
<p>Selection.Paragraphs.Style = "Graphic"</p>
<p>End<span> </span>Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>What that simply does is read your selection, note which paragraphs are in that selection, then apply the style to each of those paragraphs. &nbsp;So it can apply the style ONLY to the entire paragraph, regardless of what you have selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>Hi Rich,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. Here's a screen shot of the NAME style that usually begins my documents. My core business is writing resumes, which are fairly heavily formatted documents, although I also do a good bit of other writing and editing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, when I create a new document, I begin by applying the NAME style and then populating that paragraph. I then hit RETURN. Until one of the more recent updates to Office 2011, my style definitions worked perfectly, and the next paragraph was assigned
 to the correct style. Then, it they began to fail to work, although not on every style. I had hoped that when I upgraded (?) to 2016 this problem would have been fixed. Instead, it was worse, it did not work with any of my paragraph styles. So I got on the
 phone with Tech Support, and we ultimately reinstalled Office 2016 (I have a 365 subscription, so have it on more than 1 device - both PC and Mac, but Mac has been my main work machine since Vista drove me away. When I tested a document, there was no joy,
 so back to the phone to MS support. Then....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly, the problem I wrote (and called MS) about seemed to have gone away. At the time I called again, the reinstall had not fixed things, but when I tried to show the tech what was happening, suddenly I couldn't make it happen anymore. It applied the correct
 style for the following paragraph when I hit RETURN, and all the styles seemed to work correctly from then on. I can't explain that, because I didn't change the way I do things. But in any event, I am no longer able to duplicate the problem. And, since I've
 replaced 2011 with 2016, I can no longer show you screen shots of paragraph styles that work and those that don't. But all my paragraph styles were created the same way and ended with "Following style: Style name" as this one does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I guess I'm good for now. Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also replied to Rich, with a screen shot of one "Modify Style" dialog. As I noted, the problem seems to have fixed itself as I was unable to duplicate it for the 2nd MS support person in a sharing session. I can't explain that, but your discussion of how
 styles can be applied and how the selecting the paragraph can affect how that works seems reasonable. But...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't often apply styles to paragraphs after creating them unless I decide midway or at the end in a document that I need to reorganize it. I apply the style and then do the typing. The "following paragraph" just saves a lot of keystrokes or mousing for
 me. So when the "following paragraph" feature began not to work, it really slowed me down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do have to reorganize a document and apply different styles, I usually just click once in the paragraph and apply the style using a keyboard macro I recorded for applying that style. Most of the macros I use are for applying paragraph styles.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, John, back in 1998, when I was doing a tech writing gig for Tivoli/IBM, I had to learn Word (I had been a WordPerfect shop). I found your discussions of using styles to create stable documents very helpful. I still use your suggestions in every
 document I create, and you won't find an instance of a NORMAL paragraph in any of my Word documents. All my docs are based on BODY TEXT, which is based on NO STYLE to be sure I've entirely broken the link to "normal.docx".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to both you and Rich. I'll let you know if the problem reappears. But I've now tested several new documents and everything seems to work properly. No idea why, though.</p>

            <p>Hi Dan:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your kind remarks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was asked by a prospective customer today "What kinds of documents are you familiar with?" &nbsp;My answer was: well, during the past 40 years of professional practice, I haven't missed many..." &nbsp;I don't think I got the job :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this issue was caused by a rogue linked style, but as to how it got there, I have no idea...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't imagine either. For resumes, I have used the same style definitions and templates for quite a few years. Just suddenly in the later releases of Office 2011 it began to show up and became more and more frequent until with the update to 2016 it failed
 consistently. You know, I sometimes get the same kind of response when a prospective resume client asks what kinds of disciplines I specialize in. I don't specialize; no resume writer can and make a living. But in nearly 30 years there aren't many occupations
 I've missed. That doesn't satisfy some people, though. Again, thanks for your help. I'll keep an eye on your posts. And since Office 2016 doesn't offer the capability of easily customizing the Quick Access Toolbar, I'm considering going back to Windows as
 my main work platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
