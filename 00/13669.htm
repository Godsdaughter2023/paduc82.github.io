<h2>            Why can&#39;t i find a real Visualizer in the Zune Software&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using zune for a few years now, and the only "visualizer" I have ever seen is the "now playing" tiling of album art.</p>
<p>I have tried updating my software, but it is up to date. I have seen a how to video for "how to play visualizers in zune software" and it said to use an options menu, which i don't have in my version. I've tried using other music software, and tried installing
 several different visualizer programs, none of which have changed the zune software at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm just wondering if zune has a REAL visualizer, and if so where/how do I get it??</p>

            There is no visualization aside from the Now Playing slideshow, and the subtle pink waveform effect / visualization below the song seek bar when in regular mode with premium graphics enabled (bet you never noticed that one!)

    <title>Email Recieved from Microsoft, was I hacked&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Email Recieved from Microsoft, was I hacked&#63;</h2>
                    Hello all,<br />
<br />
I received an email from Microsoft today, <br />
<br />
Message Header:<br />
<span>Microsoft account security alert<br />
<span>Microsoft account security alert<br />
</span>
<p class="contentStandard">Content:<br />
<br />

<table>

<tr>
<td>Security alert</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We think that someone else might have accessed the Microsoft account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. When this happens, we require you to verify your identity with a security challenge and then change your password the next time you sign in.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Learn how to make your account secure. (There was a Hyperlink Here, removed.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thanks,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Microsoft account team</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="contentStandard">Before I did anything, I checked the email address that it was sent from, it was legit, came from:<br />
Microsoft account team &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;<br />
<br />
Which is were all of my confirmation emails come from in regards to changes to my account.<br />
<br />
The button (Recover Account) sent me to https://account.live.com/, which is also legit.
<br />
<br />
So I changed my information as per request, and it did indeed successfully change my Microsoft information (Logged in here with the new PW).<br />
<br />
So my question is, I see online other people are getting this email, a lot of them think it is a scam. My question is, why are people getting it? And if it IS a scam, why would it send you to nothing but legit sites, using Microsoft Support's legit email?</p>

            I should note, just to be safe, one other website I used, had the same PW as the PW I changed, so I changed it as well. I also used a unique PW that I have never used before for my new Microsoft account PW, enabled my Keyboard Encryption as well. Anti-Virus
 did not trip when I followed any hyperlinks, nor were any anti-intrusion alarms set off, will do a full system scan later.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Received the same email. Is it legitimate? "Someone started a process to replace all of the security info for the Microsoft account..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I&nbsp;have had no end of problems with my Hotmail, which&nbsp;have been ongoing for 3 years despite changing my password every few months. Many old email addresses formerly from&nbsp;my contacts (which I later deleted) are continually spammed in my name.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any recommendations to stop this, as closing the account doesn't stop my name and old email being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

</blockquote>
<p>You've asked your question in the wrong forum, so you'll likely get such terse responses here if any at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've read some of the same posts I just did, it's fairly clear that some of these emails like yours are real alert notifications from Microsoft Account Security.&nbsp; Your own verification of the links in the message seem to confirm this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the reason you see so many warnings that the message may be fake is that some of them are, since the phishing message creators have learned to use modified versions of these and similar messages in order to collect user name and password information
 from less careful people than yourself.&nbsp; So both answers are really correct and only you can confirm the&nbsp;correct answer for your own message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the safest method is to simply avoid clicking the links in the unsolicited message directly and instead look for&nbsp;an alternative path to the real information you require.&nbsp; the best of these that I found is the following, so forgive me for providing yet
 another link, since that's the only way that we can truly provide those with these concerns any real help.</p>

            <p>Hey Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! Your reply helped a bit. I wasn't sure where to post this, hence why it ended up here, but I appreciate your response.<br />
<br />
I am about 90% certain this was legit, now it's just a matter of figuring out why I got it. I was thinking it maybe had something to do with the recent hack of Xbox Live, but I will see if I can contact someone in that department and see what's up.<br />
<br />
I suppose all I was looking for was clarification that this matches up with the standard email that is usually sent out. AND, I was looking to see if I could maybe get a feel for why so many people seem to be suddenly getting these messages.</p>

            <p>That is how Autonumbers work. There is nothing you can do about it. Nor should you. The only purpose of an autonumber is to uniquely identify a record. That is why a number is generated as soon as you "dirty" the record (meaning you start data entry). &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response. It must behave the way it does but what irritates is not their behavior. It is infact the saved record which is in the table even if I don't save a record.</p>
<p>Dear I am not asking it to behave some other way. What I want is that this number must not populate the table and when the form is closed, next entry must have the autonumber = previous_record+1 rather than a previous_empty_record+1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly see for this issue. I hope I have been able to convince you my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Khurram</p>

<p>I am facing this irritating problem that as soon as I put the cursor in any data entry field, or click the checkbox of yes/no, auto number is populated and although I don't save the record and close the form, this auto number is given to the table and new
 number is given to the new entry. Kindly help me in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>The autonumber will be generated as soon as you begin editing any bound control.&nbsp; So of course it will be generated when you click a check box and change its value.&nbsp; I would not expect it to be generated if you just click in a text box, unless you have code
 or a macro that in some way dirties the record when one of the fields receives the focus.&nbsp; If that is happening, you should look to see what code or macro is making it happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to discard the "dirty" record, press the Escape key once or twice until the "editing pencil" disappears from the record selector and the autonumber field resets to "(autonumber)".</p>

            <p>This is the way Access works. If you "dirty" the record as soon as you move to another record&nbsp;or close the form the record will be saved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do as Dirk suggested and hit Escape until the record clears. Or you can code a Cancel button that will do, essentially, the same thing. But once the record is dirtied, the autonumber will be&nbsp;used and you can't get it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to sequentially number the records, see my blog on Sequential Numbering. However, you should make sure you need&nbsp;sequential numbering.&nbsp;I don't really see a need for it based on what you have told us.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Visual Voicemail in Australia for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Visual Voicemail in Australia for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have researched visual voicemail on multiple sites, but everything I've found seems very Generic towards US carriers.
</p>
<p>I have outright purchased a 950xl and a 950 (for dad).</p>
<p>Both will be running on the Vodafone Australia network.</p>
<p>The Voicemail tab that seems to pop up on the US phones isn't visable on my phone.</p>
<p>I have turned on V.V. on Vodafone by ringing 1217, but nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Has anyone got an idea of how to get Visual Voicemail working?</p>

            <p>Ok after some time I discovered that this Symbol means that ringtone Sound is activated. When deactivated another Symbol appears (one Music note that is crossed out). As I supposed, this means that the two notes, meaning that my phone is functioning&nbsp;are
 superfluous and misleading. Thanks Microsoft..</p>

            Brilliant... thanks for this... though my issue was that the profiles all stopped working... the two music notes just stayed next to the battery symbol and the profile just stayed on general. After the suggested reset all is back to normal... it's a great
 simple little phone that you don't know you've got it's so light. Thankyou

<p>Hi Joseph. Thanks for taking the time to report this issue. What app are you using to watch/listen to media? I'm trying to get as close to your scenario as possible to try to reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, are these steps correct?</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch a video or audio file. Note the current volume level.</li><li>Pause the playback (for how long?)</li><li>Resume playback. Note the current volume level (this is where the issue occurs).</li></ul>
<p>Result: Volume has audibly increased, though the volume slider shows no change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the volume slider.</li></ul>
<p>Result: The slider will suddenly jump to the correct (increased) volume level?</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Result: The audible volume will return to the original level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Jeff</p>
<p />

<p>thanks for your help. The probleem occurs usually when Im watching a stream in Chrome. When I pause and resume the volume has as you said audibly changed but the slider shows no changes. When I than move the slider the audio jumps back to the original level.</p>

<p>Hope it's not too late to add some observations, but I'm able to reproduce this issue in Groove Music with the pause/play trick.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my system (Windows 10 Ent 64bit), I can only reproduce if playback is paused for at least 2 to 3 seconds. After I hit play, volume jumps to a high level. If I scroll the volume down wheel on my keyboard just one click, volume drops back to the previously
 set level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue occurs when using the software pause/play button as well as the hard pause/play button on my media keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for investigating this issue.</p>

<h2>            In Outlook 2010, what is an &#34;Attachment information&#34; file &#63;</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I am using Outlook 2010 and have just noticed an email that has expected attachments but also unexpected "Attachment information" files for each "real" file....the info file opens with Notepad and says the "real name" but also says ZIP-archive.<br />
<br />
The attachments are note in a zip file (but could have been originally though).<br />
<br />
Anyone know what these "Attachment information" files are ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

    <title>Excel 2013 - Turn Off or Disable Ribbon Animation for alt-Shortcut - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> knickolai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 - Turn Off or Disable Ribbon Animation for alt-Shortcut Keys</h2>
                    <p>I am wondering if anyone has found a real solution to this issue yet? With Excel 2013, when you use alt-keyboard shortcuts, a ribbon animation cascades for all of the possible keyboard short cuts. This both extremely annoying and substantially slows my ability
 to execute commands from the keyboard as I have to continually wait for the cascading animation to finish displaying letters of the possible key selections. As others have noted, with a system restart the cascading animation is tolerable for a short period
 of time (it is reasonably quick at first). However, it then progressively goes slower .... slower .... Slower .... and SLOWER until completely unbearable again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of the solutions I have seen suggested: 1) disable the hardware acceleration within Excel (did not work), deselect "animate controls and elements within windows" from control panel (did not work), and updating my video driver directly from
 the vendor website (did not work). Of course, if a restart was required by those "solutions", they might seem to be working for a short time. It was just a deception because it was really the system restart that temporarily speeds things up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read there might be a possible modification that can be made using a group policy to stop this animation. Has anyone attempted that? If so, what was the outcome?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole issue is SO annoying. I simply cannot believe Microsoft did not provide a way to turn off this keyboard shortcut animation for those of us who do not need or want it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,<br />
</p>

            I don't think it is possible to turn of the animation but this feature should not slow your ability. Check to see if you have any addins and turn them off. See if that would make a diff...

            <p>In my case, the alt-shortcut key animation absolutely slows Excel to the point that I am waiting for it to finishing cascading the shortcut letters before I can execute the next command. This is not a problem I ever experienced with earlier versions of Excel.
 Others have shared the exact same issue in this and other MS related forums.</p>

 This should not be a hardware or operating system issue, but something with Excel itself that causes this lag.

            Hi Yanna,
<br />
<br />I do not have a Mac and am writing from my experiences with the Windows version. That version is similar, but the two are not the same. While I've used Word on a Mac, that was a long time ago. Nevertheless, I hope that I can be of some help.
<br />
<br />By default, macros, AutoText and keyboard shortcuts are stored in the normal.dotm template. Here is my page with directions on how to locate that template. Look for variations on the name as well as backup files with a different size or date.

<br />----------------------------------
<br />
<br />I've been using Word for more than 20 years. I generally try to keep these customizations in other files and still make regular backups of my normal template. I just used one of those yesterday!
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards

<p>Hi Yannacone,</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you, we would like to know where&nbsp;all your macros, autotext and custom keyboard shortcuts are set up. In Normal.dotm as Charles mentioned?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unless there is some sort of critical issue with your Mac, simply restarting it would not cause what you are describing. As Charles replied, those customizations are stored in the Normal.dotm template which isn't accessed by anything other than Word... and
 only when you launch &amp; are running the program. Please provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances beginning with the specific reason for the restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a thought: Do you have more than one User Account on the Mac? Those customizations are user-specific, so if they were done while logged in as 'user1' they would not be available if you're logged in as 'user2'.</p>

<p>I am aware of the multiple user problem. I also used disk utility did check the start up disk and there were no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an old backup of MyTemplates and I carefully opened the Normal in that template using the file open and double clicking. It showed me one of my old macros. Now I would like to transfer that old macro to the new Normal.dotm (global template) which organizer
 shows me is being gradually repopulated with my styles and auto text entries.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that whenever I open a new document in Word it is supposed to use that template for the new document incorporating all of its styles and macros as well as auto text entries.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I use a number of different new document styles I routinely created .dotm files which contained all of the set up features for these pages and I called them from the MyTemplates folders since they were specific to me as the user. The macros all seem
 to be gone and the new one I just made today does not appear in the document created by opening the Normal.dotm&nbsp;file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relatively complex macros have been critical to my activities since the days of WordPerfect and I have struggled with each new generation of Microsoft word since I moved to Macs. I would appreciate any help or Direction towards source material which can
 explain how Word stores macros.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like tpo know how to copy and back up the "global tmplate"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for all your help. I apologize for being a bother.</p>

<p>Dear counselor: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, and helpful advice. I have fond memories of the 1969 Winter in Madison during the final battle of the DDT Wars the DNR hearings at the Capitol. ( http://yannalaw.com/about/major-litigation/ddt/madison-ddt/ )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your website is very well done and informative. However when I tried the VBA code
</p>
<p>
</p><p>application.document.NormalTemplate,OpenAsDocument</p>
<p>
</p><p>on an empty Word document, I received the following error message</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compile error:<br />
Method or data member not found</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, to move on, like to adopt your practice of "keep[ing] these customizations in other files and still make regular backups of my normal template." I would really appreciate it if you would share the procedures and/or method used to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

<p>Thanks again to everyone for your help and concern. I have never actively tried to store macros in any particular file. When I create a macro it is usually in some lengthy document where problem has arisen which are macro would resolve quickly. I create
 the macro on the fly using the "Record Macro" from the Drop down tools menu. The box provides the ability to choose between storing the macro in the current document or "All Documents (Normal.dotm)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless it is truly a document specific macro I always select the "All Documents" option.
</p>
<p>However, now, if I call up the Normal.dotm as a document by double-clicking it the new macro does not appear when I use Alt+F8 nor when I use Tools&gt;Macro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just created a test macro, pp2p (changes ^p^p to ^p) and I tried to load it. It now appears as
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normal.NewMacros.pp2p</p>
<p>
</p><p>and</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project.NewMacros.pp2p</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what is going on or what I did any differently from what I have been doing for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for all the help and advice. </p>

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen on videos and screen shots on websites that when you're in contacts on Outlook 365, and in people view, when you click on a contact you get quite a bit of information displayed in the contact card section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As below (sorry about the quality. I screen grabbed it from a training video):</p>

<p>
</p><p>But mine look like this, and I've got no idea how to change it to display the more expanded information?!?!?!?</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for the response, but unfortunately that's not the issue I have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's the lack in information being display in the contact card / reading panel that's the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the screen grabs above, the first option has things like Contact, Notes, Organization, What's New, Membership as headings, and loads more information displayed below these heads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting none of that.</p>

<p>Hi Andy,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did some research and checked several different versions of Outlook 2016, I found that the first screenshot you uploaded belongs to the Outlook MSI version. I checked "People" view on my side with the latest version of Outlook 2016
 click-to-run version, it is just the same as yours. For your reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/office_integration__sharepoint/2016/06/23/determining-your-office-version-msi-vs-c2r/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/office_integration__sharepoint/2016/06/23/determining-your-office-version-msi-vs-c2r/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, this is a normal behavior that the people view just showing summary info for your Outlook. If you want the option has things like Contact, Notes, Organization, What's New, you need to change the version of your Outlook to
 MSI version. The following link will show you the detailed steps to do this.</p>

<p>Hi there Coldwell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That makes sense now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the link to change the version and got the message below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5237c924-7b0c-4b4b-947e-4aaed0661885?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5237c924-7b0c-4b4b-947e-4aaed0661885?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Yes. But since posting that response I'v e looking into things further.</p>
<p>Seems that the new link creates a custom xml file, that configures what version the Microsoft Download Tool installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So considering I've currently got Office 365 Home, will this be a problem, because the only version available (apart from Enterprise) is 365 ProPlus. Is that the same version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also will re-installing over the top of the current version be enough to convert from C2R to MSI?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            MS PROJECT 2013 PAGE SET-UP&#47;LEGEND</h2>
                    <p>When setting up the page "legend" from the Page Setup menu/Legend tab, I find that I can not change the "Company Name" and can find no place to modify the "Subject" entry. In earlier versions of Project you could do this from the Properties tab under the
 File menu, but I can't find anything similar for this version. I've read some forum entries that describe doing this only during the initial installation for an "Organization" listing, but nothing for "Subject".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get to these two entries once the program is installed?</p>

</p><p>Microsoft has buried the path to display the Properties dialog.&nbsp; Here is how to get there:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the project in question</li><li>Click File &gt; Info.</li><li>On the right side of the Info page, click the Project Information pick list and select Advanced Properties.</li></ol>
<p>You will now see the Properties dialog for the project, where you can change the Company field and the Subject field as well.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you've performed this step but the issue persists, please try manually setting up the server address: click options on the sign in page&gt;Personal&gt;Advanced&gt;under Manual configuration enter sipdir.online.lync.com:443 in both internal and external

</p><p>
</p><p>Opened a Excel file from One Drive and found all the last updated and changes were missing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>File flagged with last update date correctly but not reflecting any of the substantial changes made at last update.<span>&nbsp;

                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>Not long ago Microsoft released SP2 updates for Office 2010 Products,</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>It's mentioned that (&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2687455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2687455</a>&nbsp;) :</div>
<div><span>Microsoft Office 2010 Service Pack 2 (SP2) provides the latest updates for Office 2010. This service pack includes two kinds of fixes:</span>
<ul>
<li>Previously unreleased fixes that are included in this service pack. In addition to general product fixes, these fixes include improvements in stability, performance, and security.</li><li>All the public updates that were released through May 2013, and all the cumulative updates that were released through April 2013.</li></ul>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please provide us with&nbsp;Previously unreleased fixes that are included in&nbsp;each SP2 update (Project-&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2687457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">2687457</a>,

            Some of the features that was fixed for Project that I came across are:<br />
<ul>
<li><span>Applying updates causes assignments to lose work and tasks to lose duration.</span></li><li><span>Time-phased views of cost resources not displaying correctly.</span></li><li><span>Booting Project 2010 when connected to a Project 2013 server generates a confusing error message.</span></li><li><span>Custom fields not totaling correctly.</span> <br />
</li></ul>
<p>These are some of them and there are lot of tweaks and updates and I feel Project 2010 seems to be stable for now. Well atleast for me and my company folks.</p>
<p>You need to work with it and find out yourself as to what changes are made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure about Visio and Visio Viewer as I do not use them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AFAIK, MS will not provide info on what updates and tweaks are being made unless it is required and there is a problem that is caused after installing the update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, I came across this link. Download the Excel Spreadsheet and check for yourself.</p>

<h2>            How do I stop Powerpoint from asking me to turn on Intelligent Services&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I understand Microsoft is trying to help -- really, I do. But PLEASE STOP!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I drag or paste an image to Powerpoint, a new sidebar opens asking me if I want to turn on intelligent services. I click "not now." I paste another picture, it asks again. And again. And again, and again, and again, and... There is apparently no
 way to tell Powerpoint not to turn on these "intelligent services." When I have tried turning them on, just to get Powerpoint to shut up already, and let me work, it starts doing all sort of funky stuff when I paste an image. So I turn it off. And then it
 starts asking again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really interrupts my workflow enough that I'm thinking about using some other piece of software to start doing presentations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop Powerpoint from asking me if I want to turn on "intelligent services" each and every time I do anything?</p>
<p>

<p>I was able to repro this, maybe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Design Ideas needs Intelligent Services in order to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you enable Design Ideas in File | Options but disable Intelligent Services, it turns the nattering on.</p>
<br />
<p>In any case, try disabling BOTH and see if that helps.&nbsp; Seems to do the job here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing you're closing the Design Ideas pane by clicking the X in upper right corner, though.&nbsp; If you click "Not now" instead, it should leave you alone until you re-enable it.&nbsp; Again, seems to do the job here.</p>

    <title>Problems with page numbering - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with page numbering</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-word/how-can-word-be-so-shockingly-bad/ca561076-811a-4199-998c-1bbc578b4c10" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I totally agree. It's ridiculous how terribly difficult Word is to use. I don't want to just rant about it; I've been using Word for as long as I can remember, but it's so much more trouble than it's worth. I sincerely wish that there was another program
 I could use that could do what I want it to and also be compatible in my line of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a document that is upward from 300 pages. I'm having trouble with the page numbers. I've been scrolling through page after page online. Asked tech support. Even called Microsoft for assistance--they did the remote access and all of that... the
 guy I spoke to spewed a bunch of tech jargon and basically told me he couldn't fix the page numbers unless I paid whatever sum he asked for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed everyone's advice. I've done the paragraph thing to check for page breaks. There were none. No page breaks were inserted in the document. Spaces and paragraphs and tabs... I even ran the macros to check... None. I did the Alt, Shift, P... I
 did the Alt F9... There are no new sections, but I tried them anyway. When I did this I was really excited because I thought it was working. I got down to about an 8th of the document before the pages started messing up again. It was just one page off so I
 thought it'd be simple to correct. I followed the instructions&nbsp;just like I had before and instead of working, it sent me back to the top of the document and all of the numbers were off again! Imagine my frustration! I'm sure you can't. I actually tried this
 about seven times, trying different variations. Trying to do the same thing slightly different each time. Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a deadline. I really have to finish this document. I really can't fathom why it wouldn't work. Honestly. It is one document. No page breaks, no sections. Page one to page 300whatever and yet the page numbers do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really sincerely hope someone here can help me because I am going grey here. No one seems to understand why it is not working.</p>

            <p>Always the customer's fault, isn't it? I find it particularly ironic that a user who has spent several hours trying to solve a problem that should never have arisen in the first place by following various people's advice is now being told that it's not difficult
 and given more supposedly simple advice. Let's see if it works this time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the question of defaults, it's not a question of what the default settings are but of the fact that the way the defaults work is obscure, inconsistent and nonsensical. To my mind, wallowing in naive nostalgia, a default is a factory setting you get
 when you install the program. It shouldn't revert to default every time you choose a new tool. If I've just drawn a black square with no fill, isn't it likely the next one I draw will also be black with no fill? At least more likely than one with blue fill?
 I suppose that's my fault too.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>"It's not difficult." To me, that says the fault is with the stupid customer who just can't perceive the wisdom of Word, not with the design of the product (using the word "design" in its loosest sense).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm perplexed that MS are not concerned about what their customers (i.e. me, for example) think. Do I complain about every product I buy (or rent, I should say in this case) like this? No. Why not? Because most of them do what they are supposed to do, and
 when they don't, the suppliers usually admit it and try to do something about it.</p>

</p><p>You are reading quite a lot into a simple statement... With most things, it is true that if you take the time to learn something, it turns out that it wasn't so difficult as it first seemed to be. There is always a learning curve, especially with new versions

            <p>I understand that, as with all programs and software, you have to get used to them and learn to navigate them properly, but Word is a very difficult program for me to master. At least, this newest version of Word. I just need someone to walk me through my
 issue in a way that someone who spends their life reading fiction novels and not computer manuals can understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unfortunately cannot send you the document. It is a manuscript that I am editing. I am responsible for said document and cannot allow it to be read or downloaded by any outside parties. Thank you anyway.</p>

            <p>It wasn't my intention to start such a debate. I don't want anyone getting heated over my issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word, to me, seems to be a very difficult program to use, but the people who are trying to help shouldn't be held responsible for that. I think it's important that we all maintain a certain degree of politeness on these types of forums. It's easy to rant
 and forget that the people on the receiving end of the messages are in fact people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If perhaps you know some way to assist me then I would appreciate it. </p>

            <p>Ms. Barnhill</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read several of your posts and they seemed to be quite helpful to others. I have gotten no feedback on my issue, as you can see. Is there anyone who can actually give me advice on my particular issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot send the document, as I said. I have followed all of your instructions. I tried uploading the document onto another computer. It was initially typed on a computer using an earlier version of Word, 2007 I believe. I switched it from "Compatibility
 Mode" to a Word document (when I asked tech support, they told me that this was the issue), but when I called Microsoft, I was told that&nbsp;that was not correct&nbsp;(XMS or XLM?... I can't remember). So I changed the type of document again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really unsure of what to do. I have no clue as to why it won't work, but I have a deadline so if someone could help me sooner rather than later with actual, helpful, feedback it would be very much appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>The -- in your version is in the wrong place it must got before the NOT negation like this</p>
