<h2>            Cumulutive update KB3163018 fails to install</h2>
                    <p>KB3163018 fails to install. Windows 10 downloads it, the system reboots and attempts to apply the update, fails and then undoes the changes. This seems to be a problem others are having as well (e.g.: see
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/update-for-1511-kb3163018-downloads-but-will-not/10e1768d-54d0-44d7-ae11-839409d83751">

<p>
</p><p>Here's the short error message from the event viewer:</p>

            <p>Updating the thread after I managed to install the update. Perhaps it'll help someone, if they get error code 0x800F0922.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(At least for me) the problem was some sort of a contention between the update and my system using the UEFI secure boot option. If that's the case, you need to (temporarily) disable UEFI secure boot and install the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More info and credits to the guy who posted this thread:</p>
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/526163/uefi-secure-boot-may-cause-windows-updates-to-fail-with-error-code-0x800f0922/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/526163/uefi-secure-boot-may-cause-windows-updates-to-fail-with-error-code-0x800f0922/</a>
<p><br />
Hope this helps someone.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>p.s.: the procedure described in the thread above requires disabling/enabling UEFI secure boot. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>- You need to reboot your Windows into troubleshoot mode by holding the SHIFT key while clicking on "Restart".</p>
<p>- After a few seconds, you should get to a menu where you need to select:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Troubleshoot -&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; UEFI Firmware Settings -&gt; Restart</p>
<p>- After the reboot, you'll get the Boot Manager. This stage is different for each Boot Manager, but you need to search for an option called something like UEFI options/settings and disable UEFI secure boot.</p>

</p><p>I'm glad you sort this out, however my computer doesn't support UEFI, or EFI. So I guess the problem is something else because I'm unable to install this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tryed to fix Windows update, with no&nbsp;sucess and I've also tryed to download the update and manually install it, and also with no sucess.

            <p>This update rendered my Alienware X51 R2 unusable.. It had appeared to have installed the update fine. When I logged in things were very very slow.. Much of the tray icons were not loading etc. So I did a hard reboot since my computer would not accept input.
 After this it kept trying to repair and would not complete successfully. At one point it mentioned this error when trying to do a Restore; The instruction at 0x00007FFC1E8C6B8C referenced a memory at 0x0000000000000008. The memory could not be read. Click
 OK to terminate the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a fix for this!!! I do not have the original cd that came with the computer as I bought it from a friend who's basement flooded. He lost those items in the flood. The computer was upstairs and not affected. It had been doing fine as far as updates,

</p><p>Afaik, Alienware belongs to Dell, and assuming their systems are anything like Dell's, they should have a dedicated recovery partition left there by Dell during the original OS installtion. Assuming that's the case, you should be able to get a Dell recovery
 disk from somewhere (their website? a friend? any shop which sells Dell systems) and restore to a clean installtion of Windows - at least to the version which was installed when the system was initially sold.</p>

            Well I remembered I used a USB flash drive to do the Alienware recovery program backup a while back. I inserted the stick and it seemed promising. I gave me two choices reboot from hard drive "recommended" or from USB drive. I chose hard drive and it went
 back into the attempt to repair the hard drive again. Should I have chose the USB option? This is call Alienware Respawn. The repair attempt is still running at this time.<br />

            <p>I think you're referring to the native Windows recovery option. The recovery I was referring to was Dell's recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make a long story short, Dell bundles another, independent recovery mechanism in (at least some of the) systems they sell. If you have that, you may want to give it a try as well, seeing as the Windows native one seems to be broken for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recovery information is stored in a partition named "WINRETOOLS", if memory serves me right. Go to "This PC" and check if one of your partitions uses that name, and if does then you might be able to use it to recover. Google the name for details on how
 to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>Same issue,&nbsp;KB3163018 wont install, boots 4-6 times attempting install, and just fails. Is there a fix? SFC doesnt find any problems. Also on a side note, cant install Visual Studio 2015, just straight up fails by crashing. Wondering if they are related.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fixed this issue. Seems is directly related to .net 3.5 installation, which in my case was corrupted. After fixing that issue which required deleted old profilelinks from registry to get 3.5 to actually uninstall via the add features option, installed without
 problem.</p>

<p>FYI-the below worked for me, resolved problem &amp; can now use for hiding "bad" updates in the future since Microsoft doesn't provide "hide/delete updates" in Windows 10:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>is there any way to delete/hide updates anymore ? can't get rid of "Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3163018)" no matter how many times tried to update via reboot, msg. "unable

</p><p>I am also having the same problem, however I have already purchased and activated the game from a third party source, and I would like to play it asap. I have to download it through the windows store app and I am getting the same error as Corbin. I am definitely

 is that you need to upgrade your Windows 10 manually by using the Media Creation Tool. This solution worked for me.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Check your Windows version by typing "<em>winver</em>" to
<em>Run</em> command<em>.</em>&nbsp;If your version is not 1511 (10586.xxx) or newer and you haven't received this through Windows Update, you need to upgrade your Windows manually.</p>
<strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong><em>(Optional but recommended)</em>&nbsp;Make a backup of your system and important files on the system disk just in case. Your files should remain intact through the upgrade process, but you never know.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Media Creation Tool (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Media Creation Tool"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</span></a>)<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Run Media Creation Tool and choose "<em>Upgrade this PC now</em>". The process should take around 30 minutes to an hour. All your files should remain intact - although a backup never hurts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 5:</strong>&nbsp;That's it! Once the process is done open the&nbsp;Microsoft Store app and you should able to purchase Quantum Break. If there are any problems check your Windows version with "<em>winver</em>" and see if it's upgraded.</p>

Ich habe die Windows 10 Education Version und kann keine Spiele laden. Ich wollte Forza oder&nbsp;
Quantum Break runter laden aber ich soll mein Windows updaten. Und mein Windows sagt ich habe die aktuelle Version - Ernsthaft Microsoft? So kann man Win 10 nur wieder deinstallieren!

    <title>Xbox One and multiple gamer tags and consoles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigdaddybrian1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One and multiple gamer tags and consoles</h2>
                    Anybody have an idea how multiple consoles in one house would work? I have 3 kids each with their own gamertag, was wondering if I bought 3 Xbox ones if my tag would be the primary on all and have the other 3 tags as users under the new family pack or
 whatever it will be called or am I going to have to pay for multiple subscriptions? And will I be able to play all of the consoles at the same time? Originally when the One was introduced it sounded like it would be ideal for my situation but now since the
 backpedal might not be quite as appealing. And any ideas on the sharing of content like dlc with the other accounts?

<p>I'm aware the family plan is cancelled. Microsoft announced that you could have several accounts under a main or primary account. My question is can I run multiple consoles simultaneously with the different gamertags listed under that account and share digital
 content. I have 4 gamertags currently and the family plan worked well for me, except for having to buy multiple games and dlc. When it was announced that I could consolidate and only have to pay for one live account that could share content, it sounded good
 to me. But with my understanding there could be an issue for multiple consoles in the house now that they have changed there drm policy</p>

<h2>            Problems installing Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit with RAID drivers</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit, and am having problems installing.&nbsp; I have 2x 250 GB HDDs that I have always had running in a RAID 0 config, stripped.&nbsp; When I try to install WIndows 7, this is the procedure I take and
 the result...</p>
<p>When my RAID configuration pops up before boot, I press ctrl m to go into the config and set up my RAID 0 array</p>
<p>I boot to the Windows CD and when i get to the part where I need to select the partition for installation, it does not recognize any drives.&nbsp; I have to load the RAID driver that i have on a floppy disk (which i downloaded the lastest version for Win7 64)
 and then the installation will see the 500 GB partition.... so far so good.</p>
<p>Windows will install up to the point where it has to reboot for the first time.&nbsp; Once it does, it will get to the "Starting Windows" phase and get a BSOD.&nbsp; It pops up to fast for me to read it.</p>
<p>Then the computer will reboot again, and the RAID array will be gone.....&nbsp; It says "No Array Exists"</p>
<p>If I try to install Windows without creating an array, it does not work either.&nbsp; Says that I cannot install on the disk.</p>
<p>And I cannot figure out a way to install WITHOUT RAID.&nbsp; If i set the disks to IDE in the BIOS, the installation will also tell me that I cannot install.... I dont get it :(</p>
<p>I have an Intel D975XBX2 motherboard.&nbsp; Is this a RAID driver problem??&nbsp; My RAID always worked fine with Windows XP.</p>
<p>Please Help.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

<p>During the win7 installation you need to select the option to install third party drivers from usb or cd (your sata raid controler)</p>
<p>And since winxp to win7 is a clean install you will lose everything on your array / drives</p>

<p>Hi Jordan,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>You can stop Windows from restarting after the blue screen with a setting in the Control Panel.</p>
<p>Click Start &gt;Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; System &gt; Advanced system settings &gt; Startup and Recovery</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fq82pka.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pEOEPefBKdKWL4L9ruj8gQMpYHfRK8OhuPjQwXkfHYfV9QHIasE5WkmSdi7nwI33hD4Fs3Lv2YeAKVJdMaXLGCUWubCN_g-01%2fno_restart.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should prevent the system from restarting after the blue screen. Please post the full error message in this forum, verbatim.</p>
<p>From that information we might be able to better understand the issue.</p>

            Im actually running into this same problem tonight during the INSTALL.&nbsp; I'm using the Marvell Raid and loading the drivers just as the op said.<br />
<br />
After the install, Windows tries to do its FIRST load sequence, and it fails, restarts, and my RAID configuration is shot to heck.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any thoughts?<br />

            hi there i have the same problem too but found a way around this problem.<br />
the raid array in th bios will be fine, the way around this is when you would get to the part where the harddrives normally are, go to load driver option and load the 32 (86) raid first and that should show your harddrives up, then go to load driver option
 again and then do the 64bit raid driver, you should still see you harddrives then too, and continue with the install, hope this helps.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Creator&#39;s Update&#58; Search Not Finding Apps</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have clean installed Windows 10 Creator's Update on two different computers. On both computers, searching for an indexed app (indexed shortcut located in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu) yields no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have verified and toggled the settings for the following (manually rebuilding the index each time) :</p>
<ul>
<li>The start menu folder is selected for indexing (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu)</li><li>The shortcut file type is selected for indexing (.lnk)</li></ul>
<p>When comparing the number of indexed items before and after the Start Menu folder is added, the total number of indexed items does increase an appropriate amount, leading me to believe the indexing is correct, but the start menu search is not correctly displaying
 the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see the following screenshots:</p>
<p><br />
Indexing options:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25272967-b93e-4d54-ac87-a7876a073405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25272967-b93e-4d54-ac87-a7876a073405" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Indexed locations (Start Menu selected):</p>

<p>
</p><p>Indexed file types (.lnk selected):</p>

<p>
</p><p>Example search for Word (with Start Menu folder showing Word Shortcut):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e333d09e-235b-470d-a57a-339a2eeffd61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e333d09e-235b-470d-a57a-339a2eeffd61" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again, please note this issue is affecting two different computers that were both clean installed with Windows 10 Creator's Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions!</p>

<p>I have found a fix for the problem, but note that this is a Windows 10 bug that has cropped up with the release of the Creators Update. Thanks to this thread for the fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_cortana/search-cant-find-installed-apps/c1bdf712-fdf3-4e8f-bd52-27d6df50210d</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The current fix (until Microsoft addresses the bug), is to turn on the Background Apps "Let apps run in the background" master switch (found in Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Background Apps). All the apps can be turned off individually, but the master switch must
 be turned on. After a reboot, search should start working normally again.</p>

    <title>MS Surface Pro Pen only has one button for index finger&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul kepp  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Surface Pro Pen only has one button for index finger&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why in the world did they do this? I'm looking forward to getting my first tablet (been a Desktop creator with a Wacom Intuous Draw all this time) and getting a Surface Pro 6 and went in the store and my heart sank when I saw this. I draw in 3d and need
 two buttons. Why would they try to copy Crapple products? Even the arc mouse seems to only have one button. Someone in your design department doesn't know their butt from the proverbial hole in the ground.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see some third party pens that have two buttons that should work. So I suppose I'll start with that. Hopefully they work alright, I'm completely confounded that you would design stuff like this and not check if the design is something useful for 3d modeling/sculpting.
 Not everyone is buying your expensive hardware to make dumb little doodles in paint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so shooting yourself in the foot, MS. (on top of that, my current $80 Wacom tablet working with Microsoft Ink has been a chore and stuff stops working and needs restarted all the time. Windows Ink needs a lot of work.) Why stop there though? How
 about eliminate half the keyboard too? I mean I like insane and stupid decisions sometimes too, and I think if you're going to make them you should just go all out and completely puzzle the consumer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell ya what, I'm a tech wizard with a degree and lots of experience and currently studying to be an independent game developer with Blender, Unreal Engine 4, Substance Painter, Marvelous Designer, and someday Zbrush. But if you have a vacancy, you can hire
 more for a reasonable amount and I'll assist you in showing you what you do wrong. I know C++, C#, and Python also. Let's help one another because whoever is coming up with these simplistic approaches is doing you no favors. People who understand tech want
 their tech to be less like an Apple product, not more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice how controllers for games started with 1 button, then moved to 6 or 8 (Atari Jaguar tried doing 30-40 or more, not my cup of tea but perhaps someone enjoyed having all those) and now has settled around 12-14 or so. Would you release your newest Xbox
 hardware with half the buttons as the last? Why should this be any different?</p>

<p>On top of that you have to hold that button and tap the screen to right click and you can't even change that behaviour.<br />
I think it is a way of trying to be more like a***e by stripping down configuration options. But we want those options, that is why we stayed with MS. I don't even have a problem with having to do 2 hours of research to collect all the nessecary drivers from
 different places to get pen pressure working properly on a 1300,- € 5th generation device of which the hard- &amp; software is developed by microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you could give us the option to modify the right click behaviour in a way that we only have to click the button without tapping the screen. And please fix the issue with the pen freezing every 1-2 minutes for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except for those flaws it is a great device. The keyboard is marvellous.</p>

<p>Oh gawd, I just purchased a Pro 6 a minute ago. I'll have it on the 27th. I'm feeling worried now, maybe I should've saved more for a Wacom product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do 3rd party pens have these flaws? I'm used to just clicking a button for the right click. Have you tried the Windows Ink and the Pen and Touch settings on control panel? I can't believe they would okay this without that feature. If it doesn't, I seriously
 doubt they test this with actual modelers and graphics people before releasing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, I'll probably end up still using my $80 drawing tablet with my $1700 tablet, which would be absolutely stupid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what do you mean the pen freezes? I thought this was advertised as having zero lag??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting quite nervous.</p>

<p>Depending on where you purchased it you may still have the option to test it for a few days and return it if it does not fit your needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some research when I got mine and still think it is the best option in terms of form factor (mobility, all-in-one pen tablet computer). Wacom mobile studio for example seems to be bulky, heavy, have loud fans and worse battery runtime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am, like you, a developer myself and am exclusively using windows to be able to use zbrush. The fact that it would probably take me a few days to fix those things if it was not all closed source makes me sad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But nonetheless I am having a lot of fun with the device doing some zbrush modeling or paintings in krita on the train during my commute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone at microsoft will look into those things. If not for the minor flaws I think it could be dominating the market of digital artist computers.</p>

            Just checked, there are alternative pens available with two buttons on the side. That may solve the issue for you if these are configurable. The freezing issue seems to only affect a few devices esp. the 5th gen 8gb fanless i5 so you may be lucky.

<p>Yeah, and the two button ones are rechargeable too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, then I feel a lot better. If you go to pen and touch settings on control panel, it should let you turn off the having to tap the screen while pressing the button, right?</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is no way to configure it in the Windows Ink Pen settings.<br />
<br />
Last night I have found a workaround that involves using a tool called autohotkey. It is described in this thread (https://autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=30422), use at your own risk and read the scripts first. Obviously this is only suited for developers
 (in terms of, they will be able to make sense of the script when reading it to avoid running any malicious code)&nbsp; and still it involves installing the autohotkey application. Anyway it is working well for me so far.</p>

Happy holidays.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community</span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern, I suggest you to boot the computer in Safe mode and see if the issue still persist. Safe Mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows from
 starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Please refer below link on how to boot computer in safe mode.<br />
</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809468</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;To exit from safe mode, restart your computer and let the Windows start normally.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also perform a clean boot. Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Note: </strong>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to restore the Windows 8 Tablet PC to factory defaults using the System Recovery DVDs and install using an external&nbsp;USB DVD drive.&nbsp; And after setting it all up again, the same issue exists, "after I configure a Picture Password and
 log off (or reboot, or shutdown), when I go to log in, my only two options are a) local password, b) email".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device is an Acer ICONA W700 Tablet PC (a very nice device).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process I followed;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(After restore to Factory default)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Log in, creating a local account, then join this local account to a Microsoft Account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Add features to Windows 8, and use a purchased licence key to move up to Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Run Windows Update to apply all Windows 8 updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Run Apps Store update to apply all updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Add the license to Microsoft Office 2010 and then run Windows Update again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) Join the Tablet PC to a Windows SBS 2003 Domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) Set a domain user as a local administrator (so that they can install software when required), and then log out, after this I only use the Domain account when working on the Tablet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8) Log in&nbsp;as a domain user, add/link the user's Microsoft Account to their domain account so that they can access the Windows Store, and Windows 8 Mail program.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9) Assign a Picture Password, log out and go to log in [no Picture Password option is available]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10) After rebooting and logging in, and shutting down and logging, still no Picture Password login option.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11) Log in with domain password and removed picture password and recreated a picture password, shutdown and when powered on and go to log in, there is still no Picture Password log in option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12) Another issue: When I attempt to apply updates in Windows Store, about 10 updates fail.&nbsp; I believe several succeeded, and one even wanted a reboot, which I did. These remaining apps just will not update, they fail with an error code. Skype is one of
 these updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will again have access to this device in about a months time.&nbsp; So if anyone has helpful suggestions, I can take note of them and try them later on.</p>

            <p>Hi all, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After further research, maybe Domain Joined Users are not allowed the option for Picture Passwords, nor the "Require a password on wakeup" option either ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried changing the setting of&nbsp;<b>Turn off picture password sign-in</b> but this option is still not giving them the option to create a picture password.&nbsp; Are there other options that I need to know about, GPO settings, etc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found the below two web sites that indicate that "<strong>picture password is disabled in remote and network scenarios</strong>".&nbsp; Is this true? And is there a way to override this ?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<em>Also, picture password is disabled in remote and network scenarios, preventing network attacks against the feature</em>."</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/12/16/signing-in-with-a-picture-password.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/12/16/signing-in-with-a-picture-password.aspx</a>&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Testing with a third Windows 8 Pro computer and a different Windows SBS 2003 server,&nbsp;I still have not Picture Password logon available for login, but it is available for configuring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This time when I installed Windows 8 Pro, I set&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Turn off picture password sign-in</b> to be disabled, and after I joined the Windows 8 Pro computer to the Windows SBS Domain, the "Create a picture password" is still available.&nbsp; However when I set the
 picture password, and reboot/logout/lock the screen, there is never a Picture Password option available for me to log in with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have spent so much time trying different scenarios, and building Computers to test with, this is so frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have Windows 8 Pro or Enterprise working with Picture Password on a Windows Domain, if so please let me know, and what environment/versions you are using.</p>

            <p>After being able to get my third Windows 8 Pro computer to display the "Create a picture password" option for Domain Users, I decided to go back and do further tests on my second Windows 8 computer on which I was unable to get this option to display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I did&nbsp;learn was&nbsp;that a local account on this computer did not have a password set, and that once I assigned a password to this account, then all accounts on the computer were able to see the "Create a picture password" option.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This indicates that<strong> on a Windows 8 computer, if any account exists without a password, then the "Create a picture password" option is not available for any of the accounts</strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After being able to set a picture password, I found that the Picture password would not display on the logon screen, only the password and email address logon options were available on the Logon screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After removing the computer from the domain, and then using a local account, I was able to assign a picture password and get the picture password to display when at the logon screen.&nbsp; Elated by this success, I then re-joined the computer to the Windows SBS
 2003 domain, only to find that the Picture Password on the logon&nbsp;screen was no longer available. I even set a Picture Password for a domain account, but still no Picture Password logon option on the logon&nbsp;screen, and back to only the password and email address
 logon options only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From this I draw the conclusion that <strong>Domain Users cannot use a Picture Password for logging on</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was wondering how a Domain joined computer would be able to display the appropriate Picture Password for whoever was logging on at that time. That is multiple different people can log into a Domain computer, so which picture is going to get displayed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe there should be a option for "DefaultDomainPasswordPicture" where people could share the same common domain picture&nbsp;because they are unlikely to choose the same logon sequence ?&nbsp;
<em>Er, maybe not such a great idea</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any response from a Microsoft representative, please?; regarding if it is official that Picture Passwords will not be displayed for Domain Joined computers ?</p>

<h2>            laptop continuously rebooting, regardless of safe mode&#47;normal mode</h2>
                    My laptop has been continuously restarting for the past 2 days when&nbsp;I turn it on. I am using windows professional. I have tried pressing F8 to try and run it in safe mode but it still restarts again. I have also tried reloading the windows xp cd whilst
 it restarts to try and see if any files are missing that can be reloaded however I cannot get to the welcome to setup screen because it keeps restarting.
<br />
I have also tried&nbsp;using the&nbsp;disable automatic restart on system failure option and this came up:<br />
<br />
UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME<br />
...<br />
<br />
***STOP: 0x000000ED (0x86f7Be30, 0xC0000006, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know what else to try. I am a university student that has all my work on this laptop. I don't want to lose everything!<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Restart laptop and keep tapping F1, F2 or Delete key <br />
<br />
To get to bios and look at boot order make&nbsp;the 1st to CD-ROM and 2nd harddisk<br />
<br />
If that does not work try<br />
<br />
Downloading hirens bootcd and burn it&nbsp;to a cd and restart computer and boot to&nbsp;XP mini&nbsp;and use the tools to recover your info,<br />

Thanks for your reply.<br />
I have already tried this and I think I've made things a lot worse by doing so.<br />
The laptop is now asking me to re-install Windows XP all together. I told this to a friend who works with computers and he said if I did that&nbsp;I I would risk losing everything on my laptop for good.<br />
I can't get past this 'stage'.

            Hi Missbee90, <br />
<br />
Your friend is correct, You will lose data and installed 3rd party programs.<br />
<br />
Can you bring the laptop to him.<br />
<br />
Then he could take out the harddisk and copy all your data.<br />
<br />
(ie. Application data, My Documents, Favorites, Desktop. )<br />
<br />
Then reinstall XP and copy and paste the above back to your user name folder.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Home Premium will not load - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelc09  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium will not load</h2>
                    <p>I am currently in Safemode with Networking. Both safemodes work just fine.</p>
<p>However, my Normal Windows 7 Home Premium will not load. I get a black screen after Startup. Windows won't even go to the User Access Page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was at my Desktop and Clicked on Mozilla Firefox browser. When, a Prompt came up asking if its 'ok' to Dump firefox into the Recycle Bin. It then gave me 29 prompts asking if this is 'ok'. Of course I clicked 'No' which then froze my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, I Hardbooted the computer and went to restart. After loading system bios... all my computer would achieve was a black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then I have done a system restore to several days before. And that did not repair the problem.</p>
<p>My guess is that I corrupted some system file? Or is it a virus. I'm using basic Avast protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to me with more information. Thank you</p>
<p />

            <p><span>Hi Michael,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are getting a black screen after start up.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may unplug all the external devices except keyboard and mouse and check if you are able to boot to the desktop and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;I would also recommend you perform startup repair. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;To perform a Startup Repair follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Please insert the Windows 7 DVD and reboot the computer.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>When we are prompted to press a key to boot from the DVD, please press Enter or the space bar.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Choose your language settings, and then click next.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click Repair your computer.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click next.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>On the System Recovery Options menu, click Startup Repair. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries to fix the problem, and if necessary, it might restart your computer as it
 makes repairs.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below for more information about startup repair:</span></p>

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for an update on this query.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to gather few more information on this issue:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you logged in as an administrator on the computer?<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not logged in as an administrator on the computer, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to login as an administrator copy the contents of the game to a location on the hard drive of the computer and then try to install the game.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the steps:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to the link to login as an administrator on the computer:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<strong>How do I log on as an administrator?”</strong><br />

<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to copy all the contents of the game from the game disk to a location on the hard drive of the computer:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) <strong>Right Click </strong>on the game disk drive and click on <strong>Open</strong>.<br />
b) Select all the files on the disk drive and copy the files.<br />
c) Paste the files on a particular location on the hard drive.<br />
d) Locate the setup or the<strong> .exe </strong>file from the list of the files.<br />
e) <strong>Right Click </strong>on the setup file and select Properties.<br />
f) Click on Security tab.</p>
<p>g) Under <strong>Group or User names</strong>, click your name to see the permissions you have.<br />
h) Click <strong>Edit,</strong> and then click to check the check boxes for the permissions that you need, and then click
<strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><br />

    <title>Computer Whirring when Idle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benbrooks_856  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer Whirring when Idle</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I must start by saying that I really know nothing about computers. Absolutely nothing, so please treat me as though I were an imbecile. I have a windows computer, I exclusively play games on it, it's never caused me issues. Until a few weeks ago. (possibly
 coinciding with me upgrading to windows 10) Whenever I leave my computer alone, whether that be at a pause menu in a game, or simply whilst at the home screen and completely idle, it will, without fail, start screaming out. I don't know what part of the computer
 it is, I only know that it happens every single time without fail, and never whilst I'm in the middle of actually using the computer. The noise continues until I turn the computer off. I then have to leave it for a few minutes or else when I start it back
 up again it will instantly resume with the noise, before I've even gotten to the log in screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ben</p>

            <p>Hi there, and thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've just installed the latest update for windows since I saw your advice. I'm yet to see if that fixes things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure my drivers are up to date as I just looked and worked out I already have them on automatic updates, plus on the updates page in my settings it now says everything is up to date. But it did help me to remember another change I made to the
 computer at around the time that it began to make the noise. Immediately following my upgrade to windows 10 my F710 gamepad (basically a logitech version of an xbox360 controller) wouldn't work on my games anymore. So after some searching I found I had to
 install a new driver for windows 10. So I did that. I don't know if that could possibly have caused an issue or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the make and model of my computer. It's a custom built PC made by PC Specialist. It was about 3 years ago when I purchased it though and I don't remember all of the actual parts inside it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it turns out I need to clean boot, will it erase any files or anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(sorry for my obvious stupidity regarding this matter and all things computer related)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi there, Yes I do have Norton, though I do not believe it is related. Firstly, it doesn't appear to be running scans and whats more, if I were to leave the computer idle, this noise would continue day and night forever, not just during isolated incidents.
 Furthermore, the noise isn't a slight increase in volume, it whines horrendously and it sounds as though the computer is actually in the process of self destructing, for lack of a better analogy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you though!</p>

            Windows 10 changed the way fans work in PC, for whatever reason. The power supply fan is making funny noise when I shut down the computer. Not only that, the extra case fan has started to scream after Win10 install. This is clearly a Windows 10 feature,
 most likely not caused by any programs or drivers. Microsoft should explain what they changed in Windows 10 in this matter.<br />
