<p>Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Answers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This can be caused if there are too many files in the Windows temp folder.<br />
To delete the temporary files click start -&gt; trye %temp% and press enter -&gt;&nbsp; delete all the files and folders completely. Also make sure the recycle bin in empty.<br />
Once its done try reinstalling the program.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also try creating a new user account and try.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regards,</p>

            Well, with my experience this is the error i encountered when i tried to install mysql and also it occurs when you try to install xampp....<br />
<br />
The solution is to begin the installtion as an administrator...i.e. either...<br />
1. right click on the executable and click on "run as administrator"...or<br />
2.temporatily turn off the UAC....<br />
<br />
the second one worked for me....hope this is helpful...if not please post back...

<h2>            folder tree and files stuck in read-only</h2>
                    
<p>I have a folder tree rooted at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim".&nbsp; I tried editting a file _vimrc in that folder using a 3rd party editor (Vim), but it could not open the file for writing.&nbsp; When I right-click on the file and open its properties, read-only is
 not set.&nbsp; I also checked the Security tab of the Properties, and Administrators (I am using an account with admin privileges) have Full control, Modify, Read &amp; execute, Read, and Write permissions.</p>
<p>I tried opening it with notepad, making a dummy change (erase and put back a letter), and saving it again.&nbsp; I get the message that I don't have permission to save in this location.&nbsp; So I opened the properties for folder "C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim", uncheck
 read-only, and Apply.&nbsp; I am given the option to apply this setting to that folder only, or to that folder, subfolders, and files.&nbsp; I choose the latter.&nbsp; I am warned that I need admin privileges to change that attribute, and I press Continue.&nbsp; When I re-open
 the Properties for "C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim", it is still read-only.&nbsp; The Security tab shows that Administrators have Full control, Modify, Read &amp; execute, Read, and Write permissions.</p>
<p>How can I get rid of the read-only for "C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim" so that I can modify the file "_vimrc"?</p>

<p>The read-only attribute of folders is ignored by Windows 7. It has no effect.</p>
<p>When I need to modify a file in one of the protected folders that I previously mentioned then I do it like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log on under an admin account. </li><li>Click Start. </li><li>Type the word notepad.exe into the Search box. </li><li>Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter </li><li>Click "Run as Administrator". </li><li>Open the file and modify it. </li><li>Save the file, then close it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ol>

    <title>Xbox one S Fortnight edition Controller has a headphone jack issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> racoon city police  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one S Fortnight edition Controller has a headphone jack issue</h2>
                    <p>So I was able to confirm that its the brand new controller and not the headset.&nbsp; A friend of my sons came to my house with his headset and controller, in his controller the xbox sees both head sets, but as soon as we use my sons new controller it shows a
 muted mic on the top right of the screen.&nbsp; Everything else in your problem solving has failed.&nbsp; The headset is compatible and verified. Hard reset doesnt fix it, its not a setting, ect ect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for others out there the problem is likely to be your controller and the quality of the product which is disappointing.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Hi RCP! That is really no bueno that your controller audio isn’t working this quickly after getting it. I can say the build quality of the audio jacks is actually really good, and they use a pretty unique mechanism inside to make sure it doesnt break even
 when I drop my controller with headphones attached for the millionth time because my cat has personal space issues. You’ve already done the troubleshooting, so you’re good to go there. At the bottom of this link you can start the process of getting your controller
 repaired or replaced. Cheers!</p>

<p>Hi Racoon City Police,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry you are having issues with the mic.&nbsp; Here is how you unmute it.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wired-headset-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wired-headset-help</a>.&nbsp;
 If that doesn't help you tried all available solutions&gt;&gt;I recommend you returning the controller for a new one.&nbsp; Or if you have another controller getting an adapter is best because sometimes the 3.5mm jack stop working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, also you could try going through the accessories part of settings and see if the controller has a firmware update available and see if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesnt fix it then i would return the controller to the retailer with the receipt as that will be a quicker turnaround than a return to microsoft.</p>

    <title>Permanently &#34;disconnect&#34; touchscreen feature on Toshiba laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> limonkay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Permanently &#34;disconnect&#34; touchscreen feature on Toshiba laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello, is there any method to "hard" disabling a touchscreen feature on a Windows 8 laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally purchased the touchscreen Toshiba laptop thinking it would be of use, however after a year, the touchscreen went berserk (just clicking everywhere on the screen on its own). I was able to disable it through device manager, however ever time
 I try to install Windows 8.1, it re-enables itself and the Windows 8.1 installation crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, is there any wire inside my laptop that'll let me unplug the touchscreen feature permanently? I do have a small amount of experience opening laptops and working with them. OR is there any option to permanently disable the touchscreen interface
 beyond Windows 8 refresh/recovery?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be appreciated, thank you.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Re-installing Windows vs. Restore to factory conditions</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, is re-installing Windows and Restore to factory conditions the same thing?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a virus on my computer that won't go away and I would really like to restore it to factory conditions.&nbsp; I have already re-installed windows 3 times in the last month and the problem remains.&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember in older windows versions, I could hit
 F10 continuously upon start-up and perhaps go into Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone could provide me instructions on how to do this, I would really appreciate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want the longer version of my issue, it is as follows.......</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the last month or so windows will open a new tab randomly.&nbsp; If I hit the back button or try to go to another website, it simply open up more tabs.&nbsp; The computer then freezes for
 several minutes and I can't do anything.&nbsp; It happens with both Google and Edge browsers.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Please note - this is not me simply clicking on a website and it opening in another window.&nbsp; But rather, clicking the back button or another website and it opening
 the current page in multiple tabs - sometimes as many as 10).&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi Tim.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If the problem persists after a reinstall then it's carrying something forward that should not be.  I would wipe the driver to eliminate this possibility doing the vastly superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />When you back up your files or if you already have then they need to be in quarantine until scanned with Malwarebyte and AdwCleaner, before reimporting them into the fresh install.  If not these are an infection path.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Greg, thanks for your fast reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it involves taking many steps to fix the problem, I just printed out the article that you posted and will give it a try tonight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will let you know how it goes in a day or so.</p>

<p>Hi Greg.&nbsp; Thanks again for your willingness to help.&nbsp; Things aren't going so well right now....</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I followed the steps and downloaded Windows on to a USB flash drive.&nbsp; I had plenty of space.&nbsp; I think 30 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I went into the BIOS and everything went well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Exiting the BIOS and I got to the Windows Setup page where it asks for:</p>
<p>Language </p>
<p>Time and Currency Format&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keyboard or Input Method</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good.&nbsp; Then I delete partitions as instructed.&nbsp; At some point it asks me which version of windows I want to install and the options are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 S&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10 S N</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home N</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home Single Language</p>
<p>""""""""""&nbsp; 10 Education</p>
<p>""""""""""&nbsp; 10 Education N</p>
<p>""""""""""&nbsp; 10 Pro</p>
<p>""""""""""&nbsp; 10 Pro N</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I am not sure which one I have, I started with Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will then take me to the screen that says:</p>
<p>Installing Windows</p>
<p>Copying windows files</p>
<p>Getting ready....</p>
<p>Installing features</p>
<p>Installing updates</p>
<p>Finishing up</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I think great... it is almost done.&nbsp; But then it will take me back to same "Windows Setup Page"&nbsp; described above.&nbsp; Then I have to start over again.&nbsp; &nbsp; I next tried Home N, and have used all except the Education and Pro N.&nbsp; I will try the Pro N next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried once to just remove the USB flashdrive and check to see which Windows version I have, but I couldn't find it.&nbsp; I'm not sure if since i deleted the partitions that everything is there for it to work.&nbsp; When I tried this, I could not even connect to
 my Wifi - it would not show that any networks were available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what do I do next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

            Tim -
<br />
<br />You'll need to reinstall the licensed version or it won't activate.  
<br />
<br />How did you first obtain Windows 10?  If it was the free Upgrade from Windows 7 or 8 then it was most likely Home version unless you know for sure you had paid extra for Pro or had another version which is rare for consumers.  
<br />
<br />I believe what's happening is that you're not following the illustrated steps in the Clean install tutorial which clearly say to use on the BIOS Boot Menu key at Startup to boot the media as a UEFI device if offered.   It sounds like you're instead  doing it the old way by setting the media to boot first in BIOS setup which will cause it to start a flash stick install over and over again every time it restarts during install.  
<br />
<br />So again and for the fourth time I'll plead with you to follow the illustrated steps in the Clean Install tutorial which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>Hi Greg.</p>

<p>
</p><p>But, last night I decided to take a fresh look at it.&nbsp; Turns out I needed to turn off the Legacy Boot and then use another F key- F9 to boot the USB.&nbsp; And it re-installed.</p>

<h2>            Fable vs Oblivion</h2>
                    
<p>I am planning on buying a new 360 sometime soon, and I have chosen a bundle, but it comes with Fable and Halo. Now, I've never played Fable, but my main question is: do Fable and Oblivion have any common parts? Do they have the same type of game play? I
 have Obivion here with me, but I wasn't 100% engrossed in it. Then I heard of Fable, and I looked at some screen shots, and they look same at some points and not in others. Can anyone help me?</p>

<p>They are similar on theme of 'swords &amp; sorcery'.</p>
<p>Fable is only 3rd person unlike Oblivion.</p>
<p>Fable is more combat friendly but not as deep as Oblivion. </p>
<p>I played more Fable than Oblivion, but that's because I enjoy the co-op in Fable.</p>

<p>fable is linear ish, more action oriented and 3rd person. the combat is better then oblivion but everything else suffers you can beat fable 2 or 3 in a few days easily.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Oblivion is vast and open world, there are dozens of side quest as well as the main quest line</p>
<p>personally I have played all the games you mentioned. Oblivion I put a good 100 hours into it, fable 2 and 3 were about 20 hours and halo ( i am guessing halo 3) gets old around 25 hours ( all the halo games get old before the 60 hours mark unless you fall
 in love with the multiplayer)</p>

<p>there is no begining area in oblivion, thats the point. level scaling is important to the game, granted it is much better in skyrim. the problem wasn't the level scaling it was that it was scaled poorly.</p>

            Hi Sherly,<br />
<br />
<br />
As per your concern, as long as your computer is activated you don't have to worry about activation issue after reinstalling Windows 10. If in case that you will encounter activation issues, you may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10749/windows-product-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on where you can find your Windows product key.<br />
<br />
You may also check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12440/windows-10-activation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for reference regarding activation in Windows10.<br />
<br />
Should you have further questions, feel free to get back to us.

            <p>You have no printed key because computers preloaded with Windows 10&nbsp;can have the license integrated into the BIOS. When you reinstall Windows 10 one of the steps the setup program will do is to check if the key exists and activate automatically. You don't
 need a printed key that could get lost or damaged, as was frequently the case with earlier sticky labels on the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when Windows 10 is installed without using a BIOS key such as with a&nbsp;media pack the computer can register its hardware profile during activation and record that it has a license permanently with Microsoft. Reinstalling Windows 10 just needs to get to
 the point where it is connected on line then it will activate itself automatically.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can check for the latest audio driver on the PC model's Support Downloads web page, compare it to the one installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for a larger software package as this is where it should come from.  
<br />
<br />If you're having problems with the audio, right click the Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar to Troubleshoot, report back results.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level

<h2>            I installed XP Service Pack 3 - Now windows won&#39;t run at all&#33;  Please help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I installed the XP Service Pack 3 update yesterday.&nbsp; When the installation was complete, I restarted the computer.</p>
<p>Now, when the computer restarts, the black Windows XP screen comes up for a few seconds, but then it doesn't really load.&nbsp; It stops and then takes you back the blue screen or black screen with options like F3, F8 and ESC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then&nbsp;have the option to restart in safe mode, or restart with the last good configuration.&nbsp; However, since the computer has apparently never had a good configuration of service pack 3 (since it never worked), this is an endless loop of the computer restarting
 and never really running windows.</p>
<p>Choosing the load the computer in safe mode doesn't really seem to provide any quick fix either.</p>
<p>Please help!&nbsp; my computer is basically useless at this point.&nbsp; Thank goodness I backed up all my files on an external hard drive before downloading the XP&nbsp;Service Pack 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Downgrade Windows 8.1 to 7 on UEFI System - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 44ryan44  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downgrade Windows 8.1 to 7 on UEFI System</h2>
                    Hello everyone,
<p>
</p><p>I've searched all over forums and the microsoft community to try to resolve the issue I am having. Unfortunately none of the methods I've seen have worked for me. Even Acer was not able to help me with this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having trouble downgrading Windows 8.1 to Windows 7. The first issue I had was getting the usb to boot on a UEFI System. I seen around forums that most people switch to legacy and then boot windows 7 installer but I only have UEFI option I cannot switch
 to legacy. Once I got Windows 7 installer to start it just freezes on the "starting windows" screen. A lot of people seem to have that problem and a lot of them said they just waited a few minutes and the installation continued. In my case the computer shuts
 down after about 1-2 minutes. Every time I hear the fan start turning faster the computer just shuts off. It is not over heating, it is brand new. It seems to be a security measure that I have not figured out how to turn off. I do not see an option in the
 bios and even when the hdd is formatted it still does it so it isn't a windows thing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every method I've came across so far. The last thing would be putting the hard drive in another computer and installing the os that way. Has anyone encountered a similar problem and have a solution that wouldn't require me to remove the hard
 drive ?</p>
<p>What I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Resetting nvram</p>
<p>- Formatting hard drive and all its partitions before install</p>
<p>- Turning off secure boot</p>
<p>- Multiple windows iso in case the one I was using was corrupt</p>
<p>- Different usb slots (2.0 and 3.0)</p>
<p>- Mounting the iso while in Windows 8.1</p>
<p>- Installing on a separate partition</p>
<p>
</p><p>The list goes on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried installing/removing drivers but it shouldn't make a difference because even when the hard drive is wiped it is still freezing or giving me an error so it must be a bios/uefi issue but I cannot seem to fix this. I tried switching some stuff in
 the bios but there aren't really any options. I have never seen a bios with such few options. The only thing I can really switch is secure boot. The error message I get sometimes is a black screen when booting. It looks like this but the file is different.
 Sometimes its winload.efi but it is different sometimes.</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22dfd554-24f0-4152-88fd-2aa58d850f04" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I do not always get this message. This usually depends how I make the usb bootable. When I use the windows 7 bootmng,efi this is more common but when I use the windows 8 bootmgn.efi and put it in the the windows 7 iso then it seems to boot but freezes on
 the starting windows screen. I do not know what else to try. If anyone has any suggestions it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As per the description of the issue, for us to resolve the issue with your mouse we need to perform troubleshooting. We suggest that we update the Mouse driver from the Device Manager. Here's a simple guide on how to do it:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Expand <strong>Mice and other pointing devices.</strong></li><li>&nbsp;Right click on <strong>Mouse driver</strong> and select <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Restart the computer for the changes to take effect.</li></ol>
<p><br />
Hope this information is helpful.</p>

</p><p>I have also tried going into the Folder's Properties and changing the access to the files.&nbsp; Under SHARING / ADVANCED SHARING, the folder is listed under share name and the PERMISSIONS show Everyone and Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under SECURITY the Special Permissions shows each "User" has ALLOW for each attribute (read, write, erase etc.)&nbsp; Everyone, my ID, Administrator, etc. all have full access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file is from 2011 - so probably created under Windows 7.&nbsp; I've never played with encryption so I don't think that's it.&nbsp; I don't think I've ever used Norton Ghost either (though one new external hard drive does have a Norton folder in it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to remove the padlock?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>DaveM121...&nbsp; thanks for the response, unfortunately, it didn't work.&nbsp; &nbsp;I downloaded the file, merged, right clicked the folder, Take Ownership, saw the commands running and then attempted to unclick the READ ONLY attribute.&nbsp; It appeared to work when I hit
 apply and selected the folder and subfolder options, followed by Continue when asked about providing permission.&nbsp; But, I still couldn't move / copy the files - the folder remains in Read Only mode.&nbsp; All files still had the lock icon too.&nbsp; I tried it on the
 top level My Pictures folder as well as the specific folder.&nbsp; The individual files did not have the READ ONLY attribute checked, however, I still couldn't move or copy them...</p>

            Do you use a cloud account (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Perhaps, opening your cloud account in a Browser, then dragging those files into it might work. Then you can pull the files back down onto the other hard drive . . .

<h2>            After updating my DVD drive to Region 1, I now get a new error message on Windows Media Center...</h2>
                    I am running a newly installed version of Windows Version 7.&nbsp; I have Windows Media Center.&nbsp; I was trying to view a DVD movie I purchased retail, and was getting an error message stating I was in DVD Region 1 and I needed to switch to Region 1.<br />
<br />
I located a solution to&nbsp;that error message.&nbsp; I followed the directions, and my dvd drive is now set to Region 1.&nbsp; However, I now get a new error message when trying to read a DVD.<br />
<br />
"DVD Error<br />
Windows Media&nbsp;Center cannot play this DVD.&nbsp; Restart<br />
Windows Media Center and insert this DVD again."<br />
<br />
Following these directions, I still get the same error.&nbsp; I have restarted the program, system, and tried different DVD movies.<br />
<br />
Before I did the correction to switch my DVD drive from DVD Region 1 to Region 1, the Media Center at least identified the movie I was wanting to play.&nbsp; Now it is not identifying the title, instead going directly to the error message.&nbsp; I have tried several
 different movies in the drive, none will identify or play.<br />
<br />
This problem also occurs on Windows Media Player, with similar error messages and results to the region update.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions to resolve this?&nbsp; I have 4 region updates left, and it is definately set to the United States, Region 1.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi JosephUnplugged,</p>
<p>It seems that updating the drivers can fix similar issues. Once the region is set in the DVD rom, the only way to change it is to update the firmware in the DVD burner. (Even if it is the same firmware version)</p>
<p>Then you can change the region 5 times before it locks. Refer the links below for updating drivers.</p>

            Unfortunately, this did not resolve my issue.&nbsp; I have the most up to date drivers for my dvd player.&nbsp; Uninstalling them and forcing a fresh install of the driver did not correct the problem.<br />
<br />
I still get the same error message stating that it cannot read the dvd.&nbsp; Before I tried any solutions for this problem, it Media Center showed me the title of the movie but that it would not play because the region was set to DVD Region 1 instead of Region
 1.&nbsp; Now that I have moved it to region 1 per instructions on this site, it now does not show me the title of the movie at all and insists that it cannot read the dvd.&nbsp; However, the drive on My Computer -does- show the movie title (as a disk name) so the drive
 is at least reading the dvd.&nbsp; It's just not working in Media Center and it's not working in Media Player.<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Let’s see if a Reinstall of Windows Media Player (WMP) and Windows Media Center (WMC) can fix the issue.</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Control Panel</strong> -&gt; <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Click <strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong> in the left pane.</p>
<p>3. Expand <strong>Media Features</strong>, <strong><em>uncheck</em></strong> <strong>
Windows Media Player</strong>. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to continue, and click <strong>
OK</strong> to quit. Then <strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
<p>Note: If you turn off WMP, Windows Media Center will be turned off either. You may need to re-configure settings for Windows Media Center after re-enabling it.</p>
<p>4. Open <strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong> again. <strong>Turn on the features Windows Media Player</strong> and
<strong>Windows Media Center</strong>. <strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Launch <strong>Windows Media Player</strong>, initialize the program.</p>
<p>P S: If you turn off <strong>WMP</strong>, <strong>Windows Media Center</strong> will be turned off either. This does not happen when we select to turn off
<strong>WMC</strong>.</p>

<br />
I performed the steps as you suggested above.&nbsp; The results are puzzling.<br />
<br />
I still encounter the same initial problem on the bulk of my dvd collection.&nbsp; Black screen on Media Player, no audio/video.&nbsp; On Media Center, I get the error message stating:<br />
<br />
"DVD Error<br />
Windows Media&nbsp;Center cannot play this DVD.&nbsp; Restart<br />
Windows Media Center and insert this DVD again."<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, on two of my DVDs... Windows Media Player will display video.&nbsp; However, the audio is total static garbage.&nbsp; Checking against music mp3 files and video files on my pc,&nbsp;they all&nbsp;play normally, so there doesn't appear to be a problem with my sound card
 or WMP itself (as far as music/video files are concerned).&nbsp; I can fast forward or rewind the dvd using WMP commands, it'll skip ahead to the right chapter.<br />
<br />
When starting Windows Media Center and trying to display these same two dvds... I get&nbsp;pixelated garbage for&nbsp;video and wavering, high-static sound.&nbsp; I can fast-forward/rewind the video (not that I can tell if it's really repeating or not) so the program seems
 to be trying to read the dvd.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Any ideas on what to try next?&nbsp; We've already made sure the DVD drivers are up to date.&nbsp; To be sure, I did pop one of these dvds into my dvd player on my XP system and my Vista system, both of them can watch without a problem.<br />
<br />
