<h2>            Remove strikethrough on completed tasks in daily task list</h2>
                    <p>Hi - is there a way to remove the strikethrough on completed tasks in the daily task list beneath the calendar?&nbsp;&nbsp; I've&nbsp;removed the strikethrough in all views within the task folder but&nbsp;the strikethrough still appears&nbsp;in the daily task list.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm using
 Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            Hi tasks on prior dates are by default complete - if they're not complete, they still show up under today's date.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's also a check mark next to&nbsp;completed tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So I find the strikethrough distracting when I am reviewing completed actions and
 would like to change the formatting.

<p>hi Brian, i figured out how to not strike-through completed task by using "conditional formatting" under the advanced view setting. &nbsp;these tweaks are the reason i LOVE outlook for tasks and to-dos and have been using it for years.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i found the strike through distracting when i went to view completed tasks as well, but i did change the font style as a visual reminder that the task has been completed...along with the check box ;-)</p>

<h2>            Identifying &#47; flagging cells and grouping them</h2>
                    
<p>Does any version of excel have a facility to allow randomly located&nbsp;cells (i.e. cells that are not adacent in a row or column) to be&nbsp; identified/ flagged etc so that you can group/ aggregate the cells and transfer the result (eg the 'sum') to another worksheet
 or another location on same worksheet?</p>
<p>All I am trying to&nbsp;do is to pick up numbers that are entered on a worksheet in one way (eg date order), sum them abd transfer the result. It seems obvious but nk one can give an answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This wont work because I dont know in advance which cells I will need to tag. The problem is that the numbers are being entered as they come in (i.e. randomly) but I want to categorize them to sum them and transfer them to another worksheet. If I can flag
 them as they come in then all I have to do on the second worksheet is to sum the flagged cells</p>

<p>Danielco - he posted in a new thread (I've tried to point the OP back to this thread) with this comment:</p>
<p>"This wont work because I dont know in advance which cells I will need to tag. The problem is that the numbers are being entered as they come in (i.e. randomly) but I want to categorize them to sum them and transfer them to another worksheet. If I can flag

<p>I'm thinking that maybe a solution is to have an Worksheet_Change() event that copies new entries to another sheet as they are made and perhaps even entering the date/time of the entry in a column next to the copy of the original data entered.&nbsp; But the question
 of identifying which data is to be captured is still to be answered.</p>

<br />
There has to be some basis on which you want entries flagged.&nbsp; There's no way for a computer (or a person for that matter) to know which 'random' entries you want to consider -- well, at least not until people/machines learn to read minds. {grin}

<p>Tushar Mehta</p>
<p>maybe Im not explaining myself very well.</p>
<p>Suppose I have a ledger on which purchases are being entered as they arise (eg in date order). These purchases are of various types. I want to separate them into&nbsp;categories - say supplies, material costs, repairs,&nbsp;aggregate them into&nbsp;these three categories
 and transfer them on to a summarized table (maybe in another worksheet). I cannot name a range because the purchases are scattered over various dates and are not in adjacent cells. I cannot specify in advance which cells they will be in. &nbsp;If I could simply
 flag the cells in which the new purchases are entered - eg by color code or number code - then on my summary table I could have a formula in each&nbsp;row which aggregates all the flagged or coded cells in the ledger table and organizes them into the summary table
 - couldnt I????? Is this possible??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

<p>Why wouldn't the ledger itself&nbsp;or a cross-reference table of part numbers and categories&nbsp;be able to provide criteria for discerning the categories? Accrual accounting methods would place the purchases into different sub-accounts at least.</p>
<p>This is an important and primary task of any accounting software. For instance, safety equipment is rarely taxed by any level of government and needs to be identified as such in order that taxes are not paid. Labour is rarely taxed at the same rate as materials.
 The list goes on.</p>

<p>If you enter a value in a cell, and then enter a reference code in an adjacient cell, then you can summarise the data by reference code. There are a number of formulas and methods you can use depending on your preference, and how the data is set out. These
 include VLOOKUP, INDEX combined with MATCH, SUMIF, and SUMPRODUCT.</p>

<p>hi tuandinh ngoc,</p>
<p>microsoft will not delete any data without user’s confirming and office 365 will keep the shared mailbox until the user deletes it.</p>
<p>from your description, the shared mailbox is deleted automatically.</p>
<p>to look into it, i’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
note: you may need to involve the administrator.<br />
1. since the shared mailbox is converted from a user mailbox, could you confirm if the user is created from office 365 or synced from on-premises ad?<br />

exchange admin center</a> to check if there is any action recorded about this shared mailbox.</p>

<p>Hi TuanDinh Ngoc,</p>
<p>Thanks for the information.<br />
Since the user is synced from AD, could you provide the detailed steps of how you convert the mailbox?<br />
If you convert the user mailbox to shared mailbox directly and remove the user in local AD, the shared mailbox will be deleted as well.<br />
you can find the user the deleted users in Office 365 admin center.</p>
<p>If it's not the case, please provide the result of the audit report.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Franky</p>

<p>Hi Tuan,</p>
<p>Yes, that’s indeed the root cause. If you want to keep the share mailbox, the associated user account must always be synchronized.</p>

<p>Hi TuanDinh Ngoc,<br />
<br />
As said in the article below, the storage limit of one common user mailbox in Exchange Online is the same as one shared mailbox which is 50 GB.
<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/exchange-online-limits.aspx#StorageLimits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/exchange-online-limits.aspx#StorageLimits</a><br />
So the user mailbox size will not expire the max size of the shared mailbox.<br />
<br />
Then about ‘how to config shared mailbox can't receive mail or auto rely (sth like "this mail is deleted")’, if you mean to configure auto reply for a shared mailbox, you can do this following the steps below:<br />
1. Login to a user mailbox which have access to the shared mailbox.<br />
2. Refer to the article below to open the shared mailbox in a separate browser window.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-Outlook-Web-App-BC127866-42BE-4DE7-92AE-1EF2F787FD5C#__migbm_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-Outlook-Web-App-BC127866-42BE-4DE7-92AE-1EF2F787FD5C#__migbm_1</a><br />
3. Then you can set auto reply in this shared mailbox referring to the article below:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Automatic-replies-formerly-Out-of-office-assistant-48d40166-0129-4653-98f1-eb85f9bd8c20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Automatic-replies-formerly-Out-of-office-assistant-48d40166-0129-4653-98f1-eb85f9bd8c20</a><br />

                    <p>I set up a good connection to our main modem/router?&nbsp;in the other building which is across the other side of our private driveway.&nbsp; I used two Netgear extenders - one in each building.&nbsp;&nbsp; For two months the wireless connection was excellent.&nbsp; Then it stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>At the minute, I am using a mobile broadband connection to post this, but I want to restore the main connection.&nbsp; The troubleshooter told me today that it couldn't connect to the DNS server when I tried to reconnect the main&nbsp; (wireless) connection.&nbsp; What

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description, I understand that you get "Windows can't communicate with the device or resource (primary&nbsp;DNS server) error message while trying to connect to wireless network.

            <p>I tried to do all the things listed above but at various stages what appeared on my screen wasn't what I was told to look for.&nbsp; So I did not succeed.&nbsp; Eventually I was led to something called 'Tweakbit" which scanned my system and told me I had 450+ problems.&nbsp;
 The catch was that I had to buy their product, so I retreated.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;no way of knowing if using their product would fix my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the loss of connection happened about the time I installed the free copy of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Even yesterday, the internet connection I wanted to use - which comes via the two extenders from the main modem/router in our other building - connected when I first opened up the computer.&nbsp; However, the minute I tried to connect internet explorer I could
 't and the connection had changed from 'connected' to 'limited'.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is obviously something a bit askew within my computer setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has cost me too much already and I am&nbsp;not spending any more.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure there is a simple answer somewhere.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is Windows 10 with Office 10 installed.</p>
<p>Lenovo has a security system within the computer and I have all the windows updates and Windows firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much - I am very poorly informed about the Innards of computers.&nbsp; Letting me loose on the computer is like letting a&nbsp;person whose qualification is driving, &nbsp;loose on the engine of his car.&nbsp; Fools rush In where angels fear to tread.&nbsp;

</blockquote>
PS I think that the issue was caused by a conflicting programme...ie.BT WiFi but any programme or other app may cause such issues, just backtrack and uninstall each new app since problems started and then reinstall one at a time and check after each one whether
 there are any connection issues...

<h2>            Problem with HSDPA network</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently&nbsp;I bought a Nokia Lumia 920. Everything works fine but I have a problem with HSDPA networks. With my Lumia 800 when I have HSDPA signal, the phone displays a &nbsp;"H" on the top and the connection speed was fine, but with the Lumia 920 it shows "3G"
 and the connection is slower than the Lumia 800. For a seconds, with the mobile data enable, the cellular data connection icons disappears but not the signal strength icon. Once I saw the "H" icon, but it disappears quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do to solve it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found one thing. When I turn on "Internet Sharing", everything works fine. The "H" icons appears again. But when I turn off, appears the "3G" icon and disappears often.</p>

            I too have a 920 and don't get the 3G icon at all, it just says either H or E (which is edge on 2G). My maximum speed in the Settings is set at 3G. Whenever I change from Flight Mode to cellular, it is blank at the top until i swipe down on the bar and
 then it will display the H icon or just the signal bars with no H (which I believe is 3G only).<br />
<br />
In fact that whole bar should disappear after a few seconds. I assume you have checked with the same SIM card on your 800 and are getting the same behaviour? I would do everything first to ensure that it is not just a network carrier issue of reception / signal
 quality etc.

<p>The icon that my phone doesn't display is the "H" icon on HSDPA networks. On my Nokia Lumia 800 works correctly. When I use the mobile data on HSDPA networks the phone displays the "H" icon<br />
But with the Nokia Lumia 920, I connect to the same network (HSDPA) and the phone displays the "3G" icon, sometimes the icon disappearing and appears again. But at the beginning displays the "H" icon for a few seconds.</p>

            have you used any of the Speedtest apps available in the Store to check your download and upload speeds between the 800 and the 920? Would be best to compare within a few minutes of the other and to check a couple of times to eliminate the network carrier
 being the source of the issue.

<p><span>Yes</span><span>, I did the</span> <span>test</span>
<span>on both phones</span> <span>and</span> <span>
the speed</span> <span>is usually the same</span><span>.</span> <span>
Although</span> <span>there are times</span> <span>that the speed is</span>
<span>better in</span> <span>Lumia</span> <span>
920.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Today I have a new problem.&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 920 have found new&nbsp;app updates from Nokia, one of them is "Access Point" (3.2.0.4). I installed it and checked the Access Point app, now the data icon (G, 3G) is always shown even with the data
 connection turned off (but when is turned off, the connection doesn't work).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I don't know what's happening :(</span></p>

            Just because the icon is showing doesn't mean that it is transferring data. I would check your account balance and not use the data on it for one day, then check again the next day if any data was used. It may be a case of it simply displaying that 3G
 coverage or HSDPA coverage is available, but not actively transferring data. If that was the case, then that would explain everything and then there would be no issue at all :)

            Good idea.&nbsp; I download the last known good build official ISO and make media, then toss the one before.&nbsp; Routine.&nbsp; There is never anything unique or of value on my Insider systems so I have no qualms about a clean installation as needed.&nbsp; Can't have too
 many copies of the good builds, I say.

I also have this problem and desperately need to unblock my hotmail account to retrieve taxation docs. &nbsp;Microsoft help desk keep sending me back to the useless form too. Like you I purchase microsoft products and use them daily. They promoted changing hotmail
 account to outlook with promised benefits and security. The failure of this company to provide good service to their customers is tragic. NO ONE IN THERE CAN HELP YOU AND MORE TO THE POINT THEY JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT THE SITUATION THEIR PRODUCT HAS LEFT ME
 IN. I've sent many many emails to the company help desk which is so poorly managed I can't believe it from such a large company that spends so much money and time on promoting how supportive they are. &nbsp;Big big fail Microsoft.

            Me too, like you guys I seem to be screwed! &nbsp;I recently switched mobile phones and my automatic login, haven't manually entered my hotmail password for nearly a year, so decided to reset it and have the verification sent to my linked account (the one I
 used to log into this forum) but it didn't arrive in my inbox. &nbsp;I only use this account for receiving spam and for signing up to forums and I forward all messages to my gmail account, and now I cannot access any of the forums I frequent (since I also lost
 the passwords for those accounts). &nbsp;I have put in as much possible info as I can into the form, and tried twice already but there is never enough information for this automation... so where do I go to speak to someone in person, or have this problem figured
 out? &nbsp;I've had this account for over a decade, and even though I don't send email from it often, it is an important email address for me.

<p>
</p><p>I recently created a new E-Mail account just for online sweepstakes and after spending many days and night days and countless hours entering sweepstakes my account was just hacked. Of course I could not send a password reset to the hackers phone that ended
 in a number I did not recognize, &nbsp;so I moved on to the verification questions. They were ALL answered correctly, (name address birthday state and my password) except for 2 the &nbsp;E-mail addresses recently sent E-Mails and subject of E-Mails recently received,
 which i don't even remember I never sent an E-Mail to anyone so I was unable to fill that in. I never even got to answer my account recovery question and answer. My account was just blocked completely. I have no idea who to contact or how to get my account
 back now. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have the same problem, i moved from Canada to the US, so my account was blocked due to suspicious activity. Because i moved country did i also change mobile number, so i am unable to verify my account. I have tried contacting Microsoft in a countless number
 of ways, but they all just link me to this useless online form.</p>
<p>The problem i am facing, i think, is that used outlook for a period of 1 year back in 2010-2011 with my custom domain, which was moved to google, gmail, in 2011, and they want me to provide subjects of emails i have send using my outlook 6 GOD DAM YEARS
 AGO, there is no way any of my friend or family still have that. All other questions am i sure i have answered correctly, even down the the statement of a Skype purchase, but they just keep telling me they did not get enough information.</p>
<p>I still have access to my email that the account is using, i am willing to provide passport, driver license or whatever they want, but they just DON'T CARE, i just get the god dam same cookie cutter response template where i am told to use the form, even
 though my first message to them directly stated that the form was not working!</p>
<p>My office, Skypes credit and files are now locked with no way to get to them, so from now on i do not dare by any new Microsoft products should this happen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really show how little Microsoft cares about their customers! SHAME ON YOU MICROSOFT! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER.</p>
<p>It is OK to have this useless form as the first response, but not personal response option where i can provide identification is just lazy, and are causing your customer harm just so you can save a few buck!</p>

            I too have been lockout out of an account due to logging in at my boyfriends house and no longer having the same damn phone number. It is RIDICULOUS that they do not bother to comment or actually help the people with problems on this site. Yet don't really
 have an option to talk to them themselves. Do they not understand that phone numbers change? It has also been causing problems with things such as skype as my account I am locked out of is linked to that so now I cannot change my password for Skype either
 and it is already an unstable and unsafe piece of software..&nbsp;

<h2>            go to a record on subform</h2>
                    Hi<br />
I have a form (name: form1) that has a subform (name: sub1) and a textbox (name : Txt1) where the form is bounded to a table (name: table1)<br />
I want to go to the number of record on subform where the number is equal to the number that I enter in the Txt1 when I click on Txt1
<br />
How can I do it ?<br />

            <p>A couple of ways of doing that.&nbsp; The simplest way is to set the subform CONTROL's LinkMaster property to Txt1 and the LinkChild property to the name of the number field in the subform's record source table/query (not the control in the subform).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that's too automatic for your needs, then you can use VBA code in Txt1's AfterUpdate (or a command button's Click) event:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Me.sub1.Form.RecordsetClone</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; .FindFirst "numberfield=" &amp; Me.Txt1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If .NoMatch Then <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.sub1.Form.Bookmark = .Bookmark</p>
<p>End With</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and, if you want to focus to move to the found record in the subform, add this line after the above:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me. sub1.Setfocus</p>

            <p>You said you want to go to the record with the matching number.&nbsp; That number must be in a field in the table displayed in the form (i.e. the form's RecordSource table or query).&nbsp; So, just use the name of that field where I said numberfield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should not get a compile error by using the wrong field name because it is supposed to be in quotation marks.&nbsp; Maybe you made some other kind of mistake entering the procedure??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the subform's ReordsetClone (or sometimes Recordset)&nbsp;is a very ordinary, every day&nbsp;way to do what you asked.&nbsp; Can you explain why you don't want to use this basic technique?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need more help with this issue, please include a Copy/Paste of the code as it was when you tried it.</p>

thanks for your notice<br />
1-I don't want it depend on a field&nbsp; I said i want to go to the record with the matching number that I insert to text1 I don't want it depend to any other field
<br />
in your way Iit must be depended to a Id field.<br />
2-recordset is a DAO command , I want to use of the command without to have to use of library but it's not very important<br />

            <p>Access itself uses DAO to interact with the data, so avoiding the DAO library is meaningless in most situations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An exception&nbsp;to that&nbsp;might be if your tables are in an SQL Sever, Oracle, or other external database and you have a good reason to use the ADO library instead of DAO.&nbsp; Either way, you must use a data&nbsp;library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The number field must be available or you will not be able to search for the record.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what you mean by "depended to a Id field".</p>

1-"depended to a Id field"<br />
my mean is that I must use of a field like ID that I must se it to Autonumber or like that<br />
and at your code I depended on the txt1 ( no problem and it's good) and other field ( ID or autonumber field )
<br />
by the other mean your code search on the field (number field ) that must be unique&nbsp; but when I don't have it in my table how can I go to a record with specific number on Txt1?<br />
2-DAO can't use for external database which you told <br />

            <p>Well, you should always have a unique field in a table, but the code I posted does nor need or use such a field.&nbsp; It only requires that the records have a field containing the number you are searching for.&nbsp; If a field with the number is not in the table,
 then I do not understand what you are trying to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using, some other kind of database to store the tables, then you are either using DAO through ODBC or&nbsp;some other library to retrieve the records.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's some other library, that library must have a way to find a record.&nbsp; So, use that library's
 equivalent of FindFirst.</p>

The more map data you'll store, the more space it will fill. You can always use Nokia Suite to delete the map data which is not needed. Delete the one which you'll never need like the far away cities/states.

<p>Are you sure, Nokia Maps does this? You cannot remove Nokia Maps except with a computer and a tool like MobiMB. There you enable the hidden folders and you see the JAD/JAR or Nokia Maps. Anyway, I would not do that because it could destroy even more. Are
 you absolutely sure, Nokia Maps is your culprit?</p>

            Nokia map wont send premium msgs itself!! but there is an option for updating location using premium msgs...<br />
To avoid this.. enable data connection while using maps.. or just stop using the app if you dont want it.. It is not good to use Any other computer software to remove apps from rom... Also its something against nokia guidelines...

    <title>Can I unlink aliases in email&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silver rob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I unlink aliases in email&#63;</h2>
                    Hi having read and had some advise on multiple aliases I am still not clear on how to make Hotmail mail go into Hotmail and Outlook mail into Outlook.&nbsp; The emails appear in both. I need to keep Hotmail for my junk and Outlook for my private mail. Can I
 set up rules to redirect. I cannot delete an alias as both are in use and I have not got 30 days grace from when my old email expires.

            <p>Hello Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're seeing here that you have some concerns with regard your accounts in Outlook.com. Kindly provide the answers on the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you mean by "how to make Hotmail mail go into Hotmail and Outlook mail into Outlook."?
</li><li>Are you using two (2) different accounts that are logged in to Outlook.com?</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; I need to keep Hotmail for my junk and Outlook for my private mail. </p>
<p>Can I set up rules to redirect. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Yes, you can set up rules in your account. You can set us inbox rules using the Hotmail and Outlook account. To set up rules on your account, kindly follow the rules listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to your account</li><li>Click the gear icon</li><li><strong>Options</strong></li><li>Under<strong> Mail</strong>, select <strong>Inbox and sweep rules</strong></li><li>Indicate the rule <strong>Name</strong></li><li>Under<strong> When the message arrives, and it matches all of these conditions
</strong></li><li>Select<strong> [Apply to all messages]</strong><br />
</li><li>Under <strong>Do all of the following</strong><br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Move, copy, or delete</strong><br />
</li><li><strong>Move the message to folder...</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Junk email</strong></li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> </li><li>Then click <strong>OK </strong>on the upper left of the window</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've stated that you can't remove an alias at the moment, we suggest that you wait after 30 days then remove the said alias. For the steps on how to remove or add an alias, kindly click this

            <p>Hi Virfranz Man, thank you for responding to my query.</p>
<p>I use Hotmail for all my non private emails (stores, websites and others that request an email address). I use to have Orange (freeserve) as my personal email. Orange is now closing email facility. I added the Outlook. com email to serve my personal emails
 but both Hotmail and Outlook are linked and all emails appear in both inboxes.</p>
<p>I just want them to be separate to serve my needs. What I am struggling to understand (I could being thick) is why when you opt for second email address would Microsoft assume you want them combined in one inbox.</p>
<p>I log into my PC at start-up with my account log-in password. I am then able to go straight into Mail or Outlook (2013) without further passwords,&nbsp;where both show problem I have.</p>
<p>I will follow your suggestion for rules and update later.</p>
<p>Thank you again and I hope I have explained my problem with more clarity.</p>
<p>Regards Rob</p>

<p>You answered your own question with the second quoted sentence.</p>
<p>You login to your computer with a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>If you want to create a new separate email account, you have to use InPrivate Browsing.
</p>
<p>When using Edge or Internet Explorer, Ctrl + Shift + P will open an InPrivate Browsing window.</p>

<p>Hi Virfranz Man,</p>
<p>I have made a rule in Hotmail to make all "hotmail.co.uk" emails move to junk folder (this keeps Outlook clean for me). Although this means I may have to filter out or change one or two for awhile this seems to be simplest at present. I have followed all
 the moderator suggestions apart from deleting an address as&nbsp;explained earlier due to time factor.</p>
<p>As I explained before, I can see the benefits of&nbsp;linked or integrated inboxes but personally I would like to make the choice (rather than Microsoft assuming my requirements)&nbsp;as I make the decision when giving out my email which one I want people to use.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the continuing help (you must sometimes get frustrated with me) and I will keep you updated further with any developments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards Rob.</p>

            Uh, hold the phone closer to your face? There is a proximity sensor which turns off the screen when it is held to your head. Its at the top part of the phone. Make sure that the sensor is always less than 1cm from your face, =p

<p>We'd like to use Google calendar to share schedule just like everybody else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Between Mac, iPhone, Android, and Windows 10 (the calendar comes with W10) is working great.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is Windows 7 users. What is the best way for W7 users to share the calendar? They have older Outlook which wasn't working before, and they don't want to use a browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any applications? Can we install Windows 10 calendar?</p>
