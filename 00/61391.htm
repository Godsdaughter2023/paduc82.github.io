<h2>            3D Glasses won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t work while Xbox One is on - Problem&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed this (potential) problem, but I fired up my 3D Blu-ray player this afternoon (stand-alone Sony player) to start watching a movie in 3D and noticed that despite the 3DTV indicating that a 3D signal had been detected,
 my glasses would not turn on. &nbsp;I immediately thought that it could be a battery issue even though the green light was blinking to indicate they were on, so I proceeded to change the battery anyway. &nbsp;Yet, the glasses still would not turn on.</p>
<p>I then moved closer to the tv and looked up and down and noticed that when looking up towards the ceiling, the glasses would actually initialize and the screen would show in 3D. &nbsp;However, 5 seconds later, the glasses would turn off again and everything would
 go blurry.</p>
<p>This did not make sense to me at first, but I quickly realized that I still had the X1 turned on and I noticed the Kinect sensor's red optics lit up as they normally are. &nbsp;Then the lightbulb went on in my head. &nbsp;Perhaps the Kinect sensor was playing havoc
 with the receiving sensor on the glasses? &nbsp;I therefore proceeded to turn off the X1, and to my pleasant surprise, the glasses turned on immediately and I was able to watch my movie in 3D.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if the 360's Kinect did the same thing as I did not have my 360 setup in the living room last time. &nbsp;However, this could prove to be problematic if it is Microsoft's intent to have the X1 always on. &nbsp;Is this normal behaviour for the Kinect interfering
 with 3D glasses? &nbsp;If so, I suspect that even though Microsoft may be planning to implement a software update to enable 3D movies on the X1, this may prove to be an issue. &nbsp;Or....is this the reason why MS has not implemented 3D movies with the built-in BR player?
 ;)</p>
<p>In any case, I wanted to let those of you who happen to own a 3D tv and 3D blu-ray player that this appears to be an issue. &nbsp;The easy fix is to turn off the X1. &nbsp;But in the long run, if we don't want to lose our place in a game when looking to switch activities
 and spark up a 3D movie (i.e.: leave the X1 on), we may be in for trouble unless there is a fix for the interference being caused with the Kinect signal and 3D glasses.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>I can vouch for this. Now that we have 3D capability on X1, I &nbsp;inserted a 3D movie and started my active glasses and sure enough &nbsp;the picture was 3d for a second and then it turned off and back again. So I turned my Kinect around &nbsp;and sure enough could see
 the picture in full &nbsp;3D.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are getting error message stating "access denied" while installing Belkin install software. If you are getting
<strong>error message</strong>: <strong>access denied,&nbsp;</strong>it means either you are not login with administrator account or you don't have administrator permission to make changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I would suggest you to run that application as an administrator by booting the computer in clean boot state and&nbsp;disabling security software temporarily.&nbsp;If that doesn't help try to install&nbsp;the application in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the below mentioned methods and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span>Try to take full permission of the folder which contain the set up file for the application. You can refer to the below steps to provide
<strong>full permission</strong> to a particular file or folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select the file or folder which you need to provide <strong>full permission</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Now <strong>right click</strong> on that file or folder and click on <strong>Properties.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on the <strong>Security tab</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on the <strong>user account</strong> through which you are logged in.<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">
</span><span>Clicking on the <strong>user</strong> will show you the <strong>
permissions</strong> set for the user pertinent to the <strong>folder.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>After you have viewed the <strong>permissions</strong> that are already set, you can now click on the
<strong>Advanced Button</strong> that is right below the "Permissions for Authenticated Users".</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Once you have clicked <strong>Advanced</strong>, a box would appear, the "<strong>Permission Entries</strong>" box, which shows all the
<strong>permissions</strong> that are set for the <strong>users</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Now, after you have <strong>spotted</strong> the <strong>user</strong> whose
<strong>permissions</strong> you wish to <strong>change</strong>, click "<strong>Change Permissions".</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on the <strong>user</strong> you would like to <strong>edit</strong>, and then click the option that says "<strong>Change Permissions</strong>" which is
<strong>right below the box</strong>. To change permission you have to click on <strong>
edit.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Once <strong>edit</strong> is <strong>clicked</strong>, you are going to get the same box pop up but this time you can actually edit the options.</span><span> You can do that by clicking the "<strong>Administrators</strong>" user again,
 and this time, you are going to click the "<strong>Edit</strong>" option.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to <strong>disable security software temporarily</strong> and then see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:&nbsp;<em>Antivirus
 software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.
 If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2 </span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Perform clean boot.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Note:
</strong><span>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
<p>Now try to install the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists, then install the application in compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />
<br />
<strong>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

    <title>Cannot login with Microsoft password after upgrade to Windows 10 from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oysterchick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot login with Microsoft password after upgrade to Windows 10 from 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I am appalled with how I have been treated by Mircrosoft with regards to the free upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted the upgrade and everything seemed fine until my laptop started to go into the crash loop that many people have reported. I would be in the desktop only briefly before it would return to the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have long used my Microsoft account to login to my laptop with no issues and when I initially upgraded to Windows 10 it was working fine until the crash loop issue. After a restart, I kept getting the message that my password was incorrect. It most certainly
 wasn't. The device was set to a US keyboard and all other settings had not been altered, but the password would still not be accepted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my password and this still did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sought the assistance of three Microsoft technicians, the first sent me to the community page where I found no useful answers immediately and then hung up on me. The second asked me to upload a troubleshooter to the device with the login issue and provided
 a file. I told her that I was messaging her through my phone as the laptop could not be logged in to, and the phone could not save or open the file she sent, nor could it find an app that could open it. When I informed her of this, she told me to put the troubleshooting
 file on the laptop with the issue, to which I replied was not possible as I could not log in to it. She then hung up on me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third tried to be helpful and left instructions for me, but when I found a way to download the media creation tool and attempted his vague instructions to start in safe mode with networking, it simply would not work, even in safe mode it would take me
 to the login screen where it would not accept my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would not allow me to login as an administrator either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally tried to go back to the previous build and left this running for three hours, but it seemed stuck in restart. I found a post on the community page where a gentleman switched off his computer at this point and back on again, and then it it restarted
 in the previous build successfully keeping all his files. I tried this, and the device stated that it was restarting, diagnosing and fixing the problem, but then it went to a blue screen saying that it could not be repaired.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to boot from a USB. This came back with the same screen stating that it could not be repaired.</p>
<p>I have now chosen to refresh my PC, I will lose many apps and other settings through this process, but it seems to be the only option. It is only 50% complete so as yet I have no outcome, I can only hope it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the initial upgrade, I have worked on this from 6pm through to 4am, slept briefly while the device was supposed to be rolling back to the previous build, and recommenced working on this issue at 6:30am. That was an hour ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given all the time and effort gone into trying to fix this issue, so far to no avail, on a very important device that I require the use of urgently, what does Microsoft propose to do for me to compensate me for my time and extreme inconvenience, and for
 all the other users out there having similar issues? </p>
<p>
</p><p>How dare Microsoft release a product that instead of enhancing my experience with their products, only destroys my device and
</p>
<p>causes me many more hours, even days of work to return my device to a basic working order?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your technical support is non-existent, the three technicians I contacted had no clue as to the type of issue I was dealing with and were of no help to me. I live in an extremely small and remote community and rely very heavily on the internet for everything,
 there is not even a IT person in my town I can pay to solve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all your loyal customers over the many years, why would you release such a bug laden piece of software so end users like me are left with nothing but a massive headache and complete frustration at your lack of support for your frankly pathetic product?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are you doing to help me and everyone else? What, in way of compensation, will you offer us for becoming trusting victims of your incompetence?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This kind of thing should never happen. Now I have refreshed my laptop and am forced to start from basics, reinstalling every app, re-establishing all my settings I require and hoping like hell I haven't lost any valuable information. This is going to take
 a very long time to fix, if it is fixed properly at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much Microsoft, I truly am completely disgusted with you.</p>

            <p>Your problem is common, discussed often online, and little addressed or acknowledged by Microsoft, evidently. I have tried many of the suggested methods to recover my failed upgrades found here and there, especially trying to activate the administrator account--the
 regularly used method for previous versions says it works but doesn't do the job, perhaps meaning that the code is now in a different location, who knows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is probably too late for anyone reading this, but the most important thing is to do what I did initially in making sure that I had a working startup disk and system image. After installing twice and finding each time that while everything seemed to work
 but as soon as I shut down and restarted I could not log in, I had to reinstall my old system in order to continue my work. No one should try to install this update without doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worst part (other than losing your stuff if you have not prepared to restore) is the time involved. It takes hours each time you do the install and set up as well as a good bit to restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting. It is a good warning for others as well as a tip off to Microsoft to fix this problem.&nbsp; In the meantime, I am just going to wait for a while until some fixes are hopefully developed. Windows has some great improvements (along with a few
 irritating limitations) so in general I think it will be a great step forward. I have it on one computer, a newer one that came with it installed, and like it a lot.</p>

            It just happened to me.&nbsp; I finally upgraded from 8.1 to 10 and when my computer rebooted it asks for my password but says everyone that I have ever used is wrong.&nbsp; It suggested that I reset my password, so I did on another computer but is still will not
 let me in.&nbsp; Is my $1200 computer now worthless?&nbsp; At least Microsoft did not make me pay for this wonderful upgrade.<br />

            <p>Unfortunately same problem. I have an elderly friend who, accidentally, accepted the offer to upgrade to W10. I have worked on his computer before and went to upgrades from 7 to 8 and 8.1 so know his login name and password well.&nbsp; Unfortunately he never
 did create password reset disk though it may not have helped either. Anyways, on booting the computer it gets to the login screen but no matter what we tried for password, including&nbsp;old passwords&nbsp;nothing was accepted. Tried various suggestions but just get
 stuck on the same screen. Has anybody been successful in creating a pw rest disk on a working W10 computer and using that, been able to reset password?? Any other helpful suggestions?? Contacting tech service does not seem to be a good choice either.&nbsp; Will
 the computer boot up if I try to reinstall Windows XP or other version?&nbsp; I still&nbsp; have those setup disks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My daughter will get a W10 laptop in about a week and we'll be sure to make that reset disk...hopefully that will do the trick...</p>

            <p>I have been struggling with Win 10 for months now. I used a UK version of Win 8 and US English language with Hungarian keyboard, no issues. It worked just fine with Genius keyboard without numerical pad also. With Win 10 I could use only the full size Hungarian
 keyboard as the Genius keyboard boots with NumLk on and I could not switch it off. There was a large Win 10 update today and it is worse than ever before. Even the full size Hungarian and The Genius I200 boots up with NumLk on, and now I can turn it off with
 both keyboards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that both keyboards work as with UK keyboard layout until I entered the password. Fortunately I already learnt the differences, extra effort but works. It needs a Win 10 fix from Microsoft I believe to make it correct.</p>

            Even more unfortunately, I was not able to resolve the issue my self.&nbsp; I did not have a Microsoft account and do not protect my home computer by password.&nbsp; I had to take my computer to the local computer shop where he was mystified by the same inability
 to get by the sign-in page. He had to work his magic: uninstall Windows 10;&nbsp; reinstall Windows 8.1; create a Microsoft account, password and password recovery disk; install Windows 10; recreate a password from the password recovery disk; delete the password
 requirement; and......presto..... $190 dollars later I had my free copy of Windows 10 on my computer. All it would have taken was to have a "Forgot your Password?" prompt when it requested a login.&nbsp; If I treated my customers so intolerably in my business,
 I would not have a business.

<h2>            Dell studio 1735 Vista 32 bit upgrade to Win7 Home Premium Disk Error</h2>
                    I have a Dell Studio 1735 with Vista Home Premium SP2. I have the HD partitiioned into C: Main Hard drive and D: which is recovery. This came like this from the factory. I am trying to upgrade to Win 7 Home Premium. After I click on Install Windows 7 from
 the main screen, I don't get the Upgrade or Custom page. I get an error saying that it won't recognize the disks on my computer. I don't know&nbsp; where to go from here. I ran the Win 7 upgrade advisor and my system checks out. I upgraded everything I could including
 the ATI Radeon Graphics adapter. So if it comes back with everything being compatible, why does it error&nbsp; out on the disks.&nbsp; Is it because of the D: recovery partition? Please help. Thanks.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Dell does not Support that Laptop Model Studio&nbsp;1735 for Windows 7.</p>
<p>There are no Windows 7 Drivers available for it from Dell.</p>
<p>Without Windows 7 Drivers, Windows 7 will not install or work correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the link to your Model; click on the Operating System Menu.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/Product/studio-1735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/Product/studio-1735</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dell only Supports Vista 32bit and Vista&nbsp;64bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: This relates to your add on in another Thread:</p>
<p>It is not just a Graphics Card that has to be Windows 7 compatible.</p>
<p>The rest of the Hardware has to be too.</p>

<p>It covers more than just the one check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to your Computer / Laptop&nbsp;Manufacturer's website and see if Windows 7 Drivers are available for your Make and Model Computer / Laptop.

<p>If not available, Windows 7 will not&nbsp;work correctly for you.</p>

<h2>            HELP... aspire V5-122P screen went blank</h2>
                    I had done the windows 10 upgrade a week or so prior. I was playing online one night and a brief error message flashed on the screen (too fast to read it) and the screen went black. It has power, blue light comes on and the fan runs but that's it. I don't
 see anything on the monitor. I tried all the suggestions on the Microsoft website under "troubleshoot black screen problems" with no luck. I don't think it will read anything from its USB drives. I don't know what to do next. Does anybody have any advice?
 Thanks for your time.

<h2>            Going Back to Windows 8.1 after being on Windows 10 for Two Months</h2>
                    <p>I tried it, just don't like it.&nbsp; Every time I turn around, some program won't work properly, and now today my external speakers just arbitrarily won't work.&nbsp; My laptop is docked to a Targus docking station which is working properly except for the sound now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I upgraded to Windows 10, I backed up everything on my Clickfree (which backs up not only docs/photos but also your OS and all programs).&nbsp; To roll back should I just back up documents and photos from upgrade date to a thumb drive (limited stuff) and
 use my Clickfree to reinstall my previous incarnation before the upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I had my Windows 10 product key from using Belarc Advisor to pull it off in case I want to upgrade again but Microsoft Tech Support is telling me that the key is blocked.&nbsp; Am I screwed if I roll back and then later want Win10 again?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I need specific instructions on how to get rid of Windows 10 and then use my C6 Clickfree to reinstall my prevous Win 8.1 OS and all the programs, etc. that are on it.&nbsp; This particular external drive makes a mirror image of everything on the hard drive and
 will greatly simply my life, so I need to know what steps to take to get my computer to the point that it acts like a brand new hard drive has been installed.&nbsp; I made a complete backup of my system immediately before I upgraded to Windows 10 on 12/22/15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I will need to reinstall all photos/documents/songs/etc. that were put on the computer between the time I upgraded to Windows 10 and the date I wipe this monstrosity from my life.</p>

<p>That file is part of Visual C++ Redistributable Package, it looks like it is peft over from an installation as that is the wrong location for that file, there should be no reason why you cannot delete it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leave it in your recycle bin for a few days to make sure all your applications and games work fine, then you can delete it permanantly</p>

<h2>            Cant access windows temp folder for .pdf creator to function or install USB printer </h2>
                    
<p>Good day</p>
<p>i have been pulling my hair out on this one please help!</p>
<p>This is a new PC installed with windows 7 basic</p>
<p>I installed a physical printer via USB no problem , then tried to install a .pdf creator to send statements from a rental program. On installation and opening the .pdf creator program i receive an error that it does not have permission to open the temp folder.
 I then also tried to install a second printer via USB but constantly receive the message USB device not recognized! and the printer cannot be found or installed. The .pdf creator should create a pdf printer under printers but it hasent. I was convinced after
 scouring countless forums&nbsp; that the two problems were linked and had to do with -user account control settings - alas after disabling it no luck neither will work.</p>
<p>i have tried the following</p>
<ul>
<li>rebooted countless times unplugging the pc </li><li>Turned UAC off and on with reboots in between and attempting .pdf creator install and the second usb printer install with this setting on and off with no luck.
</li><li>checked the register entry for UAC to ensure it was totally disabled </li><li>checked that the second USB Samsung printer is 100% compatible with windows 7&nbsp;
</li><li>downloaded the latest .pdf creator installation files </li><li>rolled back all the windows 7 updates with a system restore </li><li>uninstall all the USB drivers which then reinstalled on reboot. </li><li>Tried to manually add the Samsung printer using add printer </li></ul>
<p>I am now at a loss and am convinced the two problems are linked. Any Help would be much appreciated</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What is the model number of the printer?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Did you follow the directions as
 per the install guide that came with the printer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To narrow down on the issue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try using the USB port that the first HP printer was plugged into for the Samsung printer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To check if it is a faulty USB cable unplug the USB cable from the working HP printer and plug that USB cable into one of
 the other printers to determine if it will recognize and install.</span></span></p>

            <p>Depends on the type of license you upgraded from.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM licenses </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

<p>It is odd that something so basic to the functioning of the OS doesn't work right out of the box.

            <p>Let's get one specific problem I struggled with recently. I wanted to cast a photo slide show from windows 10 to a TV&nbsp;with a &nbsp;chromecast device. no way to see my chromecast using devices or searching for devices (including play device). Actually another
 LED Samsung TV that is visible for projection either.. is not useable for that function either (I Use to be able to project on windows 8 on the smart Samsung TV using mirroring function on the TV that is connected to my wifi network).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, I can cast a you tube video on my TV from Chrome browser but not from Edge. I Can cast a tab from Chrome to Chromecast TV but not from edge... All those functions were possible from windows 8.. (I have many TV around the house that I want to
 use occasionally in social functions for purposes of playing music video, or running a photo slide show..) and all of this gone away with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any helpful pointers. Thanks</p>

</p><p>I did not need support on using Chromecast as a device ... I bought and used Chromecast way at the start and used successfully until Windows 10 (that was the Key question!), that is until windows 10 and Edge came along...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device does not exist anymore for windows 10 although a big icon on my desktop is Chromecast and can see it connected to my network etc.. ... so did &nbsp;other devices that existed when windows around (like the smart Samsung TV I mentioned in my original
 question) ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I casted a whole series of videos and photos... from CHROME...&nbsp; no problem. IT IS ABOUT EDGE and Windows 10. and "casting" from windows 10 and edge in general.</p>

<p>found a Win 10 app called AVCast - got it to&nbsp;see the chromecast buy connecting my PC to the wireless, (usually hard wired)

<p>
</p><p>So now it see the chromecast and connects - you see the icon on TV - on the PC however it gets stuck "decoding media" and will not play any of the file types that I've tried; avi, mp4, mpeg, mpg not even jpg's</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Chrome is a lost cause as the browser tends to kill my PC by using all&nbsp;8gb of&nbsp;RAM inside of 10 minutes - not sure why Chrome needs 23 instances of itself running</p>

<h2>            Seeking help diagnosing a BSOD - Minidump and MSinfo32 included</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am helping a work colleague with an old dell that has been "Frankensteined" with some spare parts to extend its life. In its original state it had a total failure to boot into windows or bios and so in order to get access to data off the old drive, a new
 SSD was purchased and a fresh install of windows 7 professional was put onto the new drive. Additionally a faulty PSU and CPU were replaced with spares and a slightly more modern GPU was also switched over. Since these changes have been made, the computer
 boots into windows successfully however it has been intermittently getting BSOD. Monitoring temperatures of hardware indicates safe and stable temperatures and I can't otherwise see a pattern to the crashing (no particular programs seem to be launched at the
 time of crash).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a link to a public sky drive with all the relevant minidumps and msinfo32 files (also in zipped format). It seems to be my understanding from the reading I've done so far of problems that seem similar to mine, that it is highly likely it is a third
 party driver that is responsible for the crashes but I am not sure as to how to go about identifying exactly which one it might be and also to be 100% sure that it is in fact a third party driver that is the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=9CB2610CDE98C46B%211206</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help resolving this issue would be most welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time</p>

<h2>            Creating Windows 8 Image for refresh, snapshot stuck at 10&#37;</h2>
                    SO I am trying to refresh my computer because I'm having weird permission issues with programs, basically preventing me from installing or uninstalling programs, and skype freezes up when I type in it sometimes, but it wouldn't allow me to uninstall skype.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I try to do a refresh, and it says I need to insert boot media, but since this was a download and I didn't order the CD I don't have that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found out you can use the recimg command to create a Windows 8 Image and use that as the boot media. SO I opened up admin cmd and created the folder, and type in recimg /CreatImage E:\Win8Image.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It goes through initializing 100%, but then says "Creating Snapshot" and it is stuck at 10%, won't go any further no matter how long I leave it open. How can I fix this so I can create a recovery image?</div>
                </div>

<p>
<span><font color="#000000">"Refresh your PC" is a new feature in Windows 8. By default, desktop apps are removed when you refresh a Windows 8-based computer, unless you create a custom image. After
 you create a custom system image, the image is used as the refresh image. This means that any existing image or OEM restore image is not used when you refresh your computer. We recommend that only experienced Windows 8 users who understand the consequences
 of this behavior create a custom system image.</font></span></p>
<p>
<span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p>
<span><font color="#000000">The space that is required to create a custom image depends on the number of apps that are installed on the computer and may exceed 5.0 GB. In addition, the custom image
 creation process may take a long time, during which you should not restart the computer. A percentage indicator lets you monitor the progress of the process.</font></span></p>

            Thank you - but the problem seems to have sorted itself after a major computer crash (Windows black screen) last night, followed by several nervous hours of Windows 7 repairing my computer. Whatever was wrong, the toolbar is fully back in place this morning.
 Thank you anyway for your help.

<h2>            Bluetooth Headphones paired and connected. But no sound  is heard.</h2>
                    <span>I have a Creative bluetooth headphone model SL3100 which I paired with my PC running Windows 7 64-bit. I use a tiny and cheap made-in China bluetooth USB dongle which can be bought for a few dollars.&nbsp;</span>
                    <span>I have a Creative bluetooth headphone model SL3100 which I paired with my PC running Windows 7 64-bit. I use a tiny and cheap made-in China bluetooth USB dongle which can be bought for a few dollars.&nbsp;</span>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After successfully pairing it with Windows 7, the headphone appears as a bluetooth device detected. When I checked my Control Panel --&gt; Device Manager, I could see:</div>
<div>User-PC --&gt; Bluetooth Radios --&gt; Generic Bluetooth Radio</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --&gt; Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Next, I opened Control Panel --&gt; Hardware and Sound --&gt; Sound --&gt; Manage audio devices, I could see "Bluetooth Audio Renderer" appear as one of the options under the Playback tab. So i clicked on it and set it as a Default Device. &nbsp;When I play
 an mp3 track, I could see that the sound level bar next to the "Bluetooth Audio Renderer" going up and down, indicating that it is indeed working. But somehow, I am not hearing any audio coming through my headphone.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am pretty sure the headphone is working fine as it transmits audio perfectly when I pair it with other bluetooth devices such as my mobile phone. So what went wrong along the way? &nbsp;Is there some driver I need to download
 and install to fix this? Thank you</div>
                </div>

            Hi Bilal.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What happens when you use the arrows to highlight and choose Remove? 
<br />
<br />Try manually adding a new keyboard layout:

            It's probably another bug, may correct itself in time.  
<br />
<br />Meanwhile If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to check over your install most thoroughly go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 upgrade , problem with WMP 12</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to windows 10, then noticed my windows media player 12 has a pop up saying, "windows media player has stopped working. A problem has caused the program to stop working correctly." I used the trouble shooting app that was provided, and
 got this message "configuration settings might be set incorrectly." Hope someone can help me with this problem. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

            Thanks a lot for responding to my problem, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I did the disable and re enable, the problem still exists, so I did the troubleshooting suggestion
 and the result was "configuration settings might be set incorrectly." So I think the problem has to do with the configuration settings. Also I want to point out that my WMP 12 in windows 8.1was used &nbsp;with xiph.org open codecs to play my flac files. Hope someone
 can help, thanks, gtag.

            <p>That pop-up means that WMP has crashed. When exactly does the pop-up appear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please report back the technical details of the crash. Press Win+R, type
<strong>eventvwr.msc</strong>, and press Enter. In Event Viewer, go to <strong>Windows Logs</strong> -

 found the wmplayer.exe error. As far as when the pop-up appears, It does so, every time I access WMP or whenever I &nbsp;click on a music file. When searching wmplayer I found 44 App Crash wmplayer.exe. I'm going to try copy/paste the files you requested, I hope
 it works. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THANKS &nbsp;A &nbsp;LOT, &nbsp;Gordon</p>

<p>
</p><p>So when you created a new user account as suggested by Vinz and launched WMP in that account, you saw the same issue there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, do the crashes still occur if you boot Windows in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Clean Boot mode</a>?</p>

 tried doing a new user account, it wasn't successful, but, I tried again and I got it. My media player is working in this new account. I will try the clean boot method sometime in the future , meanwhile I'd like to thank Tim De Baets and the rest of the Microsoft
 Community for all the help and hard work in solving all the computer issues out there. &nb

            If WMP does already work in a new user account, then Clean Boot probably won't help much. To further fix your existing user account, I suggest that you try resetting the media library. First note that resetting the library will make you lose all current
 play counts, and possibly ratings too. Then, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
- Reboot the PC.<br />
- Press Win+R, type <span style="font-weight: bold">services.msc</span>, and press Enter. In Services, find the
- Press Win+R, type <span style="font-weight: bold">%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</span>, and press Enter. This folder will open up in Windows Explorer.<br />
- In this folder, delete the <span style="font-weight: bold">Media Player</span> folder. If you can't see the folder, then it's probably hidden. Set Explorer to show hidden files and folders, and to show protected system files.<br />
- Start WMP, your library will have been reset and will be rebuilt. Check if the issue still occurs.

    <title>Volume Key Stealing Focus in Full Screen Games on Asus Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ldroamer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Volume Key Stealing Focus in Full Screen Games on Asus Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded my Asus laptop, model G73JW to windows 10 and for the most part it works fine except for one issue. &nbsp;When I am playing a game and adjust the volume the game loses focus and I am returned to the desktop and the volume control icon is shown.
 Obviously this is not ideal and makes adjusting the volume difficult without disrupting the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention that the FN keys on this laptop are given special functions with an Asus keyboard driver (the "ATK" driver). After the upgrade the original Win 7 ATK package was still there and was not working properly. I upgraded the ATK driver to the
 latest Win 10 one offered by Asus and this fixed most problems but it introduced this problem with the volume key stealing focus from full screen games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea if there is something I can do to fix this or do I have to wait and see if Asus will do anything about this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>The issue isn't specific to one game. It seems to happen in all games. If do a clean boot as you suggest it probably won't help me as I believe the ASUS Keyboard driver (called Asus ATK package) will be disabled and then I don't think the special keys will
 work. Maybe I am wrong about that but the ATK driver is one of the ones that gets loaded at startup and without the special function keys don't work. &nbsp;Even if doing a clean boot solved the problem it really wouldn't help as I need the ATK for a bunch of functions
 (such as enabling the keyboard backlight).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pretty sure that this is a driver issue and probably up to Asus to fix but I thought I would ask the question. &nbsp;The reason I think this is that the Win 7 ATK driver did not cause this behaviour. But it had other issues (for example the key to enable
 or disable the touchpad was working and there were issues getting the backlit keyboard to light up). By installing the Win 10 driver I solved the other issues I was having but it also created this new one. There are quite a few variants of the driver available
 on the Asus site but only one of them is specific to Windows 10. The others are for Windows 8, 8.1 and 7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is over 5 years old so there isn't a huge incentive on the part of ASUS to fix the driver for my now ageing model. &nbsp;This isn't to say they won't do it but I don't think I will hold my breath waiting for a fix either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the help and will try a clean boot just to see if it tells me anything.</p>
