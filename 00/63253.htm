    <title>Digital Xbox 360 purchase still missing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Digital Xbox 360 purchase still missing</h2>
                    <p>I had to make a new post because my last one got locked for some reason. I am having difficulty redownloading the game Half-Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax. It isn't turning up in either the download or purchase history. I am very certain that it was bought under my account, but the page for the game has a button to purchase it rather than one to redownload. In my previous post, someone suggested that I wait to see if the issue is resolved when the Xbox Live issues are fixed, but nothing has changed. Can anybody help me, please?</p>

            <p>Update: I just discovered that another one of my games has disappeared. This one was in my Ready to Install list before, but now the store page says I don't own it. I know for sure that I owned it on my account since I got it through Games with Gold on MY account.</p><p><br /></p><p>This post is probably pointless though, since I originally started this thread a month ago and nobody has bothered to help me...</p>

This is a common scenario that happens.&nbsp;The general situation is that&nbsp;accounts that may have an older email are forgotten&nbsp;and a new account was just simply created after; because of the way console licenses work for the Xbox 360, this was a smooth transition into still being able to play all the games one had on the other account.</p><p><br /></p><p>Because Beyond Good &amp;&nbsp;Evil isn't showing up on that page outside of a trial, the game would need to be purchased on this account.

When I looked at the Games With Gold for the month it was free, it said I owned it already. But I guess if it can't be fixed, then I'll just stop here. Thanks for trying to help.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>I get where you're coming from. If it's not showing up on that Download History page, then the entitlement isn't on this account. Every Xbox 360 entitlement goes on that page, and makes it a reliable source for us on the forums.&nbsp;You can always <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact us</a> via phone or chat to have them look into your licenses, as they have more visibility into that side of your account. However, if it's not on that page, they likely won't see it on your account, and may not be able to help further, either (as a preemptive warning).</p><p><br /></p><p>If it was on that page, then I would be able to look into other options.

<p>This file belongs to some DirectX patch which is also used by some installers. There is no reason for it to be running at Startup so remove it.</p>
<p><span>Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: msconfig and when it appears in the Results box above, right-click and choose "Run as Administrator".<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue. Then see what is on the Startup tab. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used the Utility.
 Usually in Vista this will be blocked by Windows Defender and you'll need to allow it so you can then tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />

    <title>Activate&#47;Deactivate auto-hide taskbar in one click - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jheal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activate&#47;Deactivate auto-hide taskbar in one click</h2>
                    Here's my situation: I usually leave my taskbar on (meaning auto-hide is OFF).&nbsp; But I occasionally have to switch it to auto-hide (like when I edit large images and I want to make full use of my screen) .&nbsp; As such, activating and deactivating the auto-hide
 function can be simply annoying. <br />
<br />
Now, I'm wondering if there's an easy way to toggle auto-hide.&nbsp; Like maybe a set of commands I can save in a batch file.&nbsp; Or maybe a third-party software.&nbsp; Or maybe a whole different approach to the issue.<br />

            Hi!<br />
<br />
You could use the little free tool TaskBar Hider, which allows you to hide and show the Windows TaskBar panel by pressing user-defined hot key.<br />
Info and download here: <a href="http://www.itsamples.com/taskbar-hider.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.itsamples.com/taskbar-hider.html</a><br />

Hope that's helpful.<br />

<h2>            how to reformat windows 7 using recovery disk for sony VAIO</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I had to reformat my sony vaio laptop because it got a win32 virus. I had already created my recovery disk (there are a million posts on how to do this) but when I looked up how to use my recovery disk the instructions simply said to insert recovery disk
 one, restart and it will begin automatically. This is not correct. There are a few options to pick before it will begin automatically and if you are like me then you won’t know which ones to pick and there are no posts on this anywhere. When you have inserted
 the disk and rebooted it takes you to a screen with two options: VAIO rescue or recovery win7 64 bit. I thought “ ok recovery disk, I should probably pick recovery”. This was wrong, it took me to a bunch of options and none of them would recognize my disk.
 The right one to pick is VAIO rescue. The it takes you to the next 3 options; pick the first one, it says something like rescue wizard. This will prompt you to save important files to external hard drive, I had already done this so I clicked the skip button.
 It then gave the option to restore factory image, which I picked and it will warn you that all files will be deleted. This will then start the process automatically, stopping periodically to prompt you to insert the next disk (recovery disk are created either
 on 3dvds or 7cds).</p>
<p>The break down:</p>
<p>1. Save important files to external hard drive</p>
<p>2. Insert first recovery disk.</p>
<p>3. Restart computer</p>
<p>4. Pick VAIO rescue, first option</p>
<p>5. Pick rescue wizard, first option</p>
<p>6. Click skip when it asks to save files (unless you skipped step one, then just follow prompts)</p>
<p>7. Restore factory image. (it will now start automatically only stopping when you need to put in next disc)</p>

                    <p>I have to say I thought it was EXTREMELY RUDE for windows to decide to restart and begin updating in the middle of me using the computer. It did not ask me first if I wanted to restart. Who could possibly think this is a good user experience.</p>

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding the issue, I would like to let you know that controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro , Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.
<br />Another way would be to use a 3rd party app like Stop Updates10. which allows you to disable Windows 10 Updates with a single click.

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try going back to a previous Windows point.
<br />
<br />Follow the steps below to restore your computer to a previous date using a restore point:
<br />
<br />1- Type recovery in the search box of the taskbar and choose Recovery (Control Panel).
<br />2.- Click on Open System Restore.
<br />3.- Click on Next.
<br />4.- Select your restore point, and click Next.
<br />5.- Click on Finish.
<br />
<br />The computer will reboot and present a message on the desktop confirming that the restoration was successful.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.       
        </p>

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<div><br />

<div>The process locking it is called dumpkernel.exe and it always running since the computer started. It locks every app that I want to kill normally using the close button. Sometimes, the dumpkernel.exe crashes itself, and will run again randomly.</div>

<div>Most of the computer using MSE as antivirus solution and it did not detect anything odd about the dumpkernel.exe, but virustotal has different opinions about the dumpkernel.exe</div>

https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/bbab9383065b21a75aa291f395ae8a3f59cc013e4a865e43be792d7b5b9fc1c3/analysis/1378083330/<br />
<br />
I also uploaded the dumpkernel.exe here http://www.mediafire.com/download/2qqshz3zqbr8uao/dumpkernel.zip<br />
( pass : infected )<br />
<br />
Could you help me with this?<br />
<br />
My first solution is to do a clean re-install over the infected computers tomorrow.</div>

            When your AV software doesn't report anything, that does not necessarily mean your system is clean.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I would always interpret a statement like that to mean that whatever your AV software is it just didn't find anything that it knows about.&nbsp; That doesn't mean your system is clean.&nbsp; And there does not seem to be one AV software that seems to know about everything.<br />
<br />
Therefore, it is prudent to use more than one respectable scanning tool(s).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
MSE is 'okay' but remember that Microsoft is not in the malicious software prevention, detection and removal business - that is not their job.&nbsp; It make sense to stick closely with companies where malicious software prevention, detection and removal IS their
 job and that is all they do all day long.<br />
<br />
To wit, I suggest you supplement MSE (or whatever else you are using) as follows:<br />
<br />
No matter what else you are using for malicious software protection, do this:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a quick scan with these free malware detection programs (not at the same time) and remove any reported threats:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
Be sure to select and choose to delete any threats, reboot, then scan again to be sure the threats have really been removed.<br />
<br />
SAS will probably report a bunch of tracking cookies and you can just let it delete them.<br />
<br />
SAS may install a startup item and launch every time your system reboots so if it is your desire to disable that, from the SAS splash screen, choose Preferences and uncheck the box "Start SUPERAntiSpyware when Windows starts" and the startup item will be removed
 from your configuration.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
SAS may also create a Scheduled Task to run every day which can also be disabled or deleted if that is your desire.&nbsp; To do that, choose Preferences, Scanning Control tab, Configure Scheduled Scanning.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do a full scan once in a while when you have more time (perhaps hours).<br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
When the scans run clean, reboot and then troubleshoot any remaining issues.<br />

            Thank you for doing so, it will analyze with Microsoft Malware Protection Center team and in case that is infected file, they will release signature and when you update your Anti-Malware product it will be removed. Make sure to submit any other samples
 in that way.

            Thank you for suggesting Malwarebyte's Anti Malware.<br />
<br />
Today I was able to scan the computer with it and found 8 infections, but after the system restart, the computer become lot slower ( it's an old computer though )<br />
<br />
I will just observe this computer for a week from now and see if that scan totally cure it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I do understand that if my AV did not catch anything doesn't mean the system is clean, that's why I choose to send the sample to virustotal to see if other tools says the same. Security is a process not a result.

            I am glad you were clever enough to find dumpkernel.exe and if you perform a Google search on it, you will find considerable chatter about it, what it looks like and what to do about it.<br />
<br />
The MBAM/SAS combo is what I like to start with before troubleshooting if one thinks there may be malware afoot (or just do it anyway).&nbsp; It does not make sense to troubleshoot a system that might be afflicted with malicious software.<br />
<br />
In addition to VirusTotal, Jotti will give you some additional opinions:<br />
<br />
Online scanner online virus scanner virus scanning engines<br />
<a href="http://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.virustotal.com/</a>&nbsp; (about 40+ scanners)<br />
<a href="http://virusscan.jotti.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://virusscan.jotti.org/en</a>&nbsp; (about 20+ scanners)<br />
<br />
For VirusTotal, if you get a message:<br />
<br />
File has already been analysed<br />
<br />
Click the Reanalyze file now button and wait. You might be in a waiting queue depending on how busy they are.&nbsp; If the files are large, it may take a while to upload them.<br />
<br />
You should see some progress indicator and the result will be displayed on the browser screen from A-Z when all the scans are done.<br />
<br />
Remember that the MS Answers forums does not prompt even the most fundamental system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system (that is the way they choose to run things here) so if you want to try to figure out
 any performance problems, we would have to know more information.<br />

            Yes, a google search do give lots of result about it being a trojan, but not what I am expecting. I was expecting more like what causing it, list of symptom but instead I only got how to cure it ( most of them delete it )<br />
<br />
I'll just mark your answer helpful first until I know the computer can really bu safe with just MBAM scan, as a pre-caution, I already have the re-installation disc and drivers for the worst scenario.<br />

            Hey Surya,<br />
<br />
I can assist you in troubleshooting why your computer starts up slower and check for any further suspicious items starting up with your computer if you create and upload logs as needed. Getting your computer to operate faster and be malware free will be my
 goal.<br />
<br />
The two main programs we would use are autoruns and procmon.<br />
Autoruns:<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx
</a><br />
(Lists start up items)<br />
Procmon:<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx</a><br />
(Captures disk actions from processes)<br />
<br />
I can also download the dumpkernel.exe if necessary and run it in a closed environment to check what damage it causes to computers and reverse it on your computer if you wish. (Just let me know if you want me to attempt this)<br />
<br />
Let me know if you would like to begin.<br />
<br />

            Well, it was expected that it run slower. The computer is out of the current league of office computer. Previously run out of space of drive C, then I manage to sort it out. As long as it can still do offices task, it's enough for now<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t get any mail in Windows Mail on Windows 10 or device - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get any mail in Windows Mail on Windows 10 or device settings to sync for months</h2>
                    <p>So many other Windows 10 users have been having the same problem for quite some time now according to the Windows 10 feedback app, and I'm disturbed updating to Windows 10 version 1607 didn't solve the problem in the least. Fortunately, I'm always able to
 sync email on the Outlook 2016 desktop app, but all the Windows 10 Mail and Calendar apps do is take up space on my hard drive since it never syncs my calendar or any of the email across my five email accounts connected to it, Outlook, iCloud, Gmail, Yahoo,
 and AOL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing I like about the Windows 10 anniversary update is that the sticky notes app no longer looks and functions&nbsp;the exact same way&nbsp;it did in Windows 7, over one year after Windows 10 was released to the public, the sticky notes app in Windows 10
 is updated in its own right. But there's another broken feature that still isn't fixed in Windows 10 version 1607, backing up device settings to OneDrive! I have been looking forward to this update for months on end, and in my experience, it's more cosmetic
 changes than fixing everything that's broken. All my device's settings synced just fine on my old laptop which originally ran Windows 8.0. It even carried my desktop background over to my new laptop when I powered it on for the first time on April 15, well
 after I lost my ability to sync my settings. With every year that passes, it gets more likely I'll get a new laptop. I might do that in 2020 or 2021, which is hopefully more than enough time for me to be able to sync my settings again so I won't have to go
 through the headache of reconfiguring everything!</p>

            Did you ever get s fix for this?&nbsp; seems like a lot of people having the no sync error code but these techs always telling you to do the same basic fixes, which doesn't work most of the time.&nbsp; Only problem I have is msn account wont sync after 8-2-16 in
 windows 10 mail app.&nbsp; all others work. etc.&nbsp;

            No. My laptop is completely up to date in Windows Update, and I have no idea where to get a fix for this no sync error code.

            <p>As I was looking for solutions I noticed that there was a help instruction for mail in windows 10 when having sync errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that for msn it had a server address of eas.outlook.com.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My server address for msn was bay407-m.hotmail.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed it to the eas.outlook.com and it didn't work, and I thought I put it back to the original and went about my day, shut off the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to my other computer later which had the exact same setup and same problem and when I went into mail in I noticed I had emails from today.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; How could that be.&nbsp; I checked the setup and noticed that the server was eas.outlook.com.&nbsp; I sent and
 received emails and all was good.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the main computer and checked it and its server was on eas.outlook.com not the bay407 server and my emails were working fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as I suspected, the server was the issue all along.&nbsp; Microsoft was probably working on migrations from one server to another and didn't tell anyone in the company or users, and thus the problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, its fixed, and the tier2 level mail pros don't have to call me tomorrow at 10am.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go figure after 2 weeks of **** and being bounced around and no answers.</p>

<h2>            Performance issues after upgrade to Windows 10 on HP ProBook 4730s</h2>
                    <p>Original title; Upgrade to Windows 10 on HP ProBook 4730s</p>
<p>I upgraded to Windows 10 on my HP ProBook 4730s about the middle of 2015.&nbsp; Upgrade went great and everything seemed to be working great........UNTIL ........ the Nov. 2015 update and POW!!!!&nbsp; The boot up became agonizingly slow and would lock up.&nbsp; It wouldn't
 restart, or even shut down on its own.&nbsp; The mouse would lock up.&nbsp; The computer was flat out non-functional.&nbsp; Then I discovered that Windows 10 does automatic updates, one of which is an&nbsp; AMD Graphics Driver.&nbsp; It appears that is the problem, but I do not have
 the option of deselecting it to keep it from downloading.&nbsp; Microsoft forces the upgrade (or in my case a downgrade) on you.&nbsp; Called Microsoft, let them remote in, they played with it for about 2-3 hours, then told me to go to the AMD site and download a new
 driver and they would call me back the next day.&nbsp; Had difficulty downloading the driver, but is still didn't work.&nbsp; Microsoft called back and in so many words said take the computer to a local technician, nothing we can do for you, you must have a hardware
 problem, wish I could help, but we can't, sorry - Goodbye, thank you for calling Microsoft.&nbsp; Hey Microsoft, that is baloney.&nbsp; If I had a hardware problem then how come I can reload Win 7 and upgrade it with no issues.&nbsp; The fact that you are
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">forcing </span></strong>me to upgrade software, apps, and drivers that cause my system to fail is more baloney.&nbsp; I can understand if a supplier is not providing an adequate driver for a piece of hardware, but
 continually forcing it on someones computer and causing it to fail then not fixing the problem??!!!!&nbsp; We all know what that is - B _ _ _ _ _ _ t!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had a similar issue? If anyone can give me any ideas as to how I can get the upgrade working, it would sure be appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly Microsoft doesn't have a clue.&nbsp; I have reloaded Win 7 and it is working fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The Laserbase drivers are on the NET John. However they are from 3rd party sites not Canon. If you do use these downloads make sure you scan them for malware first.</p>

 MF3220, but it doesn't work. &nbsp;If you have really found a Windows 10 driver for the laserbase MF 3220, I should be oh so pleased to be given a URL for it!</span></p>

            Thanks for all your help, Davy-Delliott. &nbsp;I have tried your three suggestions, but all only go up to Windows Vista or Windows 7. &nbsp;There is nothing for Windows 10. &nbsp;I guess I am stuck with a printer/scanner which is useless for all but photocopying - unless
 there is a well-hidden driver out there somewhere. &nbsp; There must be hundreds of these devices all destined for the tip. &nbsp;That seems criminal to me.

            The drivers for my printer/scanner are Windows 7 drivers. For older models it is quite likely that there are no Windows 10 drivers. Usually they work though. Sometimes right clicking on the driver and selecting compatibility mode is all you need.

            Davy-Delliott - I am most grateful for your input here. &nbsp;I have been to Control Panel on my computer, and note that Canon MF3220 &nbsp;appears there only as a scanner. &nbsp;There are Windows 10 drivers for the scanner function of the Laserbase MF 3220 all over
 the place. &nbsp; So I suspect the issue goes beyond the simple matter of a driver. &nbsp;I have downloaded Windows 7 drivers for the Laserbase MF3220, but cannot get them to generate anything - not surprising, really, as my version of Windows 10 does not seem even
 to recognise the printer. &nbsp;I am wondering if I have to give up on this one - in which case I shall probably Freecycle the device to someone who is still on Windows 7 or an older version of Windows, and get myself a new straight laser printer. &nbsp;(I already have
 scanning and photocopying facilities).

            Have you looked in Device Manager in Control Panel to see if it recognises a Cannon 3220 printer? There should be an entry under imaging devices for your Canon. Under the Action Tab you can scan for hardware changes. Windows 10 usually "sees" a connected
 printer and installs the drivers automatically.

            Yes, <span><span><strong>Canon MF3220 Series</strong> is listed there, and driver is up to date. &nbsp;But I think this simply refers to the scanner component, not the printer.</span></span>&nbsp; &nbsp;I did scan for hardware changes,
 but nothing additional came up. &nbsp;What Windows 10 has "seen" is just the scanner, I think. &nbsp;There is still no MF3220 printer showing up in the Control Panel, only an MF3220 scanner. &nbsp; I'm beginning to think this is a lost cause &nbsp;:(

<p>Yes, as above, I have a scanner (only) indicated as MF3200 in the Devices and Printers section of the Control Panel.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fbc996d-3343-4d60-94f1-501e461c165b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fbc996d-3343-4d60-94f1-501e461c165b" /></a></p>
<p>That's what I get as a result of connecting the Laserbase MF3200 to the computer.</p>
<p>I have tried the tab, Add a Printer, but MF3200 is not there - even after updating.</p>

<h2>            Reinstalling the Microsoft Common Controller Driver</h2>
                    <p>Alright So I was trying to install my XBOX 360 Wireless Receiver. I went into device manager, right clicked the unknown driver and clicked update. I followed it to install the Microsoft Common Controller Drivers for Windows. Didn't work or connect with my
 device so I went to uninstall/delete the driver to try again. Except I managed to delete the the common drivers. I've searched Hi and low, ran windows updates to get them back but....I can't. Is there some place I can get these drivers or no? Below as you
 see is only the Xbox 360 Controller for Windows...not the Wireless receiver, or wireless Xbox one. Ive tried re-downloading the driver for the wireless controller from the Microsoft website, but it tells me the driver already exist. Ive done restarts as well...</p>

            Hi Genny.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Windows 10 installs with the Install.wim file included as a pristine mirror image of the Operating system files, to use to repair any System files that get broken.  You can check if the file is intact or repair it if necessary by running the DISM checks in Step 10 here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br /> I realize this is complicated so perhaps it would help more if you tell me exactly what you want to do.  I'll also answer  any questions until you understand fully or have an alternate plan.  This is complicated enough internals that only a handful of people on the web understand it enough to explain it fully, something I've been doing for ten years in tens of thousands of posts.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the most part, any installation media downloaded from Microsoft Create Media site no longer uses Install.wim…</p>
<p>
</p><p>The newer ISO's, downloads, flash media, and etc., use a Install.esd.. This is more highly compressed than the .wim file...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can be a bit of a trick to get a Install.wim ISO from Microsoft... Does it absolutely need to be a .Wim file ?</p>

<h3> katiestrukel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update stuck on Initializing&#63;</h2>
                    I've been trying to run the Cumulative Update for windows 10 ( 1803 ) since January 1st, and it's just been stuck on initializing. Above the update there's a yellow text saying "Your device is missing important security and quality fixes", but this update
 is the only thing I haven't done. I've tried running it online, cancelling it, restarting my PC, and none of it has worked. Whenever I restart my PC, it's still initializing. When I tried cancelling the update, I got an error saying it failed to cancel it.
 I'm so lost on what more I can do, but all I know is that I'm getting bothered by having an icon at the bottom of my screen every day saying I have a critical update I need to download, but I can't. My PC keeps getting slower and slower because this update
 won't download too.&nbsp;

            Hi Katie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Most Updates will sort themselves out in a few days so I'd wait to see.  If not then here are steps you can take:  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1809 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Updating to the latest feature update 1809, should resolve this.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:

<br />
<br />If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable.
<br />
<br />Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1809 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:

<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don't, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />How to Upgrade to Windows 10 on a Drive with Limited Space
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-creators-update-on-a/d7cdba8b-c59b-4a23-86e2-6635a7e44489">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />Thats it, the Windows 10 1809 is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1809 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

<p>
</p><p>This all started with trying to install a common software package that would not install due to antivirus conflict and then deteriorated from there. Attempts to perform System Restore to just prior to the sw install fail in recovery mode but then report

            <p>Yes, but with a potentially important caveat. Everything is the same except for the mobo which was RMA'd with a new board of the exact same make &amp; model. Following mobo replacement, MS had me re-verify the OS when it detected the replaced mobo. All previously
 reported issues had been successfully resolved prior to the mobo replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, no troubleshooters work despite enabling them via policy editor.</p>
<p>Windows Update fails.</p>
<p>Cannot install software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sigh.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. WU troubleshooter now working and has repaired WU. WU now working. SW install also now working. Wow, it'd be really nice to know what actually fixed these issues. Kind of a mystery. SFC, DISM, Policy Editor {I've never played here b4}, Safe Boot, Clean
 Boot, Normal Boot. ??? Seems to be working now. Go figure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Curiously, DISM still reports "The component store corruption was repaired."</p>
