<h2>            How do I move the &#39;show desktop&#39; button on the taskbar&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I want to put the 'show whole desktop' or 'hide windows' button on the left of the taskbar, not the right. Is this possible? If not, is there a workaround, like creating a button for a shortcut?&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>Why in this world doesn't Microsoft make this easy to do? &nbsp;People were used to the Show Desktop icon being on the left side and we were also used to the Home icon in the IE to be on the left. &nbsp;Why take away the ability to move
 an icon or shortcut? &nbsp;This makes no sense.</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi Ben</p>
<p>It does make sense when you consider the new functionality of the Show Desktop button.</p>
<p>The old version of Show Desktop was just a static shortcut that only performed one function, mimimize all of the windows and display the Desktop.</p>
<p>The new Windows 7 version performs the same function plus it also has the Aero Peek capability. If you move the mouse over the button, all of the windows disappear so you can, briefly,&nbsp;take a 'peek' at the Desktop.</p>
<p>Placing the button directly next to the Start button in Windows 7 resulted in users unintentionally passing the cursor over the button, when moving towards the Start button,&nbsp;and having all of the windows disappear.</p>
<p>At the lower/right corner of the screen, it is out of the way, but still easy to get to as Shawn described.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ronnie's suggestion will help you get what you desire, although I'd like to encourage you to give it a try on the right side. &nbsp;It involves something known as Fritt's law, and I bet you'll wonder how you lived without it. &nbsp;Example: &nbsp;You never have to carefully
 point to the Start button, you can just "slam" your hand down and to the left, and you know for sure that it's going to be there. &nbsp;In other words, you can't over-shoot. &nbsp;Now you can train muscle memory to go to the right to show desktop (although I do a lot
 of typing, so I typically just press Windows-D or Windows-Space to show the desktop).</p>

<h3> mshllb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio problems with Creative SB X-fi sound card and Windows 7 &#40;64&#41;</h2>
                    I recently had my OS upgraded to Win. 7 Home Prem. Edition (64) bit. After the upgrade, the audio on my PC does not work properly. The repair shop said the new OS does not recognize my Creative SB X-fi sound card and that I should have them install a new
 sound card. I ran my computer diagnostics and it indicates my Realtek AC97 audio is inoperable. I have looked at sound cards reviews and seen there are many people experiencing the same problems as me. I don't know what to do. Should I get a new sound card.
 If so, which one. I don't even know what or where the Realtek AC97 audio is on my computer. Can someone help me solve this problem?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;you upgraded to Windows 7 did you run the Upgrade Advisor and check with the Compatibility Center?<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
<span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>Also check the Compatibility Center <br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Check with the System and Device makers for updated drivers and many have special instructions to help<br />
with upgrading to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
RealTek<br />
<a href="http://www.realtek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.realtek.com/</a><br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
There need to be Windows 7 compatible drivers or the sound (and other devices) will not work properly.<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<strong>Also Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area -<br />

    <title>July 2014 update broke Live TV for Cisco 8742HDC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacob w. klein  say:</h3>
<h2>            July 2014 update broke Live TV for Cisco 8742HDC</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Cisco 8742HDC DVR, connected into the HDMI In port of my XBox One.</p>
<p>Ever since the July 2014 update, when I launch the TV app to watch TV, the DVR briefly says something about requiring a secured cable connection, and then the result is that I see TV picture that hiccups every couple of seconds, and have no TV audio. (The
 XBox UI picture/audio are all still fine when this happens).</p>
<p>I have tried cold booting the DVR (via long-power-press for 30 seconds), and cold booting the XBox One (via long-power-press for 10 seconds), but the problem persists. My only workaround is to disconnect the DVR from the XBox, and plug it directly to the
 TV.</p>
<p>This worked pretty well before the July 2014 update. Did you guys break it? Does anyone have any recommendations/solutions?</p>
<p>Please investigate,<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jacob</p>

    <title>Copy Outlook Express to a flash drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenzolkoski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy Outlook Express to a flash drive</h2>
                    <p>I want to copy all the data in my Outlook Express email account to a flash drive. I mean ALL the data: names, email, phone, address etc. from the address book (which has many sub-folders), plus all the folders and sub-folders of emails I have saved.
</p>
<p>The plan is to upload this data to a newer computer. But newer computers don't support OE, where the data resides on the hard drive vs. on a server with most email accounts. So I would just copy the OE data from the flash drive to the desktop of the new
 computer where I can at least see and use it. Depending on what email I choose (maybe gmail), I could then possibly upload the data to that email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for doing this? Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<p>Your post was just moved to the correct forum which is why you didn't get a good reply yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best answer I could give is to install an email client on your XP machine. Import all your data to the new client, back that up and then install it on the new machine and import the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example, I started using Thunderbird when I went to Win7 from XP. So, I installed Thunderbird on the XP machine and imported all the data. Then I backed up the TB data and imported it to the TB client on the Win7 machine. Still using TB with Win10
 today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Decide what you want to use in Win10 and post back for more details instructions.</p>

    <title>Free W10 upgrade, with minor problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luigixyxy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Free W10 upgrade, with minor problem</h2>
                    <p>My problem started after I upgraded my laptop from Windows 7 Pro to the free release of Windows 10 Pro.<br />
<br />
Since the upgrade completed, as soon as Windows 10 loads I am shown the following warning:<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">AMD Quick Stream Error<br />
The license information to use this software is not found.</p>
<p><br />
Apart from that, all seems to be working right. I just &nbsp;remove the pop up warning and go about my session without experiencing any inconvenience.<br />
<br />
All the same, to do away with that warning, I downloaded from the AMD site the latest graphics package for Windows 10, and installed it in the machine. But that was to no avail: the warning keeps showing up every time I start Windows.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My machine is:<br />
<br />
Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E335<br />
Processor: AMD E2-2000 APU with Radeon(trademark) HD&nbsp;<br />
Operating system: Windows 10 64-bit<br />
Graphics hardware: AMD Radeon HD7340 Graphics<br />
<br />
Any cue? Thank you for any suggestion you may have.<br />

    <title>Having problem using proxy on port 443 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baby.boy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having problem using proxy on port 443</h2>
                    Greetings to everyone.
<div>I have a strange problem.</div>
<div>First, let me say that it is not a Microsoft's problem , but I have tried so hard not to post my problem here, since it's a Microsoft forum, but I wasn't able to, I have tried days to fix it myself, but no chance at all.</div>
<div>Me and my friends are using a proxy from a specific server. None us having a problem, except me.</div>
<div>And let me say that we use a program called Proxifier. Even though you can use the proxy without this program and it works fine (using Internet Properties, LAN settings), except for me!</div>
<div>I am using two PCs and one laptop.</div>
<div>The proxy and the Proxifier works fine on one my PCs and the laptop.</div>
<div>However, I used to use this program in another PC as well and it worked great, but not anymore.</div>
<div>Here's what happened, I didn't use that PC for more than 8 months and when I came back to it, it didn't work.</div>
<div>No changes at all.</div>
<div>And the strange thing is, proxy and Proxifier works fine when I boot Windows in Safe Mode with Networking! And that means there is a problem with a software, right?</div>
<div>I don't know what might be the problem, disabled firewall and anti virus (ESET V6 plus Malwarebytes') but no chance.</div>
<div>Please, help me if possible.</div>
<div>And one important thing, I can connect to proxy server, but I can't connect to any website using the server, here's the error I get on Proxifier:<br />
<div><b>[50:59] Starting: Test 1: Connection to the Proxy Server</b></div>
<div><b>[50:59] IP Address: <u>REMOVED</u></b></div>
<div><b>[50:59] Connection established</b></div>
<div><b>[50:59] Test passed.</b></div>
<div><b>[50:59] Starting: Test 2: Connection through the Proxy Server</b></div>
<div><b>[56:00] Error : connection to the proxy server was closed unexpectedly.</b></div>
<div><b>Please make sure that the proxy server protocol and address are correct.</b></div>
<div><b>[56:00] Test failed.</b></div>
<div><b>[56:00] Testing Finished.</b></div>
</div>
<div>And I get that error after waiting for a few minutes not instantly...</div>
<div>Plus, I have tried a different proxy, same result, connects to server but not to a website through it.</div>
<div>Sorry, just one more thing, I am able to use Freegate ( if you know what's that), a free software, but it is too slow, I mean you have to refresh a page 10 times and it might open it!</div>
<div>I really need to use the proxy...</div>
<div>I appreciate any help, thank you.</div>
                </div>

            Oh God, I can't believe it!<br />
<div>After of hours of trying and thinking I solved the problem.</div>
<div>The problem was an option on ESET.</div>
<div>No wonder why clean boot didn't work, ESET was running on clean boot.</div>
<div>I stopped ESET service manually, restarted. and the proxy was working fine. Though on my other PC and laptop, and even my friends, we're all using ESET without this problem.</div>
<div>About the problem, ESET was scanning the port, number 443, and to tell you, it's a default option.</div>
<div>Here's the solution:</div>
<div>Open ESET Advanced setup (Simply press F5), click on&nbsp;<u>HTTP, HTTPS&nbsp;</u>(don't expand it), &nbsp;on the last field &nbsp;"Ports used by HTTPS protocl" remove the port(s) you have problem with, click on OK and you're done.</div>
<div>Sorry for bothering.</div>
<div>Cheers,</div>
<div>Amin.</div>

            <p>Nor would one think it would - since, AFAIK, there are no <em>Microsoft</em> torrent apps. (There's some in the store - but they are not made by Microsoft.) ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Have you uninstalled and restarted the computer and then downloaded and installed the latest version of
<a href="http://www.utorrent.com/downloads/win" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">uTorrent</a> and restarted the computer again before going to a web page to try a magnet link?<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Are you using Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera or another web browser?<br />
Have you tried resetting the browser(s) you are using to their defaults (if you want to try this - do it AFTER uninstalling

            Which Edition of Windows XP do you use?<br />
What exactly triggered that message?<br />
<br />
<strong>More Information</strong><br />
<br />
The built-in administrator account is named "Administrator" or "Owner" (in OEM PCs). In Windows XP Home Edition, you can login to the builtin administrator account via Safe Mode, where in Windows XP Professional, you can login as Administrator via the Classic
 Logon screen itself. To invoke the Classic Logon screen press CTRL+ALT+DEL twice at the Welcome Screen.<br />
<br />
Note that the "Administrator" account has blank password by default.<br />

<p>This just told me what i already knew. So i phoned microsoft support, and was put on hold for 45 minutes, to be told to switch the xbox off, and back on again....... Yup that worked a treat &lt;_&lt; (SARCASM)</p>
<p>Power LED flashes constantly regardless of wether or not the disc tray is open. "it should not flash all the time"... i guessed that.</p>
<p>"If you have 1 light on on port 1 and 1 on port 4 you have 2 controllers switched on." Makes sense but i only have 1 controller, and thats the only controller thats synced, and the charge is good.</p>
<p>To answer the question of the TMX, Yeah its all up to date.</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>[/quote]I am just throwing it out there, about the green lights. Do you have a Kinect with Kinect ID set up on multiple accounts? Because Kinect ID sometimes messes up, and detects you as somebody else. When that happens, the other account is automatically
 signed in, and another green light on the console appears. This is just a guess, my Kinect does this sometimes.</p>

<p>nope my xbox was reset to factory defaults after i got rid of kinect 2 months ago. I have only been having the issue for a week and its only happening once its been run warm. Im tempted to pop the case open and connect a thermostat to it to see if its over
 heating but the case feels cool so i dont think its over heating either (also it would be 2 flashing red lights if it were over heating).</p>
<p>Its not spitting out any error codes.</p>
<p>does any one know if its possible to run diagnostics on it??? I figure its using a stripped version of windows embedded?</p>

<p>Greetings, Sparco. I would not recommend opening the case or making any alterations to your console as this can void your warranty. If I understand correctly, you are encountering a power button that constantly flashes no matter what you are doing. Is that
 right? Do you have any active downloads and do you notice this impacting your experience when gaming or watching media in any way?
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. Standing by for your response.</p>

<h2>            eject device in file explorer shuts down file explorer</h2>
                    <p>Ejecting a device in file explorer shuts down file explorer.</p>
<p>I would like to find a way to change this, but have searched through settings and help pages.</p>
<p>It is really inconvenient &amp; time consuming to have to keep re-opening file explorer and click through the file trees to get back to where I was.</p>
<p>This comes up a lot when I am going from different camera SD cards or USB flash drives.</p>
<p>Thanks for any ideas.</p>
<p>If it can't be done, consider this a request for improvement or bug report.</p>

<p>No error messages.</p>
<p>I've always experienced this File Explorer shut down in this particular situation since I got the computer a couple of years ago, thus I haven't made any changes since the issue started.</p>
<p>I haven't done anything that could be called troubleshooting, I've only searched for settings which might be changed from the default to remedy the situation. Since I didn't find any settings changes that fit the situation, I didn't change anything.<br />
I've always had an antivirus utility running on this computer (Webroot Secure Anywhere), in addition to what is built in with Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just seems like default behavior for File Explorer. When I right-click on the Flash drive or SD card device on the listing, and select Eject, it does eject the device, and I am informed that it is safe to remove device, but then File Explorer closes.
 No error messages, no indication that this is anything but normal behavior.</p>

<p>All my Windows 10 files are on the C: drive, an internal SSD. The problem occurs when I am ejecting external memory devices such as Flash drives &amp; SD cards.</p>
<p>I switch between SD cards frequently when I am loading files from cameras &amp; organizing those files on internal hard drives. It is tedious when Windows File Explorer shuts down when I eject an SD card, then have to re-open Explorer and click through several
 times to re-locate the drive &amp; folder into which I want to place the files from the external device.<br />

    <title>Why is there no proxy support&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is there no proxy support&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Morning,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm getting in contact because I'm have some problems with using Kodu with XBox 360.&nbsp; In about 2 weeks I'm supposed to do a schools workshop for about 50 ICT subject leaders in the Manchester Area in the UK.&nbsp; I was going to show them how to use Kodu on
 the XBox 360 and program a simple game with the idea they would take it to their schools and possibly incorporate it into their curriculums.&nbsp; However there is a huge problem...</p>
<p>&nbsp;Did you know you the XBox 360 does not support proxies?&nbsp; This is a huge issue as our networks in schools use proxy servers to connect to the internet.&nbsp; Now this wouldn't be that big a problem if we could take the XBox elsewhere and install Kodu on it then
 bring it into school and play it offline...</p>
<p>Did you know it is impossible to play an Indie game downloaded from the XBox marketplace without being signed into XBox live via your internet connection...</p>
<p>Basically I have a huge problem.&nbsp; The only way to get round this is to connect the XBoxes via Internet Connection Sharing but believe me, no school is going to buy 10 XBoxes and 10 copies of Kodu to find that you have to connect them via a laptop.&nbsp; They
 may download the PC version of Kodu but it's not as impressive a learning tool.</p>
<p>Is there any way to get round this problem so I can actually use Kodu in school with the XBox but without Internet Connection Sharing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surely it'd be worth building in some support for proxies.&nbsp; What I'm about to do in 2 weeks could lead to potential sales of 500 XBoxes.&nbsp; Imagine if all schools in the UK could take up this opportunity.&nbsp; Please build in some proxy support - the Wii has it!</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<p>Hey there! I'm thrilled to hear you're trying to bring game design into curriculum! Unfortunately there is no way around these limitations that I'm aware of. If you are interested, we do have a guide on connecting your console to LIVE through a PC (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/troubleshoot/kb/connect-Xbox-360-console-Xbox-LIVE-with-computer-978618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../connect-Xbox-360-console-Xbox-LIVE-with-computer-978618</a>)
 if you wanted to try it out. Maybe it's easier than you think. Let me know if that helps at all.

<p>I work in a school in the North of England and we would like to use our XBox and Kinect more heavily especially since Michael Gove's announcement regarding the change in focus for the ICT curriculum and the launch of KinectFusion but the 360's limited network
 settings make it very hard work.</p>
<p>You would be hard pressed to find a school in the UK whose connection does not pass through a proxy and content filter and often this is controlled at county level rather than by the individual school.</p>
<p>Both the Wii and PS3 are easily used in this environment yet neither are as engaging for our students - Microsoft are missing a trick here as despite a lot of support, particularly in the US, for indy developers and universities they're not getting in on
 the 'ground floor' with schools.</p>
<p>Currently I'm stuck with taking the XBox and Kinect home with me whenever it requires an update, not a great solution.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Surely this is something you can work around on your network? You could put the Xboxes in the DMZ zone of your network or even operate the proxy for that part of the network in transparent mode so it still does its job but it is invisible to the user (Xbox)</p>
<p>Totally understand your issue and that the need is there but just like wireless RADIUS support the userbase for this feature compared to the home market must be so small which is probably why it hasn't been included.</p>
<p>I'm sure there used to be a suggestions forum on xbox.com where you could post new features you would like to have included but I cannot seem to find it.</p>
<p>Maybe Mister Gwther can point you in the right direction or you could also try to drum up some support with schools in your area and maybe write to Major Nelson to ask for it to be considered?</p>
<p>HTH</p>

                    Since initial purchase and instalment of windows xp i have not had any sound at all. I found out that i do not seem to have the audio drivers properly installed. i allowed windows to search the xp install disc for drivers, but it found none. Could you
 provide me with a link to where i could download such, or how to search for drivers using windows update?

    <title>Numpad has the &#43; sign stuck - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skorpion777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Numpad has the &#43; sign stuck</h2>
                    The '+' key in my numpad is not 'set' properly. I rarely use it unless working with entering numbers in spreasheets. If I ever use it and for the very few times I have, the + sign runs away after entering any of the numbers. It was so annoying, I took
 the battery out of the numpad and they sit in pieces on my desk!&nbsp;Almost feels like a cheaper spring was used to lift the + key and so any tiny vibration to the desk (yes, not even near the numpad) has the + enabled and it runs. So if I tried to type 9876,
 it would appear as 9+++..... Does anyone else have a problem with their numpad? Does MS know about it?&nbsp;

<p><span>First I suggest you to check by disabling the Num lock and type any key on the keyboard and check if the + sign appears.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the + sign does not appear then try to connect the keyboard in a different computer and check if the same issue persist.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Yasser! But the problem is not a connection or a technical issue. It is a manufacturing defect by the looks of it. The moment the battery is inserted in the numpad and you open a Word or Excel document, the + sign will start appearing. As there is
 no On/Off switch on the numpad (something so silly to not have, as the Mouse has it), the unit is ON all the time and is a headache to work with. I had to pull the battery out (and no mean task as well, as the battery case is SCREWED on, why not just magnetic
 like all the others - K/B and Mouse?). Only then can one work with the mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the spring/contact for the + sign may not have been built correctly, so in close proximity/contact. So even a tiny vibration to the desk (yes, the table) will activate the + sign indefinitely and appears like (++++++++++). If I type a number
 say, 7, it will appear as 7++++++++ (and so on), if I press 9 then (9+++++++++) and if I press 1, then (1+++++++++), so the numpad is practically useless as you can see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I have two keyboards (Thanks MS), one is this new one, and the other is the stock standard Dell one, which I use for JUST THE NUMPAD. What a major fail!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I am an IT grad and Pro-Excel user, I know when a issue is with just swapping computers to tests, but thanks anyway.</p>

<h2>            File History - Missing Files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Win10 Pro x64 and just started using File History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it made its first backup I looked at the Properties of the backup's data set and the source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The backup had:</p>
<p>108 less files</p>
<p>56,481 less Gb</p>
<p>5,210 less folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an explanation?&nbsp; The difference in Gb may be due to a compression algorithm (?), but otherwise ….&nbsp; The difference in files could be hidden system files which are being included in the source properties.&nbsp; The difference in folders is a mystery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I do not have any file types excluded.&nbsp; The backup was strictly limited to my data drive, so the system was not included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be related to files that were currently in use when you perform the backup process. Any third-party application or background application may trigger this and the tool will not be able to backup files currently used by such applications. I recommend
 that you perform another backup process after disabling these applications and while in clean boot state. Refer to this support article for the steps on
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
how to perform a clean boot in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, you can check the File History event logs to view the exact error or reason why some files were not included in the backup process. Kindly follow these steps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type in <strong>Restore your files with File History </strong>in the <strong>
Cortana Search </strong>bar and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Configure File History settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Advance settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Event logs</strong>, click <strong>Open File History event logs to view recent events or errors</strong>.</li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 7 gives a BCCode 131 after bootup and login on a clean install.</h2>
                    Hi. I've purchased a copy of Windows 7 Pro (32-Bit edition, upgrade only) through the MSDNAA, and have recently installed it over an clean copy of Vista business (also from MSDNAA). I loaded the graphics and motherboard drivers onto the machine in question,
 with no toubles. However, when loading the drivers for my sound card, the computer bluescreens and reboots, creating a memory dump in the process. The details of the error are as follows:<br />

<br />
The computer has not been connected to the internet, ruling out virus/trojan/worm (from my point of veiw), and has no programs on it other than the drivers I installed, which came with the components, which were in sealed boxes. At this point in time, I can
 only assume the copy of Windows 7 that was downloaded from MSDNAA was corrupted at some point in the download process, but would like to know if there is any advice that I could use to rectify the problem, saving me the effort of re-installing the operating
 systems.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I have since re-installed a clean copy of Vista Business, and have put the driver that seemed to cause the problem on it, straight from the disk, with no problems. I guess it must have been the copy of Windows 7 that got corrupted. Even so, it would be
 nice to know the answer to the original question, just in case it happens again.

            Hi <strong>The_Denton,</strong> <br />
&nbsp;<br />
That's definitely a driver compatibility issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Whenever you install Windows 7 in future I would recommend you to run the upgrade advisor.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>2.</strong> And you are always recommended to download and install the drivers from the manufacturer's website for Windows 7.<br />
If there are no drivers available for windows 7 you can install the drivers in Windows Vista or XP compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
You can find more information about compatibility modes in the articles below:<br />

<h2>            How to update Standard VGA graphics adapter</h2>
                    So Yesterday, I installed Windows 7 Home premium on my Dell Inspiron n5050 Laptop. (Note i've had a Windows 7 Gamer edition and it Worked fine. With no problems.)&nbsp; Its about 3-4 years old Give or take. Computer runs kinda slow... When i stream video it
 hiccups/Skips/Lags. Doesn't sync with sound.&nbsp; Recently I've downloaded 2 online games on my laptop. Roblox, and RumbleFighter. I get 2 different errors on each game. I'm pretty sure they're both related in some shape or form. The RumbleFighter error i get
 is:<br />
---------------------------<br />
Standard VGA Graphics Adapter (TITLE) This is my Video Card name.<br />
---------------------------<br />
Direct X µð¹ÙÀÌ½º »ý¼º ½ÇÆÐ (error)<br />
---------------------------<br />
OK&nbsp;&nbsp; (Button) When i press this button Cilent closes.<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
The Roblox error i get is:<br />
---------------------------<br />
ROBLOX(title)<br />
---------------------------<br />
Your graphics drivers seem to be too old for Roblox to use.<br />
<br />
Visit http://www.roblox.com/drivers for info on how to perform a driver upgrade. (Error)<br />
---------------------------<br />
OK&nbsp;&nbsp; (button) When i press this button Cilent closes.<br />

&nbsp;P.S. I have downloaded this Direct X : DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer<br />

<p>Some games also stutter because they are very disk drive intensive, monitor your drive activity LED to tell if the drive is unable to keep up with the game's demand.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 download with Microsoft money 2005 UK - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melvynhardy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 download with Microsoft money 2005 UK</h2>
                    I have just downloaded Windows 10,but my Microsoft Money 2005 UK will not work. It asks for IE6 to be installed which is now long gone. Somebody has suggested altering the registry to fix the problem,but i am reluctant to do as i do not know what i will
 be doing,i.e "out of the frying pan and into the Fire" . Any suggestions as to what to do ? how do i contact the right people in the Windows 10 launch team to make them aware&nbsp; of this problem ?. looks like a patch or fix is required on Windows 10.

            I had the same problem on the US version of Microsoft Money 2005. After upgrading to Windows 10, in desktop mode there were two icons on the left side of the taskbar, one for Edge and one for Internet Explorer 11&nbsp;that I was using in Windows 8.1. Because
 I couldn't open Money 2005 I rolled my operating system back to Windows 8.1.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
After doing that, to learn how to share the link to the file if you are unaware, please visit the following link -
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share files and folders and change permissions</a> and view <strong>'Get a link'</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUpUtilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use. With this said, if you've run such software, you will need to allow the system to crash once again to generate a crash dump.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Patrick<br />

            <p>It takes time to develop sufficiently the understanding of&nbsp;the clues in dump files to resolve a recurring blue screen error. You would only gain these skills by expending considerable time and effort. Not all dump files contain specific clues so sometimes
 the investigator has to look at a number of dump files or try other approaches to resolve this type of computer error. Patrick Barker is very good at teasing out any clues in a dump file.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please post copies of your dump files as shared files (excluding any more than one month old) to your OneDrive with a link here.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The dump file will be created at c:\windows\minidump. You may need to change your settings in Windows to be able to see the file. To show hidden files type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select View, Advanced Settings and
 verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known
 file types" is not checked.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please download and run Driver View and upload a copy of <span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">
the</span> report it produces to your OneDrive. To get a report on all drivers select Edit, Select All followed by File, Save Selected Items.</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Please provide a copy of your System Information file. Type System Information in the Search Box above the start Button and press the ENTER key (alternative is Select Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, System Information). Select File,
 Export and give the file a name noting where it is located. Do not place the cursor within the body of the report before exporting the file. The system creates a new System Information file each time system information is accessed. You need to allow a minute
 or two for the file to be fully populated before exporting a copy. Please upload to your OneDrive, share with everyone and post a link here. Please say if the report has been obtained in safe mode. The request for a copy of this file is additional to answering
 the question about make and model. </span></p>

            <p>I want to include what little I know historical as well so that maybe it strikes a red flag when looking at the dump files I sent to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I found the cpu at 70C from blocked intake filters.&nbsp; It's now back in the 40Cs.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The only driver that change the is a red flag for me is around 5/24 when I reinstalled my external WD driver that back up my computer.&nbsp; If you see SES Driver or anything related to WD causing the error let me know.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Microsoft tech have told me a) it's related to a wifi and b) the hard drive may be failing.&nbsp; For a., I don't&nbsp; have internal wifi, only router software.&nbsp; For b., perhaps I have burned my hard drive up with the lack of cooling.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the only history I have, hopefully you'll see something in the dump file.</p>

            <p>Thanks Patrick.&nbsp; I installed the ASUS software with my motherboard a couple of years ago.&nbsp; I use a lot of those tools like the temperature and fan analysis tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went ahead and unistalled the ASUS Ai Charger.&nbsp; I also uninstalled the ASUS update utilty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left the ASUS fanxpert and PC Probe(temperature).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't work, I'll take out the other two. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that ASUSTek Computer Inc asks for permission to access Asloader.exe (no idea what it is trying to do) every time I log on the other user account.&nbsp; I did recently reload the update utility to get the latest motherboard update to remedy the
 blue screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the only things I have noticed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>fyi.....I talked with two MS techs, the first said it was my wifi, the second said it was a hardrive issue.&nbsp; The only info they had was the blue screen code in the first post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm extremely happy to hear it may not be a hardrive issue.&nbsp; I can also assure you that I have checked the disk many times lately with no bad sectors.</p>
