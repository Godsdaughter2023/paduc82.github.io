    <title>Reconnect your File History Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amma904  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reconnect your File History Drive</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 on an HP Envy Laptop - and I'm not particularly "computer savvy"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a message to Reconnect my File History Drive - Is this supposed to be a hard drive ON my laptop computer? &nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026565/windows-reconnect-your-file-history-drive says to go to &nbsp;<span>Settings</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><span>Update
 &amp; security</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><span>Backup&nbsp;</span><span>and
 reselect the network - but I am not "on a network" - I'm on a stand alone laptop - so I don't have a network to "reselect". &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Back on May 15, 2017 I used an external hard drive to back up my computer because I kept getting notifications
 Microsoft was going to "upgrade" - Now, when I go to <strong>Control Panel &gt; All Control Panel Items &gt; File History</strong> is says my "Segate Backup Plus Drive (G:) Disconnected" - I don't normally use this Seagate external hard drive and wondered if I am
 supposed to somehow reconnect to my laptop's "File History Drive" to "RECOVERY (D:)" &nbsp;that I see under "This PC &gt; Devices and Drives" - and if this is the case, how - very specifically - do I reconnect to this? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And, if I need to connect to RECOVERY (D:) -- how do I avoid having Windows 10 change back to an external
 hard drive that I may connect to in the future?</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your help!</span></p>

            I have a touch screen HP desktop that went into auto update to completely crash to a blue screen that sends you on a circle of death.&nbsp; It says pick a language, then takes you to another screen.&nbsp; Now anything you choose will end in not allowed or it doesn't
 exist.&nbsp; I have tried to do a hard reset and turn it off several times and it never goes into recovery mode.&nbsp; It says to reinstall disk.&nbsp; I didn't get a disk.&nbsp; I paid almost $1000. And it didn't come with one.&nbsp; What an I supposed to do to fix the over priced
 paper weight.&nbsp; And I am losing faith in Microsoft and their products.&nbsp;

<h2>            MS Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000</h2>
                    <p>Since the latest Windows 10 update (March 2018) v1709,&nbsp; OS Built16299.251 - the bluetooth connection between the two connections cannot connect. My Laptop sees the mouse and the mouse sees the laptop but when I try to connect it asks for a password or sometimes
 says that the password is wrong but I do not have a password and I never needed a password before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do searches on the WWW and on Microsoft HELP I only find subjects relating to non-working bluetooth hardware. My problem is not about hardware but about "handshaking" connections between the two devices.</p>

            This doesn't work and I have never had to put in a code before. Even the MS Mouse instructions say that there is not code... it auto connects.

    <title>I need to uninstall Windows 10 after the month deadline - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I need to uninstall Windows 10 after the month deadline</h2>
                    <p>I need to uninstall Windows 10 and revert back to 8.1. I rolled with 10 for a while now, but with each update it only seems to become worse. What began as irritating bugs (dead task bar, etc) has now become a matter of starting and restarting to just get
 10 to boot up. I keep getting an error notice telling me to sign out and sign in again, but that never seems to work, so it's hard start over and over again. I gave the OS a chance, and now that it's passed the month deadline evidently I can't remove 10 and
 restore my desktop to some level of working condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is no help, as they do not appear to have a help line or customer service function (no surprise there).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be welcome</p>
<p>Thanks in advance...</p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rollback is dependent on the availability of the Windows.old folder &amp; other folders, if you delete that, then you may not be offered the option to rollback.<br />
If you receive the error, "We’re sorry, but you can’t go back. The files we need to take you back were removed", then it could mean two things:</p>
<p><br />
<strong>a. </strong>You are carrying out the rollback operation after a month of upgrading to Windows 10.<br />
<strong>b.</strong> You have deleted the <strong>$Windows.~BT </strong>and <strong>
$Windows.~WS </strong>folders required by the system to perform the rollback operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you rename these folders within 30 days, you may be able to rollback Windows 10 after 30 days limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, if you receive this message, you can check if you have any old system restore points available and try to restore your Windows 10 to the oldest point. To perform system restore, refer to the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>a.</strong> Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Type <strong><em>rstrui.exe </em></strong>in the Run dialog box.</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Follow the onscreen instructions to perform System Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Disclaimer: </em></strong><em>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we will be glad to assist you.</p>

            Is it installing an update when it restarts or this restart seems like a crash?
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?

<br />Open Start, type: system information

<h2>            Wrong email address shown under Outlook account in Windows Mail App &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have a Microsoft account with both a <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***'</strong> and a
<strong>'myname@mydomain' </strong>alias.&nbsp; The 'myname@mydomain' alias is the primary one (although I have swapped them over in the past).</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>In the Mail App on Windows 10 I have both accounts set up.&nbsp; The 'mydomain' account is listed as:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>'myname@mydomain'</strong> <em>(account name)</em></p>
<p>'myname@mydomain' <em>(email address)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>...and the other one is listed as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>'Outlook'</strong> <em>(account name)</em></p>
<p><strong>'myname@mydomain' </strong><em>(email address)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook account&nbsp;should&nbsp;have the email address&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***' instead of 'myname@mydomain'&nbsp;but I can find no way of changing it, either from within the app or from my Microsoft account online.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply NC.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem happens in the mail app - I'm not sure which other apps I should check as I can't think of any that display a list of&nbsp;account names and email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed the Outlook alias to primary (I've tried this before) and it made no difference: the mail app still displays:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"Outlook"</strong></p>
<p><strong>"myname@mydomain"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The mail app is receiving mail on my Outlook account, so it works, but for some reason&nbsp;the app has got itself confused with the displayed email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to change the primary alias back again as I don't want the Outlook alias as primary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>The 'Outlook' account is your Windows Login account, the same one that is used for Windows Store and that is assigned to you when you set up Windows. You can not change it nor remove it, only change the name.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I originally set up the account with my existing email address and got an Outlook address later.&nbsp;&nbsp;It
<em>can</em> be changed or deleted as the option to delete the Outlook address or add further aliases and make them primary is provided online in account management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, that's&nbsp;beside the point. I don't want to remove it, I want to keep it (as a secondary alias), but underneath the heading 'Outlook' in Windows Mail I want *** Email address is removed for privacy ***' displayed because that is my Outlook email address. I don't want it to
 display another (incorrect) email address.</p>

            <p>As is confirmed in the help (I did not make that up) the default 'Outlook' account in Mail cannot be removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours can then it isn't the default Windows login account and you should see two accounts with the same name (Outlook) in Accounts (on the right pane). One of them must be the Windows Login account aka Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Login&nbsp;account (or Microsoft account) is&nbsp;an account to receive mail from Microsoft only, which is probably&nbsp;the main reason why&nbsp;it can't be removed. That account can be used to send mail but it will send it on behalf of&nbsp;
<strong>'myname@mydomain' (account name), </strong>the reply address.&nbsp;That is the email address that you&nbsp;provided when you set up Windows for the first time. From what I gathered this is also known as the Primary Alias if you don't change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what you see under Outlook (the Microsoft account)&nbsp;is the&nbsp;Primary Alias.&nbsp;Perhaps that changes if you change&nbsp;the account&nbsp;into a 'send and receive' account, I don't know.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply BE.&nbsp; Your help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think&nbsp;we're both just saying the same thing differently. &nbsp;It seems that you <em>
can</em> change and delete any email address/login, provided that a valid, primary one is retained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have an Outlook.com email address but, because that is not my primary alias, I can only receive&nbsp;and not send email using that account from Windows mail app?&nbsp; That seems to be a very strange 'feature'!&nbsp; Especially as I can send
<em>and</em> receive if I do it on the Outlook.com website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Outlook.com options page, my Outlook account is set as send-and-receive.&nbsp; The 'myname@mydomain' account is set as send only.&nbsp; It appears that, to change it to a send-and-receive account, I have to use POP3 - and I prefer to use IMAP.&nbsp; I can't see
 how changing this would&nbsp;address this particular&nbsp;issue&nbsp;in any case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

            <p>Well , the <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** just doesn't help understanding the problem much better&nbsp;and I have no idea&nbsp; what
</strong><strong>'myname@mydomain' </strong>should translate into so I'm sort of flying blind on that Outlook account named '<strong>Outlook</strong>' which in my case is the Microsoft account, the account that is (also) used to login into windows (using the
 same password) and from where Microsoft controls my billing if I buy from the App store. That one can not be removed. You should be able to find one account in your account list that is undeletable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also do not need to login to that Outlook account; as soon as I go to Hotmail.com Live,com or Outlook.com (the websites) I'm automagically landing&nbsp;in my Outlook account mailbox. When I login to my account settings I arrive at another Webpage with my account
 settings and I also see my recent <strong>purchases.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can definitely sent email from the Microsoft Account, you just can't receive any email there when someone replies to the message that you sent from there. It will go to your account with the email address that is listed under the Microsoft account name.
 That is what 'on behalf' means and what is set as the Reply Address. It sends email as if it was sent from the other (on behalf) account. On the Microsoft account that is in fact the primary alias. So if you say primary alias above you must be referring to
 your other regular email account's primary alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is uncanny how much&nbsp;confusion you can create by merely mentioning the word 'outlook'.</p>

    <title>Two Skype accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moonrey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two Skype accounts</h2>
                    <p>Somehow ?? I have two skype accounts because the Skype / Microsoft merger messed everything up and made using the right account info impossible. I can't get into my old account and getting a new password for the old account requires my hotmail information.
 Absurd. Now its forcing me to use a community board to fix an account error that the community can't help with. Ridiculous!!!</p>
<p>Anyone know how to merge accounts? I'm gambling you can't.</p>

            Check you settings again.&nbsp; It does NOT say <em>never update</em>. It says <em>
<strong>never check for updates </strong></em>(Not recommended).&nbsp; Not the same thing.&nbsp; Never is a setting you can use if you wish to take responsibility for initiating check for updates then decide for yourself what to update.&nbsp; Actually it is the setting I
 recommend to my clients.

            it just keeps running,and with me getting computer set back to factory settings, i have been reading about "fix it" etc there seems to be a lot of differing advice about this problem,and also seems to&nbsp; be a problem with windows 7

            Yes I continually have this issue and I am frustrated. I am clueless at this moment as to what is causing it and how to fix it. Tried it 6 times already and it fails at 68% every time giving me this error.

            <p>I have tried disconnecting all external hardware,&nbsp;disabling AMD catalyst which didn't help, I have disabled LAN connections, which didn't help, I have stopped short of uninstalling my LAN connections as I don't want to then have to find my drivers again.
 I'm leaving it for a week while I still have a functioning PC (big scare earlier when I uninstalled AMD catalyst, has BSOD, I think F8 during restart somehow fixed it.</p>
<p>I haven't yet disconnected my other hard drives yet which I saw in one of the other 8.1 issues posts.</p>

            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hi All,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue for a better understanding. Please answer to these questions:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When exactly do you get this error code? Is it at the download phase or installation phase?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you install all the important updates via Windows Update before you started the Windows 8.1 installation? Are all the device drivers updated to their latest version on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any external hardware device (except the mouse and the keyboard) connected to the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It has been found that in many instances this issue has been fixed after you restart the computer and attempt to install Windows 8.1 again for the 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> time. So, first of all, I would request
 you to restart the computer and then attempt to install Windows 8.1 again and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, make sure that you have installed all the important and critical updates for your operating system via Windows Update. You can also check that the drivers for all the devices on the computer are up to date. Please
 go to the computer or device manufacturer’s website to get the latest updates for all the drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, then try the methods given below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Method 1: <span>
Disconnect all the unnecessary external devices connected to the computer (except the mouse and the keyboard)</span></span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please disconnect all the unnecessary external devices connected to the computer (except the mouse and the keyboard) and then check if you still face this issue while installing Windows 8.1. This is to check if the
 issue is caused by any external devices connected to the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you still face this issue, then let’s try clearing the Windows Store Cache and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Method 2: Clear the Store cache</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try these steps to clear the Store cache and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press the “Windows Logo” + “R” keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “<b><i>wsreset.exe</i></b>” and press “Enter”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Reboot the computer and then check the issue with the installation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any third party security program installed on the computer, then try the next method.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Method 3: Temporarily disable the third party security program. (If you have installed any)</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any third party security program installed on the computer, then I request you to contact its technical support to temporarily disable the program and then check the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Important: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this resolves the issue. Please get back to us with the results.</span></p>

            Are there any more troubleshooting steps? I have tried the above with no success. A while back I restored this system to a RAID 0 SSD array. It was originally on a single SSD. Perhaps this has corrupted the activation data for the system which is preventing
 the upgrade? Is there a script or a FixIt that I can run to reset the activation data?&nbsp;I have been taking screenshots of this upgrade experience which in this case&nbsp;has been less than stellar. My other machine upgraded without issue. I will be happy to provide
 this feedback if desired.

<h2>            Does bitlocker protect my license key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have win10 system drive which is encrypted by bitlocker and I've got some questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does bitlocker protect my windows license key? </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Does bitlocker requires to enter license key during reinstalling system from bitlocker recovery screen?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If not is it possible do disable option to reinstall system from bitlocker recovery screen, but leave options to enter recovery key and password and in that way protect the license?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer and tell me if I'm wrong in anything :-)</p>

            If you're not familiar with how Bitlocker works, you should not use it.&nbsp; I don't know what you mean by "protect my windows license key," but if you encrypt your drive with Bitlocker and then lose the Bitlocker recovery key or password, your data will not
 be recoverable under any circumstances.

<p>I maybe asked in wrong way. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In bitlocker recovery options I saw option to reinstall system from recovery screen if I forget password or if tpm is broken or something like that (I use it without tpm) and I'm asking if is it possible to check license without entering recovery key or
 password by someone (for example by reinstalling).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how bitlocker works, 256 bit AES encryption to protect data blablabla... etc. :-) But I'm not sure about this thing but I don't have time to check it by myself so that's why i'm asking. I like to know what I'm using :-)</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Hi Remilla,</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are receiving the OneNote pop-up at the startup, follow these methods.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may remove the OneNote icon from the taskbar. Right click on the OneNote icon in taskbar, click on ‘Remove OneNote icon’.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may configure the computer clean boot state and then check if the issue persists. It will start Windows7 by using a minimal set of
 drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the step 7 from the article: How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows
 Vista or in Windows7:&nbsp; </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>

<h2>            Halo 2 on Xbox One.</h2>
                    Im here to say no. If they make Halo 2 HD I would rather have it on 360 then on One, because That the Halo game i need. Plus Xbox One is already getting Halo 5. So give Halo 2 to 360 owners.

<p>The whole series of Halo does need to be on Xbox 1 I agree. And yes I do own the Xbox 1. I really dont care if Halo takes ups every 500 gb of storage but I doubt it will. Strange though CoD ghosts take 32gb of storage if downloaded.

<p>I have a suspicion that people will be very disappointed with Halo 2 Anniversary.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Most people seem to speak mostly of its multiplayer but it wouldn't be the multiplayer they remember. More likely they would be beta testing the system intended for Halo 5.</p>

<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-3_thumb.png%3fw%3d522%26amp%3bh%3d276" /></a></p>
<p>This simple tool will help you convert the same image file you just created to a USB thumb drive. For installation purposes, you should get a thumb drive that’s at least 4 GBs in size to store the installation files. Browse to where the Windows
 7 Image is stored, open it. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-3b.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-3b_thumb.png%3fw%3d500%26amp%3bh%3d266" /></a></p>
<p>Select the USB device where you want to have the backup stored to for installation.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-3c.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-3c_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d500%26amp%3bh%3d250" /></a></p>
<p>Once the USB device has been identified, click the <strong>Begin copying
</strong>button.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-3d.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-3d_thumb.png%3fw%3d487%26amp%3bh%3d263" /></a></p>
<p>And that’s it, the next step now is to boot your Netbook from the thumb drive, make sure the thumb drive you will be installing Windows 7 from is plugged into the USB port. This might vary by manufacturer, but the usual one to try is F12, start
 your Netbook and press F12 repeatedly until a screen is displayed giving you the option to boot from a USB Memory device, select that and press
<strong>Enter </strong>on your keyboard. The screen should look something like the following:</p>

<h2>            GOLD</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have contacted the support team and asked for a refund for the items that I cannot use for there is no gold subscription on the account. However, that option is not available so we checked on other option including the adding of gold on the account or gold sharing. Since I do not have friends that has gold that will be able to share gold with me,&nbsp; I am here to check if there are promotions that you can provide for me? or maybe there is a free gold subscription that I can avail.</p>

<p><span>Hi Catfish Jim,</span></p>
<p><span>By default when you open FreeCell game, it will open a game randomly; you will not be able to get the game to open in sequence. This is by
 design and you will not be able to change the settings for it.</span></p>
<p><span>To play the game in sequence you will have to open FreeCell click on File and click on select game or press F3 and enter the number in sequence
 you want to play.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 8.1 taskbar thumbnails not showing when I hover, but only when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meyouknowwho  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 taskbar thumbnails not showing when I hover, but only when I click on combined group.</h2>
                    <p>Laptop Gateway NE 522 series, Windows 8.1 </p>
<p>Taskbar thumbnails not showing up when I hover on taskbar buttons of open programs/apps. The only way I can get thumbnails to show up is if I select taskbar properties "always combine" (buttons of the same type), and then I click on the combined group. But
 the thumbnails show only when I click on the group, never when I hover. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I have three separate IE browser windows or tabs, two or three notepad, two or three windows explorer. These are the programs I use most so far on this computer. If I group the buttons, then click on the group, then the thumbnails popup and
 all open copies of that program show thumbnails. But other programs or applications that would have only one copy open, such as Windows Media Player, Control Panel, Adobe Reader, etc., will not show a thumbnail when I hover, and therefore I would have to click
 on the taskbar button of the open program to see the window of that program. I cannot get a thumbnail preview without maximizing the window up from the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And is there a setting somewhere to change from thumbnails to a "list view"? I saw a list a couple times popup when I hovered, just like I saw the split second thumbnails popup when hovering. But I don't know how that happened nor how to make it happen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I enabled some additional toolbars with the taskbar: quick launch, desktop, programs. I also changed button sizes, and I turned off "charms" from popping up on the right, and upper right. These are minor changes. (The charms change I made in the
 registry, from 1 to 0, in the Elan touchpad folder there. But that should not affect taskbar thumbnail function.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thumbnails tried a couple times yesterday to pop up when I hovered. But it was only for a split second. And only a couple times. And that was when I had the taskbar buttons NOT combined in groups. I disabled the tool bars, changed the registry value
 back to enable charms popup, but that did not restore taskbar thumbnail hover feature. So I reset the toolbars and disabled charms again. I have also changed a few icons and moved some shortcuts in the "program" directory. But again, none of this should affect
 taskbar thumbnail hover function. I also downloaded a DRM license to play my WMA protected music on this computer, but that should not affect thumbnail hover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've considered doing a "system restore" back to 2 or 3 days ago, when the taskbar thumbnails were showing when hover, but then I would have to reset toolbars, icons, move things around again, and download the DRM license again. And get the windows updates
 again that I would undo in a system restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure this feature is worth the hassle, but I do like the thumbnail when hover feature. I also should mention that the windows 8.1 thumbnails have solid color borders (as do programs and apps), and squared corners. The only transparent Aero looking
 feature is the taskbar itself. Nothing else looks like Windows 7 Aero design. On my desktop computer, running Windows 7 Pro, all the Aero design appears correct, transparent full borders, transparent thumbnails that popup when hover.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 looks so beautiful and elegant. And window 8.1 on this laptop looks homely and bland. No Aero looking design but the taskbar, which will not popup thumbnails as it should. (Or maybe I got the Gateway cheapo edition of windows 8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I did get that frakkin' charms menu to stop popping up on the right side of the screen! And the accompanying rectangular clock on the lower left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I am hesitant to try system restore just because life is too short to mess with redoing so much afterward. I'm not totally convinced the system restore will fix the thumbnail hover problem. And I'm not convinced that Gateway doesn't set their
 computers to go bad after a little while. (They wanted $200 to diagnose and fix this problem!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also considering downloading and installing a third party app that would give me a taskbar and start button like windows 7. I wonder if such a program would also correct my taskbar thumbnail hover issue, since it would probably have included some Aero
 and similar design and functions. (Does anyone know about that?) ClassicShell is one I've read about. That one and a few others have reviews on CNET. Can anyone recommend the best (safest, most stable, most like Windows 7?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not very tech oriented. So please explain replies in common English. Thanks.</p>

            <p>hi Shawn.</p>
<p>I don't recall now if thumbnails were popping up when hovering, for all open programs/apps. I was mostly using File Explorer, IE, and Notepad. Because 8.1 came default set to combine buttons (of open programs) on taskbar, this is what I thought was correct/normal,
 that I click on the group button and then thumbnails pop up. I didn't notice any differently until I got tired/frustrated with 8's taskbar and remembered how to add quick launch toolbar onto taskbar. I also changed taskbar properties to "not combine" buttons.
 Right after that, I noticed thumbnails were not popping up when hovering, as they do in 7. I think I didn't ever try the taskbar settings to "not combine" (prior to adding quick launch toolbar). So, I don't know if the automatic thumbnail popup when hovering
 ever worked on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not familiar with windows 8.1, so I did not know what to expect. I tried to familiarize myself with 8.1 but then too much time passed for me to return the laptop to retailer as defective. All I knew of windows 8 was that it was **** and most people
 hated it, but it was too late to find a laptop with windows 7 at a retail store. (I'm not tech savvy.) I asked a local repair person if he could uninstall 8 and install 7. (I have discs for 7, which is on my desktop computer.) But then I heard I could get
 a third party app to restore a 7-like taskbar and start button/menu. I'm still considering doing that. Do you know whether any of those third party apps (such as ClassicShell) will provide or correct the auto thumbnail popup feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As each day passes, I think I will not attempt a system restore. I think if I do that, it will just go back to a few days ago before I had enabled quick launch toolbar, and I will just be back to what I had since the beginning: taskbar buttons combined,
 and thumbnails showing when I click on grouped button. I think Gateway sucks as a company, but this was a fairly competitively priced laptop at a major retailer. I also still believe that the version of 8.1 on this laptop is a Gateway cheapo edition, like
 a starter edition that is even below regular 8.1. The style does not look Aero at all except that the taskbar is transparent. The rest looks like something from Kindergarten. (And Kindergarten students could probably make a computer better than Gateway.) But
 I have been running AVG Free, MBAM Free, and Spybot S&amp;D on this machine since I began using it. No major problems. I did uninstall Norton after its free trial ended, because AVG kept detecting Norton's most previous definition as a virus. But uninstalling
 Norton should not have affected taskbar thumbnail popup/preview function. (I think it should not.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think anything like Spybot immunization of browser could affect taskbar thumbnails? Or any regular settings in AVG or MBAM or such programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The person who does computer repair/maintenance for me suggested I contact certain reputable computer manufacturers and try to get a new laptop with windows 7 on it. My next computer will not have windows 8.anything as its OS. I will either get one with
 7 while still available, or wait for 9 while using this laptop with 8.1 such as it is. I'm glad I have the discs for 7 Pro and Office 2010. I hope my desktop lasts me until I can get something better than 8 and as good as (or close to) 7. I considered 7 to
 be the greater improved version of XP (with innovations, of course). Why the frak would anyone want to
</p>
<p>mess with 7? I hope 9 is at least as good and satisfying as 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should add that I phoned Microsoft and explained the problem, and all they say is "give us money, give us money, give us money." The bots there wanted $100 to diagnose and fix the problem. I told them I could take it to local repair persons who would fix
 it (and do even more enhancements)&nbsp;for $50 to $60. The bots at MS (and Gateway, who wanted $200) say they will fix it, like they know what I'm describing and they know it should behave differently. That's why I suspect Gateway of putting on a dumbed-down edition
 of 8.1, knowing that people will have to call and buy software service package. So much scamming, it's immoral. My desktop with 7 was built by my cousin (who died 3 years ago, too young). He was honest and generous. Few people like that now, or hard to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever else you can suggest or recommend will be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi<br />
If you mean the following instructions from that other thread, neither suggestion works for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First (from the other thread you suggested):</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this and it didn't work. But together with what I did next it probably helped.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Open up the folder with the pictures and click on the View tab<br />
&nbsp;Next click on Options to the far right<br />
&nbsp;Then Click on Change folder and search options<br />
&nbsp;This opens up an options menu<br />
&nbsp;Navigate to the view tab<br />
&nbsp;uncheck the box that says Always show icons, never thumbnails<br />
&nbsp;And Check the box that says Display file icon on thumbnails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This should solve the problem. It worked for me. </p>
<p>NOTE: This pertains to viewing files within folders, whether to see details or thumbnails. This is not my problem. Please read my posts again, and you will understand that my problem is with TASKBAR THUMBNAILS not rising up, or not popping up, above the
 taskbar, so I can preview open programs (Internet Explorer windows/tabs, File Explorer, Word, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the suggestion to type in the Run box:</p>
<p>
</p><p>gpedit.msc, I get the same message someone else posted that they got:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows cannot find gpedit.msc. Make sure you tuped the name correctly, and then try again."</p>
<p>Is there another way to reach this setting, GROUP POLICY EDITOR? And can that really affect Taskbar Thumbnail behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think this is a stripped down edition of windows 8.1, probably a gateway edition, to make buyers need to call and pay $100 or $200 more just to get the features that should already be included. Gateway sucks. And I think MS just wants to get more
 money out of windows users. People should leave windows 8 and go back to 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any more suggestion, please let me know. And please read both my posts again, so you understand the actual nature of my problem. The problem is not with folders views, but with Taskbar Thumbnail previews of open programs. Read my description
 of what happens, and that when I click the group icon of like open programs (e.g., several IE tabs/windows), the thumbnails rise up but they have an opaque background, not Aero transparent. And they rise up only when I click the combined group icon on taskbar,
 never when I simply hover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am done describing the problem symptoms. If someone thinks they might know the solution (and not merely suggest I read other posts) and wants to ask my specific settings, please do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>Concerning the 3 methods given (see below), regarding:</p>
<p>Method 3, as a last resort I might try to uninstall the driver, reboot windows 8.1, and reinstall the driver. But that is&nbsp;a procedure I am reluctant to try, because it seems risky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2, is what I will try once I turn the laptop computer back on. For now, I am back to using my desktop windows 7 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1, seems like what I already tried.&nbsp; </p>
<p>First, according to my previous posts, I thought I specified that this laptop computer came with windows 8.1 already on it. I did not upgrade to 8.1, that is what the computer had when I bought it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand that what you are telling me to try here is referring to "show desktop" peek feature. I do not wish to "show desktop." I wish to see taskbar Aero popups of the icons of the open programs. I do not know the precise techy words to use. But
 surely someone on this forum has a enough common sense to understand what I am describing. (I think that the techy thinking often loses common sense understanding.) You suggest that I check the box to use peek to preview the desktop. But I do not wish to preview
 the desktop in that manner. You do not state that checking this box will restore the taskbar popup thumbnail previews. So, I think you are misperceiving again what I am trying to accomplish.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you please answer back and describe what you think I am describing? That way I know you understand my problem. I will look at this setting when I care to turn the laptop computer back on.
</p>
<p>(I still think this was a deception by Acer-Gateway.) </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I have the same sudden problem but on Windows 8.0 Pro rather than 8.1.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the thumbnails until a recent problem with IE 10 that didn't have anything to do with the thumbnails.&nbsp; That problem is fixed.&nbsp; The thumbnails disappeared about the time of the IE problem (which grew out of last month's IE cumulative update).&nbsp; The two
 may or may not be related.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the suggestions that you mention except I have not and will not update my nVidia drivers.&nbsp; They are fine. They are NOT the problem.&nbsp; I do have the thumbnails on Win 10 Preview where there was never an IE problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you, I miss them and I need them back!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want Windows 7 Start Menu on Windows 8, install Start8 (I installed it on Win 10 Preview also (already had it on Windows 8) as it is a superior start menu to Microsoft's effort in Win 10 Preview and WindowBlinds (also from Stardock that makes Start8)
 and it gives you transparency with a lot of control for how much and where, gives you control over fonts so you can use a different Windows font (I had an awful time with the font that is forced by Microsoft for Windows Explorer. I need Verdana font and the
 only way to get a different Windows font is through WindowBlinds).&nbsp; You also have control over colors, texture, etc.&nbsp; You can choose from a lot of WindowBlinds presets and tons of full skins.&nbsp; (Great forum also for help).&nbsp; Plus, Window Blinds will give you
 transparency of the taskbar thumbnails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I happen to prefer XP style flat, square corners&nbsp; rather than rounded 3D look of Windows 7 so I now have full transparency of Windows but with XP like square corners.&nbsp; I even installed WindowBlinds on Win 10 Preview so I have full transparency there and
 my Verdana bold font for Windows Explorer and various shades of green instead of all the blue you get with Microsoft for things like download progress bars and when you highlight a word in some text, etc ...it's various shades of green for me which for my
 eyes is not only much more attractive than the harsh blues Microsoft favors (like at this forum) but it doesn't tire my eyes like the harsh blues do.&nbsp; I have been a million times happier with Windows 8 after installing these two third party programs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Classic Shell is great also but I think it is not as stable BUT I haven't used it in quite awhile and I know folks who love it and it is free.&nbsp; Start 8 is $5 and WindowsBlinds is $10 and they are so stable that they both work on Windows 10 Preview (which
 is beta Windows) without a problem.&nbsp; You get a 30 day trial so you can always cancel if you don't like them.&nbsp; Plus, Stardock has frequent sales and probably has some going now since it is Christmas time.&nbsp; If you use any Metro apps then you should check out
 Stardock's ModernMix also.&nbsp; It's $5 also but you get a discount if you buy several at the same time.&nbsp; Modern Mix does on Windows 8/8.1 what is built into Win 10 Preview.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.stardock.com/products/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, these Stardock programs don't fix the disappearance of thumbnails for programs in the task bar on Windows 8 Pro.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; I really want them back!&nbsp; I had them for almost two years working fine until that IE Cumulative update last month.&nbsp; As
 for Listview, I just tested by filling the taskbar up and then opening Thunderbird and I opened five emails and because the task bar was full they stacked on top of each other (that's a setting in Taskbar options - I think that governs it "combine when taskbar
 is full").&nbsp; I hovered the mouse over the stack, they all showed in list view in a vertical list.&nbsp; This is interesting that List view works for items open in the taskbar and stacked but thumbnail hover doesn't.&nbsp; Seems to me if one works the other should also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You really gotta get Start8 or something like it because Start8 will control that pesky charms bar and that ugly, way too big black clock! I struggled for two months two years ago with Windows 8 and that charms bar that was always popping up for no reason
 and it was a glorious relief when I got Start8 and worth every penny of the $5 I paid for it.&nbsp; All this stuff is particularly irritating on a powerful desktop computer with a 24" NON (deliberately) touch screen gorgeous monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, I hope someone can help us figure out how to get the thumbnail previews back!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have Dell Premiere support so if I end up calling them about it and they figure it out I'll be sure and post the solution here.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the usb Windows 7 Pro reinstallation
 stick from Dell (I bought Win 8 Pro instead of plain Win 8 partly so I would have downgrade rights to Win 7 Pro) so I can still "downgrade" to Windows 7 Pro but Dell did say there might be problems with my nVidia card (not driver).&nbsp; Plus, Win 8 is ok after
 I got it all fixed.&nbsp; But I should never have had to spend so much time (and some more money) to fix Microsoft's mess.&nbsp; I even had to fix Microsoft's problems like them forgetting to give us Win 8 users access to Last Known Good if there is a problem like after
 installing nVidia driver updates.&nbsp; I now have a proper boot screen where I can choose Safe Mode (that's not in Win 8 you know if you need to cold boot to safe mode), Last Known Good, and other boot options. (I don't think it is in 8.1 either).&nbsp; Last Known
 Good is what you need, not Restore Point, if you get a BSOD on boot after upgrading nvidia drivers and that happens frequently and happened to me which is why I was motivated to find out how to get back things Microsoft got rid of in Win 8.&nbsp; I also have a
 free program that makes System Restore far easier to use in Win 8 and it sits on the taskbar for easy accessibility and other things.&nbsp;

            <p>I have this problem all the time as well, generally when using Excel. What I notice is that I will start a new Excel sheet from clicking on the Start screen. I then save that new workbook. Then from that instance of Excel I will open up 6 other workbooks
 I need. Then when I go to hover over the Excel icon on the Taskbar, I only see the 6 workbooks I opened -&nbsp;I do not see the original workbook I saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I Alt-Tab, I can find my way back to the new workbook. So, it's definitely still there - just looks like a probably with how the visuals are working on the hover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling it is something to do with how the applications open from the Start screen on Win 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Win 8.1 Pro.</p>

            <p>That's probably an issue with Excel's limitations as an MDU program (Multi-Document User-Interface).&nbsp; Up until version 2013, opening multiple Excel files would open them into one Excel window container, and the documents themselves were all trapped inside
 that container.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, Excel was stuck like this from birth until version 2013, which finally changed the interface model.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.msdn.microsoft.com%2fdynimg%2fIC120097.gif" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2010, Excel took the first small step by finally being able to show individual document previews in the taskbar, even though it was really just one running "program".&nbsp; It did this by drawing extra off-screen windows (literally off your screen, they were
 just drawn with negative coordinates so that you couldn't see them on your pixel plane).&nbsp; Then the taskbar would see them and show previews.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it's been buggy and still is even in version 2013.&nbsp; This new version of Excel makes every single document appear inside it's own container window, so it "feels" more like how Word or Notepad runs.&nbsp; But Excel is just faking it, it's still using the MDI
 model underneath (the VBA object model for macros would break otherwise).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anyway, I doubt the problem you're seeing is truly a Windows 8 bug, or if it is, it's probably because of the shell tricks Excel is using to draw the previews in the first place.</p>

            <p>Interesting - certainly didn't know all of those details about how it draws up Excel windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a novice on these things, but I guess what I look at is simply that I had Win 7 for multiple years with Excel 2013 and never had this issue. Then when I went to Win 8, I had the same version of Excel, and the problem started happening. Only thing I could
 point to was Win 8 being the culprit.</p>
