<h2>            Windows 10 Technical Preview - First Impressions</h2>
                    <p>Whilst I still don't fully understand the logic or reasoning behind the naming convention adopted for the next version of Windows, I'll leave that aside as&nbsp;ultimately it's purely a matter for Microsoft what they call their OS and I'm sure that&nbsp;it makes perfect
 sense internally at Redmond.&nbsp; What we are&nbsp;here to&nbsp;contribute to&nbsp;is the Technical Preview and to hopefully help Microsoft in the development of a system that all users can live with and adopt as their own once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any personal feelings about&nbsp;the re-instatement of the "Start" menu.&nbsp; I fully understand the reasons behind the decision.&nbsp; It appears to be well implemented.&nbsp; However in the installation of TP it became necessary to log off and then log back
 in.&nbsp; It took a while to realise that the "User Name" and "Power Button" are two separate entities even though they share the same space in the menu structure.&nbsp; This leads to ambiguity and confusion for the user.&nbsp; It may seem an inconsequential and niggling
 point to many, but I believe this lies at the very heart of the matter and was one of the underlying reasons Windows 8 wasn't readily adopted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people cite the lack of a "Start" button&nbsp;in their&nbsp;need to find something to dislike about a system that confused them and remained an enigma to many.&nbsp; Others claim the Frankenstein nature of moving from the "Start" screen to the "Desktop" was a jarring
 experience and wasn't fluid.&nbsp; I haven't read or seen any&nbsp;articles or comments&nbsp;that redress what I believe was the fundamental underlying flaw in Windows 8 and as far as can been seen still exist&nbsp;in the current Technical Preview, that of consistency.&nbsp; However
 in all fairness to Microsoft and by their own assertion this is an early build, so may be the things I'm going to discuss now may well be&nbsp;redressed at a later stage.&nbsp; I certainly hope so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than trying to distance themselves from Windows 8, Microsoft should be&nbsp;openly&nbsp;proud of it and&nbsp;build on what was essentially an excellent piece of work with merit, irrespective of what other may say.&nbsp; Whilst recognising that its implementation wasn't
 executed particularly well.&nbsp; It had touches of genius but an equal amount of gaping holes.&nbsp; Microsoft's Windows 8 and the Modern UI gave millions a glimpse of what a unified experience on multiple devices would look like.&nbsp; I say look like as on the flip side
 when it came to the desktop experience people were left feeling left out, abandoned and confused.&nbsp; Especially the enterprise.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appeared that Microsoft had just pulled all the code from Windows 7 desktop and dumped it as an after thought into Windows 8.&nbsp; Although I'm pretty sure that wasn't the case.&nbsp; No real attention was&nbsp;paid to the appearance of the desktop and its associated
 applications and control panels with respect the principles laid down by Microsoft themselves for the implementation of the Modern UI.&nbsp; By which I mean when you drilled down into the core you were thrown back to 2009, which wasn't a very unified experience
 for the average user hence confusion. &nbsp;I'm sure this was solely due to time constraints and pressure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows&nbsp;10 is to&nbsp;represent a new direction for Microsoft and&nbsp;as has been&nbsp;claimed by the new leadership that we live in a mobile first cloud first world and the policy of Microsoft going forward is to provide the tools and services to business&nbsp;and consumers
 alike&nbsp;to achieve great things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it is essential that Microsoft understand and commit themselves to producing a truly cohesive unified system and not the "Pick n Mix" we've seen in the past.&nbsp; Even if that means putting back its provisional&nbsp;launch date
 of 2015?&nbsp; I know that Microsoft are primarily engineers and what I'm talking about is design and probably an anathema to most engineers, but the UI and UX especially in todays world of diverse devices make these just as important to the continued success of&nbsp;Windows
 as the features&nbsp;and service the engineers build into the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I very much doubt&nbsp;that what I have laid out&nbsp;would be deemed&nbsp;achievable in the time frame already set out for the next launch of Windows to the market.&nbsp; However I fear without tackling this very real problem Windows will only suffer further.&nbsp; I don't have
 all the answers as to how you square the circle, but it does appear to me that by implementing the "Insider Program" and releasing the "Technical Preview" Microsoft have all the pieces in place to ensure that the next Windows could be a real turning point
 for the company and users alike.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this isn't necessarily applicable to providing feedback on the Technical Preview, but there isn't any way of providing feedback directly through the system for the points I wanted to raise.&nbsp; You may well disagree with my assessment and your perfectly
 welcome to post a reply.&nbsp; I'll happily read them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck everyone with testing.&nbsp; Lets hope it's all things to all men/women.</p>

            <p>I'm not a marketing person but I'll bet that the naming of Windows 10 is a direct result of how consumers felt about Windows 8. Distancing itself from Windows 8, Microsoft is merely trying to address the issues that resulted in&nbsp;poor adoption by users.&nbsp;If
 the Technical Previews are&nbsp;rough drafts, then I&nbsp;can't wait to see the&nbsp;refined and final drafts.&nbsp;It&nbsp;does seem that they are actually listening to&nbsp;the&nbsp;users.&nbsp;Consumers will&nbsp;perceive&nbsp;increased functionality, reliability and security, by simply naming it Windows
 10, but the real genius will be its ability to address&nbsp;both consumer and enterprise markets&nbsp;and&nbsp;their needs for a secure and integrated environment. My Nokia 1520 already feels like an extention of my workstation.&nbsp;There's exciting times ahead, keep up the
 good work Microsoft !!!</p>

            My first impression - First off love that the start menu is back but do NOT like the fact that the start menu still has the Windows 8/8.1 Tab App option instead of the original Start Menu options of Programs/All Programs in Windows XP Thru 7. Secondly
 I do NOT like the fact you have to have a Microsoft Account in order to sign into windows. Yes makes it more secure but makes the user also have to sign up for another Email account through Microsoft in order to get into their computer. Bad Feature for sure.
 Need to have Local Log in options not Web only based as not 100% of all computers use the internet. Some users buy computers to do work at home without DSL, Cable or even Dialup Internet. Please update the start menu back to its original form - START - PROGRAMS
 or ALL PROGRAMS or at least give the option to have a Tab based Start menu or a Programs/All Programs based Start menu. So far I am not at all impressed with windows 10 Technical Preview and wouldn't recommend it once it does come out d

            Having downloaded for personal use I am finding the only problem that I am having is a slow response but this could be due to the fact that my laptop is several years old, so far the 10 in my opinion is very good even as far as the new start section and
 I noticed that if looking through the apps I had a pop up window asking if I found what I was looking for. I think that Microsoft may have outdone themselves with this build even though it is a long way from being finished so far so good.

            My first impression of Windows 10 is fairly positive.&nbsp; I actually like the new start menu.&nbsp; I think it a good balance between the old start menu and the new tile look of windows 8.&nbsp; Some users don't like change, but I think it is a good balance.&nbsp; The new
 task bar icons I think are helpful.&nbsp; It's nice to be able to do a search without going into the start menu.&nbsp;

            <p>Now First off, I agree that bring back the program names, second please bring back the ability to talk to the router in the address line, that's is so bad right now as I use 2 routers and the second one I have to change it to a hub set up fro all my tv game
 controllers and the second computer over there in another room.the IPCONFIG will not let me do what I did by talking to the #1 Main Router to recognize the second router plugged in the wan port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I have run into two more Driver install problems the FDC.INF &amp; FLPYDISK.INF. and the&nbsp;Device ACPI\PNP0510\4&amp;9c79eed&amp;0 No-driver found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also it lost the Firewall walll avast setting at the rebootof the computer that locked oout the internet access because it did not recognize it</p>

            <p>My Initial impressions of W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Tech preview from DVD on a spare Core i3 with a Gigabyte motherboard, 4GB of DDR3 and a blank SATA hard drive. Installation was trouble-free and all drivers were found (haven't tried manufacturer's drivers yet). You do NOT have to sign in
 with a Microsoft account. As in W8/8.1 you just have to look carefully for the local option. Start menu return is welcome although trying to incorporate the tiles is not. The good news is that the Classic Shell installs and works perfectly. Once you install
 all the necessary utilities ( a pdf reader, K-lite codec pack, 7Zip, Directory Opus, Picasa, XBMC, Chrome and Firefox) and change the Windows defaults W10 is starting to look better. Haven't installed Office 2003 yet (it does everything I need) or any burning
 programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is still going for the "one size fits all" approach to cover PCs, laptops, pads and phones and the result is still something that doesn't fit very very well on anything. I'm associated with a Telstra shop (in Australia) and I know how hard it is
 for the staff to sell a W8 phone. And no-one ever buys a second one. Have been using a Toshiba Portege tablet with keyboard dock for about 2 months. It has w8.1 and a 1920x1080 screen. As soon as you try to do any serious work (i.e. desktop) it is almost unusable
 because of the small size of everything. Yes, I do know that you can resize some things, but it's still not satisfactory. It does make a great video player though, but I wouldn't pay the $1,500 that is the retail price on it (I think) for a video player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is of course my opinion, but I find the MUI so ugly especially compared to both IOS and Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel that Microsoft needs to go back to a refined version of W7 for the desktop with the option of switching over to the MUI when wanted. Something like the way you can switch into Windows Media Centre in XP, Vista, 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just do not want a mobile phone interface on my desktop or laptop. and the novelty of having a touchscreen on a desktop or laptop lasts about 3 days. After that it may as well not exist.</p>

 need to throw a huge curve ball in order to get everyones attention, especially since Ubuntu and it's Debian counterparts are making huge strides in the market and set to release on several platforms in the next year, don't be the elephant in the room, be
 the Microsoft we all once had incredible faith in, 2 letters...XP not,. XP basic, starter, home, premium ultimate, fascinating, now buy our best at $299. your time to shine is now, &nbsp;don't be Jerry Jones and put 5 titles on your business card, just be honest
 and drop a bombshell on the market, i'm testing it right now. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO TAKE BACK THE MARKET..</p>
 i shied away right over 7 years even though i did tech test every beta since vista. anyway, i decided to delete the file, and being used to stalking Linux terminal installs i watched the deletion. i was shocked to find several Linux based programs/language
 in win 10. so i dug a little deeper, sure enough i was right. windows has finally used SUSE ??, not that that's wrong. i'm indifferent on this. but if you look close enough you'll see this is a mixture of 7, 8.1 and built on a Linux kernel. run-times were
 a dead give away. i mean it almost feels like i'm watching h-top when i look at the task manager. runtime broker, time broker, are these the same as Linux low latency runtime kernels? if you watch close enough what is not in use is put in idle state, like
 Linux, unlike previous windows where they just kept eating away at resources. memory distribution has changed, CPU run times have changed, even the disk usage has changed, it's a new system.</p>
 to get to 10, i'm glad to see they jumped over 9, as they should have with ME and Vista, this operating system is going to shell shock a lot of long time windows users that have never seen under the hood of Linux. as i sit here with several windows open i
 watch the runtime broker reset run times and my CPU drops down and hovers at 2-4% and ram at steady 33%. i see this and think of low latency kernel, no? also i noticed that if a driver is unavailable the maintenance/trouble shooter sends out a call, low and
 behold, a driver, now i know for a fact that my CPU does not have a driver past 2009, yet i have one now from 2012. cross reference, maybe. prior build of drivers in a cab file tucked away, not, &nbsp;so where did it come from? what is most fascinating is the overall
 presentation of GUI, a long way from Fort Lauderdale and those Xerox Engineers huh techs ?? you know what i'm talking about. it is damn near flawless, in all my beta tests this is the 1st without a system crash. it's as if we are testing the RTM and they are
 tweaking and teasing us as we respond. i can almost see a code writer with a smile on his face thinking, man are we going to seriously split our stocks this time!! as i said before, long time away from Microsoft, but i will say this. you won me over in beta,
 and i will buy. i hope they don't make the mistake of taking out the best candy and splitting it up into tiers like they always do, for once, just release a really good version for home users and one for pros. in fact i think it should simply be one platform
 across all architectures. phones, tablets, laptops, pc's...etc ..etc.. join hands in a way, reunite the ones that strayed away like me, one OS for us all, no more sales gimmicks, make your money in the store and keep the X-BOX radio for more revenue. this
 is just my opinion, and one voice. but i'm pretty tech savvy and know my way around, i managed to tweak the OS to restart in less than 10 seconds flat with everything up and running, thanks to your pre-starts i found by accident, again, Linux? for those that
 want to dig deeper get auto-runs and see what's under the hood, also install iobit system care, let it run it's safe and it will show you where the tweaks are,...all i know is this one is out of the park. and i'm in the front row. don't mind the lack of proper
 grammar, i been beating on this OS for 2 days straight and my eyes are blood shot. i even managed to wiggle a true separate desktop, with it's own notification area. 2 monitors of course, and yes 2 separate operating systems running at the same time with no
 virtual box. not too hard using 2 samsung smart tvs hdmi. and a few tweaks to your extended monitor registry and clunking on the side of the panoramic themes, kinda nice to have a bit of wiggle room in Microsoft. i know you offered the extension but, will
 you include the notification i was able to get up and running ?? &nbsp;i wish you allowed screen shots here. well anyway, if you know Linux....... approach win 10 with that mentality, you'll find a ton of Easter eggs !!!&nbsp;</p>

            Where is Aero Interface... if Microsoft continues new windows with this shity metro interface.. i move to Linux forever! This is not Windows 3.1 !! This not 1992 ! Get back Aero Theme from Windows 7, F8 - SafeMode Menu, and more... !! Start Menu don't
 need Metro titles !!! You need help to wake up Microsoft !<br />

            <p>Well, simply skipping a version number to distance from the flop Windows 8.x is far not enough. Although the right direction,&nbsp;bringing back the Startmenu will not cover the problem of the shelf warmer. There is still the public cloud integration which is
 an absolute no-go! Installation only work without public cloud, when disconnected from network. Sending feedback from inside the OS...only by public cloud. Using Apps...I didn't try, but I guess...more than half ...only by public cloud. Sorry Microsoft, but
 I pay only for a system that is mine and definitely not for a system that always talks to "mother" &amp; other (apps).&nbsp;I do not even have a&nbsp;wink of an idea what is exchanged at all (especially apps). For sure I will not agree to any terms, that tell me "not to
 transmit sensitive data" and I will not check via network monitor.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong! Cloud is a very impressive technology, as long as it is private. No hybrid, or even public.</p>
<p>Any supporters of these systems will have to suffer. E.g. recently I checked for a new laptop for my daughter&nbsp;at my favorite shop DELL, the only systems with&nbsp;17" display would be shipped with Windows 8.1. So I was urged to change to HP (they had at least
 one).</p>
<p>Business is complaining about stagnation selling hardware. Why do you wonder? Bring up innovations,&nbsp;Desktops like the one from&nbsp;Apple or KDE and don't try to urge customers to your products, by software for rent or bundle with hardware.&nbsp;Some people may be&nbsp;stupid
 enough to not understand what marketing is planning, but not everyone. I will not look and wait, till there is no way back.</p>
<p>I for myself have change a long time ago to Linux as Client OS. Not that I would be sooo happy with Linux, but it keeps
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">my </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">data</span></strong>!</p>
<p>Xbox One = Sony PS4 = Cloud integration = shelf warmer.</p>
<p>Wait a little bit more for Steam OS and maybe then even marketing has to understand, that public cloud is the wrong direction. I know there was a lot of money wasted for all that stuff. But some times even marketing people may discover that they are riding
 a dead horse.</p>

            Hi Friend!<br />
<br />
Its a problem occured in savings at temporary memory.<br />
<br />
You turn off Alarm option in the mobile and switch off the mobile, remove battery and leave the mobile without battery for 5 min. After 5 min, turn on your mobile and enable your Alarm option with your preferred ring tone or standard alarm tone and wake up
 early :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank You.<br />
Shyam.

                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem creating a 2D line chart in Excel 2010 but I am struggling with Excel 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to create a 2D line chart and then have it onto a new sheet.&nbsp; In 2010, I click on the "move chart" button and choose new sheet option.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I do this
 in 2013?&nbsp; Also, I need to justify the left margin so that the data starts at the edge of the chart.&nbsp; In 2010,I hover over the bottom and click on "horizontal Category axis, right click on it and select "format axis" and select "on tick marks".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I do this in 2013?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping for some help</p>

<p>Same here. I can't cancel my upcoming subscription. It's a complete joke!!! Microsoft tell me that I can go onto my account then go to manage subscription but there is
<strong>NO MANAGE </strong>feature. It's a complete fraud. Skype Get your mess sorted please. I don't want to be charged again this year because you are making it virtually impossible for me to cancel my subscription. By the way<strong> I DON'T</strong> want
 to cancel my Microsoft account but only want to cancel my Skype subscription. Why are you making it so difficult. I wonder does it have anything to do with you wanting to keep my money.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is not that there is no option to cancel the subscription if you cannot find the manage feature. The important thing that you need to look up on this is if you are using the correct Skype name or email address to sign in for your account. You need to
 make sure that you sign in manually on the Skype page to be directed to the correct account. If you are logging in to a different one, you will not really be able to cancel the subscription. If you are not sure of your Skype name (username) or Microsoft account,
 you may check the email&nbsp;order confirmation from Skype that you have received and use it to sign in.

<p>Dear Nova, thank you very much for all your kind and useful assistance. We have a little problem as we cannot find the global admin person which you need to be able to request a transfer of the public network to the business one...how can we deal with this?
 the business network was setup a few years back, the team has since changed and they don't seem to know who the global admin person is...Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Sandrine Jarnet</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer &#47; WebBrowser control is broken</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I own a Windows Phone 8S by HTC and a few days ago, Internet Explorer (and all related apps which are using the WebBrowser control) is unable to start.</div>
<div>When I open up IE on my Homescreen, the icons jump forward like they do when you start any application, but they immediately return forward (like when pressing the Windows-button). Additionally, all apps which are using the WebBrowser-Control are experiencing
 the same problem - I can't start Maps, I can't add my Microsoft Account to the phone, apps crash (e.g. Nextgen Reader when opening a article in detail mode), etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I already tried setting "Open links from other apps in the current tab" like suggested at&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.wpcentral.com/windows-phone-7/192318-internet-explorer-not-working.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.wpcentral.com/windows-phone-7/192318-internet-explorer-not-working.html</a>,
 but that did not help.</div>
<div>I tried restarting, which did not help either (It did actually once, but the problem occured a few hours later again and restarts do not seem to help)</div>
<div>I tried resetting my phone, but the problem still persists (even worse, I can't even download any backups because I can't add the MSFT-account).</div>
<div>I have an update pending (since yesterday) which I can't install - it downloads, but then it just displays the message "The update was downloaded, but couldn't be opened (8007000d)". I am not sure if this is related to the broken WebBrowser control, but
 I have no idea why it wouldn't work then. (I got the same message prior to resetting and after)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to do some debugging and made a small windows phone app: I made a new project based on the "Windows Phone App"-template and just added the WebBrowser-control on the GUI. When testing on the emulator, it works perfectly. Testing on my device throws
 an exception in the "InitializeComponent()"-method:</div>
<div>"A first chance exception of type 'System.Windows.Markup.XamlParseException' occured in System.Windows.ni.dll</div>
<div>Additional information: Cannot create instance of type 'Microsoft.Phone.Controls.WebBrowser' [Line: 52 Position: 64]"</div>
<div>(I tested this on a Surface Pro (16GB) with Windows 8.1 and Visual Studio 2013 Preview).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, what can I do to make my phone work again? Is there any way I can flash a fresh firmware on my phone (it seems to me the firmware itself is damaged)? Do you need any more information concerning this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yours,</div>
<div>Dave</div>

    <title>Unable to reinstall Office Home &#38; Student 2013 after a clean - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iangreely  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to reinstall Office Home &#38; Student 2013 after a clean install from Windows Installation Media.</h2>
                    <p>I have an Asus X102BA that came with Windows 8 and a copy of&nbsp;Office Home &amp; Student 2013.<br />
All installed and updated to Windows 10 etc within the normal timelines.<br />
<br />
Last week the disk started having problems and I bought an SSD to replace it. While attempting to clone the Original hard disk to the SSD the hard disk completely failed requiring me to install from standard Microsoft Windows 10 x64 USB disk that I created
 today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to follow the original instructions for installing&nbsp;Office Home &amp; Student 2013 from Asus; I clicked the Office icon in live tiles but when I entered my Product Key it failed the test and did not install.<br />
<br />
How should I go about installing/activating this product?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ian</p>

<p>The original instructions wouldn't work because you do not have an ASUS installation any more, you now have a clean install of Windows 10. That is OK, you just have to use a different path to do the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to do is use the 25 character product key (typically written in 5 groups of 5 char) (that they provided to you separate from the installation) to download the appropriate installation file.&nbsp; Go to one of the following links, find the 2013 section
 and submit your product key. You should then be given an installation file. Download and SAVE (not run) it. After the download ends, run the installation file. You should be prompted for the product key. If you are also given the option to "register" the installation
 take it. That will require your real "Microsoft account" email, ie the one you used to post here (DON'T use a fake one).&nbsp; After registering the activation you will be able to log in to the MyAccount site to re-install in the future.

<h2>            Excel files will not open on Onedrive</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently created a new Onedrive account but it will not let me open an excel or word files that I have uploaded. I upload the files myself and I can open the files in the web app but I can not open them in excel. It comes up with the message 'you
 do not have permission to complete the task'. I can open files that other people have shared just not files that I have uploaded. I have never had this problem with Onedrive before.</p>
<p>

            <p>Well I am using Hotmail.&nbsp; I just go to hotmail.com....and up comes my email.&nbsp; Outlook is involved somehow but dont use Outlook.&nbsp; I dont know what the connection is.&nbsp; But at the top I do see outlook.com&nbsp; So I cant really answer your question because I dont
 understand it I guess.&nbsp; That is why it would be nice to be able to talk to someone live.&nbsp; But Microsoft isnt interested in good customer service obviously.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folks I speak to on the phone cant speak English.&nbsp; Or it has a mechanical voice which gives me options none of which applies and cant get a live person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the fall I am going to have to send out tons of emails, if there is a limit then I will have to go someplace else.&nbsp; Feel free to email me at rose ville gary miller at hotmail dot com.....I may or may not be able to respond.</p>

</p><p>Since you have only been registered here for under a day I feel you should be made aware that this is a peer to peer site staffed mostly by volunteers who have little or no contact to Microsoft.&nbsp; No one who matters will read this thread</p>

<div><br />
<strong>If you’ve been notified that you have hit some limit on a Microsoft product, it’s almost certainly part of an effort to reduce spam.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The send mail limit depends on your reputation within Outlook.com</strong><br />

            <p>Totally agree with your comments.&nbsp; I havent been able to even access my outlook email for about a week.&nbsp; Absolutly no idea why, I've not changed anything and it was fine before.&nbsp; Microsoft couldnt care less.&nbsp; I have tried the on line chat and requested a
 call back from Microsoft.&nbsp; They did call me, but didnt help just tried to sell me a support package which I declined as I dont see why I should pay for something Microsfot have broken/changed.&nbsp; Plus, even paying for it doesnt guarantee they will resolve my
 issue.&nbsp; So many people on this forum have the same issue, so I know it's not me, but I have more chance of flying to the moon as I have in ever seeing my emails again.</p>

            I also have no idea where to complain. &nbsp;I have had the most shocking customer experience. I signed up for a Microsoft Dynamic CRM Trial. &nbsp;I tried to access the mobile app, but couldnt. I called for 4 days, including live chat and each and every time i
 spoke to somebody they told me to call somebody else and i kept doing that until i just lost all patience. In that last call, i even asked the guy is there a complaints department and he said "i have no idea". &nbsp;What a joke.

            <p>To Whomever Can or Will Assist,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Briefly, I am an "Outlook" user. &nbsp;For the pass three days, if I received a so-called "focused" email, the system will allow me to open it.&nbsp; However, if the system considers it, just in-box information, it will not allow me to open such&nbsp;messages.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
 I have deleted some rather important messages, due to pure frustration, which includes a message from a local church that I was planning to attend over the holidays.&nbsp; Principally, my question is why offer anything for "free," if the offer is&nbsp;not truly&nbsp;earnest??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, John, a member of such church has emailed me twice, and at this point, he probably believes that I'm an inconsiderate and disrespectful individual, due to&nbsp;not receiving a timely&nbsp;response from me.&nbsp; To no avail, I have attempted various&nbsp;things.&nbsp;
 At this point, I can&nbsp;only prayer that GOD help sort out our complex, and ever-changing materialistic society, and&nbsp;assist&nbsp;those&nbsp;who's simply trying to live&nbsp;a decent and moral life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Holidays!</p>

<h2>            Excel autocomplete does not work consistently</h2>
                    My husband created a long list of birds in Excel. When he types in a name of one of the birds at the end of the list, autocomplete works only for lines 561 to the end, but not for something typed in to the first 560 lines. Is there a limit to the lines
 autocomplete will work for? Or is there a defect in the document or program that is causing this?

            I can confirm this. I typed apple: berry; cherry; damson in A1:A5 and copied down to row 20. Then from A21 to A600 I had just apple and damson alternating in cells. In range 21 to about 80, typing c gave cherry. But doing so lower down did not. This is
 a question for the Excel development team - wonder if they will pick it up. best wishes

Hi , has anyone solved this? i'm using IE 10 on windows 8 desktop ( I do not use surface and don't wish to) and am really really frustrated by the favourites being sorted alphabetically. I need to be able to see them in date saved order so that I can go about
 my business. I lose too much time every day trying to find things in the alphabetical list. HELP!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can't sort the IE favorites by date, as amongst other things the favorites folder contains folders as well as url shortcut files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use Windows explorer to sort your favorites folders and files by date however.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>type</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>shell:favorites </p>
<p>or</p>
<p>shell:favorites\links</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the IE address bar... this will open a Windows Explorer window located at your Favorites or Favorites Bar folder.... there you will see columns for the date created (or right click on the column header to display columns of your choosing.... there are
 additional columns.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Open Windows Explorer window you can drag and drop url shortcut files to IE to open them
</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Multi-select files or folders to open them in groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Is &#34;Intel&#40;R&#41; network connections drivers&#34; size 11.2 Gb&#63;</h2>
                    On my PC (Windows 10, Build 10074, running on i7-4790K/Asus Z97-Deluxe) the size of Intel(R) network connections drivers is&nbsp;11.2 Gb as reported in Control Panel&gt;Programs&gt;Programs and Features. This seems like a lot for network drivers, so I wonder what
 other people have. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Windows 10 Insider Preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as the size of the Intel Network Connection drivers is concerned, I don’t think it should be more than 500 Mb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide us following information so that we can understand the issue better and help you in resolving it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Was the network driver installed through the Manufacturer’s website or did you updated it using some 3<sup>rd</sup> party Tool?</li><li>What was the size of the drivers prior Windows 10 Build 10074?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to follow the steps below and see if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Remove the driver and install the drivers from the Manufacturer’s website</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to download the latest network drivers available for your device from the link below and uninstall the one you have in the list of the programs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Z97DELUXE/HelpDesk_Download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Z97DELUXE/HelpDesk_Download/</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Run Disk Cleanup</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>You can use Disk Cleanup to reduce the number of unnecessary files on your drives, which can help your PC run faster. It can delete temporary files and system files, empty the Recycle Bin, and remove a variety of other items that you might no longer need</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to run the disk cleanup from the link below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also run a full virus scan of the system to make sure that your computer is not infected with any virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Activation After Reinstall Caused By Hard Drive Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ytgunawan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation After Reinstall Caused By Hard Drive Failure</h2>
                    <p>My HDD (WD Blue 1TB) which have windows file in it failed, and the PC won't turn up, so I went to the distributor for warranty claim, and what I get is a new one but I got to wait for 2 weeks to get it, since it's kinda slow, fearing that the same problem
 might turn up again and I need to use the PC asap I bought an SSD (Samsung Evo 250GB) while I'm at it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Windows 10 Technical Preview since it got out, and got the key when it rolled. So I think I will got the digital entitlement thing, because everything is the same except the HDD -&gt; SSD swap after I reinstall (Windows 10 x64 Home) using the usb boot.
 And welp, the windows is not activated after I sign in and verify with my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>And yes I already change windows update to Preview Build again and the error info is "Activation failed because this device doesn't have a valid digital entitlement or product key. Error Code 0x803F7001"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions are</p>
<p>Shouldn't I get the digital entitlement for activation after reinstall?</p>
<p>If yes, since my condition right now is not activated, how do I get activated?</p>
<p>If no, what is the best course of action of what should I do, since most of my money pretty much went away for that costly SSD? ( &nbsp;T_T)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank You in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards<br />

<p>
</p><p>If you first installed windows 10 preview build only and used the generic key then you

<p>do not qualify for digital entitlement, you need to either:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install a windows 7 sp1 or windows 8.1 system, make sure it is activated, </p>
<p>then performed a windows 10 retail 10586 update first (not clean install).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Or Install windows 10 retail version 10586 and use or buy a valid windows 7 sp1 or windows 8.1 product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Or purchase a windows 10 retail version and use the windows 10 retail product key</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Excel has a lot of shortcut keys that you can use to <strong>switch between worksheets</strong>,
<strong>page layout views</strong>, <strong>normal view</strong>, and <strong>page break preview view</strong>. However, the option to use the
<strong>Alt + Tab</strong> shortcut key in switching Excel view is not yet available. We recommend submitting your suggestion to our

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Try opening word in safe mode.
<br />
<br />Windows + R, then type winword /safe
<br />
<br />If it works fine like this, the issue is the add-in, if you want to disable it please read this.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-m...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work perform an Office repair
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing seems to work i suggest you to change in your organization profile trough the admin center the update channel from semi-annual to monthly or viceversa, uninstall office and install it again, it will install a new Office version.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<p>Hi Brady,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you still experiencing the problem in safe mode? If the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, that means the problem may be related to the add-ins, we suggest you remove some add-ins then check whether the problem still persists.</p>

<p>I've had my n73 music edition for over 3 years now. And I've been facing this problem for months.</p>

<p>It just keeps going into camera mode every few seconds and then back to normal then back to camera mode . Its really driving me nuts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had given this for repair at a nokia care center they told me they had replaced the back camera pins? And some keyboard IC. After 2 days its again the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;the firmware was updated and the memory card was wiped completely before putting it back in the camera. Still the problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please&nbsp; can any one tell me why this is happening and how to fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am being spammed daily with dozens of email from China redirected from my web site address to my outlook.com email address. The junk mail block sender function does not work with this domain name.... all the email prefixes are just numbers which change
 every time I receive an email.... e.g. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution to this problem would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I went through my service provider as the junk mail was coming through a third party website with a DNS not recognized by the outlook program... there is room for improvement in Outlook in this regard... however, my service provider now blocks/filters these
 unwanted emails before they can be re-routed to my outlook.com email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the follow-up ... the 1st level support staff did not know what was causing the problem... and even though they said they promoted my program to a higher level, I never heard back, nor was their acknowledgement that they even received my query
 which was facilitated by the 1st level support person, Rency, who was obliging and pleasant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give the 1st line support an A for effort.... but an F for results.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the download button is grayed out, it's usually means that the application is still installed on your device although you thought you've already removed it. To verify it, go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Application mgr. &gt; Installed apps</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try deleting the web cache. You can check the attached picture for the steps.

<p>I have same problem (reported here approx 1-2 months ago), just tried that with a cache delete,&nbsp;doesn't help. Problem occure on all applications on store, not just wrong installed or something.</p>
<p>Also I can't access even this forum with firefox any more, login just not working, I must use IE just to post here.</p>
<p>I think that we are a witness of a final entropy stage of a dying symbian ecosystem,</p>
<p>R.I.P.&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I received some&nbsp;advices to perform full phone reset&nbsp;to try resolve this problem, but&nbsp;I don't want to do it any more, I made full resets few times in&nbsp;a past and I'm tired that for almost every&nbsp;problem I must reset phone.</p>
<p>I keep it now&nbsp;only because of&nbsp;nokia maps which are still working excellent, for other stuf&nbsp;I have SGS3 mini.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            persistent value in forms</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greetings!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First Query</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a group table and email table.</p>
<p>group table has one field named group name, in the Email table, there is one field group that is bound to group field in group table using combo box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So each time when user adds emails, group pop ups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I want</p>
<p>Since one group refers to many email ids, I want something time saving like</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group form and email form are two different forms whose data goes in different tables namely group and email tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now in ,Email table, lets say I select Group= India from the drop down combo box, for next record, I want to show India pre populated, instead of selecting it again. Some thing like persistent field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second Query:</p>
<p>I am using MS Access 2010, and in the form, when I click on Next record, or Next blank record using navigation, the cursor start blinking on second field instead of first field. That may confuse data entry operator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First field is drop down, and second is simple text box. I think due to first field is drop down, cursor is going to second, I don't want to show the cursor blinking, to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Manoj</p>

            First possible answer:
<div>You can add a little code in the After Update event of a control to set its Default Value to the current value. This will only affect new records.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Second possible answer:</div>
<div>The Tab order of your controls and Tab Stop properties will typically manage the focus. You can also use code in the On Current event of the form to set the focus to a particular control.</div>

    <title>Can&#39;t freeze multiple rows in excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t freeze multiple rows in excel</h2>
                    <p>When I select the first two rows of my Excel sheet and click "Freeze Panes", it freezes the first 10 rows instead. I cannot select and freeze only the first two. There are no merged cells in my sheet. I have an image (logo) in my first cell, but even if
 I delete that, it still does not work. Selecting all, unfreezing everything and trying it again does not work either. Any thoughts?</p>

            Hi LuukFrank,
<br />
<br />Click the number 3 on the left of row 3, then choose View - Freeze Panes
<br />
<br />That will freeze the top 2 rows in Excel . . .       
        </p>

            Nope. That freezes the first six rows. I have no idea why.
