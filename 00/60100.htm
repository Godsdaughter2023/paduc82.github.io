<h2>            Cannot connect Xbox Controller to Windows 10 via bluetooth since 1709</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm posting here in a desperate last bid to get help with this issue. I've already had 3 chats with Microsoft Support which have gotten me nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Built a Windows 10 build 1607 PC (i7, 32GB ram, NVidia 1060) in May 2017 and purchased an Xbox One controller to play games. All worked perfectly until around October/November when build 1709 was installed. At that point I couldn't get my controller to connect
 via bluetooth anymore. It worked on USB cable though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed numerous troubleshooting guides and updated bluetooth drivers and controller firmware. After contacting Microsoft Support, they suggested a new controller which I purchased yesterday, but I still have the same problem with the new one!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a nutshell: both old and new controllers will not connect via bluetooth to my Windows 10 build 1709 PC or my Windows 10 build 1709 laptop. Both controllers work fine via bluetooth on Windows 7 Pro. I cannot "go back" to a previous build. I just get a
 message saying Windows could not "go back".</p>
<p>
</p><p>On digging in Even viewer, I've found this listed every time the connection fails: "The mutual authentication between the local Bluetooth adapter and a device with Bluetooth adapter failed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to go via Start&gt;Settings&gt;Bluetooth &amp; other devices&gt;Add Bluetooth or over device and choose "Everything else" the controller isn't even detected. Tried the controller in both modes (normal and pair mode).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try via Devices and Printers&gt;Add Device then the controller is found (either as Gamepad or Xbox Wireless Controller) but then hangs at "connecting" then I get the "That didn't work" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find anything else online which describes my same symptoms. It all worked perfectly before 1709!! If anyone can help me I would be so very grateful, this problem has drove me to tears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in anticipation of any help...</p>
<p>Alex</p>

            Hi Alex.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Many bluetooth problems caused recently by Windows Updates are being solved by rolling back the drivers in Device Manager, Uninstalling the driver to let it reinstall by restarting the PC,  or Updating the driver to the latest on the PC's Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then it may be related to hardware deprecation with the new Version Update.  Since you can't roll it back you can Clean install the last version it's known to work with media from here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Burn DVD with Windows Image Burner or create bootable flash using settings set to UEFI for GPT or if you have Legacy BIOS for MBR using Rufus:  <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rufus.akeo.ie/</a>
<br />
<br />Then follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You can even shrink C in Disk Management and boot the media to do a test install to the shrink space, set it up enough to see if the controller works and if so I'll help you remove the old install, or vice versa.
<br />
<br />I know you said you spoke with Microsoft Support but did you talk with Xbox SUpport to see if it's a known issue with them?  <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was really hoping to avoid a clean install of Windows due to the amount of apps and games I have installed. Setting everything up again would take me hours and hours. My installation drive (I install all games on a separate drive from C:) is over 2TB.
 Not to mention all my video/sound/graphics software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have completely removed the bluetooth device and installed using the drivers it came with and allowing Windows update to get the drivers itself before, but I will try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I also spoke with Xbox Support and they recommended I purchase ANOTHER new controller, in addition to the new one I purchased yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will reply later once I’ve tried your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<p>I've installed Windows 10 build 1607 on a different HDD and the controller works! This is a bug in Windows 10 Pro build 1709. I've also been doing further digging and found other posts (not on Microsoft forums) of other people with this exact same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.windows10forums.com/threads/issues-connecting-xbox-one-controller-to-pc-via-bluetooth.15586/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly the same symptoms and situation, Xbox One controller worked fine before 1709 but stopped afterwards. I also found a post from a Microsoft MVP stating that 1709 was a buggy build with problems around bluetooth and other software/hardware working before
 1709 but not after:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/bluetooth-device-no-longer-working/3bdedf01-9b72-45fa-be70-9b9b532f08c7?auth=1 (note the first response from Andre Da Costa)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft going to fix this? I have concerns about a) reinstalling my whole system just to roll back the version which will take me a great deal of time and b) running an old build which might, in the future, present problems with newer software/hardware
 where the solution will be to "upgrade to the latest patches". Granted this is just conjecture, but a valid concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be elevated to the appropriate department to get it fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in anticipation,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

            Hi again, Alex.  Glad it helped.
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems. 
<br />
<br />I work with Andre Da Costa here who is a fellow MVP and we are daily helping people resolve these kinds of problems.  But it seems to me as much an Xbox issue as a Windows one since it's their hardware.
<br />
<br />Do you know if the controller works on Version 1703?  You can save a System Image backup of v.1607 to try upgrading it to see if you want.  I gave you links to all the previous editions software.  
<br />
<br />But at least with v.1607 you have the Hide Updates tool to install and hide Version 1709 if it's offered.  You may have to abort it's install if it slips by before you block it.  
<br />
<br />There are other strategies here to block Windows Updates to give them a timeout.  We even have some frustrated consumers blocking all Updates and then installing the version Updates twice a year which roll up all the previous Updates in them. 
<br />
<br />It may take awhile before it is fixed in the latest version.  But you can help assure this by providing good feedback including everything you've tried.  They may contact you to provide some logs or traces too.       
        </p>

            <p>You can never turn a scan into a folder, as a folder is a directory structure that holds files.&nbsp; As for attaching a scan to an email, check your email program's documentation for how to attach a file, once scaned, from your computer to an email message.</p><p>You might also consider, in the future, including details in your initial post.&nbsp; "doesn't work with windows 7" is a very long way from "can't create a folder and attach it in email". </p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Software conflict, and/or system file corruption can be the cause why an update fails to install. We suggest running the
<a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troubleshooter</a> to automatically diagnose and fix issues with updating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to update us with the result.</p>

            I actually have been dealing with this for months, but I was able to fix it today. All I did was remove my video card, then turned my computer on and startded the update. Once completed, i put my videocard back and and everything was great!

<p>Thanks for your reply back as to what worked for your device. If you will, if you can reply back with the specific details concerning make, model, and driver version of the hardware being used I'm sure that it could then be of help to some others as well.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 system font changed from Western style to CJK - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maaho  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 system font changed from Western style to CJK</h2>
                    My Windows 7 system font changed after opening a file from a Brazilian Portuguese system that was first created on a Japanese system. Now, all programs, not only Microsoft programs, use a small font that appears to be MS Mincho in many places. I have changed
 the Appearance settings of all changeable items, to no avail. I have edited the Fonts Substitution section of the registry, to no avail. Somehow the default system font was changed by the Excel file, so I suppose somehow it could be changed again, if only
 Microsoft would tell us how to do so. As an example of what I am referring to, I want to change the font used within the Excel Visual Basic Properties window, and the Project Explorer window. I want to change the font used to list the Microsoft Excel Objects,
 Forms, Modules, and Class Modules. This is the font that somehow changed into a tiny and non-proportional font, perhaps MS Mincho it seems. This same wrong font is now also used by other applications, making them difficult to read. As a further example, I
 am unable now to change the font used to display items with SysInternals Process Explorer to any Western font. I can make the font used larger, or smaller, but the application will not use any fonts other than a Japanese/Chinese selection. If a CJK font is
 selected, the font is applied correctly. Any Western font selected is not applied...so the problem seems to be that the Windows 7 default system font type has been changed to CJK type, and does not permit loading of any Western fonts. Please help, and tell
 me where to change this registry setting.<br />
<br />
UPDATE 2011-09-12: After resetting the Region and Language Settings to English, cold booting, and then resetting the region to my desired locale and cold booting again, many (but not all) of the font settings have been reset to the default font type of Western.
 It is a great improvement, although not 100%. From all the attempts to correct this problem, it seems that nothing to reset or change fonts was effective, so don't bother trying to reset fonts via the Appearance Display Settings, or by editing the Registry
 Font or font Substitute sections. There must be a font type setting for the entire system in the Registry (which I have not located) that is changed upon selecting a new locale (and that makes a great deal of sense to me). I only wish I knew where it is in
 the Registry.<br />

 doing the same thing. I have the latest version of skype that you can get on the iphone 6 but he still has an older version of skype because he has an older phone. Is there a reason for this or could the fact that his skype is older effct this! Please help!&nbsp;

            When you delete a file or files in Windows, the only thing that happens is that Windows marks the space occupied by the file(s) as available--data&nbsp;isn't actually deleted.&nbsp; It will eventually be overwritten by new data being saved.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand,
 when you use a "shredder," the files are overwritten immediately, somewhat aggressively depending on the method used.&nbsp; Unless you do an awful lot of shredding, the effect on hard drive life is mostly negligible.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same is generally true of SSDs.

            as already noted, delete doesn't do anything to the actual file <br />
<br />
shred / overwrite multiple times is negligible on HDD life span<br />
<br />
with SSD you actually aren't shredding anything<br />
as the firmware wear leveling system prevents the same flash cells from being repeatedly written to
<br />
thus shredding files on SSD will simply place random data all over the place and not actually shred any files<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and welcome to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I see that you receive the error code
<b>0x8024001e </b><span>when you try to install Real Player Express.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Rest assured that we will help you to resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, we need more information on this issue. Please answer the following questions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to install other programs?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From where did you download Real Player Express?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s what you can try:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Scan the computer for virus and spyware.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to scan your computer with
<b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b>, which would help to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The
<b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b> is a free-to-download security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after
 being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors
 are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Make sure Date, Time and Time Zone are correct.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press
<b>Windows key + W</b> and type <b>Date and Time</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select
<b>Set Date and Time</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>Change Date and Time Button</b> to change date and time.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>Change Time Zone button</b> to change Time Zone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Install updates.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Install all critical and optional updates available in Windows Updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to do so:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press
<b>Windows key + W</b> and type <b>Windows Updates</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select
<b>Install Optional Updates</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the new window, install all the updates available.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Please contact Real Player Support for further assistance.</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            Having some serious issues and I&#38;&#35;39&#59;m getting frustrated</h2>
                    
<p>Right, my account got suspended because no payment was recieved due to my mum's card (which was used to pay for my Live) either got cancelled or had no money on it, fine but it's telling me to continue my membership edit or add a new payment option or something,
 so today I bought a 3 month prepaid voucher but still it won't work, it won't let me redeem the code and it won't let me remove my mum's card details, I keep getting the status code 80162765 along with various error codes.</p>
<p>My sister then checked the internet with one of the error codes and it told her I owe £11.98 or something and my account is suspended until Microsoft get the money...</p>

<p>First of all, it should only be redeeming my Live monthly at a cost of £5.99 (even though it's only supposed to be £5) so where is the other £6 coming from? Why exactly am I paying another 6 quid, in total £11.98 when all that should be taken is £5.99? why
 will my prepaid code not work? why am I occasionally getting dashboard access minus my friends which apparently have all disappeared even though I'm apparently suspended and have no Live? what exactly are you people doing? if you even know, usually when I
 ask questions on forums nobody has any idea what they're talking about...</p>

<p>So this is likely the case, you have been on a monthly plan for a while. The card that has been paying for it got canceled. You were unaware of this issue, but you were allowed to play use the Xbox live service. The membership was used for a month and a
 half without actually paying for it, so now MS has suspended your account. You cannot use that 3 month card you just bought because you still owe a balance.
</p>
<p>You will have to call MS pay the balance on the account and then you can redeem that card. Your best bet is to ask them to turn off auto renewal while you are it that way you don't run into this issue later on. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't understand how they can do that though, how can they let me use it for free for a month and a half and then expect me to pay for it? they should have cancelled there and then that way I could start paying again whenever I wanted to instead of them
 forcing a debt on to me, it may be only £12 but it's a debt all the same that I apparently had no say in, if that is what's happened I think it'd be worth my while seeking legal advice, they can't do that to people regardless of whether I was under the impression
 that I was paying or not, they can't just cancel peoples account after giving them free Live access whenever they want and expect people to pay for it, atleast not without some sort of warning first... I'm extremely annoyed by this, not only can I not pay
 it because the card was cancelled, which I knew nothing about but now I owe them £12 quid AND spent a further £15 on a prepaid card that can't be used, that's one way to keep customers Microsoft, well done.</p>

<p>They can do that to you, there is no point in threatening a lawyer you wont win. When you signed the TOU (Terms of Use) you authorized this. It is not MS fault that the card YOU authorized declined. It is YOUR responsibility to keep YOUR information current

<h2>            &#34;choose the program you want to open this file&#34; dialog is shown after I start up &#40;after shutdown or restart&#41; with my windows user name listed as the file to be opened</h2>
                     As I described, the dialog appears after each restart.&nbsp; It occurs after I have entered my log-in credentials and proceeded to windows.&nbsp; It seems to be fairly late in the boot process as things like chat programs and widgets are fully loaded
 by the time the dialog appears.<br />
<br />
The dialog appears to be the standard "Open with" dialog in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Specifically the dialog reads:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Choose the program you want to open this file:<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File: Mathew [this is my user id and there is no extension shown)<br />
<br />
If I open the file in something like notepad, then the below information is presented (the #'s are real numbers, but these looked like mac addresses so I left them out)<br />

<br />
I have resolved the issue.<br />
<br />
I did find that when creating a new user, no longer had the Open with dialog.<br />
<br />
I began the process of resolving a corrupted user profile (which seems little more than creating a new one and copying/pasting some old values), when I decided to try one more thing.<br />
<br />
I logged into my corrupted account again and when the "Open with" dialog appears I opened the file with notepad.&nbsp; I attempted to "Save as" to locate the file and found that it was located in C:\Users.&nbsp; Something in the last few weeks seems to have put an extensionless
 file called "Mathew" (my log in name) in this folder and it was starting each time I started windows.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have since deleted the file and am no longer getting the "Open with" dialog.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support!<br />
Mat

<h2>            Cannot connect to xbox live from this console&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, my step sons xbox cannot connect to live. it connects thru a wired network. i've physically checked the wire for recent defects. this wire has been used with NO problems for the passed, i don't know how many years. no defects
 found. from the console, i test the live connection. it connects from console all the way to xbox live no problem, according to the console test. when you then try to connect and sign in to live an error message pops up saying "this console cannot connect
 to xbox live...test your network connection...80151014"</p>
<p>this doesn't make any sense??? has anyone had this problem before or does anyone know what is going on???</p>

            <p>Have your son delete his profile only (not profile and items) then clear the cache 3 times and restart the console before redownloading the profile. &nbsp;That should solve the issue.</p>
<p>You can redownload the profile go to Social&gt;Sign In/Out&gt;Download Profile</p>
<p>Clear the cache by following the steps at the following link</p>

<h2>            my computer wont reconize my archos 5</h2>
                    when i connect my archos 5 media player to my p.c it is not being reconized by my computer, the lead is not faulty, as it is charging when i connect it to the p.c, this only started recently, it connected every time up to now, i think it it is an issue
 with my p.c as i had a similar problem few years back with a creative mp3 player it stopped being reconized by my p.c after a few years, and i could not sync any files, just like now, i would appreciate some assistance with this problem, your's faithfully

<h2>            Forza Horizons GonD Disc Read Error</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, I see that this problem has been going on for a year already.&nbsp; Why is there no fix for this?&nbsp; I have tried every stupid method you people have posted and NOTHING works.&nbsp; I am so sick and tired of all this crap from Microsoft!&nbsp; I either want a WORKING
 FIX within 48 hours or my money back from the game purchase and ALL of my in game purchases, since I cant use them without the STUPID THING WORKING!!!</p>
<p><br />
Considering it has been a year ( at the least ) since I have noticed everyone else having this issue, if its not fixed, I do believe I may seek out an attorney for a very good class action lawsuit..&nbsp; I only think that is fair since no one at Microsoft is doing
 anything about this or even refunding people their hard earned money back..</p>

<p>Well, here is what happened. &nbsp;At times I was not very nice, and I will admit that, but it's because I was very very frustrated over the issue. &nbsp;I have protected the names and identifying information of both myself and the MS rep, and removed any other codes
 etc. that were identifying. &nbsp;Hopefully this will not get modded or removed. &nbsp;Happy reading:</p>

<p>Hi there VSCORPIONv.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:39:18 </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=forza+horizon+god+disc+unreadable&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=sb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.google.com/search</a></p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:40:09 </p>
<p>A little background, I am very frustrated at this point. I gave up on the last guy because he just couldn't get it and it's not that hard to understand.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:40:19 </p>
<p>Here is the bottom line:</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 10:40:24</p>
<p>I understand where are you coming from VSCORPIONv, for security purposes we cannot access the link you have provided me.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:40:57 </p>
<p>I have two Xbox360s. I am able to play every other Games On Demand game on both, using cloud saves, without issue.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:41:30 </p>
<p>Forza Horizon is broken in this respect though, it cannot be played on a secondary console due to a problem with DRM.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:42:06 </p>
<p>It will play play fine on the original console it was downloaded on, but not on another one (using the same Live account)</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:42:31 </p>
<p>If you attempt this you get "disc unreadable" error which is crazy because it's a download.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:42:52 </p>
<p>If you search "forza horizon god disc unreadable" you will get a ton of hits.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:43:17 </p>
<p>It is a KNOWN issue going back to when the game was first made available via Games On Demand.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:43:52 </p>
<p>The suggested fix is to do a license transfer, but that DEFEATS THE PURPOSE. I want to be able to play this on any console I own, which is the whole point of downloadable games, cloud gaming, etc.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:44:48 </p>
<p>This works with EVERY other game I have purchased via Games On Demand, except for this one. I don't want to transfer my licenses from my PRIMARY console to my SECONDARY. They are fine where they are, I just want to be able to play a game I PURCHASED on any
 console I OWN. Why is that so hard?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:45:35 </p>
<p>I believe at this point I am due a refund + compensation for my inconvenience due to lost time contacting Microsoft, OR a PHYSICAL DISC COPY OF THE GAME as recompense.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 10:46:33</p>
<p>Okay VSCORPIONv, please refer to this link for more information about Xbox 360 Digital Rights Management and it will explain all the the questions you have and why you need to transfer the licence on the other device.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 10:46:44</p>
<p>Here is the link, <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/downloadable-content/download-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:47:01 </p>
<p>So i can click on links but you can't?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:47:29 </p>
<p>Ridiculous. No I'm not doing that. I'm already more of an expert on this issue than you are because of the sheer amount of time I've spent researching it.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:47:47 </p>
<p>If I transfer the license to my SECONDARY console, it will then not work on my PRIMARY console.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:47:55 </p>
<p>Which is NOT the way it is supposed to work!</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:48:30 </p>
<p>I want to be able to play it on BOTH consoles without transferring ALL of my licenses to my SECONDARY console.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:49:35 </p>
<p>If there was a way to just transfer the license for this ONE game to the SECONDARY console to see if it would still work on BOTH then I might be willing to do that, but I use the PRIMARY one far more often and I don't want to have to transfer ALL of my licenses
 for ONE game when the rest of them work fine.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:50:16 </p>
<p>I know for a fact that this will not work. It will make the game usable on the secondary console but not on my primary.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:50:39 </p>
<p>Listen, your records show that I purchased Forza Horizon through Games On Demand right?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:51:28 </p>
<p>So I own it and I should be able to play it on ANY console I own that I have enable my User ID/Gamertag on, right? That is how this is supposed to work.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:51:35 </p>
<p>IT DOESN"T!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 10:51:42</p>
<p>May I know if you have downloaded the main account where you purchased the game?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:52:19 </p>
<p>Through my gamertag, vSCORPIONv, user ID *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, what else do you need to know?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 10:53:12</p>
<p>May I know if you have downloaded the account on the second console and also download the game on it?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:53:58 </p>
<p>What do you think? Please don't ask stupid questions. How the hell would I know it doesn't work on my second console if I hadn't downloaded it to that console and attempted to play it?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 10:55:57</p>
<p>Alright VSCORPIONv, as much as we want to help you on your concern with regards to your issue that you do not want to transfer the license on your second console, we are not capable of doing that here an in this moment.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:56:10 </p>
<p>I have tried all the "fixes". They are not fixes and don't work. The "work around" is to do a license transfer, again this is not a fix. The only fix is either to patch the game so that the DRM works as it should, or send me a physical copy.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 10:56:34</p>
<p>here is a link for you to be able to voice out your concern with regards to the license transfer,

</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:56:58 </p>
<p>Answer the question, if I transfer the license to the second console, and the issue is that this game only wants to work on the console the license resides on, then it will not work on the primary console correct?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:57:21 </p>
<p>No, that's not good enough. You are not resolving the issue. I want a phone number to a supervisor.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 10:58:10</p>
<p>That is correct VSCORPIONv.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:58:34 </p>
<p>Then AGAIN, I am owed a refund or a physical copy of the disc! What's it going to be?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 10:59:07</p>
<p>No worries VSCORPIONv here is a the Phone number, 1-800-469-9269 (toll-free).</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 10:59:39 </p>
<p>Ok, am I forced now to call that number or cannot you not help me?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:00:45</p>
<p>As much as we want to help you VSCORPIONv but if you are not cooperating and if you are on that level we cannot accomplish anything. The license transfer should be done for you to be able to play it on the other console.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:01:02</p>
<p>May I know if you downloaded the game through Xbox live or you are using a disc?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:01:22 </p>
<p>Again, that doesn't fix anything! I WANT TO BE ABLE TO PLAY IT ON BOTH CONSOLES!</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:02:03 </p>
<p>I said It's a DOWNLOADABLE game!!! Is English not your first language?!</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:02:33 </p>
<p>FYI, that means I DON</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:02:43 </p>
<p>FYI that means I DON'T HAVE A DISC</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:03:43</p>
<p>Okay VSCORPIONv, here is what you are going to do, if you are really asking for an answer and a urgent resolution, please refer to the link that I have provided you.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:04:14</p>
<p>As much as we want to help you with an instant resolution that you are asking, we are not capable of doing that.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:04:22</p>
<p>IF we are you do not have to ask for it.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:04:36 </p>
<p>No, what I am going to do is elevate this issue as high as I absolutely can until I get a resolution from a real person, and I will be mentioning your ineptitude when I do so.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:04:45</p>
<p>The license transfer information are all on the link that I have provided you earlier.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:05:09 </p>
<p>Quit talking about license transfers. AGAIN, THAT IS NOT THE FIX.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:05:43 </p>
<p>You have already agreed that this will STILL not allow me to play it on BOTH consoles, so you have not FIXED the problem, you have just REPLICATED it somewhere else!!!!!!!</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:06:37 </p>
<p>Tell me what the solution is that will allow me to play the game on BOTH consoles.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:08:00</p>
<p>Okay VSCORPIONv if you are going to play the game on both consoles the game will be tag as a suspicious activity.
</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:08:48 </p>
<p>WHAT?!?!</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:09:48 </p>
<p>You do understand that playing the game on both consoles under the same Gamertag, when it has been legally downloaded and purchased by the owner of BOTH consoles is perfectly LEGAL and the WHOLE IDEA right?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:10:25 </p>
<p>I think you are misunderstanding me here. I am the sole owner and user of both consoles. I have a primary and secondary residence which is why I own two 360s.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:10:50 </p>
<p>I am the only one on either console with an Xbox Live account, and I use the account on both consoles.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:11:09 </p>
<p>my gamertag, vSCORPIONv is the account I am talking about.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:11:46 </p>
<p>Microsoft, do you not understand that owning digitally downloaded games and using cloud saves is the whole point behind cloud gaming and owning multiple consoles?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:13:10 </p>
<p>Play game on Console X, save in the Cloud, boot up game on console Y, and load a cloud save to play where you left off. Works great on all other games except for Forza Horizon!!!</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:13:21</p>
<p>I understand what you are referring to VSCORPIONv, DRM is designed in this specific reason, to make sure that the gamertag that you used will not take advantage of the game you paid for.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:14:08 </p>
<p>How in the world am I taking advantage of anything by trying to play the game I purchased??!!!</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:14:20 </p>
<p>Microsoft, is English your first language?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:15:59</p>
<p>Let us focus on resolving your issue.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:17:17 </p>
<p>I want to do that, but due to your lack of understanding of my extremely detailed explanations, and your extremely slow response time, I can only assume I am talking to someone whose first language is NOT English, most likely in India or the Philippines,
 which is not conducive to solving my problem.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:18:06 </p>
<p>If you really understood what I was saying, half of the things you have said you would not have said.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:18:33 </p>
<p>This issue was stated SPECIFICALLY to be a Games On Demand issue, and you asked me if I was using a Disc?!</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:18:36 </p>
<p>Really???????!!!!</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:21:01</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I find your responses offensive. Let's be fair to these folks. Nationality does not have anything to do with comprehension. Let's focus on addressing this issue. Please allow me to clarify how the licensing works and why licenses are in place.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:23:40</p>
<p>DRM is designed to ensure that sharing is restricted. If you did not buy the game or DLC, no license will be linked to your account and you will not be able to play the game or access the DLC. DRM is designed for cases when the consoles get repaired of if
 the old console is defective.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:24:01 </p>
<p>Microsoft, I am not meaning to be offensive. My point is that no matter where you reside, which I don't really care about, your mastery of the English language is a must here if you are going to understand clearly what is being stated and avoid asking unnecessary
 questions.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:24:11</p>
<p>It is also meant to ensure that cheaters will not share content and games that they never bought.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:24:19 </p>
<p>Ok, well I BOUGHT THE GAME.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:26:06 </p>
<p>Is it not true that buying a digital game should make it usable on multiple consoles (not at the same time, at separate times depending on which console the primary user is trying to use at that moment). Again, this is a rhetorical question I already know
 the answer to, since it works on ALL OTHER DOWNLOADABLE GAMES I HAVE PURCHASED.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:26:19</p>
<p>When an account buys content, a system license is attached. When you download the game/content on the console, the local licenses are downloaded too. You can only have one console to have the local license.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:26:41</p>
<p>In cases when the old console is repaired or replaced, license transfer is done.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:27:12 </p>
<p>I didn't repair or replace my console. I bought a second one and enabled my gamertag on it.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:27:18</p>
<p>Most cheaters use the license transfer feature to share games and content they never bought.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:27:38</p>
<p>That merits a violation of the terms of use.</p>

<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:27:58 </p>
<p>Ok, that is not what is going on here.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:28:04</p>
<p>Which in turn may result to a temporary or permanent ban.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:28:18 </p>
<p>Again, I bought the game and it works on my primary console, but not on my secondary console. All my other GOD games do.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:29:13 </p>
<p>Ok, you are way off base here and I don't like your threatening tone about a temporary or permanent ban. I have been a loyal Xbox live customer, and I have never done anything like you are suggesting. Now you are offending ME!</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:29:32</p>
<p>That's good to know that certain games work. Licensing is different for every content.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:29:33 </p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/profile-storage-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../profile-storage-changes</a></p>

<p>How to use your Xbox profile on another Xbox Play anywhere The latest version of the Xbox console software makes it easy for you to use your Xbox Live profile (gamertag) on multiple consoles. For example, you can use your profile at your friend’s house,
 or on a second console at home. Use your profile on multiple consoles There are two ways you can use your profile on multiple consoles: Download your profile from Xbox Live (recommended). Move your profile to another console using a portable storage device,
 such as a flash drive or memory unit. For information on how to download or move your profile, see Manage gamertag &amp; profil</p>

</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:30:33</p>
<p>This is how the licensing works.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:30:48</p>
<p>Yes, you can transfer content licenses from one Xbox 360 console to a different Xbox 360 console. However, you can only transfer a license once every four months.
</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:31:04</p>
<p>When you try to use protected content, the Xbox 360 console checks whether you have a valid license for that content. If the license lets you use the content, the Xbox 360 console plays the content.
</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:31:04</p>
<p>If the Xbox 360 console doesn’t find a valid license for the content, or if the license doesn't allow the action, your Xbox 360 console won't let you use the content. Typically, you receive an error message that states why the action wasn't performed.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:31:26 </p>
<p>Tell me this, why don't I have to transfer licenses to play ALL of the other games I have downloaded on demand on BOTH consoles?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:31:33 </p>
<p>Why are you ignoring this question and this fact?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:32:06</p>
<p>Licensing is different for every content.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:32:47 </p>
<p>For example, I bought Far Cry 3, I play it sometimes on console 1, save the game, and pick up where I left off on console 2! I ALSO, do this on other games. I just want to be able to do it on Forza Horizon as I have done it on the other games. Please tell
 me you understand what I am saying here?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:33:04 </p>
<p>Microsoft, you are giving me the run around.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:33:16 </p>
<p>It doesn't work differently, it is just broken and a fix hasn't been made.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:33:43 </p>
<p>Normally in the gaming industry this would warrant a PATCH to FIX the problem. This has not bee done though going back to 2013 now.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:34:04</p>
<p>Yes I do and as we have discussed, the license for each content works different. What works for most game will not automatically mean that it will work for all.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:34:33 </p>
<p>But you are failing to recognize that as a GLITCH, and not the NORM.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:34:46 </p>
<p>That IS NOT the way it's supposed to work.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:35:28 </p>
<p>If the game had a disclaimer "will only work on the console it's downloaded on", I wouldn't have purchased the digital version. I would have purchased the disc. Do you understand?</p>

<p>The bottom line here is that local license can only reside on one console. The system license is the one linked to &nbsp;the account when you buy it. This way, you can download the content anytime. If the local license is not on this console, although the game
 is downloaded, the DLCs will not work since the local license for the DLC is on the other console. You can only do the license transfer once every 4 months. It was not designed for sharing but rather to ensure that content is protected.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:40:15 </p>
<p>I'm not trying to SHARE. I'm trying to play MY game. ME AND ONLY ME. JUST ON MY SECOND CONSOLE.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:40:56</p>
<p>You may activate the 'roaming license' for the game.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:41:25</p>
<p>You just need to make sure that both profiles are downloaded and signed in on both consoles.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:42:32 </p>
<p>You are plain wrong Microsoft. The reason why is since MS has allowed the same profile to be used on another console, all GOD games have enabled the usage of the license on any console that THAT profile that originally purchased the game is trying to use
 said game. My point is, that feature isn't working on Forza Horizon and it's a known issue. Do you understand?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:43:16 </p>
<p>My profile, with the gamertag vSCORPIONv, is being used on BOTH of the consoles I OWN. But only by me, I can't be in two places at once!</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:43:49 </p>
<p>How do I activate a "roaming license" for Forza Horizon and why have you just now mentioned that?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:43:59</p>
<p>Yes I do and as we have discussed, the license for each content works differently. What works for most games will not automatically mean that it will work for all.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:44:30</p>
<p>I actually gave you the link that discusses this issue and gives you the steps needed to resolve this.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:44:40</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/downloadable-content/download-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../download-content</a>
</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:44:49</p>
<p>Here it is again for your reference.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:44:52 </p>
<p>Again, you are only right in the case that it wasn't enabled, which is should have been, and if not the buyer should be informed and to not do so is dishonest.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:45:04</p>
<p>If you follow the steps closely, there should be no issues.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:46:07 </p>
<p>Is this what you are talking about:</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:46:10 </p>
<p>What is a "roaming" Xbox 360 console? The term “roaming” refers to using content that you purchased on one Xbox 360 console on a different Xbox 360 console. For example, you might download a game from the Xbox Live Games Store to the hard drive on one console.
 Then, you attach the hard drive that contains that game to a different console. When you attach the hard drive to the second console and sign in to Xbox Live, you can play the game without any restrictions. Note To verify the content, you must use the profile
 that purchased the content to sign in to Xbox Live. </p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:46:18</p>
<p>The page discusses what and how licensing works and how you can activate the roaming option.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:46:22</p>
<p>Yes, that's it.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:47:18 </p>
<p>Ok, that isn't going to work.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:48:06 </p>
<p>The first console has the original old style hard drive because it is a 1st generation 360, the new one (second console) is a 3rd generation 360. They are not compatible.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:49:42</p>
<p>As you notice, the licensing will work only on one console. The transfer is available for customers who have issues with the other console and is unable to play the game or access content since the old one is repaired or defective. In your case both consoles
 and totally fine and DRM should not be used to transfer content from one console to the other.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:50:29 </p>
<p>Ok, finally we agree on that last statement.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:50:47</p>
<p>It has to be only one console.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:51:09 </p>
<p>So In the case of Forza Horizon, the only way for me to do what it is that I'm wanting to do (play the game on both consoles) would be to buy a physical copy of the game? (Disc)</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:51:12</p>
<p>It cannot be used to transfer from one working console to another.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:51:33 </p>
<p>I.e., when I want to play on console 2, i bring the disc with me to that console.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:52:44 </p>
<p>And this is because for whatever reason the developer of the game has not allowed for the game to be played on any other console except the one it was originally purchased/downloaded to, because that is where the license resides?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:52:49</p>
<p>Yes, that is correct. A game disc has a built in license and can be mobile, meaning, it can be used on any console.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:53:09</p>
<p>Yes, again VSCORPIONv.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:53:20 </p>
<p>Ok, tell me this, why have some DLC/GOD games been made to work this way also?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:53:24 </p>
<p>But not thisone?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:53:31 </p>
<p>I guess I want to know the WHY?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:55:05 </p>
<p>And if so, do you agree that that should have been clearly stated before purchase, as it is an expectation of the purchaser since in MOST (in my case with the games I have purchased; ALL) other cases it works by checking your profile/gamertag against the
 purchase history thereby verfying the license?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 11:55:08</p>
<p>That's the developers decision actually. We are only a game reseller and we manufacture the console where you can access these games.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:57:13 </p>
<p>Ok, I understand that, I think it would have been a more honest approach for MS to create ONE STANDARD here though.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 11:58:39 </p>
<p>I have read that in a few select cases on this issue with this specific game, MS has sent the person a physical copy of the disc. This was actually on a MS forum. Can you confirm this?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:00:03</p>
<p>That's good to know that we have reached common ground. As for standard licensing, we cater to different game developers and there are agreements and certain restrictions that may apply from one vendor to another depending on their terms. As for this, can
 you copy the link where you got that so we can check and verify?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:01:07 </p>
<p>Yes hold on, I will have to do a google search and comb for the link.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:01:34</p>
<p>Sure VSCORPIONv. I'll be glad to help validate that. I'll hold on for you.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:03:00 </p>
<p>In the meantime please read this, this is just ONE of the forums that have people frustrated over this issue. It's a MS forum so there should be no security issue.</p>

<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:06:53 </p>
<p>Level 1 Posted 4 Jul 2013 7:18 AM I run multiple servers and deal with code all day. I KNOW that the Forza Horizon "Disc is Unreadable" error is a coding mistake. Do something about it MS or give me a refund. I have: -Cleared the System Cache -Recovered
 my Profile -Deleted and re-downloaded Forza Horizon AFTER filing up the space with other content. Just FYI, the likelihood of an HDD having a bad sector just for the space of Forza Horizon, as occurring for the hundreds of people who share this problem, is
 close to 0.0000001%. Give me a refund. Let me License Transfer before I'm technically able to. OR fix the problem. This entire situation is a disgrace. This has been a known issue for months and MS hasn't done squ</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:07:25 </p>
<p>Makes no sense right? Since it's a downloadable game.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:07:36 </p>
<p>Microsoft, I was explicit from the beginning that this was the issue.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:07:54</p>
<p>Yes and the fix is actually outlined on the link I gave you.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:08:10</p>
<p>That's step 5.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:08:30 </p>
<p>It's not a fix though. It just isn't.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:08:34</p>
<p>We've dealt with this issue and that is proven to work.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:08:41 </p>
<p>The fix is BUY A DISC.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:09:02</p>
<p>5. Go to the Games Store and download a game demo or other content that is approximately the same size as the Games on Demand title.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:09:11 </p>
<p>Tried it.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:09:14 </p>
<p>Didn't work.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:09:19 </p>
<p>Multiple multiple times.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:09:31 </p>
<p>Read the posts in the forum, didn't work for those guys either.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:11:10 </p>
<p>FYI, I have been on hold now on that number you gave me for 1 hour. I hung up.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:11:20 </p>
<p>At this point I want a $15 refund.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:12:14 </p>
<p>Read this, this is from "Mister Ohnaka", an Official Support member:</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:12:16 </p>
<p>Hey folks, This is quite a frustrating issue. We really appreciate your patience, and am happy to let you know we have a current work-around. What we need to do is perform a license transfer onto your primary console. NOTE: You can only license transfer
 every 120 days, so if you are not using your main console, DO NOT DO THIS. This is also not an official solution, just a work-around to allow you to play your game while we continue to investigate. To perform a license transfer, just follow the steps below:
 Navigate to Settings. Choose Account. Select License Transfer Press "A" This should resolve the "Disc Unreadable" issue for the time being. Again, this is not a final solution. Please do not do this if you use any other consoles, as it will effect all licenses
 tied to your profile. Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:13:13 </p>
<p>I am also reading that you guys can give me another code for another license on my second console, since I legitatmely purchased the game outright. Is that not so?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:13:52 </p>
<p>Another post:</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:13:55 </p>
<p>Level 1 Posted 1 Aug 2013 4:10 AM Mister Fizzle... We are all having the SAME EXACT problem. We're all sick of hearing "We're working on it." or "we're looking into it." It's been a problem since it came out. Microsoft is bringing in $40 every time someone
 gets it, and they don't even get their game. It's not a coincidence the WE ALL have the SAME problem in the SAME place in the SAME loading screen. As for me, I want a refund cause I don't have money to spend on stuff and not get what I pay for. I give to charity
 for giving away money. At least until I can download a WORKING version of the game. It should work like EVERY other game, without transferring the license. Fix it</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:14:57</p>
<p>Can I have your gamertag and Xbox Live email to make sure that I am working on the right account?</p>

<p>Great! Thanks!</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:26:12 </p>
<p>Still here.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:26:54</p>
<p>Yes VSCORPIONv.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:27:09 </p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:27:37</p>
<p>May I ask if you are getting an error message when trying to access the game on the other console/</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:30:04 </p>
<p>No I am not.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:30:10 </p>
<p>Only on the secondary console.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:30:30</p>
<p>What is the error message that you are getting?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:30:48</p>
<p>I am referring to the second console.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:30:54 </p>
<p>"Disc Unreadable"</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:30:56 </p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:31:04 </p>
<p>as if there was a disc, but there is not</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:31:11 </p>
<p>again, this is a known issue.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:31:45 </p>
<p>it takes some time to wade through it all but a simple search for "Forza Horizon GOD Disc Unreadable" will tell you all you need to know.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:31:53 </p>
<p>I just got a second verify code for some reason?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:31:56 </p>
<p>Do you need it?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:33:07</p>
<p>To be honest, I know that we also have other customers who encountered this issue which shows disc unreadable even it is a digital download.
</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:33:25 </p>
<p>Ok. Thanks for your honesty. You would be correct</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:33:27</p>
<p>There are troubleshooting steps that we have tried that also work for this concern.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:33:35 </p>
<p>No. They don't.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:33:40 </p>
<p>I've tried them all.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:33:54 </p>
<p>Let's please not go down that path again.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:33:57</p>
<p>One of the steps is license transfer, VSCORPIONv. </p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:34:15</p>
<p>I've handled this case before.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:34:25 </p>
<p>Microsoft, you are sounding like a broken record now.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:34:29 </p>
<p>I am done with this.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:34:35 </p>
<p>Refund or physical disc.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:34:44 </p>

<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:35:05 </p>
<p>A LICENSE TRANSFER DOES NOT FIX THE ISSUE</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:35:24 </p>
<p>I DON'T WANT TO PLAY IT ON ONE CONSOLE, I WANT TO PLAY IT ON BOTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:35:28</p>
<p>I will not insist you to do it if you do not want to VSCORPIONv.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:35:51 </p>
<p>Are you going to issue a refund or send me a disc copy of the game?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:35:52 </p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:35:58 </p>
<p>That is all I want to know at this point.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:36:42</p>
<p>I am not arguing or will insist you to do the license transfer and I am just saying based on my experience being a technical support for how many years now on Xbox.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:37:54 </p>
<p>Ok, well in this case you are WRONG and you are not listening to the details of the issue. If you were you would understand this point that a license transfer will not allow me to play this game on both of the consoles, and since this is the issue I originally
 contacted you about, you have not in ANY WAY RESOLVED MY ISSUE.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:38:18 </p>

<p>I don't care what types of licenses you have.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:39:10</p>
<p>The system license is the one that is attached to the console and the local license is the one attached to your profile.
</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:39:50 </p>
<p>I want to be able to play the game that I OWN on the consoles I OWN. Since you cannot offer me that with a digital download in the case of Forza Horizon, then I either want a REFUND or a PHYSICAL DISC COPY of Forza Horizon.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:39:51</p>
<p>If you have two consoles, you can play the game on the second console using the profile that was used to purchase the content.
</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:39:54 </p>
<p>So what's it going to be?</p>

<p>That is EXACTLY what I have been telling you this ENTIRE TIME!!!!!!</p>

http://billing.microsoft.com</a> and I have this concern documented with case number: xxxxxxxx for reference purposes.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:48:34</p>
<p>It was truly an honor that I was able to help you with this. Will there be anything else that I can help you today?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:49:12 </p>
<p>No but Microsoft, you wasted a hell of a lot of my time by not listening to the exact details of the problem in the first place. Do you realize that?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:49:43 </p>
<p>What are you prepared to offer me for wasting my time?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:50:07</p>
<p>A free game.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:50:16 </p>
<p>Any free game?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:51:00 </p>
<p>At this point I'd think you guys were ready to send me an Xbox One for crying out loud. This has been the most preposterous customer service experience of my life.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:51:04</p>
<p>No, &nbsp;I will provide you a link that you can check on later.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:51:33 </p>
<p>What link?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:52:22</p>
<p>May I Know if you want the game or not/</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:52:27 </p>
<p>By the way, I will be writing a letter to Microsoft's corporate offices about this issue, the way it was handled, etc.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:52:44 </p>
<p>Yest I want a free game, but I still don't feel that fully compensates me.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:52:58</p>
<p>Here is the link VSCORPIONv, <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Spartacus-Legends/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
marketplace.xbox.com/.../xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</a></p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:53:03</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can help you with?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:54:09 </p>
<p>How about a year free of Xbox Live, or an Xbox One? My time is very valuable, I play games to release from stress and this has done exactly the opposite. I have paid through the nose to MS for years now and although you are trying to make good after wasting
 my time it is not enough.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:54:31</p>
<p>I am not capable of doing that VSCORPIONv.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:54:53 </p>
<p>Who is?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:56:25</p>
<p>I am afraid that can be granted since the account has already been refunded.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:56:36</p>
<p>**Can't</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:57:15 </p>
<p>Refunded for the game. Not my time.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:57:25 </p>
<p>And of course it can be granted. That's not an excuse.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:57:31</p>
<p>Refunded for the game VSCORPIONv.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:57:41 </p>
<p>Now we are talking about my time.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:58:09 </p>
<p>This should have been very very simple, instead it turned into a debacle because you failed to listen to the details.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 12:59:08</p>
<p>There will be no compensation that can be granted, I hope you understand our limitation VSCORPIONv.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 12:59:48 </p>
<p>There is no limitation other than the one you and your corporation choose in this matter. Anything is doable from your end. The ball is in your court.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 13:01:00</p>
<p>I understand that &nbsp;you are asking for a compensation VSCORPIONv, but if we are capable of doing that you do not have to ask for it.</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 13:01:16 </p>
<p>I wonder what Satya Nadella would have to say about this?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 13:01:29 </p>
<p>Or Phil Spencer?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 13:01:43 </p>
<p>Or Larry Herb?</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 13:01:54</p>

<p>Actually, I plan on writing a letter to all three of the above, with this exact correspondence.</p>
<p>Microsoft: at 13:02:59</p>
<p>Alright! Would there be anything else that I can assist you with?</p>
<p>VSCORPIONv: at 13:03:10 </p>
<p>Nope. Good luck.</p>

<p>Glad I could provide some entertainment Squid. </p>
<p>In all seriousness though. Totally ridiculous. I don't believe anyone else had ever taken it this far yet though and I'm not done.</p>
<p>Out of principle I'm going to pursue this until they fix it or refund everyone.
