<h2>            The Ending of LA Noire &#40;Major Spoilers&#41;</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><b>Once again, for those that missed it in the title. MAJOR SPOILERS are abound, if you've not completed the game don't read this.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><b><br />
So I just finished LA Noire after hearing a lof of people saying the ending was awful and abrupt. I personally thought it was fantastic once I got my head around it. Have I interpreted it differently from everyone else, or are people dissapointed it wasn't
 the fairy tale ending we were all expecting?<br />
<br />
People are saying the ending is sudden - Of course it was, Phelps dies out of the blue. That puts the brakes on the story quite fast.But, the way he died in my eyes was great. Sacrificing himself because of his mistakes in the war, and his guilt.<br />
</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><b>A lot of the major players get away. The Chief of Police, Ray and the DA all escape the wrath of the law coming down on them. With the death of Phelps and Ira, there is no case to build against them. We have to assume the freeway
 gets built, and they all get paid. Are people unhappy that for once, the criminals get paid, and get away?</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><b>Phelps trying to be a good leader in the army and following orders ruins Ira's life. He pays for it at the time by getting shot (if anyone can give me the name of the guy who shoots him I'd love to know, I couldn't place his
 face fast enough), but at the end of the story we find out that his mistakes ruined Ira's life and consequently a lot of people die because of it in the arson fires. Only Monroe and Harlan get their comeuppance for the "bad guys", where as every solider from
 the war dies with the exception of Kelso. <br />
</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><b>I thought it was a great example of the good guys not coming out on top.&nbsp; As I said before, out of the 10 or so good guys only one survives. Where as the crooks get paid and run off into the sunset, whilst at the same time
 the people of LA think they are the heroes. This doesn't happen enough in video games, and for me the shock of it made it a great little ending.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><b>I guess the moral of the story, much like real life, is that the good guys hardly win.</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><b><br />
How did you guys feel about the ending? How did you interpret it? <br />
</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><b><br />

<p>I liked it. Was very abrupt though, but ok that the good guys didn't win because it was more fitting that Cole lost his life. It's more realistic and suits Cole's character and history well.</p>

<p>The ending caught me by suprise because I wasn't expecting it again so soon after RDR (I no this is a &nbsp;Team Bondi game not Rockstar) but you no what I mean. I wouldnt mind being able to try to take down the bad guys who got away in future DLC playing as
 the insurance investigator.</p>

<p>A fantastic story and completely what the Noire genre is, reminded me of Saturday Avo's when i was a kid watching black and white movies, class! &nbsp; Wouldnt agree with the assesment of Phelps being a good guy in the war though, and following orders, he couldnt
 hack it and made bad judgement calls, shouldnt have been in a position of command and the whole squad new it, Which is why the story of Noire is essentially Phelps redemption story. &nbsp;Class best game of the year so far. &nbsp; New DLC next Tuesday Wooop WOOOP</p>

<h2>            My desktop windows 10 display has completely changed, I want to get back my original desktop display.</h2>
                    I don't know if this is from some recent update or something that someone in my family did but my normal display with all my apps and links have changed to something completely different.&nbsp; Hopefully this is just something that can be changed easily but
 I can't figure out how.&nbsp; This new setting looks much like the old windows 8 did though I never had that version.&nbsp; It's like the small boxes that used to pop up when I click on the windows button now are showing in the middle of my monitor in a much bigger
 version.&nbsp; Hope someone can help.

            Hi wnscf, that will be no problem, you are in Tablet Mode . . .
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + A
<br />On the Resulting Flyout, if you cannot see the Tablet Mode Button, click 'Expand'
<br />If the Tablet Mode Button is not gray, click it so it becomes gray
<br />This will turn off tablet mode

    <title>OneDrive - Linking New User on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melanieforeman  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive - Linking New User on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have two Microsoft accounts, one for personal use and one for work use. &nbsp;I did some digging and found out that it is not possible to change or add users to OneDrive in a Windows 8.1 user account. &nbsp;I then created a new user on my PC, and I used my work
 Microsoft account to set up that user account. &nbsp;Windows then began setting up OneDrive for that user. &nbsp;However, when it asked me to verify my email address, I did so on my phone because Outlook was not yet set up on the new user account. &nbsp;After verifying,
 the PC screen never changed - it still was waiting for verification. &nbsp;I closed out of OneDrive, and now I don't have the option of linking my Microsoft account to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this: &nbsp;How do I link my Microsoft account to the OneDrive Windows app for 8.1 if the user account is already set up? &nbsp;Again, it is not linked to any account right now.</p>

            Thanks for the response. I'd already tried the open maximise route which didn't work. Only VDJ has this problem as far as I'm aware. Ran uninstall and then reinstalled latest rev and now works fine.

<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7</u></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it came preinstalled on your computer.</p>
<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
</span>
<p>For Samsung: Tap the F4 Key at the Samsung logo when you first power on.</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 App Store</h2>
                    I have complaints about 2 issues with the Windows 8.1 App Store, And I'd love for someone to point out where I'm wrong. 



First, when browsing or searching for apps, Why in gods name do they NOT list the publisher for the apps on that page?  I have to go into each and every app to determine if the app is an official app by a reputable publisher, or some knock off BS app trying to charge me 1.99 to play you tube videos.  Not even the main page shows the publisher.  Seriously, save time and cut down on fraud by just putting the publishers name on the list of apps. 



Which leads me to my second point...  It was incredibly hard for me to find this website to leave feedback.  How about a menu option that says: "Feedback"?  I'm still not even sure that this message is going towards the right people (let alone if anyone will care once it gets there). 


I found plenty of links saying "Wait, wait, let us tell you how to do things!"  But it seems like Microsoft is so eager to tell me what they

                    Since I installed Windows 10, I now cannot access my memory card in camera or otherwise. The drive shows up as an external device and even shows it as my camera D3s, but it says the folder is empty when it is not. I understand other Nikon users are having
 the same problem. Would you at Microsoft please post an executable patch? Thank you.

                    <p>Just installed 1709 from scratch, and the last thing left to do is link my phone. When I received a message, I got Microsoft Launcher. It looks pretty awesome and useful, and the last I'd like to know: does it replace Cortana app and can it sync notifications
 with PC?</p>

<p>Thank you for response. The sms I received after linking my phone to Windows contained a link to Microsoft Launcher in Play Store. So I got it and I keep using it.</p>

<p>Since I had an experience with Cortana app that is able to sync the notifications, including incoming text messages, I've still never seen the technique the Messaging app is working. None of my conversations was saved. It also informed me with a warning
 message at the start that it stores all the received SMS and texts from messengers, one of which is Skype. And I still have this window:</p>

<p>I don't understand. What is a mobile app we're talking about? Is this something related to Windows Phone programs (don't blame me, if there's nothing useful about Android devices, I shouldn't reply then)? Also, the notifications are enabled for the PC app.</p>

<p>I also really want the sms feature on and can't seem to find any direct answer about whether or not it exists.... I see the option for messaging notification and calls on the Windows 10, but it says to connect an app that makes calls and sends messages;
 an app I am assuming like Skype- and not a phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say that generic response by Erika Aro was very unhelpful. They either don't seem to understand the question entirely.. or they just don't have answer. Really unfortunate, I hope someone updates.</p>

<div>If (a) you do NOT have an anti-virus application installed and/or (b) your subscription expired, however briefly and/or (c) you didn't have a valid, fully-functional anti-virus application installed when your computer got infected and/or (d) you've neglected
 to keep the machine fully patched at Windows Update, see...<br />

<br />
Back-up any personal data (e.g., online banking &amp; credit-card passwords, none of which should be considered 100% trustworthy at this point) then format the hard-drive (typically the C: drive) &amp; do a clean install of Windows.&nbsp;<span><span style="font-weight: bold">Please
 note that a Repair Install (AKA in-place upgrade) will NOT fix this!</span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
NOTE: If your computer didn't come with a set of disks, there will be a hidden Recovery partition (not to be confused with System Restore) you would use to do the clean install (AKA a "destructive recovery").<br />
<br />
After the clean install, you will have the equivalent of a "new computer" so take care of&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">everything</span></span>&nbsp;in the list below,&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">in
 order</span></span>, before otherwise connecting the machine to the internet&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">or a local network</span></span>&nbsp;(i.e., other computers)&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">and
 before connecting a flash drive, SDCard, or any other external drive to the computer</span></span>:
<ol>
<br />
<li>Make sure the Windows Firewall is enabled.</li><li>Uninstall any&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic">now-invalid</span>&nbsp;Norton, McAfee, etc., free-trialware which was also reinstalled, run the appropriate removal tool (see below), then install an anti-virus application of your choice (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft
 Security Essentials</a>&nbsp;- free).</li><li>Check in at Windows Update &amp; get the computer fully-patched.</li><li>If you do&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic">not</span>&nbsp;install Microsoft Security Essentials or your chosen anti-virus application does not include an anti-spyware component, you can install&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/defender/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows
 Defender</a>&nbsp;or another anti-spyware application which includes realtime protection.</li></ol>
<br />
TIP: Use another, uninfected computer to download the installers for, e.g., SP2 and/or SP3, the installer for your new anti-virus application and either of the removal tools cited below. Transfer these files to CD or DVD (not a flash drive) then transfer the
 files from the CD or DVD to the desktop of the computer you're working on.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 update error 80070003 - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ardom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 update error 80070003 -</h2>
                    A&nbsp; friend , non native English speaker can not update her laptop. I have tried "fixit" and deleting contents and changing the name of Download in windows sys32. These the two main suggestions I have found on line.
<br />
<br />
She runs Windows 7 home premium. I came to help as Windows started asking for activation. The program was reinstalled several months ago and I activated it at the time.&nbsp; She does have another friend who does things to help sometimes and maybe he did something
 to cause this. I deleted Eset Nod32 and reinstalled MSE as anti virus. I ran CCleaner to flush temporary files . I have tried "fixit" and deleting contents and changing the name of Download in windows sys32..&nbsp; I note that in properties the computer still shows
 the OEM number as her Windows activation code in spite of my trying to change it to the version she is actually using and which I used to activate. .&nbsp; I also ran the System Update Readiness tool. I restarted after each approach.&nbsp; I will try to visit tomorrow
 to run the SFC tool which I just read about.&nbsp; The programs that are in start up are Skype and Yahoo messenger.<br />
<br />
In the mean time if anybody has any ideas I would love to hear them.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Which Windows Update are you trying to install?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform system file checker and try to install the updates. If that does not work, I would suggest you to run Windows Genuine Advantage Validation Tool and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: </span></b></p>
<p><span>The Windows Genuine Advantage validation is required when you request a genuine Windows download from the Microsoft Download Center or from Windows Update. The validation process applies to all Windows editions.</span></p>
<p><span>All the users of genuine Windows and non-genuine Windows software can access security updates through Automatic Updates. The Windows validation is required to make sure that customers have access to the latest features, updates, and support from Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span>To validate your Windows 7 edition, visit the following Web site, and then click
<strong><span>Validate Windows</span></strong> button:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/genuine</strong></span></a><br />
If the validation is unsuccessful, you will receive a description of why your Windows is not genuine Windows. Additionally, you will receive information about how to obtain genuine Windows software.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Contact Microsoft Customer Service and Support: </strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/295539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/295539</strong></span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Once you've validated your Windows and if the tool has repaired Windows 7 licensing components that may have been damaged, moved, or deleted. You can try updating your Windows to see if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Install Windows updates: </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-Windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-Windows-updates</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Manually install the update in Clean Boot</span></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Step 1:</span></i></b><span> Follow the steps in the link below to set the computer to ‘Clean boot’ state.</span></p>
<p><b><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></b></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> When the troubleshooting is over, do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow step 7 in the above-mentioned article.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Install the update manually</span></b></p>
<p><span>To download and install the update manually, follow these steps: </span>
</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Determine the Microsoft Knowledge Base article number of the failed update. To do this, take one of the following actions:</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>View the error code message.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>View the update history on the Windows Update Web site or on the Microsoft Update Web site. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Visit the following Microsoft Update Web site:
</span><span><a href="http://update.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://update.microsoft.com</strong></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Review your update history</b> under
<b>Options</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the <b>Update</b> column, determine the Microsoft Knowledge Base article number of the failed update.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Visit the following Windows Download Web site:
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/default.aspx</strong></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>h)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the <b>Search</b> box on the Downloads Web page, type the Microsoft Knowledge Base article number that you determined in step 1, and then click

<b>Note:</b> If the Microsoft Knowledge Base article number that is listed for the update is
<b>KB123456</b>, type <b>123456</b> in the <b>Search</b> box on the Downloads Web page, and then click

<p><span><span>i)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Browse the list of returned content to locate the Knowledge Base article that has a link to the download.
<br />
<b>Note:</b> You may be prompted to validate Windows. If you are prompted, follow the instructions to validate Windows, and then continue with the download.</span></p>
<p><span><span>j)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Download</b>, and then click
<b>Save</b> when you are prompted to save the download. Save the download to your desktop.</span></p>
<p><span><span>k)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>After the download has finished, click
<b>Open</b> to install the update.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: The installation of the update may still fail if the update is incorrect for your version of Windows.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Run System restore and try installing updates.</span></b></p>
<p><span>System Restore can return your PC's system files and programs to a time when everything was working fine, potentially preventing hours of troubleshooting headaches. It will not affect your documents, pictures, or other data.</span></p>

            Anoop P K hello,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Thank you for the response. As I said it is not my machine\e and at least one other person is "helping" her. Language is also a problem. She is Nepalese and my mother in laws (94) caretaker.&nbsp; I came because suddenly Windows demanded activation. As I had activated
 it several months before after doing a reinstall to clean out all the viruses and other junk that filled her machine I did not understand why.<br />
&nbsp; I did activate successfully and then tried to update and discovered I could not.
<br />
&nbsp;Looking around for solutions to 80070003 I used "fixit" , downloaded and ran system update tool , ran CCleaner to empty temps , cleared downloads in -Windows 32 / software and even changed its name.&nbsp; All to no avail.&nbsp; Only tomorrow will I be able to get back&nbsp;
 to her machine when I will try&nbsp; SFC and report back the results. System Restore I confess I did not think of because of the activation issue.<br />
Looking at restore point might tell me something though. <br />
<br />
yours Ardom<br />

    <title>HID Touchscreen disconnecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emmjay52  say:</h3>
<h2>            HID Touchscreen disconnecting</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 7348. The HID touchscreen is disconnecting from the laptop, whether I have it in tablet or normal mode. Rotation lock is greyed out and hasn't been working for as long as I can remember. The touchscreen driver is up to date. The latest
 message I got is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Device HID\VID_04F3&amp;PID_2033&amp;Col02\6&amp;3865017c&amp;0&amp;0001 was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match.<br />
<br />
Last Device Instance Id: BTHHFENUM\BthHFPHID\8&amp;32fe89ac&amp;0&amp;104"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I uninstall the touchscreen and re-start the laptop, it will re-appear and remain connected and working until I bend the screen back to use as a tablet, then it disappears again (Auto-rotate message appears and works). The touchscreen problem is getting
 worse. , if I leave the laptop in tent position and re-start, the touchscreen will not work. Any advice welcome (I am only slightly computer literate, not fluent yet!)</p>

    <title>Laptop acts weird when I use the USB ports - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rose quintilian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop acts weird when I use the USB ports</h2>
                    <p>I have read a lot of *similar* problems here but none that are quite the same as mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new Toshiba laptop, which I'm using at my desk. &nbsp;I have plugged in a monitor, new keyboard, and new mouse. &nbsp;I also sometimes plug in an external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes my laptop acts possessed. &nbsp;It opens apps, types things, jumps around, etc. &nbsp;I have tried unplugging different things in different variations, so no, having everything plugged in at once is not the problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when just the mouse is plugged in it goes wonky as well, and sometimes not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Rose,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing issues with your Windows 8.1 system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try the following methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety
 Scanner is a free security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing Antivirus software. Refer to the link to download and run the scanner:</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run
 the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>

    <title>Unable to activate Windows 10 license key after re-installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cam nielsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to activate Windows 10 license key after re-installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently re-installed windows on my home computer to get the OS entirely on my SSD and roll back an automatic update that compromised functionality of a vital program. I had no issues activating my windows license during my first install ~3 months ago
 but when I tried to reactivate windows this time around I am having some issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting the following error when I enter my license:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We can't reach a critical windows service. Make sure you're connected to the Internet, wait a few minutes, and try activating again. Error code: 0x8070422"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned off automatic updates to prevent the same issue occurring again - and I am connected to the internet (this post should serve as evidence of that) but the error has persisted. Below the change product key option (which leads to this error) it shows
 a product key that I am wholly unfamiliar with as being my last product key. I bought the parts for my computer new and have only used one license for windows so I have no idea where it got a last product key from to be honest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any advice on how to get my product key entered that would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi Cam,<br />
<br />
There are 2 possible reasons why this concern is happening. One, two services might be disabled namely,<strong> Automatic updates</strong> and&nbsp;
<strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)</strong>. Two, the error message that you have encountered is related to a volume license key that is related to a large organization and its for business use, not for consumers. These type of license key
 expire on a regular basis. They are usually reactivated by an IT department owned by a company.
<br />
<br />
We just like to clarify a few things, please answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using a retail license key of Windows or it came preinstalled with the computer?</li><li>How did you disable automatic updates? Based on the error message, there was a service that is used to activate Windows that was disabled. That's why it can't connect to the activation server.</li><li>Where did you get the copy of your Windows installer? Is it through this <strong>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>?</li></ul>
<p>For the meantime, please run the <em>services.msc</em> and check if the following Windows services are running: Software Protection, and Background Intelligent Transfer Service. If they are not, kindly activate them again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further investigate, please run the activation troubleshooter by going to<strong> Settings&gt;&gt; Update and security&gt;&gt; Activation&gt;&gt; select Troubleshoot.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>You must run this as an Administrator</em><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

            Home in Windows 10 Home doesn't mean it can only be used in Home. If it suits your need, you can use it.

    <title>System unresponsive after going to sleep mode - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System unresponsive after going to sleep mode</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: left">Original title:- HP 6005 desktop - issue with 'sleep' mode.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p style="text-align: center">
</p><p style="text-align: center">Greets from a fellow computer hobbyist. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two identical HP 6005 desktops (AMD) which I purchased for my mother where I reformatted one of the desktops with W10 and kept the other for parts if need be - which has come in handy as of late...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I was advised that my mother lost a lot of work related documents because apparently the computer went to sleep and 'died',&nbsp; the monitor never woke up and apparently the computer required a hard reboot, acting strange when restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fired up the spare HP 6005 at my place and left it alone for a while to test the outcome.</p>
<p>Sure enough, W10 'sleep' maims it by the monitor not getting a signal to bring it back to life.</p>
<p>Doing a soft power up, it then takes excessive time to come back to life, very sluggish with freezing.</p>
<p>Almost like the OS is struggling to overcome something - which is probably how it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Rebooting the monitor (Usually stuck on standby or get a blank/dead screen with only the mouse pointer, or get a frozen 'welcome' page)</p>
<p>-Swapping drives with different manufacturers. (No change)</p>
<p>-Updating BIOS and all drivers possible (Yes, video was high priority. Tried older and newer driver). (No change)</p>
<p>-Adjusting the power settings in both the BIOS and in W10. (No change)</p>
<p>-Spending endless hours online to find a lot of laptop owners experiencing the same thing along with other HP 6005 owners.</p>
<p>- ??? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely an issue with W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not have a problem with W7 at all because I reformatted a drive with W7 and all is well.</p>
<p>Being that W10 'free' offer expires this summer,&nbsp; I don't think it's fair how my mother's computer is stricken with a crippling sleep phase and now I have to spend hours putting W7 back into her computer after spending hours teaching her about W10, just
 great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was all for W10, but now I have to buy her another a different tower to safely run W10 or 'downgrade' to W7?
</p>
<p>Hmm, I guess I'm realistically faced with the latter option to revert. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps this sleep 'disorder' remains a mystery, but I thought to tell my tale in case some internet traveler finds this post and lends much needed help to solve this conundrum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align: center">Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you were facing issues related to power after upgrading to Windows 10. We appreciate your efforts trying to troubleshoot the issue. The problem with power
 and sleep function might have caused due to corruption in power settings on your Windows 10 computer. This could have been caused while performing the upgrade due to some corrupted download. I suggest you to try upgrading again using a Windows 10 media creation
 tool and check if the issue persists. </span></p>

<p>
</p><p>However, the thing is that I have the two computers (same specs/clones) and both have different hard drives with separate clean installs of W10 from an older and newer media creation tool.</p>
<p>I actually did error checking on both.</p>
<p>Both HP 6005 computers are having the same issue regarding the 'sleep' phase. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How I've laid out the most recent testing tonight was to put a fully working spare HDD with W10 (sleep worked just fine on an older ASUS EeeBox which it just came out of) into my test computer and did all the updates for that specific tower, so the platforms
 are virtually the same in the HP towers which both exhibit the exact 'sleep' disorder as described in the original posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is now three hard drives with W10 with the same problem and I'm still stumped... as well as others:

<p>
</p><p>Perhaps a BIOS adjustment is needed for W10 and HP couldn't care less.</p>
<p>Anyone's guess is as good as mine.</p>

 working ok. Restored to several earlier restore points with no luck. Everything seems to work but the keyboard. Need some better ideas.</p>

            How did you check the KB drivers/function?<br />
<br />
As an interesting aside, I checked the device manager on my Windows 7 toy (a 32-bit netbook, admittedly), and I was rather surprised to see the "Keyboard" category missing my keyboard.&nbsp; It's an aside because my keyboard is working fine despite this revelation.&nbsp;
 Anyway, back to suggestions.<br />
<br />
Try running the hardware and devices troubleshooter, and post back whether it found a problem or not:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Click on Start -&gt; Control Panel</li><li>Change "View by: Category" (in the upper-right part) to "View by: Large Icons" (or to "View by: Small Icons")</li><li>Click on Troubleshooting</li><li>Click on the "Configure a device" link (the one with the UAC shield beside it) directly underneath "Hardware and Sound."</li><li>The troubleshooter wizard should start and guide you through the rest.</li><li>When the troubleshooter reaches the finish, it should offer a small text link in the lower-left, "View detailed information," if it doesn't directly say what problems it fixed or found.<br />
</li></ul>

            The result report was saved to your computer, but you're the only one who can access it with those links.<br />
<br />
When you tried updating the PS/2 keyboard driver in the Device Manager, you were in the dialog box that has the next idea I have.&nbsp; In that box are two other buttons, one to roll back the driver, and one to uninstall the device.<br />
<br />
Please understand that I'm making an educated guess but still a guess based on what I've seen when other types of devices stop working in Windows but continue working in other operating systems.&nbsp; I've never seen this happen with a legacy keyboard before.<br />
<br />
Try rolling back the driver first.&nbsp; If it tells you that there is a driver to roll back to, try typing or reboot and try typing.<br />
<br />
If rolling back the driver doesn't restore the keyboard or if Windows says there's nothing to roll back to, then try uninstalling the PS/2 keyboard.&nbsp; Once uninstalled, you'll be asked to reboot, and Windows should offer to reinstall it as new hardware on that
 very boot.&nbsp; Once reinstalled, you'll be asked to reboot again.&nbsp; See if the keyboard starts working then.<br />

            When I looked at drivers, the only driver listed was the original driver installed with the W7 operating system.&nbsp; I un-installed it and rebooted, but it didn't help..&nbsp; Didn't even ask to reinstall after I rebooted, likely because it is the default and
 only keyboard driver.&nbsp; I've never seen anything like this before.

            Having the same issue with an HP dm4 with windows 7, Did a system restore, and the keyboard worked, after I completed the system updates the keyboard no longer works. The wireless function key still works, and the keyboard still functions on the log in
 screen, is not working in safe mode, or in a clean boot.

<p>This is a Dell 2 in 1 device and is a replacement refurb unit for this same problem. Recently this one started acting up with same problem - right side of keyboard does not work, specifically ESC, tab, caps lock, left shift, 1, q, a and z. Then inexplicably,
 I was locked out at password entry. Said this account was not authorized for pin number and entry of password failed over and over. Reset password on other laptop but this one would not work. Refresh keeping files did not work so had to do complete deletion
 and reinstall. Amazingly keyboard now worked like a charm. After updates and restart, same problem. Have cleaned with alcohol and canned air and electronics brush - no joy. Drive is unchanged. Sticky keys off, Toggle keys on, Filer keys on, Enable slow keys
 off. Sometime hitting one of these keys (like to use caps lock to see if light comes on) will start key working and once it works all of these keys will work FOR A WHILE. Running hardware trouble troubleshooter will work once in a blue moon. This unit gets
 very hot, especially on left side and I'm wondering if this problem is typical to this unit,</p>
