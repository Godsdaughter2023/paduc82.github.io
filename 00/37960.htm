<h2>            How do I uninstall Windows live essentials so when I try to reinstall them all of them appear as install options&#63;</h2>
                    I am using IE8 and windows live essentials. I tried uninstalling windows live essentials and it was no problem. When I downloaded the set to reinstall again there were to options to reinstall either one of them except for one that was not installed. How
 can I clean uninstall live essentials so everything gets reinstalled again?

Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />

It shows like you may have some corruption in your system files.<br />
Run System File Checker: <br />
<p><span>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow<br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Restart your system<br />
<br />
Then try again and download and install Windows Installer Cleanup Tool. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here to download the utility</a>. <br />
You can use the utility to remove installation information for programs that were installed by using Windows Installer. Be aware that Windows Installer CleanUp Utility will not remove the actual program from your computer. However, it will remove the installation
 files so that you can start the installation, upgrade, or uninstall over. <br />
<br />
If that doesn't work to uninstall, reinstall the program and then try to uninstall again. Usually this will help to remove all aspects of the programs.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            <p>Non-genuine status doesn't block access to Windows - so you must also have other problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please boot to Safe Mode with Networking&nbsp;(which should allow access) then follow these instructions.</p>
<p>To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool
<br />
(download and save to desktop - <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a> )<br />
&nbsp;Once saved, run the tool. <br />
Click on the Continue button, which will produce the report.<br />
&nbsp;To copy the report to your response, click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your response.<br />
&nbsp; - **in your own thread**, please<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please also state the Version and Edition of Windows quoted on your COA sticker (if you have one) on the case of your machine (or inside the battery compartment), but do NOT quote the Key on the sticker!<br />

            <p>1. It was working fine on the SSD until I reformatted the original OS drive. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The SSD shows up as E on the cmd "diskpart"</p>
<p>the D Drive shows up as D.</p>
<p>The original OS(formated) drive&nbsp;doesn't show a drive letter in "diskpart".</p>
<p>3. I cannot get into safe mode as it does the same thing as normal mode.</p>

<p>4. Could it be that because there is no C drive? But why would it boot to login screen and allow me to try and login?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I could run MGADiag from the cmd prompt I would have no way to print it. </p>

            <p>Its possible you did not clone the 'System, Reserved' partition from your original drive to the SSD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boot from&nbsp;one of the utilties list below and see if there is a small 100MB partition at the front of the SSD. Should be labled 'System' and 'Active'.</p>

You should be able to get into Windows even if its not activated, the fact that you were able to attempt JW's suggestion would suggest that were able to access the desktop and execute programs.

<p><strong><em>How to Activate Windows by Internet.</em></strong></p>
<p>Activating Windows 7 manually is very simple. First of all, you need to make sure you have a working Internet connection. Once that is confirmed, go on to the next step.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Activate-Windows-1-tut.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f12%2fActivate-Windows-1-tut_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Click Start, type <strong>Activate Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Activate-Windows-1-tut1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f12%2fActivate-Windows-1-tut_thumb1.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Hit Enter on your Keyboard</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Activate-Windows-2-tut.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f12%2fActivate-Windows-2-tut_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Click <strong>Activate Windows Online Now </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Activation-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f12%2fActivation-3_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Activation in progress</strong></p>
<p>To confirm your genuine license, view Windows Activation in System Properties:</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Wndows-activated.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f12%2fWndows-activated_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Within seconds you should be automatically activated. If not, there are a number of factors that could be preventing you from activating. It is possible Microsoft Activation Servers are overwhelmed at the moment. Give it some time and try again later. Again,
 you could be running a non-genuine installation or using a black listed product key. We will find out more about this later in the article.</p>
<p><strong><em>How to Activate Windows by telephone</em></strong></p>

<p>Use the toll free number and hold on to speak with a customer agent. If you don’t, you will use the automated phone system instead.</p>
<p><strong>Other work around – Extend your Activation Grace Period</strong></p>
<p>Another work around for Activation is to extend Activation Grace Period for another 30 days. You can do this up to 4 times (3 times for volume licenses) for a total of 180 days extension. After this grace period, you will need to make sure Windows is activated.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Activation-Workaround.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f12%2fActivation-Workaround_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>At the command prompt, type <strong>slmgr/rearm </strong>then press <strong>Enter
</strong>(slmgr stands for <em>software license manager) This will tell Windows to extend grace period for another 30 days if you are not ready or unable to activate.
</em></p>
<p>Exit the command prompt and restart the system to save the changes.</p>
<p>If you would like to see how many rearms you have left, open another command prompt and type

            <p>I have looked at all info from different people and all have let me look into areas I would not know about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have not resolved my issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I can do is when I login is hit Cltr-Alt-Del and I can get into the Task Manager and go in and see my info on my drives.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did use the mini tool and saw all my partitions and the SSD shows it is the&nbsp;active and boot drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do not know how to resolve this issue without starting over, but will wait a while until I feel I have no alternative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know the original drive that was the main OS is still intact even though I reformatted it. I used the MiniTool software recommended and saw that the partition is still there, but the software doesn't seem to be able to recover it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again all, if there is someone that has any further suggestions I would like to hear them.</p>

<p>Do you / Did you have Superb Game Boost by IOBit? it seems that in its settings, there's a screenshot option that the default is alt + a. It's what it was for me.<br />
Solution was found in an obscure Steam thread.</p>

            I don't know what or who is "RETARDED" but that hotkey combination isn't coming from Windows 10.&nbsp; You most likely have some program or screenshot utility installed that's causing it.&nbsp;

<p>I have a solution. The shortcut is from Superb Game Boost.</p>
<p>To change the shortcut, follow my steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open up Superb Game Boost.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/126b25ad-3482-4a79-a41b-39e89bcd883e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/126b25ad-3482-4a79-a41b-39e89bcd883e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the top right hand corner where the close icon is. Click the icon far to the left of the close icon. Then, click Settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6806b74-eac7-4d5d-8a3c-4c21e3e66fe7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6806b74-eac7-4d5d-8a3c-4c21e3e66fe7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Hotkey, then change the shortcut. (I already disabled it so the hotkey is showing as None)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73671920-390b-401c-a3c8-ff959e959d7c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73671920-390b-401c-a3c8-ff959e959d7c" /></a></p>
<p>And now Alt+A will no longer do anything. You're welcome!</p>

            Thanks for your message.&nbsp; I have had another look at the files involved.&nbsp; I downloaded another browser and made that the default.&nbsp; I uninstalled Flash player plugin version 11.&nbsp; IPlayer stopped working in the new browser too.&nbsp; I went to the Adobe site
 and asked for the latest Flash Player (11) and downloaded it.&nbsp; After it was installed I went to the Microsoft IE site and downloaded the latest browser and reinstalled it.&nbsp; I then tried to use iPlayer in Microsoft IE11 and found that it worked.&nbsp; I then uninstalled
 the other browser (FireFox) and now only use IE11 as it is my preferred browser.&nbsp; Thank you for all your help Srimadhwa.

<h2>            Copy and Paste commands not working</h2>
                    My Copy and Paste commands have stopped working in all my software programs (Photoshop, CorelDraw, Corel Painter, etc.).&nbsp; When I hit 'copy', or do 'control c', it stalls and whatever program I am using becomes inoperative.&nbsp; I ran Services.msc to make sure&nbsp;the
 clipboard (didn't find clipboard so I assumed it was changed to clipbook) was enabled, which it was but when I clicked on 'Start this service' it said&nbsp; "Could not start the Clipbook service on local computerl.&nbsp; Error:1068: The dependency service or group failed
 to start". This started several weeks ago and I have not installed any new programs during that time.&nbsp; Only&nbsp;chage to my computer has been the automatic Windows Updates.&nbsp; This is very frustrating...how do I get copy and paste to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've had this computer
 less then 4 months.&nbsp; Thanks

<h2>            Microsoft Jackpot</h2>
                    <p>WHY do We get the run around about the question of the cloud? I'm 6 days of calling Microsoft support-they can't help. the Microsoft Answer Desk is a joke and waste of time. Seems like someone from Microsoft could address this issue other than pass the buck
 to Xbox. This getting very frustrating, to me FIX IT or just remove the game from Microsoft Store. I know it is a free game, but when I was ask by their IT Pro team to pay for a fix , heck no, what's wrong with that picture? I need to quit ,this issue keeps
 my blood pressure up, If I have a heart attack, will be because of Microsoft.</p>

    <title>Saving System Image Backup to External Hard Drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ghaleus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saving System Image Backup to External Hard Drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create a backup of my laptop that will include all of my programs, files, photos, settings, licenses, etc. The best option seems to be to use the System Image Backup to do so. Do I have to create the backup on a new, blank external hard drive?
 Or can I create the backup on an external hard drive that already has files and things on it? Would doing so cause any problems later on?<br />
<br />
Also, I was told that when creating the system image backup I should also create a Recovery Drive on a separate flash drive. What exactly is the difference? Is it simply that the recovery drive allows you to save a copy of the OS so you can boot into it after
 a crash and then use the System Backup to restore everything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not the most tech savvy person so not sure if this is a very obvious question. I'm just trying to find a way to create a backup of everything in case the worst happens or I need to move all of my stuff to a new laptop but most places I look are either
 really vague or super techy to the point I don't really understand what they're talking about.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Sparky3489,<br />
<br />
You can receive an e‑mail, even from someone you know, with an attached file that is disguised as a document, photo, or program, but is actually a virus. In such cases, Windows Mail automatically blocks known dangerous file types.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If you still believe that those are trusted mails, you may temporarily disable the security software installed on the computer and check if you are able to open the emails.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to enable the security software’s after completing the troubleshooting and identifying the issue so that the computer is protected.<br />
<br />
Refer to the link “<strong>Avoiding Email virus</strong>” <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Avoiding-e-mail-viruses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ms_widi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently bought MS Display Adapter with my Surface 3 and after successfully using it for 3 months it does not work any more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using it with 3 different TVs but the adapter exhibits same issue everywhere i.e. When TV is switched to HDMI port where MS WDA is connected, it tries to start (and I can see MS logo) but nothing happens after three white dots appears. WDA randomly
 pauses at this point and restart itself. It never goes to the point where it shows its name. Nor it gets detected by any WiDi device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The white LED light beside reset button on adapter does glow. I have tried using reset button for 15, 15, 15 secs but that does not work in any combination I perform reset. Before I take it back to MS Store I wanted to find out if anyone else is having the
 same issue and/or if they are able to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks and appreciate your responses in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Thanks Deepak for your reply. I have already gone thru this link and none of the PRPs listed pertains to issue at hand. I forgot to mention that I have three MS WDA and two of them just work fine. Only one is not working. And Yes I have swapped them and
 the issue follows the adapter.

<p><span>I would like to know from anyone who has tried both a comparison of both of these OTA solutions for Xbox One. I do have the HW-150PVR and it has worked moderately well, but I would like to know how the Hauppauge stacks
 up with pros and cons of both units. I may consider switching to the Hauppauge unit if it is a better alternative.</span></p>

<p>Great question, I would like to know as well! &nbsp;</p>
<p>One difference I know of... with the Hauppauge tuner the Xbox allows you to stream TV to your other devices through the Smartglass app. &nbsp;Having a TV in every room though, I'm not sure it's work the $60 to switch for that.</p>
<p>Using the Hauppauge would also open up your HDMI port for other devices.</p>
<p>And if you're like me and always hitting the Play button by accident on the remote, you'll no longer get stuck in time lapse mode on your HomeWorx and having to hit buttons trying to get out :)</p>

<p>I have both. I actually switch because my HomeWorx died. Wouldn't pick up channels anymore. So I got the Hauppauge tuner. It works alot better. It's faster responding. My picture actually looks better. But can't compare because of HomeWorx died. I am happy
 with the purchase </p>

    <title>Unable to create a Windows 10 System Repair Disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pennbear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to create a Windows 10 System Repair Disk</h2>
                    <p>How do I restore or replace the information needed to create a Windows 10 system repair disk for my laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I couldn't create a system image due to insufficient space to create a shadow copy on one or more of my&nbsp;laptop drive volumes.&nbsp; I identified a volume&nbsp;that had 5% of unused space and ran into more difficulties trying to expand the volume.&nbsp; Long long
 story short, I got the system image backup to work, but inadvertently lost my hidden recovery partition, so now I'm not able to create a repair disk DVD/CD.&nbsp;I get a message saying some of the files are missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to restore this partition or obtain a download for a Windows 10 bootable repair disk?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To get back the lost hidden recovery partition, you may restore your PC from a system restore point. Once the lost files are restored, you can then create a repair or recovery disk. Check out the steps in
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Restore from a system restore point</a>. But if you don't want to do a system restore, then you may create a repair or recovery drive on a working PC. Here's the

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response and your possible solution. &nbsp;I believe your recommendation would have worked if I had not deleted my C: drive recovery partition. &nbsp; This prevented me from having the necessary files to do a manufacturer recovery. &nbsp;My next choice
 was to reinstall Windows 10; however, in doing so any restore points were gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up calling the manufacturer and ordering a recovery disk specific to my computer. &nbsp;Fortunately, I keep a backup copy of my personal files, installed software, and was able to restore my computer to factory settings. &nbsp;The downside is having to go
 through all the time consuming updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is that I now have the best plan implemented in creating a system mirror image and backup plan to save all my important drive partitions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>David</p>

    <title>Need Help For Identification of Parent Account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Need Help For Identification of Parent Account</h2>
                    
<p>Okay recently in October, Microsoft released their new Xbox LIVE Terms of Use that needs to be accepted. So I tried, but it asked me to login to my parent account. Now here is the issue:</p>
<p>1) I have no idea what my parent account is at all. I have no clue of the ID whatsoever, let alone the password.</p>
<p>2) I DON'T own a Xbox 360, so there is NO way I am able to identify my parent account using the Xbox 360. I do not know friend with a Xbox 360, nor am I going to buy one just to find out what my parent account is.</p>
<p>An alternative for me would be to transfer my current Gamertag achievements and saves to another email account. But I have no idea how I could do that on a computer. Is anybody able to provide instructions for doing so on a PC? I do NOT own a Xbox 360 so
 people who give me instructions for that is asking for a whack up his/her butt.</p>
<p>If you are thinking of giving me an answer, I would advice you to read me post CAREFULLY again. I absolutely hate it when somebody gives me an answer which I have clearly clarified in my post that it is impossible for me to carry out a particular set of
 instructions. If you are able to provide a decent, working and LOGICAL solution, I shall honour you as a life saviour.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<div>
<p>If you can’t sign in to an Xbox LIVE profile on your console, here are some other ways to find your Microsoft account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://accounts.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">accounts.live.com</a>&nbsp;and try signing in with what you think is your Microsoft account (email address and password). If you can sign in to Windows Live, the email address and password you entered
 are valid. Next, go to<a href="https://live.xbox.com/Account/Signin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox.com</a>&nbsp;and try signing in with this same information. If you’re prompted to create a new gamertag, the Microsoft account you entered is not currently associated with
 an Xbox LIVE account. </li><li>Check your email accounts for messages about your Xbox LIVE Membership (search for messages about “Xbox LIVE” or “Microsoft billing”). This may help you determine which email address is associated with your Xbox LIVE membership (an email address is part
 of your Microsoft account information). </li><li>If you know your Microsoft account but can’t remember your password, try&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">resetting your Microsoft account password</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>If you still can’t find your Microsoft account information, contact Xbox Support using the Assistance information at the bottom of this page. You’ll be asked several questions to confirm your identity before your Microsoft account can be looked up. Please
 have your payment information (such as the credit card associated with your account) handy when you contact Xbox Support.</p>

<p>First of all, I appreciate the prompt reply. I was rather surprised that I could get a reply within hours after I posted my question.</p>
<p>However, I was rather disappointed by the quality of the reply. By reading your post, it is obvious that you did not read my first post carefully. Allow me to show you how illogical your reply is.</p>
<ul>
<li>"<em>If you can’t sign in to an Xbox LIVE profile on your console.....:</em>"
</li></ul>
<p>I clearly stated that&nbsp;"<strong>I DON'T own a Xbox 360</strong>", so that statement of yours proved to be useless and pointless. It serves no purpose whatsoever.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://accounts.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">accounts.live.com</a>&nbsp;and try signing in with what you think is your Microsoft account (email address and password). If you can sign in to Windows Live, the email address and password you entered
 are valid.</em> </li></ul>
<p>This statement is vague and unclear. Which Microsoft account are you referring to, the parent or the child account? If you are talking about the parent account, then you are giving an IMPOSSIBLE solution. I clearly mentioned "<strong>I have no idea what
 my parent account is at all. I have no clue of the ID whatsoever, let alone the password</strong>". So there is&nbsp;<strong>NO&nbsp;</strong>way I can test this at all.</p>
<p>If you are referring to the child account, then you are absolutely retarded. It is obvious that my child account is valid. If not, I would not even be able to sign in to Xbox.com to type this post in the first place.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Next, go to<a href="https://live.xbox.com/Account/Signin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox.com</a>&nbsp;and try signing in with this same information. If you’re prompted to create a new gamertag, the Microsoft account you entered is not currently associated with an
 Xbox LIVE account.</em> </li></ul>
<p>I mentioned something about how I don't mind transferring "<strong>my current Gamertag achievements and saves to another email account</strong>", so it is obvious that my Microsoft account is associated with an Xbox LIVE account or gamertag. Don't you guys
 have any common sense?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Check your email accounts for messages about your Xbox LIVE Membership (search for messages about “Xbox LIVE” or “Microsoft billing”). This may help you determine which email address is associated with your Xbox LIVE membership (an email address is
 part of your Microsoft account information).<br />
</em></li></ul>
<p>At least this statement is logical enough to be accepted, but it is not going to help me. I&nbsp;<strong>DON'T&nbsp;</strong>have any Xbox LIVE membership and have NOT gone through any sort of billing before. So no, there is no way I can find out about my parent account
 from reading the emails.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you know your Microsoft account but can’t remember your password, try&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">resetting your Microsoft account password</a>.<br />
</em></li></ul>
<p>I already mentioned&nbsp;<strong>VERY CLEARLY&nbsp;</strong>that "<strong>I have no idea what my parent account is at all. I have no clue of the ID whatsoever, let alone the password</strong>", so you are giving another retarded suggestion.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you still can’t find your Microsoft account information, contact Xbox Support using the Assistance information at the bottom of this page. You’ll be asked several questions......</em>
</li></ul>
<p><br />
This suggestion has been tried before, but never once is an assistant available for me to seek help from.</p>
<p>Now, before you make a reply, I seek your cooperation to&nbsp;<span><strong>READ THE POST CAREFULLY AGAIN</strong></span>. I have been holding back my temper to avoid using swear words but someone give me the chance again, I would not hesitate to let them slip
 off my tongue. Thank you and I look forward to your reply. Let's hope it is not another piece useless information you are providing.</p>

<strong>1) I have no idea what my parent account is at all. I have no clue of the ID whatsoever, let alone the password:
</strong>Do you know anything about the parental account such as the information such as the address, phone number, full name on the account etc? &nbsp;If so, please contact Xbox Phone Support and tell them you don't remember the Parental Email and they should give
 that to you. &nbsp;Once you get that email, if you have access to that email, simply select the forgot password button. &nbsp;If you don't have access to that email any longer, then please go to http://account.live.com/acsr/ and follow that form once you get the parental
 email.<strong><br />
<br />
An alternative for me would be to transfer my current Gamertag achievements and saves to another email account. But I have no idea how I could do that on a computer. Is anybody able to provide instructions for doing so on a PC? I do NOT own a Xbox 360 so people
 who give me instructions for that is asking for a whack up his/her butt.</strong>&nbsp;I'm not sure how to do this on the PC, but I only know how on the console. &nbsp;You may want to see if Phone Support can help you with that as well, but I don't believe that would
 resolve the issue. &nbsp;If you follow the steps above, that should solve the problem. :)<br />

<p>Hey there Kenozero,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the optimal solution here would be to download your account on to an Xbox console and then when prompted to accept the Terms of Use with the parental account, you would see the associated email address. I know you were expressing you had issues
 locating a console but if you are not able to find access of one through a friend, relative or neighbor, then try giving your local game store a call as they often have consoles connected to Xbox LIVE and are generally willing to help customers with issues
 like these.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are absolutely not able to find a console to use at any of the above mentioned venues, then you can also try giving our phone team a call at this number to try to verify account ownership and receive further assistance that way: 1-800-469-9269<br />
<br />
Let us know if these steps are able to help. Thanks! &nbsp;</p>

Make sure if you've installed the game to an external HDD instead of your console internal storage, that the external HDD with the game on it, is connected to your Xbox One. </p><p>2. Ensure the game or app is up to date, and that it has fully been installed. </p><p>3. Ensure your console has the latest system update.</p><p>4. Restart your console and try again if the above don't work. </p><p>5. If the above don't work, contact Xbox Support, the official support agency Microsoft has delegated. Don't rely and wait for the reply of unofficial non Microsoft employee/support people to make a reply. Xbox Support since I've used it, is great. Although they're not perfect, it is the official support body from Microsoft. And Microsoft has quality control over Xbox Support and standards of what is expected from Xbox Support. Last time I contacted them, they sent me a feedback email for me to rate them on the service. In 2011 I rang them a

            <p>do you have the SET command enabled, if not then there are only a few things that you can do in the recovery console.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>read above, but you have to be able to boot into windows to enable the set commands in the group policy editor.&nbsp; can you boot normally?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>since you can get into the recovery console, run chkdsk c: /r&nbsp;&nbsp; and run over again if any errors are found. run until no errors are found.</p>

            If you are implementing KB307545 in an effort to fix&nbsp; problems like these:<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>
<div>Windows XP could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>
<div>Windows XP could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SOFTWARE<br />
<br />
KB307545 is never, never, never the fist thing to do when you see messages like that.<br />
<br />
The first thing to do is always, always, always run a chkdsk with error correction as the problem is usually that XP just can't find the files due to some corruption in the NT File System (NTFS).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The file system could get corrupted from a power interruption, plug pulling, using the power button, aborted restart or ungrateful shutdown.&nbsp; Have any of those events occurred?<br />
<br />
Until you know that your file system is intact, running any other commands to make directories, copy files, etc. doesn't make sense and is very likely to fail and complain.&nbsp; If things in KB307545 do not go perfectly, you may find yourself in bigger trouble
 and it sounds like you are off to a bad start already :-).<br />
<br />
If the CD you booted on is some kind of recovery CD from the manufacturer and not a genuine bootable XP installation CD, that could also explain why what you are trying to do might not work (the two are not the same).&nbsp; But, as usual, we know next to nothing
 about your system.<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
If your system has SATA drives, <i>none </i>of those Recovery Console commands are going to work for you unless you do some fiddling with your system BIOS and that is too much trouble.<br />
<br />
A good sign that the system has SATA drives will be when you boot into the RC and you end up in the
<b>C:\&gt;</b> folder instead of the&nbsp; <b>C:\WINDOWS&gt;&nbsp;</b> folder where you should be.&nbsp; And, you will see things like 'enumeration' errors for even simple commands like 'dir' or error messages like "Access denied".&nbsp; You will not get much done like that.<br />
<br />
KB307545 has it's place in the world - like if you have modified your registry without making a backup and messed things up so bad that your system will not boot (if you
<i>really </i>corrupted it) - then KB307545 might be a good idea (but there are better ideas), but KB307545 is not the first thing to do for the aforementioned errors.&nbsp; It is also good practice but you better have a plan for what you are going to do if it doesn't
 go smoothly.<br />
<br />
If you did not accidentally corrupt your registry what happened prior to this incident?<br />
<br />
People often start with KB307545 since that is the first thing to come up in a Google or Bing search of the error or when the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" will always start with that (and that is too bad), but I wold never start with that and
 have never used it for this problem and will never suggest it.<br />
<br />
Here is where you <i>should </i>start.<br />
<br />
If you are not sure what you have for bootable media, from a working system, make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD, boot on that into the Mini XP mode and run the chkdsk from there.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install anything from UniBlue or the Ask toolbar (never install the ASK toolbar for anything).<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>cmd</b><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<b>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</b><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
<br />
<br />
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>

            If you know you have SATA drives (as suspected) and you are at the C:\&gt; prompt instead of the C:\WINDOWS\&gt; prompt, I would not count on any commands you type in to work properly.<br />
<br />
Did you make the Hiren's Boot CD and run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; from there?&nbsp; If not, you need to.<br />
<br />
You may need to run it several times and hope that it will be able to correct the problem(s).<br />
