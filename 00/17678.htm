            Hello CTWoods
<br />I would like you to validate before this article.
<br />
<br />There are some recommendations for videos in PowerPoint 2013, PowerPoint 2016, PowerPoint 2016 for Mac: .mp4 files encoded with H.264 video and AAC audio.
<br />
<br />Video and audio file formats supported by PowerPoint
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/video-and-audio-file-formats-supported-in-powerpoint-d8b12450-26db-4c7b-a5c1-593d3418fb59?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/video-...</a> US &amp; ad = US
<br />
<br />
<br />If the slide show is longer than a song, you can add more songs. But if you think you'll have trouble synchronizing the music with the presentation, you can use a third-party audio editing tool like Audacity:registered: to chain the songs into a single file so they play continuously during the presentation.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/are-you-having-video-or-audio-playback-issues-e0a94444-8ea7-4a00-974b-6ad0d6edc4b1?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/are-yo...</a> US &amp; ad = US
<br />
<br />Regards 
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope it works for you

            I believe the linked articles are about using video and audio files to create a slide show. The question appears to be about a video version of the completed slide show.

            <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a re-post has the problem remains as is.&nbsp;<span>I have reviewed previous replies to my first post and actioned the following:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have checked for updates - all good</li><li>I have actioned an online repair of MS Office 365</li></ul>
<p>and still, I have the same problem</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I have created a PPT (office 365) with added voice files (not narration).</li><li>I then converted the file to mp4 video. Saving as an mp4 and also exported as video including timings options</li><li>The sides are advancing before the voice has finished.</li><li>Tried setting the timing to finish just after the voice timing. [still had overlapping]&nbsp;</li><li>It is only happening after the 2nd slide. 1st slide has an embedded video but moves correctly to slide 2</li><li>Nothing different in the settings on all slides. all settings&nbsp;are the same except the timing [see below]</li><li>No fancy animations nor transitions</li></ol>
<p>I have converted ppt files hundreds of times but in PPT 2013 - it seems to only be an issue in Office 365. Previous actions&nbsp;were: simply insert the audio - trim - save - then save as Video MP4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just don't understand this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help is much needed...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my google drive is both the PPT and the video if you wish to look at them... thanks again</p>

<h2>            Nokia C6 as modem</h2>
                    
<p><font>Hi,</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>I have connected my C6-00 to my PC using Ovi Suite. But I couldn't connect to internet by keeping C6 as modem. The 'connect to internet' menu is disabled in the Ovi suit. But I can do all other operations like media transfer, synchronise data
 etc with my PC using C6-00. </font></p>
<p><font>Is there any setting needs to be changed to achieve this? Please note I can surf the net through mobile and also could able to connect to the internet if using the
<strong>'Connect to net</strong>' option installed from <strong>C7.</strong></font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Thanks</font></p>

<p>@kuttan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not an expert.. try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Hope the SIM card you used in C7 and C6-00 is the same. This is to confirm that GRPS service is activated in the SIM by the service provider</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. My guess is that OVI suite recognises if the GPRS is available on your phone.</p>
<p>In your phone, activate by:</p>
<p>Applications&gt;Tools&gt;Sett. Wizard &gt; Operator&gt; press Start to define automatic settings for using Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>and one more thing, in OVI suite check for the following setting:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools &gt; Options &gt; Connect to Internet &gt; Choose either "use this network operator" - give correct country and operator name (or) "use manual setting" - choose correct gprs setting...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it could be possible that your Mobile phone service provider is XXXX and the network operator chosen in OVI is YYYYY...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

    <title>Error message&#58; 452 Too many recipients - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angela emuss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error message&#58; 452 Too many recipients</h2>
                    <p>I have read a lot of the responses. My problem is similar in that I tried to send one email to around 30 or 40 recipients, advising my friends my sister was going to be on the television.&nbsp; I keep getting the 452 error message about too many recipients, even
 though I have sent a similar message to many people in the past.&nbsp; I now cannot sent an email to anyone, other than via my web based BT account and not via Outlook, which is very inconvenient.&nbsp; The "system" keeps trying to send, over and over again, but with
 the same message coming up all the time.&nbsp; I can still receive incoming mail, but cannot respond to them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One respondent suggested deleting the Outlook profile and reinstating it - does that involve actually deleting the email account altogether and then re-entering the account details?&nbsp; And if I do that, will I lose all my contacts and "filed" emails under
 my inbox?&nbsp; I use Windows 7 and Outlook 2010 - but I don't really understand the significance of that - as you can see, I am very teccie blind!! Any help out there would be most appreciated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I did notice, under the "account settings" that there was a "repair" button, and I wondered what would happen if I clicked on that?&nbsp; Does another window open, or does it go and "do" something automatically, over which I would have no control and perhaps
 delete everything?&nbsp; Grrrrrrrrrr... very frustrating! </p>

            <p>Hello Angela,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'd like to clarify that Error message: 452 is not from Outlook but is from your ISP or corporate mail administrator. For a more in-depth explanation regarding the errors and on how to resolve this, check out this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_other/452-too-many-recipients-received-this-hour/0c3afa04-d283-4e81-bafa-5b7afdd8e714">
thread</a> answered by Shashirekha.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd also like to clarify that when you remove a profile in Outlook 2013, it does not remove the data that is tied to the email account. You can try this option if the resolution from the thread we've given you doesn't work. For instructions on how to remove
 a profile in Outlook, see the link below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, the "<strong>Repair</strong>" under "Account settings" lets you diagnose and fix any

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remotely executing Powershell scripts</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have a exchange setup as below:</p>
<p>Server A (AD, Exchange Management tools)</p>
<p>Server B (Exchange Server, Exchange Management tools )</p>

<p>on Server A I launched Exchange console and I am directly calling cmdlts such as "get-mailbox" without explicitly establishing connection to server B.</p>
<p>Now I want to write a powershell script to execute commands remotely so should we explicitly establish connection with remote server?</p>
<p>Ex:</p>
<div>
<div><code>$session</code>
<code>= </code><code>New-PSSession</code>
<code>-computername</code> <code>
hostname</code> <code>-credential</code> <code>
$cred</code></div>

<div>Or as mentioned above could I directly call those commands in the script ?</div>

<div>please suggest.</div>

<div>Thanks and Regards,</div>
<div>Mahesh</div>

<p>Thanks and Regards,</p>

<p>Hello D. van den Beld,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post in the forum. First, I want to know if you are using Teams desktop client or
<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Teams web application</a>? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is Teams web application, please try other browsers(like Edge or IE) to see if there is any difference. If it is Teams desktop client, please make sure that it is updated to the latest version. Meanwhile, you can create a new project
 to see if you can add it in Teams. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists after you have tried all the methods above, please capture a screenshot for this problem for further check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<h2>            HP LaserJet 1018 printing too light</h2>
                    <p>Hello again Suzanne. I hope you don't mind me asking you this question and you may not be able to answer me, but i'm comfortable with you now because you were so helpful to me with my previous issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I have two computers, one with word XP and the other word 7. I unhooked my printer from my older pc (XP) and hooked it up to the newer one, but when i went to print my document (court transcripts) it's printing in grey. I know i have enough toner
 because i printed some stuff earlier today on the older pc, plus I bought my ink cartridge not long ago and it prints up to 2000 pages. It's an HP laserjet 1018. I went through the troubleshooting steps on the printer site, but still prints in grey. Do you
 have any ideas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you again in advance, Suzanne.</p>

            <p>I have a HP laser jet 1018 and i printed a document but it came out with grey print. I know i have enough toner because i have two computers and I had this printed hooked up with my other pc and i printed a few documents and it prints fine in black. But
 now i connected it to this one which is ms word 7, my other one was XP. But when i save my documents on this ms word 7 i always save my documents in 2003 version. Anyways, i've gone through all the steps of the troubleshooter on the printer site, but still
 printing in grey. Can someone help please? &nbsp;Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>I'm going to split this off as a new question since it really isn't related to this thread. I'm guessing that you mean that the old computer has Windows (not Word) XP and the new one Windows 7. When you connected the printer to the Windows 7 system, did
 you download a new driver from the HP website? Windows 7 will need a different driver from Windows XP.&nbsp;See
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=4063&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=1814094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page </a>for the appropriate driver. </p>

            <p>Hi again suzanne, i downloaded the drivers from HP and it printed a test page and it looked fine. The print was black not grey, but then when i printed my document it came out grey... strange. So i opened up notepad and just typed a few words on there and
 printed black. Then i opened another transcript that i typed a month ago and printed one page of it and it printed grey. So are my word document files corrupt? I don't get it.</p>

            It doesn't seem likely that any of Word's settings have changed, but look at
<strong>Office Button | Word Options | Advanced: Print</strong> and make sure that "Use draft quality" isn't checked. You could also check the printer Properties to make sure that nothing bizarre is selected, though this isn't likely, either, since Word uses
 the default printer settings, and they would affect everything. What font are you using?

            <p>I just printed another test page and it's in black. I printed something off the internet and it's in black. I went back into notepad and it printed in black. I printed a page from another transcript and it printed grey. It seems it's only my word documents
 that are coming out in grey. So it has to be something that's set in word that's making it come out grey. Also, I hooked it up to my older pc and printed a page and it printed in black. This really has me stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you're wondering why i just don't print my document on my old pc it's because I have something that's not right there as well. When i print a large document like a 200-page transcript it misses printing some pages, stops in the middle of printing
 for long periods of time. Sometimes it'll print 30 pages then stops and won't start again for 10-15 minutes.. etc. So I can't trust that pc to do my transcripts. Too risky. That's why i bought a newer one.</p>

            In the Font dialog (<strong>Ctrl+D</strong>) set the font color to Automatic. If it's already set to Automatic, you could try setting it to Black. You can also do this using the
<strong>Font Color</strong> flyout palette in the <strong>Font</strong> group on the
<strong>Home</strong> tab.

            The application needs to get its initial lock again and also to download the maps if you don't have a memory card - all this will take time unless you enable the Assisted GPS option :)

                    I've just upgraded. When I used to send messages, the outbox containing those messages would appear in the bottom left, so if I was quick enough, I could still stop or change a sent message - this doesn't seem to be the case anymore, surely that's not
 right is it?

<h2>            office 365 click to run</h2>
                    <p>Hello I’ve installed Microsoft Office 2013 x64 via the Office 365 subscription and just realised that I have a new service “Microsoft Office Click-To-Run” which is still consuming 25mb memory even when not open.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to remove this service as I prefer the standard installation? Also why is it still running when I completed the installation last week?
<br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hello <span>awalker-mdb</span>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for Posting on the forum,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately zip files are not supported on the windows Phone 8. You would need to unzip them on the Pc and then sync them over.

<h2>            X3-02&#58; USB device not supported</h2>
                    
<p>I bought this phone 5 months back. I had detected the problems it was giving me, from the start itself. It had a problem with the display. It used to go blink away, all by its own or even restart. Recently, the problem had aggravated and there was some other
 proble. This used to happen whenever I connected my uSB device to my cell and m pc. My wouldn't detect it and the msg would appear on the cell's screen reading, "<strong>Unsupported USB device. Please Disconnect It</strong>".<br />
I went to Nokia Care. After 8 days of service I got my cell back with software upgraded and the problems taken car of. After almost less than a week the message of 'UNSUPPORTED DEVICE' has started to appear on the screen, which means there's certainly a problem
 with the device itself (I may be wrong).:smileyindifferent:</p>
<p>I would be really thankful if anyone gave me a suggestion, which i haven't tried out yet.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Recover an old email address from early 2000&#8217;s</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i’m trying to access my old account from a very long time ago. This would be the 4th/5th time i’ve tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i try use the auto recovery method I just get a email message back saying unfortunately not enough information was given and that the account is blocked to protect it. I cant remember every last detail of my account. I know the account was linked to
 an old xbox 360 gamertag which I included and i know it’s about 10 years old. I cant give any bank details because the cards wouldnhave been expired and thrown away etc. I’m still living at the same address as I did when I used it. I’m just running iut of
 options of recovering my old account. I know ive got old memories on there that I would love to get back to but its seeming an impossoble task. Any help please? Thanks</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account&#58; excessive asking for verification</h2>
                    Whenever I try to select my Microsoft Account's Security or Privacy options (to clear search and browsing history) , the system asks to verify my email address and use a code sent to an email before letting me access those options. The thing is, it just
 started this past week. The system never asked me for verification before. Why is it happening now? Is there a way to bypass the whole process? It's incredibly annoying. Even selecting the option to
<em>"Don't ask again for this device"</em> doesn't prevent it

<p>I am using Windows 10 Version 1709 (OS Build 16299.192) and Microsoft Edge. I was also already logged in when the system asked for verification. As for using the browser option to clear data, that only clears data from my browser and device but not the data
 associated with my Microsoft Account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I think you're missing the point. I have a problem with the whole verification system. It's ridiculous that I have to do a verification just to access options while I am already logged in my account. It gets really old fast since I login almost everyday.

<h2>            Excel Forecast sheet option not given&#47;shown on data tab in version 15.13.1</h2>
                    <p>I have selected data in a row of the spreadsheet - each cell has a different year's data showing from left to right. If &nbsp;I understand correctly toolbar options are context based and only show options available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what data I select the Forecast Sheet option on the Data tab does not show on the toolbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The functionality is an awesome feature if I could only figure out how to get to it! Losing my mind over this!<br />

            <p>I am using Excel 2016 for Mac - Sorry for not getting that in the title. I am not seeing the Forecast Sheet button on the data tab as described below:</p>
<p>
New forecasting capabilities
</p><p style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">
We also revamped the forecasting capabilities provided in Excel 2016. In previous versions, only linear forecasting had been available. In Excel 2016, the FORECAST function has been extended to allow forecasting based on Exponential Smoothing (i.e.&nbsp;<span>FORECAST.ETS()</span>&nbsp;…).
 This functionality is also available as a new one-click forecasting button. On the Data tab, click the&nbsp;<span>Forecast
 Sheet</span>button to quickly create a forecast visualization of your data series. From the wizard, you can also find options to adjust common forecast parameters, like seasonality, which is automatically detected by default and confidence intervals.</p>

            No you can't get 14267 again. You will get the next upgrade after it however. That is the message I got when I reverted. This is a good thing since the problems with 14267 have not been fixed yet. MS will fix it and issue a new update.

<h3> z_920  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need for Favorite Collections in Maps App</h2>
                    <p>The offline maps capability of Windows Phone was what first attracted me to the platform, and I am glad to see that Microsoft is still taking the app seriously.&nbsp; Having a single, universal app for phone and desktop seems like a great thing.&nbsp; However, there
 is one area in which MS still falls far short of the Nokia Here app, especially if the universal app results in increased usage.&nbsp; I have suggested more than once, using the old app's feedback option, that MS needs to implement something like Here's "Collections"
 feature, which lets you sort your favorites into groups.&nbsp; A simple "favorites list," as referenced in today's press announcement, is inadequate for heavy use.&nbsp; It's great to be able to sit at my desk, and store maps and ideas for my upcoming vacation.&nbsp; But
 I don't need to see that stuff when I'm driving around my home town.&nbsp; Especially if you're driving, you don't want to have to mess around with a long list.&nbsp; For safety's sake, you'll choose something with a more convenient interface.&nbsp; I'm still using my Tom
 Tom.</p>

    <title>How to show I am a BCC recipient in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mplb  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to show I am a BCC recipient in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    Is there a way that I can easily (at a glance) show that I am a BCC recipient on a message when I open it or from the Inbox list of messages?<br />
<br />
Currently if I open a received message that I am BCC'd on I don't see my name on the recipient list (To: &amp; CC:) which gives me the hint that I was BCC'd. However, is there a way that I can display the BCC line in the email with my name next to it or make it
 blatantly obvious that I was BCC'd?<br />
<br />
I thought that by having the senders switch on the Show BCC Field in their mailboxes that it would somehow show the BCC line in the recipients mailbox but it doesn't seem to work like that.<br />
<br />
Is there a solution to this to help prevent Replying to All when I shouldn't be doing so?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            Hi Roady<br />
<br />
Thanks for the useful link. It works well when I'm BCC'd on a message from another internal Exchange user but not from an external source (ie. my Gmail.com mailbox).<br />
<br />
I've looked at the Internet headers of the message received at I see the line:<br />
<br />
BCC: &lt;<i>myemailaddress</i>@<i>mydomain.com</i>&gt;<br />
<br />
But the Outlook client rule doesn't seem to recognize this as not being in the To or CC fields as per the rules exceptions.<br />
<br />
Any ideas why it doesn't work for external emails?<br />
<br />
<br />
        </p>

            <p>I can't reproduce that issue here. I've just sent a test message from my Gmail account to my Exchange account and the rule was executed as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BCC line shouldn't be exposed in an Internet header of a message either. Is your company perhaps adding additional message headers via their mail hub or security software? They really shouldn't but in that case you can also take advantage of it by creating
 a&nbsp;additional rule which looks at the message header for that line.</p>

<p>This reply missed the point of the question which I felt was articulated clearly.&nbsp; I thank the author of the original question and I hope that someone who understands the question will respond because I have the very same issue.&nbsp; In short, I need to know
 when I (not others) are on the bcc line.&nbsp; Especially when receiving emails that have a lot of TO and CC recipients, it is not convenient to have to deduce that I was bcc'd but searching for my email address in the TO and CC lines to determine that I "must
 be" on the bcc line.&nbsp; Another option that should be added to outlook that is in other high quality mail clients is a option to prevent REPLY ALL if you are on the bcc line or to WARN you that you are replying to an email that you were blinded on.&nbsp; For anyone
 who has been in business for any length of time, you will understand perfectly why this feature is absolutely important.&nbsp; It is not a trivial or uninformed request.</p>

<p>That you don´t like the answers doesn´t mean we don´t understand the question :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook has no option to display that you´re on the BCC line. </p>
<p>
</p><p>With a macro you as the sender could add a line to the email that users are not allowed to ReplyAll at all. However, that would apply to all recipients, not only the BCC ones, and it works only for those recipients who also use Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can add your wishes at https://outlook.uservoice.com/, and wait whether or not it will be added. Another option is to use the Addin mentioned in my previous reply which does exactly what you´re looking for.</p>

 fiber casing and high quality screen protectors. Unfortunately as I am a active person, the screen shattered on the right side as I was playing basketball. I did not hit anything extremely hard on my watches surface, but it did hit things. My concern or suggestion
 is that they make a more durable watch next time. Keep the software, up the durability. I have heard that it uses gorilla glass, but I don't know if I believe that because if how easily it shattered.</p>
<p>once again please make a more durable watch, that way it can be worn without worry. Another problem was there were no shatterproof glass protectors and no more insurance on it.</p>
<p>well if anyone agrees please respond, I just wanted to make a suggestion to Microsoft.</p>

<p>I have a entry for with 3 combo boxes that have block rows at the top of the dropdown list.&nbsp; I once had the information on how to eliminate these, but, can't seem to find it, nor remember how to get rid of the blank rows.</p>
<p>I would truly appreciate it if someone would please remind me how to to do that.</p>

<p>Hi Tom, thank you for your reply. I have made sure that there are no blank rows.&nbsp; The Combo boxes are bound to respective queries and there are no blank rows in the queries or the tables the queries are based on.</p>
<p>I have made sure all the 'Blanks' check boxes in the queries are unchecked. Some of the combo boxes don't have the blank row, others do, and I can't figure out what where the difference is, as I have checked them all and the information settings appear to
 all be the same, but, obviously, something in a couple of them is odd somewhere.</p>

<p>When you open a query in datasheet view at the top of each field there is a down arrow, and when you check the down arrow there is a list of the fields and each one has a check box.&nbsp; The seond one down from the top is the word Blanks. So, I unchecked that
 box on each of the queries and saved them.&nbsp; As i could not remember what you needed to do to keep the blank row from displaying at the top of the dropdown list in the combo box, I did this just to make sure I had covered all the bases that I could think of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br />
Can you post the query for the dropdown?</p>

<p>'k...here is the SQL for the query for one of the boxes that has the blank row:<br />
SELECT DISTINCT tblPW.AccountNo<br />
FROM tblPW;</p>
<p>Here is the SQL for the query for one of the boxes that does not have the blank row:<br />
SELECT DISTINCT tblPW.CoName<br />
FROM tblPW;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br />

<p>Just once, earlier to see if the C&amp;R would resolve the issue making sure all the 'Blanks' boxes were unchecked in the queries.</p>

<p><br />

<p>There is only one column in the query, and the Count is set to 1</p>

<p>Also..when I click on the combo box for that related entry on the filter form, the same blank row is at the top of the list.&nbsp; I have tried the Can Shrink to yes on that one as well, and it does not remove the blank row. The other two combo boxes on that

<p>I think I have found the cause of the blank rows in some of the dropdowns. While reviewing the tables earlier today it dawned on me that there were some rows in fields that had nothing in them, as there is no data to enter in that field for some products.&nbsp;
 These are the fields that are displaying the blank rows in the dropdowns.</p>
<p>I am wondering if there is a setting or some way to ignore blank rows in the query or control for that field so that the blank rows won't show in the dropdown list?&nbsp; Or perhaps put them at the bottom of the list?</p>

I have a entry for with 3 combo boxes that have block rows at the top of the dropdown list. I once had the information on how to eliminate these, but, can't seem to find it, nor remember how to get rid of the blank rows.<br />

<p>For any who may be interested, the following SQL for the query related to the blank row has eliminated the blank row in the combo dropdown list:<br />
SELECT DISTINCT tblPW.AccountNo<br />

<div>Great that you fixed it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But IMHO you fixed it the wrong way. I wrote in first instance:</div>
<div>"inspect the underlying data and delete the blank rows. Then make that</div>
<div>field Required in Table Design so it can't happen again."</div>
<div>You replied: " I have made sure that there are no blank rows"</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We now know that's not completely accurate: at least one row was blank</div>
<div>and with the where-clause of "where AccountNo is not null" you</div>
<div>eliminate that row.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you were banking on AccountNo not to be blank, it should be a</div>
<div>required field. So far you didn't set the Required property to True. I</div>
<div>would recommend that you fix up or delete the existing record(s) that</div>
<div>have AccountNo as null, and then set it to required. Then take out the</div>
<div>Where-clause from the query because it is no longer needed.</div>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s the exact Skype version that you’re using? Skype has 3 different versions on Windows 10 and each of them has a different user interface.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is this happening to all of your Skype contacts?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to your response.

            I actually have no idea.&nbsp; Whatever came preloaded on the computer but I doubt it's program specific as it also doesn't show his messages on my iphone app or the web version.&nbsp; My messages appear instantaneously on each of the platforms when I type a message
 on one platforms but his don't show up at all.
