<h3> xharvey price o  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battlefield 4 Premium problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I just purchased Battlefield 4 premium for my xbox one, but every time I go onto the server browser to play the new maps I just bought, it tells me to buy Premium. If I click it a message appears saying 'you already own this. You can find it in your
 games and apps collection.'&nbsp;</p>

<p>Someone please help, this is very frustrating. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>If you purchased the full premium you will still need to individually download each map pack when it prompts you, you won't have to pay for it again, but this seems to be the only way to install it. DICE didn't give much notice on that one....</p>

            I have had this same issue ever since Windows10 did an update. I have done everything possible to correct this. This is a problem that needs to be fixed! It interferes with remote repairs and updates.

<p>I have had the same problem since the latest (fall of 2017) update of Windows 10. It appears that it is one of those many settings that get reset (incorrectly) whenever Microsoft deems we're getting too comfortable with our OS ;)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The setting is in the old Control Panel in a part that hasn't made it yet to the new look. I managed to fix it by selecting the Windows 10 button in the lower left-hand side, then;
</p>
<ul>

<h2>            Event Viewer Reporting Account Logon</h2>
                    
<p>Why would Event Viewer report an account logged on when I am the only user and the computer was idle?</p>
<p>The activity occured at around 9:00 pm and the computer has beeen idle for more than 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I thought the only logon would be when Windows starts:</p>
<p>Audit Services</p>

<p>Special privileges assigned to new logon.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi JamesJoey,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Volume shadow copy service is associated with backups. You can check if you had a backup scheduled at that particular
 time.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Also it is not possible for the computer to show login information unless someone logged in at that particular time.
 I would suggest you to provide us some more information from the log file to assist you better.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,<br />

<p><strong><span>Hi,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>In the event viewer you can just right click the event category under the windows logs option like the system, application

<p>This is a database trying to login so it can run itself, I don't let it, any service you install has a login setting, if it is not one of those, you look for suspect id's trying to logon....typically guest, but that can just be an xp pc trying to login on
 a network to get to the shares ( not your issue)....if it is an id like admin or guest and it's getting in, try some of the online scans, dl and install microsoft security essentials, clamwin as a weekly scanner , or which ever antivirus you like. Thats just
 to be safe, the ms backup that seems to run on it's own in win7 may want to login as admin as well, that would showup especially if you've never set the password, note: on home version or depending on versions you may not have a visable admin acct.</p>

<p>You'll get lots of those, it just means you have the logon events being tracked, thats a local security policy setting, I personnally turn it on with xp but it looks like it's already turned on in win7.</p>
<p>the nt auth logon is usually your services starting up or changing, thats normal, you want to look for guest acct success or failures, those mean another pc is trying to access you, also watch for odd number acct names trying to logon, some sql installs,
 the service trys to do it that way, like simply acct connection mgr. But if your not running sql then their realy suspect.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft family and gmail</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded to Windows 10 and started using the Microsoft Family account settings.</p>
<p>My children's accounts will not allow access to gmail.</p>
<p>My children use gmail for school but I can't find any way to allow them access to it.</p>
<p>I can access all our gmail accounts from the adult users on our PC so it has something to do with the child access.</p>
<p>How can I get gmail to work on the child accounts?</p>

            <p>Child is trying to access Gmail and Drive using either IE or Edge. What happens is that after password is entered, Gmail page reverts to the login screen without any error messages.&nbsp; Everything works fine under Chrome, but that defies the purpose, as&nbsp;parents
 can not control browsing there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is also described here (https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3y6ppe/microsoft_child_account_cannot_login_at_gmailcom/?sort=old) - but solution is not satisfactory.</p>

            I have 2 kids in my family, both have the same problem. Moreover, I have 2 computers with Windows10 and neither of them works with Gmail in a&nbsp;child account.&nbsp;All four accounts were converted to Microsoft account from regular (non-admin) local&nbsp;computer accounts.&nbsp;But
 I will try to re-create one of them again as per steps above. Even if it works, it's not the ideal solution, as accounts are customized, they will loose all the settings.&nbsp;

    <title>Left Side of my Laptop Screen Noticeably Darker than the Right&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Left Side of my Laptop Screen Noticeably Darker than the Right&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Okay, now I have a strange problem going on here.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A few weeks ago, I noticed that 90% of the left side of my screen is noticeably darker than the right. This problem came out right after all of the dead pixels (black pixels) disappeared from my screen, after months of them being there. The right side
 is still at the normal brightness level, but the left side seems to have this big blotch coming straight down from top to bottom, making everything over it noticeably darker. Also, whenever I put pressure on my screen, when the laptop is on (like when I have
 to adjust it), the edges of the blotch seem to be compressed the most, like if someone was pressing there finger against the screen, thus causing that dark, wavy, circle to form for a few moments before fading away.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem is really irritating, despite the fact I've gotten used to it. It's most noticeable when viewed against a white background (like this website) and it's pretty irritating.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any reason this is happening? Is there anyway to fix it? This problem is on an HP Pavilion dv5000</div>
                </div>

            Hey Chucker9,
<div><br />
<div>It seems what may be the issue is Windows has lost the file association to .zip files. Try these steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Find a zip file.</p>
<p>Right click the file and choose "Open With". If a sub-menu appears, please click "Choose Default Program…"</p>
<p>Click "Browse…" button. Browse to "C:\Windows" folder.</p>
<p>Find the file "explorer.exe" (it sometimes will show as "explorer") and click "Open".</p>
<p>Make "Always use the selected program to open this kind of file" selected and click "OK"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That should re associate the .zip association for your computer.</p>
<p>Let the community know the status after you have had time to give it a try. Thanks!</p>

I have the following system :&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>CPU : </strong>Intel Core i7 2600K&nbsp;<br />

<strong>CPU: </strong>Gigabyte GeForce GTX 570 1280MB Windforce&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Optic unit :</strong> Optiarc AD-7280S SATA<br />
<br />
The Intel 530 SSD is bought for about 2 weeks ago.<br />
<br />
When lookin in Windows 8.1 &gt; Eventlog &gt; System I find alot of these warnings :&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>

The source is disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im not running any raid<br />
<br />
Yesterday, the computer would not restart(just standig at Restarting...), I hade to power off/on and when I got the Windows alot of programs have lost there settings(accounts and settings).<br />
<br />
According to the Intel Toolbox the Intel 530 is just fine and the extended diagnostics says success.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the latest BIOS and Intel rapid storage but the events is still poping up in evenlog?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Where does these problems come from and how do I solve them?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something's not right... you have seven drives and only two ATA Channels...</p>
<p>My machine has a Intel and ASMedia controller with EIGHT channels... 6 Intel and 2 ASMedia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not an expert in RAID, but I think that each of your controllers has it's own settings for RAID\AHCI\IDE...</p>
<p>I'm also not sure where you are seeing Disk 0 and Disk 1 and etc., but that might indicate RAID....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that they are saying "Standard" instead of Marvel and JMicron tells me that they don't have the correct drivers...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a problem similar to this previously with a JMicron controller on a Gigabyte motherboard....</p>
<p>Gigabyte changed the name of the chip to GB286 from the actual name JM286... just as an example... not the actual numbers...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, I had some issues... Somewhere along the line I found actual JMicron drivers for the chip, and the problems went away... The chip was also renamed to JM286...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try checking with Marvel and JMicron to see what they have available.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not an expert on Error Logs, but the first three on the list concern a USB Device "Flash_HS-COMBO"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might check out this link for the <strong>Kernel-Pnp</strong><strong>(warning)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/drivers/268212-driver-driver-wudfrd-failed-load-device-error.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/drivers/268212-driver-driver-wudfrd-failed-load-device-error.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>One error is a network connection, unrelated to your Hard Drives... unless you maybe have a network drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only actual disk error, unless you have a USB Hard Drive hooked up, is for Hard Disk 9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to Device Manager... Disk Drives, and select Properties... Volumes... Populate, it will list the drives Disk Number... at least you may find which one has the issue for sure...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may or may not be your SSD.</p>

            <p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did install a special driver for the USB from ASUS that I never done before, maybe this driver was not that good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled Windows 8 and avoided the USB and the Chip drivers from ASUS. I have had one disk error but that was for a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a USB drive hooked up, next time I get a disk problem I will check in the DeviceManager what drive it really is.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have done that, I do however still get some errors. I can see that it comes from the USB and from one of the new Western Digital 3TB discs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I supose that the USB errors is not that important but the large new disc errrors is not good.</p>

<h2>            Fallout 4 Animations&#47;Notifications Bug</h2>
                    
<p><span>I'll start by saying my game IS modded BUT I don't have any mods that should cause this problem. One of the problems I have is whenever I kill an enemy with a lazer weapon, instead of disintegrating like normal, there is a delay for about 10 seconds,
 then they disintegrate with both a pile of ashes AND their original body as separate objects. Another problem is that when the notification for water or food or whatever appears and I counter the effect, it takes anywhere between 20-60 seconds to take effect.
 There are more but I'll just leave it at this for now. Any help is appreciated</span></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The first thing I would advise doing is to hard reset the console by going into setting on the left and selecting restart console.</p>
<p>Second thing to try is to turn off all mods running and see if the problem carries on.</p>
<p>If these items do not fix your issue I would next try and uninstall an re install the game.</p>

            Hello lb22,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
If you have Office 2003 or Office 2007, the Microsoft Office Document Scanning does have the option to scan multiple pages into a single file.<br />
<br />
See the path below from the Help File: <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>On the Windows <strong>Start</strong> menu, point to <strong>
All Programs</strong> (<strong>Programs</strong> in Windows 2000), point to
<strong>Microsoft Office</strong>, point to <strong>Microsoft Office Tools</strong>, and then click
<strong>Microsoft Office Document Scanning</strong>. </li></ul>
<p>The scanning component allows you to scan documents and make them available on your computer by using any installed scanner. This component provides scanning presets that control your scanner by using settings that are optimized for specific purposes. For
 example, the <strong>Black and white</strong> scanning preset will give you the best OCR results when scanning pages of text, while the
<strong>Color</strong> scanning preset is best for scanning full-color pictures or artwork. OCR is automatically performed on text documents immediately after scanning, and you can easily scan multiple pages into a single file.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,</p>

<h2>            faulty email recognition that has prevented me from using xboxlive features...</h2>
                    
<p>ok so when i first set up my xbox live account my mom decided it would be cool to do some sort of parental block thing where i couldnt access certain things on xbox live. and when she set up the parental restrictions she typed in her email as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 "YAHO" it clearly says yaho which is obviously a typo and because of us not being able to change it to yahoo because it saves yaho into the account forever i am not able to access alot on xbl. BUT WAIT THERES MORE. with this "amazing" new update it forces
 me to use that un changeable yaho account to even access xbox live AT ALL. so heres the thing. i would LOVE it if i were able to just take off that stupid parental block whatever that is making me have a $300 paper weight rather than actually being able to
 enjoy it. is there any way this is possible?</p>

<p><b>Bottom line up front</b><span>: I am in search of the settings that provide the best online experience specifically for Advanced Warfare (single xbox setup). I.E. provide the&nbsp;</span><i>lowest latency</i><span>&nbsp;experience.</span><br />
<br />
<span>No I am not having any significant issues and yes I have the latest firmware. And I have the xbox setup with a reserved IP address (Static IP). I connect with a wired connection using CAT 6 Cables from modem to router and router to xbox. I have Home Telecom
<span>No I am not having any significant issues and yes I have the latest firmware. And I have the xbox setup with a reserved IP address (Static IP). I connect with a wired connection using CAT 6 Cables from modem to router and router to xbox. I have Home Telecom
 for ISP from Moncks Corner SC, I have cable internet 50 mbps down and 10 mbps up.</span><br />
<br />
<b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Things I wish to address/ ask questions about:</span></b><br />
<br />
<b>Question #1</b><span>: UPnP, Port forwarding, or DMZ? I can get an open NAT with any of these but which one will provide the lowest latency?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Question #2</b><span>: Firewall, what are the best settings for xbox live? And if DMZ is used do these settings even matter?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Question #3</b><span>: MTU some claim this makes a difference I have played with it but can't tell for sure if it affected latency. Will it improve latency to change the MTU to something lower than the default 1500?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Question #4</b><span>&nbsp;(Big Question): QoS, First of all the 2 besides the upstream. Wireless WMM, enable or dis enable? Downstream, I notice a custom rule can be setup to the xbox's MAC address, would this help or make latency worse? And finally, the upstream
 QoS, enable obviously....</span><br />
<br />
<span>Click Qos priority rule list; setup QoS rule and it shows the current rules and allows more to be created. By default xbox applications is only set to high while Skype and other useless things to me are set as highest. I deleted all rules except Netgear

 EVA and the xbox one, I changed xbox priority to highest and Netgear EVA to high.</span><br />
<br />
<span>So to sum up Question #4: did i do more damage than good or is there an even better setup for this? I noticed I can setup custom rules and even just setup rules for the LAN port or MAC address, would either of those be better options?</span><br />

<br />
<b>Question #5</b><span>: I know when setting up most QoS you have to put in your bandwidth and it must be something lower than your actual or else it all falls apart. (I.E. i get 10 mbps upstream, when I enter my upstream bandwidth in the router I must put
 something lower than what I actually get. Speed test vary from about 8 to 9 mbps, therefore i must put a value into the router no more than 8) When I click the button for speed test it auto puts in about 9.66 mbps. but i know sometimes i get less than that
 from my isp especially during peak times. So I conservatively set the upstream in the router to 8, does anybody see a problem with this or know why this QoS system would be different from others?</span><br />
<span>Recap: Upstream bandwidth actual vs. value place in router.</span><br />

<br />
<b>Question #6</b><span>: Will turning off the wireless radios improve the wired connection latency or stability? and if so, would using a second router as an access point to handle the wireless side be a good option?</span><br />
<br />
<b>Question #7</b><span>&nbsp;(Last one): DNS servers. I can change them on the xbox itself, would it make any difference for the xbox if;</span><br />
<span>I let the xbox get DNS automatically and changed the router's DNS to google's (8.8.8.8),&nbsp;</span><br />

<span>Okay, so a lot of questions, I am not here to argue about the placeable effect and yes I understand that lag cannot be completely gotten rid of and it depends on many factors. The defaults work just fine but I have been playing Call of Duty for many years
<span>Okay, so a lot of questions, I am not here to argue about the placeable effect and yes I understand that lag cannot be completely gotten rid of and it depends on many factors. The defaults work just fine but I have been playing Call of Duty for many years
 now with multiple ISP's and many different routers and setups I have learned that tweaking a setup just right gives people with no skill (like me) a nice advantage in most games. And if you combine the right setup with actual skill, well....You have all seen
 that person that is impossible to kill and you swear is hacking so you report them, but guess what they were not hacking. I know because I had a good setup once with verizon Fios and i was accused of cheating all the time. Unfortunately I cannot get Fiber
 optic internet where I live now.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Also, with everything I have tried so far, the Nighthawk is by far the best router I have ever used and I have already improved my average K/D after owning it for only a few days now.</span></p>

<p>To clear things up, this is what I have done so far and gotten good results with this router. (But I want to make it the best it can be so if you know how to answer any of these questions please explain)</p>
<p>under advanced settings; WAN settings; </p>
<p>Disable port scan and dos protection checked</p>
<p>Default DMZ checked and my xbox's static ip address entered </p>
<p>Respond to ping on internet port and Disable IGMP parodying both unchecked</p>
<p>MTU default 1500</p>
<p>Disable SIP ALG checked then to the right open selected</p>
<p>Advanced settings; LAN setup:</p>
<p>at the bottom add reservation setup a static ip address</p>
<p>Advanced settings; QoS settings:</p>
<p>For upload check enable upstream QoS (optimized for gaming)</p>
<p>For the bandwidth; (should be about 80-90% of max) I get 10 from my isp, i set it to 8 because there must be something to throttle or the qos engine falls apart (or at least most qos engines) so if i set it to 10 and at the moment i am only getting 8.5 from
 my isp then the qos engine doesn't work right. If anybody KNOWS otherwise please explain.</p>
<p>then click Setup QoS rule and delete all except for the xbox and Netgear EVA rules and change the xbox priority to highest and netgear eva to high.</p>
<p>The only other things I changed which should have no impact was the system time, wifi name and password router login password</p>
<p>Everything else is default UPnP enabled by default (shows xbox ip and port 3074 in the list) and I have no port forwarding rules setup.</p>
<p>Again I had open net and connected just fine without changing anything, however in games such as COD every millisecond counts and I noticed a big improvement with the above setup vs. defaults.</p>

<p>Very detailed post and questions. I've had a lot of the same questions and found the following:</p>
<p>Question #1: UPnP, Port forwarding, or DMZ? I can get an open NAT with any of these but which one will provide the lowest latency?</p>
<p>A #1) To really check your latency to MS/XB1 servers, test Multiplayer Connection in Network. After the test is done, hold LT, RT then LB, RB all 4 at the same time to bring up advanced network test parameters. You want &lt;100ms Latency, 0% packet loss and
 &gt;1.5MB Download. That will tell you if you have a good (COD AW) connection.</p>
<p>Activision recommends the following in order of priority:</p>
<p>1) UPnP</p>
<p>2) Port Forwarding</p>
<p>3) DMZ</p>
<p>*Only one of these should be used at a time. If multiple are enabled they can conflict and slow your connection down. I found success with only enabling UPnP and auto assigned IP on my X1.</p>
<p>Question #2: Firewall, what are the best settings for xbox live? And if DMZ is used do these settings even matter?</p>
<p>A#2) Firewall like ZoneAlarm is on your PC and won't/shouldn't affect other devices like X1. Your router is your physical firewall between your devices and the internet. But yes, with X1 in DMZ it's not inside the firewall and so potentially vulnerable to
 'attacks'. BUt there is nothing on your X1 to hack so there's really no danger of X1 in DMZ.</p>
<p>Question #3: MTU some claim this makes a difference I have played with it but can't tell for sure if it affected latency. Will it improve latency to change the MTU to something lower than the default 1500?</p>
<p>A#4) I have no idea on MTU or effectiveness. I'm curious if there is any relation to MTU and latency.</p>
<p>Question #4 (Big Question): QoS, First of all the 2 besides the upstream. Wireless WMM, enable or dis enable? Downstream, I notice a custom rule can be setup to the xbox's MAC address, would this help or make latency worse? And finally, the upstream QoS,
 enable obviously....</p>
<p>A#5) I was just looking up QoS and came across this post. QoS assigns priority to different types of traffic on your network. If someone is streaming or downloading in your house while you're gaming, you'll want to enable QoS and possibly assign priority
 to X1 over other devices streaming YT for example. However I turn QoS off as it didn't make much difference. One less feature my router has to do and I ask my wife/kids not to stream videos while I game.</p>
<p>Question #5: I know when setting up most QoS you have to put in your bandwidth and it must be something lower than your actual or else it all falls apart. (I.E. i get 10 mbps upstream, when I enter my upstream bandwidth in the router I must put something
 lower than what I actually get. Speed test vary from about 8 to 9 mbps, therefore i must put a value into the router no more than 8) When I click the button for speed test it auto puts in about 9.66 mbps. but i know sometimes i get less than that..</p>
<p>A#5) With COD AW there is some discussion that throttling your bandwidth on your router you'll somehow get a better game experience. It's counterintuitive but possible. I've noticed when playing solo, I put my UL limit to 400kbps and 200kbps, even 160kbps.
 The game only requires 20~30kbps so these ranges should be fine. Playing solo I have had killer games with throttled UL speeds. I don't know why. But playing in a party (which is pretty much always), the party chat suffers as well as my game. It must be something
 with the AW netcode that regulates lag compensation. i.e. fast internet and low latency connections are handicapped by the netcode through lag comp. So, if you throttle your connection/latency you take advantage of the lag comp. I've removed all QoS and bandwidth
 limiting and the game runs good.</p>
<p>Question #6: Will turning off the wireless radios improve the wired connection latency or stability? and if so, would using a second router as an access point to handle the wireless side be a good option?</p>
<p>A#6) It shouldn't. Routers are good at multitasking and keeping other features enabled without affecting your wired connection. However if other devices on the wireless are streaming or downloading, then yes, you will suffer.</p>
<p>Question #7 (Last one): DNS servers. I can change them on the xbox itself, would it make any difference for the xbox if; I let the xbox get DNS automatically and changed the router's DNS to google's (8.8.8.8), rather than leaving the default ISP DNS in the
 router and manually changing them on the xbox to google's DNS? </p>
<p>A#7) Your router is your DNS inside your home. I believe, you want the X1 DNS to be your router's IP address. I don't think you want (or even can) have your X1 use a google or ISP DNS while inside your router's LAN.</p>
<p>And lastly, if you're an AW (or Destiny) gamer and looking for a gaming community; check out rG: Rapturegammingcommunity.net. It's a good gaming community that's recruiting, we have an MLG competitive team and we kick *** at clan wars!

<p>When I do the network test I more than meet the requirements for xbox and AW. &nbsp;I usually get about 87 - 90 ms on ping. &nbsp;Now the ping doesn't really change with the xbox test very much as I change router settings but in game I notice big changes therefore
 using that test to determine best settings doesn't help a whole lot.</p>
<p>Question 1:</p>
<p>Now with UPnp, port forwarding, or DMZ I agree with you about only using one, but I have read many other posts where specifically DMZ and UPnP were used together with success such as people with multi consoles or whatever. So I wasn't sure if those two were
 actually incompatible, I have been trying it with UPnP off and on but havn't determined if it makes a difference.</p>
<p>To remind you what the question was, which of the 3 will give lowest latency? &nbsp;Just because UPnP is recommended doesn't mean that it provides lowest latency.</p>
<p>Question 2: </p>
<p>To clarify I am not concerned about security risk. For my specific router these settings are found under LAN settings. &nbsp;With some routers these settings must be changed for a smooth online experience, my router is also one of them. &nbsp;Just wondering if checking
 or unchecking anything specific will improve Latency at all. &nbsp;And yes I use DMZ (outside of firewall) but just wanted to make sure that that means firewall settings don't matter for the xbox then.
</p>
<p>By the way routers also have firewalls and settings for said firewalls in the software (it is not just a physical firewall)</p>
<p>Question 4:</p>
<p>My specific router was designed to work with Xbox's, by offering a rare upstream QoS (compared to the normal downstream) Upstream is what makes the biggest difference for gaming, or so they say. QoS controls who can use how much bandwidth but I am also under
 the impression that it can give priority to packets. So for an example two packets enter the router, without a priority set the router will just send one packet before the other therefore increasing the latency of the second packet (since it was paused before
 sending) so when you give the xbox for example a priority of highest then all xbox packets will be analyzed, processed, and sent prior to anything with a lower priority setting.</p>
<p>Your answer to question 5: I was more talking about the qos setting rather than what you are talking about. &nbsp;I believe what you are talking about is throttling to the point that the xbox servers will not use your connection to co-host the game and therefore
 people tend to get a better connection because of that. &nbsp;Besides the actual host other people in the game with "good" connections are used to co-host and that takes part of your connection to help take some of the load off of the actual host and to provide
 an overall better experience for people with less than good connections.</p>
<p>Question 6: Again I'm not talking about what works just fine. I'm talking about maximizing the connection for the xbox to the max extent possible. &nbsp;And if it did make a difference if using a second router as an access point would be a good option.</p>
<p>Question 7: Yes, yes you can. Try it. &nbsp;It allows you to use any dns on the xbox while everything else connected to the router to use the routers dns (if you want)</p>
<p>Again thank you for the reply but remember what I am searching for. &nbsp;Not a resolution to any "problem" but the best experience I can get. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And trust me it can and will get much better than just open NAT if you get the settings just right.</p>

<p>Important Update Important!</p>
<p>With my suggested settings, everything worked awesome at first. &nbsp;Then I started having some issues. I checked the system log and saw some weird activity to my xbox one (192.168.1.8)</p>
<p>There are many weird ports that are not used by xbox live. I believe that may have been the cause of my issues.</p>
<p>I reset WAN settings (Firewall) to default.</p>
<p>I will continue to troubleshoot getting the best connection while preventing this weird activity.</p>

<p>Ok this is what I'm trying now and has been working very well (not as well as in DMZ, but oh well)</p>
<p>I setup a static ip address (DHCP reservation) in LAN setup</p>
<p>QoS setup: &nbsp;WMM both disabled/not checked, downstream disabled/not checked, </p>
<p>Upstream enabled/checked (I get 10 up from my isp but i enter 8 into the router) many people with actual knowledge of qos engines will tell you to only input a value of 80% - 95% of what you actually get. &nbsp;If you prefer to throttle to the point that you
 won't be used as a host then put this value to something below that which will automatically disqualify you from host. (I don't know what value that is)</p>
<p>And the most important WAN settings/ Firewall settings:</p>
<p>Everything is not checked except for the bottom one</p>
<p>The only thing that should be checked is Disable SIP ALG then check open instead of secured.</p>
<p>so to clarify what is not checked is: </p>
<p>Disable port scan and dos protection</p>
<p>Default DMZ server</p>
<p>Respond to ping on internet port</p>
<p>Disable IGMP proxying</p>
<p>Under advanced setup disable UPnP and delete all port forwarding rules.</p>
<p>Now if you were paying attention i have no UPnP, no port forwarding and no DMZ and I still get open NAT with this router. &nbsp;If you have a different router then you may need to use ONE of those (but only one).</p>
<p>DMZ gave me the lowest latency but it also allowed attacks that seemed to destroy my games, when I was not being attacked however it gave me some of the best games I have every had in any COD game.</p>
<p>Other things to consider if you are having problems:</p>
<p>Input lag of your TV, I personally spent a lot of extra money to ensure I got a TV with low input lag (only works when i use the "game mode" however)</p>
<p>I also had a lot of issues once and found my xbox was connecting wired and wireless at the same time, clear the wireless settings if this is happening to you as well.</p>

<p>And of course DNS, I have had a lot of success with setting this in the xbox network settings rather than getting automatically from router. &nbsp;I use google's but sometimes my isp dns is actually faster according to name bench but the isp dns is less consistent.</p>

<p>Something else that has seemed to help after some testing is checking/enabling respond to ping on internet port</p>
<p>can be found in WAN settings.</p>
<p>And if I didn't mention before with the upstream QoS, I deleted ALL of the defaults rules and created a new one for my xbox's MAC address.</p>

            Office 365 does not permit custom installs, it must be installed on the system drive where Windows 10 is currently installed. There are hacks to get it to install elsewhere, but its not easy.

            Did you mean Office 365 as there is no Windows 365? If you meant Office 365, you can install only one C driver as installation will not give you the flexibility to choose this. This restriction is for Click to Run installations (retail versions have this, most likely you will have retail). In MSI (volume licensing) you have this flexibility to install on different drive.
<br />
<br />People have claimed to found ways to install C2R versions of MS Office on different drives but the routes are dangerous and should be handled by a person well versed.  Look into few answers here

            Hi a1Mel12, it is unclear from your question whather you need to install Windows 10 or Office 365, please see below:
<br />
<br />
<br />1, Clean install Windows 10 on a new Hard Drive:
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />
<br />2. Reinstall Office 365 on new Hard Drive:
<br />Install Windows as explained above . . .
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a> and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted.
<br />
<br />Select Install
<br />
<br />Under Install information, locate the computer where you want to deactivate the install.
<br />
