<h2>            I am unable to reformat the Buffalo Technology external hard drive.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Buffalo Technology DriveStation JustStore 1TB External Hard Drive&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have a External Drive that I had everything stored on and thought it would never crash; but it did. I have tried every software out there to retrieve the data and I now know that it is gone forever. I still would like to use it (and make sure I back it
 up consistently), but I am unable to reformat the hard drive.<br />
<br />
I have looked online and tried all different types of software to format the hard drive, but I still have not been successful. My PC can see it, but I am unable to format it.<br />
<br />
Any help with this matter would be much appreciated.<br />
</p>

<p>I've asked this question a few times.&nbsp; I see this problem all over the internet and tried about 6 different fixes [Am Microsoft Certified System Engineer].&nbsp; None worked.&nbsp;I have another computer&nbsp;in which Windows Media Center works fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is there a way to

<h2>            Diagnosing Frequent Windows 10 hangs</h2>
                    <p>Hi I keep getting some strange hangs on my windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically the windows that are open keep working, but if I try to go down to the bottom bar to either open a new window or shut down I just get the icon change to the timer circle and it won't do anything. It seems to be windows explorer stopping. If I shut
 down all the open windows I am just left with a machine that does nothing and ultimately I have to shut down the machine manually..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run reliability checker and can see the hangs which give the following info, it looks like explorer is hanging waiting on system settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there anyway to work out what the cause of all of this is, and how to fix. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine is only five months old and has had this problem on and off since&nbsp; new. Ie&nbsp; I had a run of this happening at the start, then it only happened once in three months, but has now happened three days running again.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>with regard to the recent batch of errors, I am not aware of any recent changes. Last windows update was January 10th</p>
<p>
</p><p>So whilst I could not rule out some lack of stability caused by the latest update, I could not say it has only occurred because of the latest update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current build</p>
<p>Windows 10 Version 1709 (OS build 16299.192)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run powershell&nbsp;sfc /SCANNOW</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the full hardware test from Dell Support Assist to check memory, CPU disk etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked through device manager for any problem drivers</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding. I just want to verify, what was the results of the SFC scan that you performed? I see that you may need to update your Windows 10 since the current update that we have is January 31, 2018—KB4058258 (OS Build 16299.214). You may
 check it using this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4058258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em><strong>link</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating you are still having the same issue, you may perform a clean boot in your PC, A clean boot is performed to begin Windows using minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install
 a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10. Begin the process by accessing this

</p><p>Let us know the result for us to help you further. </p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK firstly my windows obviously was up to date when I posted the previous messages. The update you referred to only came through in the last day or so and is installed now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC scan generally finds no violations, once last year it did find something which was then fixed - can't remember which. The crashes are getting more frequent (Twice yesterday) but still not necessarily every day and so I am not sure how the clean boot
 will help. If I am not able to use the PC for anything I am not sure how I will find the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted the info in my first message in case someone was able to look at it and know what was causing it. eg it stays explored crashed waiting on systemsettings.exe and I had hoped that may lead somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the question I have now is, on the basis that there is no way to diagnose from the info given about the crash - which seems a bit pointless - what is the next best step to eradicate this problem?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it to </p>
<p>1. reset windows under recovery, </p>
<p>2. reinstall the whole image (ie back to factory install from recovery partition)</p>
<p>3. any other option</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can advise please I would very much appreciate it.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your response. You may consider performing a repair upgrade using a Windows 10 ISO file. A repair upgrade is the process of installing Windows 10 over the existing installation of Windows 10 on your hard disk, using your installation DVD or
 ISO file. Performing this can repair broken operating system files while preserving your personal files, settings and installed applications. Click the link below for the steps and to know more about it. The link is a Forum Article from Andre Da Costa which
 helped a lot of Community members who had issues with their broken operating system as well.

<p>Thanks for the extra info, I will bear it in mind in case I need to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if it sheds any extra light onto things, but the error has stopped since the last windows update, and I can see that one of the other quiet periods started after an update and started again after a later one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst I can understand that I can have a conflict with a program/HW on my system and windows itself, is it likely that this would come and go with updates or is it just likely to be a coincidence?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its just I can see that I had terrible trouble after the Jan 10th updates until the ones at the start of Feb and then it has all gone quiet again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the same programs each day so I can't see it likely to be related to use.</p>

<h2>            Secure Socket layer is disabled Win 10</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; After I ran a auto &nbsp;scan&nbsp;from on my PC called PC&nbsp;health tech.&nbsp;sponsored by McAfee's Webb site. It stated that : My PC 's
<em><strong>secure socket layer is disabled</strong></em>. I called their phone number the guy told me for $150.00 &nbsp;That &nbsp;I&nbsp;could buy a one year&nbsp;subscription to their PC health tech that would fix the problem. Is this a scam or is it something I could fix myself.
 The PC is only 2 months old came with windows 10&nbsp;preinstalled it's HP Pavilion Desktop. Could I update the BIOS from HP's site would that fix the problem ?&nbsp; Anyone have an idea how I could fix this issue?&nbsp; J.H.

<h2>            Volume keys on new Sculpt Comfort wireless keyboard don&#39;t work.  Don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong.</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp; I just bought a new Sculpt Comfort wireless deskset, and for some reason the volume keys don't do anything at all.&nbsp; Obviously I'm doing something wrong, but I have no idea what that may be.&nbsp; Any help would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<h2>            I need to back up C drive to my external drive - system and all.  How do I go about it.&#63;</h2>
                    I suppose my question is, can you backup the entire c drive to an external drive?&nbsp; I had been doing it until I installed Windows 8.&nbsp; I am guessing it will allow you to do it.&nbsp; I just haven't figured out the proper procedure yet.

    <title>Why does my text size randomly change&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does my text size randomly change&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have seen this question posed related to IE and I don't think it was successfully answered! I don't use IE at all, but the same thing is happening in my Google Chrome! The only new app or extension I have added recently have been security ones and I'm
 sure it's not them!</p>
<p>I have a Lenovo Ideapad 100 laptop, with a touchpad, but I'm used to touchpads from my previous machines, and I don't think I'm touching it inadvertently! I do used Ctrl + Left Click when I want to select multiple files for action, but I conscious of doing
 that, so I don't think that's the problem either! It does, however, seem to happen when I'm scrolling! I'm new to the m/c and also to Windows 10 (have been using Chrome&nbsp;OS in recent years), so I'm not very familiar with either! Have selected Accessibility
 &amp; ease of access, below, instead of Settings, as I'm not sure which category is right!</p>
<p>Is there some other key combination that is causing it?</p>
<p>Does anyone else have any ideas?</p>
<p />

            <p>If it happens when scrolling, it's likely that your new touchpad uses 2-finger zooming so you can "pinch" the touchpad and zoom in/out just like on a touch phone. &nbsp;So while you are scrolling, if the space between your fingers changes, now it's zooming. May
 not be your case, but I've seen it many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could also just be that the sensitivity of the touchpad is too high, and most manufacturers include options to turn down the sensitivity so you may want to try that too.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Did you make any changes prior to the issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;Are you able to open Registry editor by typing regedit in Start search?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>a) Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow.<br />
</p>
<p>b) Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
sfc /scannow <br />
The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.
<br />
</p>
<p>Also check if <strong>&nbsp;Windows Management Instrumenation</strong> service is not running or not.
</p>
<p>a) Click on start and type ‘services.msc’ in the search field.<br />
b) Look for the&nbsp; Windows Management Instrumenation Service.<br />
c) The status should be "Starated" and Startup Type should be "Automatic"</p>

<h2>            Message that there is no network adapter and not configured. What is wrong&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I have&nbsp; Gateway LX6810-01 desk top runnning windows Vista Home Premium, 64 bit, 8gb RAM, Service Pack 2 and all latest updates. I connect to the internet through the LAN connection to AT&amp;T Uverse broad band high speed (12gbps). This has been working for
 over two years now with no problems until now. All of a sudden one day after I rebooted the machine there was no internet connection. When I went to the Network and Sharing Center I get a message that there is no network device installed. SO, I went to the
 Device Manager window and there was&nbsp;no network device listed but when I opened the "hidden devices" there is was. (Why it is hidden I don't have a clue.) SO, I went to the BIOS and checked to be sure the LAN was "enabled" and it WAS.&nbsp; I still get the same
 message "no network device installed". SO, then I went to the Gateway web site and downloaded the LAN driver for my machine and my LAN and REinstalled the driver. . . I STILL get the same message and I still have no connetion to the internet. WHAT could be
 wrong?? Although I consider myself relatively intelligent, I am NOT a computer guru, so please be kind and state your suggestions in "non lingo" so I will understand. Thanks for your help. I have run out of ideas.<br />

Hi</p>
<p>You can Minimize all open windows, which will leave only the Desktop visible.</p>
<p>Press the Windows Logo Key+M.</p>
<p>To Restore all of the minimized windows, press Windows Logo Key+Shift+M</p>
<p>You can also do this by clicking the small button on the right end of the Taskbar.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<div><strong>Maybe this can Help.</strong></div>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has <strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted<br />
</a><strong><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled).</strong> If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic.</p>
<p>If end up with the 3rd party software uninstalled or disabled, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
----------------------<br />
<p><strong>Networking&nbsp;Win 7 with other version of Windows as&nbsp; Work Network (</strong><strong>works very well if all computers are Win 7 too).</strong></p>

<h2>            Are you having a &#34;Needed Authentication&#34; error all of the sudden &#40;ATT Solution&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So found out my router all of the sudden wouldn't allow me to connect to Xbox Live, but EVERYTHING else was fine with my Wi-Fi. So After hours on the phone with Xbox Support and ATT, here's how I fixed it with ATT, don't know if it will work with other Routers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">1. look on the modem for the Advanced Configuration website,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://0.0.0.0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://000.000.0.000</a><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">&nbsp;(your

<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
2. Go to Home Network</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
3. Then the sub-tab MAC Filtering</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
4. Scroll down to MAC Filtering List</p>
<p style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
5. Manually enter the MAC number on your Xbox. May be different depending on if you're wired or wireless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your MAC number should be in the Network Settings on your Xbox. I hope this helps someone.</p>

<p>That's weird.&nbsp; Would anyone else have access to the router admin functions?&nbsp; MAC Filtering would allow or block access for devices based on the physical MAC address (block or allow based on how its is set up in the router as blacklist or whitelist). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your situation it would have had to been on the list before and inadvertently removed, or the feature was toggled off/on before.</p>

            I'm going to agree with PalmettoBling, someone had to either toggle on MAC filtering or manually delete you Xbox, that is not a spontaneous event. As a rule ISPs avoid turning this stuff on because it creates support issues.

            I was "late" on a bill, cause they applied my full installation fee on my first bill instead of spreading it, and they just told me to ignore and only part a 3rd of the fee each month which turns out was a lie to try to force me to pay my bill. But even
 after it was resolved this was still the issue. So I'm sure someone at ATT had to have done something.

 improve your performance. I wish it did, but nope. and I not the one that did it. EA emailed me a list of the ports i needed open to connect to their servers for that whole port forwarding stuff. I don't know how to do all that and didn't want to mess anything
 up so I called at&amp;t and asked them to open some ports for me. I was put on hold for 10 minutes guy came back on talking about I've placed the order to get all the boxes removed from the kitchen for you. 🤨😠😡🤬🤬 confused, so was I. he was helping a different
 customer on the phone while I was on hold and got us mixed up. put back on hold few min he came back on and said ok I opened the ports for you �� I said "you did? which ports, cuz I didn't even tell you what I needed to open ports for? he said I open dem all.
 I dmz xbox. I got mad.&nbsp; had someone do that the month b4 and didnt it work. I was told by a completely different sup tech a week b4 that, that dmz could be part of problem and to just open specific ports which is what I was trying to do but they wouldn't do
 it. I feel like EA and at&amp;t are singling me out for whatever reason.😓 </p>
<p>
</p><p>edit* I had given xbox live ports when I was giving EA ports to my isp</p>

<h2>            Lan Access from Remote</h2>
                    <p>My router logs frequent attempts to access my home network via the port I assigned to my Xbox One. These attempts, from peculiar places like Chine and Russia occur at all times, with the exception of when I turn all power to the Xbox One off. Otherwise, this is an example (a short one as the log can be hundreds of lines long if I keep the power flowing to my Xbox)::</p><p><font color="#000000" size="3">

<h2>            Why does my Xbox One S download so slow&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I got an Xbox&nbsp;One S for Christmas and finally got a chance to play it. The only problem is it has **** for a download speed (8-10mbps avg with a range of 2mpbs - 15mbps) and the game that came with it's a digital download.</p><p>It's been downloading for the past 6 hours.&nbsp;What's up with this?&nbsp;It was never this bad on the original Xbox One. I&nbsp;checked my internet speed on the computer and DL is 50mbps. I've tried turning off everything else in the house that uses the bandwidth, but the xbox&nbsp;remained sub 10mbps.&nbsp;</p><p>What I've tried:&nbsp;</p><p>1)&nbsp;Restarting the Xbox One S.&nbsp;It worked for a few minutes. It was up to around 30-40mpbs but over a 5 minute period it dropped back down to &lt;10/s.</p><p>2)&nbsp;I tried changing the DNS to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 as a reddit user was told to do.&nbsp;</p><p>3)&nbsp;It is in energy saver mode, which I&nbsp;read can fix this issue.&nbsp;</p><p>All it's doing is downloading&nbsp;(I'm not playing the game&nbsp;a

            <p>Hey Cizl! I'm using wireless.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know what was up with it yesterday. It finished downloading Battlefield&nbsp;after_almost_24 hours. Started downloading Halo 5 a few hours ago and I've been getting 30mbps (Range between 10mbps-45mbps) which is a lot better than the 10mbps I was getting with the battlefield 1 download.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>hi I have had the same problem for over a year now I've tried using wired connection and it doesn't make much of a difference. I couldn't tell you how much time I've spent on the phone with xbox, Microsoft, at&amp;t, EA. they all just push me off to one another
 saying it's got to be the others fault. let's put it this way I'm to the point now that when I try to call any of them for help, 9 times out of 10 I know more about their systems and troubleshooting techniques or whatever than the person on the other end of
 the phone, who's just sitting there reading from a script anyway&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I really so need some help with this&nbsp; it drives me insane taking 2 days to install a game or update&nbsp;</p>
