    <title>Cannot detect Wifi networks in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot detect Wifi networks in Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I just bought an Asus 6320 desktop preinstalled with win 8&nbsp;yesterday.</p>
<p>I can connect online via my mobile hotspot,</p>
<p>however it cannot detect any other wireless connections including my home's, or my neighbours'. Sometimes it can detect my home network, but the signal would be very weak and after I key in the password for the network, it can't connect anyway.
</p>
<p>Is it because all the networks are not compatible with windows 8 or is there something wrong with my wireless driver???
</p>
<p>Everything else can connect to my wireless network, like my Nintendo ds, ipod touch, MacBook air with mac os and win 7, and win vista desktop.
</p>
<p>Someone help me please, i'm feeling so&nbsp;frustrated! I can't even roll back to anything prior to this because I JUST BOUGHT IT.&nbsp;thanks.</p>

            <p>I know this post is old.. but I really hate when support people say "just run the troubleshooter" in about 50% of the cases this will fix the issue..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT windows 8 has a bug where it will ONLY see Wifi networks it has connected to in the past and will NOT see any new ones.... so if you have this bug and go from WIRED to WIFI.. you won't see anything...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a windows service that it designed to sit there and just SCAN for every available Wifi network and present them to you. hit the windows key in the KB and just start typing when the metro tiles come up: SERVICES (it may show up as local services)
 right click that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will then get a list of ALL the services on your PC (Think of services as OS background applications.. also programs you install can have their own services is well... about 1/2 automatically start with windows, some won't start until a user logs in,
 and others must me manually started by the user or by another process. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You want to scroll down and find: WLAN AutoConfig and Make SURE: 1) it is running and 2) it is set to AUTOMATIC. If either is not the case then 1) set it to AUTOMATIC, then hit apply, then start the service. If it wasn't running this should fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF IT IS RUNNING, RESTART IT... if the issue STILL persists, then you have the BUG in windows 8.x</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next go to control panel then network and sharing .. on the left click: CHANGE ADAPTER SETTINGS, find your wifi adapter, RIGHT CLICK it.. and click STATUS... in the new window, click: WIRELESS PROPERTIES</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make SURE the look for other wireless network boxes is checked.. if it is not.. then you will only EVER see wifi networks you know about.. and if you don't know of any... NONE will show... clicking this should solve your issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't get me wrong, what the MS engineer said WILL help many people and windows 8.x does have a GREAT built in troubleshooter... but the problem is.. when those things fail, MS usually tells you to system restore, reformat the computer, etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should NEVER&lt; EVER EVER EVER have to re-install your OS unless it is HOPELESSLY corrupted and damaged.. even then... most versions of windows can be repaired IF you get someone who knows what they are doing: I DO</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have worked with windows since it was Windows 286 and 386 (pre Windows 1 and 2, etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But where my expertise really comes in is with any version of windows starting with 3.0 all the way up to 6.3 (8.1).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a side note.... technically Windows 8.1 is v6.3, 8=6.2, 7=6.1, vista=6, xp=5, 2000=4 and windows NT 3 &amp; 4.... Windows 2000 to XP are basically the same.. just with extra features and GUI enhancements over the years.. but are still VERY much rooted in
 Windows NT</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Vista, 7 and 8, even 8.1 are all the SAME MAJOR product version #.. meaning the all share the basic same core operating system.. the newer versions just have extra features slapped on... hence why 7-8.1 are all v6.x.. same windows.. just tweaks...
 and some tweaks were NOT so good. Even todays windows are Windows NT at heart :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... I've been a certified MS engineer since the cert program first came out, and I've had varying cert names over the yrs as the program was changed. There isn't much about windows I don't know and can't fix.</p>

<p>Hi Charlie,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I got most of the steps you mentioned, but even after restarting the service, when I right click on my adapter, "status" is not an option that is available to be clicked. It's "greyed out."&nbsp; Any ideas what to do in that case?</p>
<p>

<h3> jatzwa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video TDR failure</h2>
                    <p>I had a system crash from a video tdr failure, with the message atikmpag.sys (windows 10, ATI Radeon HD4850 graphics). &nbsp;I have not changed the system, or installed new software or hardware recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system couldnt restart, it would go into preparing auto repair, diagnosing, then it wouldn't repair, and would take me to advanced options. &nbsp;I could only boot in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In safe mode I checked my ati radeon hd 4850 driver, which was latest version, and I have been running it a long time. &nbsp;I disabled the graphics, and was able to reboot in normal mode with reduced graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then uninstalled the driver so I could do a fresh install. &nbsp;Downloaded from AMD, however, not only had the card disappeared from Device Manager, the whole display adaptor tab had disappeared. &nbsp;Showing hidden devices, and find new hardware didnt resolve
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran microsoft system diagnostics which said everything was fine with my Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the AMD package, and restarted. &nbsp;I was able to restart in normal mode (but graphics were still low), but I still didnt have the display adaptor tab, and after a couple of minutes, I had the same system crash. &nbsp;I crash within a couple of minutes every
 time I boot in normal mode with the atikmpag.sys error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to see if it was drivers again was run the amd uninstaller. &nbsp;However my system now still crashes when I run in normal mode with the same error, even though I think I do not have the ATI drivers running (I am not sure because I cannot see the
 display adaptor tab, or graphics card).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not even sure if I am running default graphics or the ATI card on low resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I get the display adaptor tab back.</p>
<p>Could my issue be an issue with the card itself, is getting a new card likely to help</p>

            Ok, follow up. Restarted in normal mode and managed to get a report from speccy on my system before it crashed. It only showed the legacy microsoft basic display adaptor. &nbsp;Ati did not show up, then it crashed again.

            I tried a new video card. &nbsp;This was recognised and installed with no issue. &nbsp;Now working fine. &nbsp;I think it was a problem with the video card itself, which was getting a bit old.

    <title>What is this mess with file associations &#38; default programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> k9ee  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is this mess with file associations &#38; default programs settings &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a <strong>very</strong> complicated question. I tought about system restore, but I don't have a way to know which restore point to choose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the record : Win 7 Home Premium x64 (OEM Acer/Packard Bell)&nbsp;and MS Office Home &amp; Student 32bit (Pro Eval&nbsp;came pre-installed on the notebook, and when I bought it I ended up with the Click-To-Run edition whithout knowing there may be differences between
 CTR and "normal" Office)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People with which I exchange documents are using any of : MS Office, OpenOffice or LibreOffice.</p>
<p>When I open a file with the other Office suite, the page layout is all messed up (ex: .doc made with Word opened with LibO ; or the opposite : .doc made with LibO opened with Word). As a consequence I need to have both suites installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is with file associations. In the "set default programs" control panel, there is no entry for MS Office, but the one for LibO is there.</p>
<p>("set default programs" control panel is this : <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-which-programs-Windows-uses-by-default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-which-programs-Windows-uses-by-default</a>&nbsp;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, when I click on "choose defaults for this program", most of the entries are locked (either checked or not, and not editable)...</p>
<p>This control panel is great because it offers a global view of associations. But it doesn't function on my computer, and I don't know which files are associated whith which application (inside a set of extensions an application can open).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I did to try to solve this problem is first, make a search, and second, apply some advices found here and there&nbsp;:</p>
<p>1) Removed "Click-To-Run" Office and re-installed from the&nbsp;"backup" downladed for MS Store.</p>
<p>The "Q:" drive is gone and Word is now starting a little faster. Great, but it doesn't solve the problem.</p>
<p>2) Repaired Office. It corrected nothing. Waste of time.</p>
<p>3) Ran SFC /VERIFYONLY. It told me that all files are OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking in the registry, I saw that Office apps (word, excel, ...) didn't registered at all there :</p>
<p>HKLM\SOFTWARE\RegisteredApplications</p>
<p>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\RegisteredApplications</p>
<p>It seems to be needed to have the "set default programs" control panel working.</p>
<p>I made a little test by manually registering&nbsp;an image viewer program (named "FullScreen Photo Viewer"), and I found that I had incorrect permissions on some registry keys there :</p>
<p>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.jpg\UserChoice</p>
<p>[note: there is no "FileExts" key in the Wow6432 registry, at least on my computer]</p>
<p>"UserChoice" is the key indicating which program I choosed to be the default JPG viewer for my user account, and I was denied access to this key, even as an admin. Not only to this key, but to all "UserChoice" keys for all extensions .doc, .docx, .xls, ...&nbsp;(and
 only to those "UserChoice" keys). When I remove some of the&nbsp;faulty ACLs, it comes back automagically for some extensions, which defeats the whole purpose of the "set default programs" control panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, this permission problem is about associating extensions with a registered application. MS Office is not registered, as I wrote above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my questions are :</p>
<p>1) How to have things functionning as they should ? (by "should", I mean "as explained in most tutorials")</p>
<p>2) How&nbsp;to have MS Office in the "set default programs" control panel ?</p>
<p>3) How to remove all the&nbsp;faulty ACLs disallowing me to choose which files I want to open with which app ?</p>
<p>4) How to prevent those faulty&nbsp;ACLs to come back ?</p>
<p>5) How to get the full "student" edition when the MS website tells that the email is not functionning (it does function, I tested) ?</p>
<p>6)&nbsp;Why managing associations is still so complicated in 2012&nbsp;? Hey, I can set a video as my wallpaper if I want, but file associations are not functionning ????</p>
<p>7) Would you imagine your phone failing to associate with the network of the provider you're paying ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice on any of those questions would be greatly appreciated !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for your interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) This is not an acceptable answer to my question. You misunderstood (or I misexplained)&nbsp;that I may need to change the associations, and you&nbsp;answered like if I wanted to set an association forever...</p>
<ul>
<li>First :</li></ul>
<p>What you are describing is the precise level of functionality of Windowses from the second half of the 1990's.</p>
<p>I did bought a computer of the early 2010's, with OS and software of the same era, that are designed to provide a higher level of functionality, and the user experience that come along with.</p>
<p>I did not bought a time machine to live again the previous century, nor the complexities of the softwares of that era. Reading the EULA can confirm that Microsoft does not sell time machines,&nbsp;and
<u>that</u> is very sad seeing how useful time machines would be.</p>
<p>As a proof of my affirmation about design, you can watch the video provided by Microsoft on the link in my message above. Microsoft was not providing videos in the 1990's. Obviously, the work on design is not complete, and this is my question : how to complete
 it and have MS Office shown in the said control panel ?</p>
<p>I might be skilled enough to "hack the stuff" myself, but I might also be skilled enough to screw everything. If, as you said, MS intention was to hide MS Office from this control panel, why ? what would be the consequences of adding it ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Second :</li></ul>
<p>Not having MS Office shown in "Default Programs" disallow me to easily switch from one set of associations (for instance, LibO), to another (MS). This is useful if I work with someone making .doc with LibO (I will in this case want to open the .doc with
 LibO), then, later, work with another person making .doc with MS Office (I will, in this case, want to open the .doc with MS Office). More than useful, this is important when dealing with series of documents from various sources.</p>
<p>Existing solutions to&nbsp;this issue include&nbsp;having two user profiles (one LibO, one MS Office), which is far from useable ; or abusing of "right-click -&gt; open with", which is very irritating when dealing with multiple documents&nbsp;; or teaching people to always
 use the native file format of their office suite, which leads to questions like "what is a format ? what is an extension ? why should those matters be my job ?" and so on...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) No, that's not on this site, I correctly downloaded the file. That's about the email validation step to check if I'm a student : my student email (from an affiliated university) is rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any toughts about the ACLs problem ?</p>

Yes, I do have a rant, that's cultural in my country (and in others). Sorry if this offends you.</p>
<p>Life is about choice, and you wrote that computing shouldn't be.</p>
<p>As shown by the link I provided in my question, it happens that&nbsp;MS designs concepts it doesn't follow. That's a known fact since decades (for more information on this topic, please do search for "Chuck Norris facts" in your favorite search engine).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides having a rant, I have a constructive rant. Please, read again my question : I may set myself the needed registry entries to have MS Office shown in "defaults programs". But is this a good idea ? Is there any obscure drawback(s) of doing so ?</p>
<p>You wrote that MS didn't do this themselves <em>by desing</em>. Great answer, but... : is this about
<em>technical</em> design, <em>commercial</em> design, <em>legal</em> design, <em>
graphical</em> design, <em>educational</em> design, <em>artistic</em> design, &lt;insert any other form of design here&gt; ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Design</em> is a badly shapeshifting word. Easily used to avoid a topic seen as difficult.</p>
<p>Come on, I won't eat more than your words...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, all this <em>design</em> stuff doesn't save my day : I'm also looking for directions about the issue on this faulty ACL (see questions 3 &amp; 4 above).</p>
<p>What made it appear ? Did I made something I shouldn't ? How to fix this issue ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading &amp; have a nice day.</p>

    <title>Mouse Drag Box Select changed under new Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> corran219  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse Drag Box Select changed under new Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>In the original version of windows 10 the drag box would only select files whos names were contained within the box.&nbsp; Even though I disabled all windows updates, version 1803 was installed.&nbsp; Without my authorization. Now the drag box selects all lines that
 are within the box.&nbsp; How do I change this behavior back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example.&nbsp; Windows Explorer is in List.&nbsp; Most file names are 10 characters in length.&nbsp; 3 files are 30 characters, which I want to delete.&nbsp; I click at the top of the window and drag to the bottom.&nbsp; Selecting only the 3rd, 7th, and 12th files, as those
 are the 30 character long filenames.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get this behavior back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

</p><p>You can highlight a specific file by holding the <strong>Ctrl key and click on it using the left click</strong>
<strong>of your mouse</strong>. Once the files are highlighted, you can press the
<strong>delete (del) key </strong>on your keyboard to delete the files right away or
<strong>right-click</strong> on one of the highlighted files then click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.<br />

<p>I apologize.&nbsp; I guess I should have stated that a keyboard will not be accessible.&nbsp; This was accomplished with mouse only in the original version of Windows 10 and still needs to be.&nbsp; How do I get the old Drag Box behavior back?</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I am Mark.</p>
<p>My Skype version is 12.13.274.0</p>
<p>My Skype account was working normally about 15 January 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am unable to call out nor receive calls (since about 18 Jan 2018).</p>
<p>My Skype screen opens and clicking on directory entries reveals phone numbers available for that name.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Calling Out: NONE-</strong>Clicking on the phone/audio icon brings up the "calling" window, but the call timer remains at 0 min./sec. and immediately terminates before any connection has been made.</p>
<p><strong>Calls In: NONE-</strong>Those calling in get a recording that says this number is unable to receive your call at this time. No connection is made.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Corrective efforts/results so far</strong></p>
<p>I downloaded Skype Classic as seen above. Neither saw nor found a Tools tab.</p>
<p>I did access "settings" and verified that sms and calls will be accepted from anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Trouble shooting responses</strong></p>
<p>I am using Skype only on this 1 laptop. No one else is using my Skype acct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for attention. After 60-plus minutes of following directions and being "recycled" through the security logon 3x, it is discouraging to find myself no closer to resolution.</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>1- My Skype number IS listed as my Caller ID. I verified that, but my account is STILL UNABLE TO MAKE OR RECEIVE calls.</p>
<p>2- I verified that I AM ACCESSING MY OWN ACCOUNT &amp; Skype number.</p>
<p>3- My account shows a positive balance of more than US$5.00.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to make a call...</p>
<p>A- I click on the colored phone icon for the one I wish to call.</p>
<p>B- Then I click on that person's blue "call" icon circle.</p>
<p>C- The calling window opens, but NO calling sound is heard and time counter REMAINS at 00:00 and the Calling Window CLOSES after 2-3 seconds.</p>
<p>D- I get NO sound or signal of dialing, ringing, nor connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ACCOUNT INFO</p>
<p>I originally opened my Skype account while living in Michigan, USA, so my Skype number prefix has a 1 for USA and 616 for my original home region in Michigan, USA. For 3.5 years, I have lived in Nigeria, West Africa (about 9.5 months each year). Still, the
 1 616 Skype number has always worked fine with no problems, until about 1 month ago. Was that when Microsoft took over?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the second week that I am seeking resolution.</p>
<p>I am willing to keep working at resolution for 1 more week.</p>
<p>Thank you for your persistent help.</p>

<h2>            Laptop Randomly Shutdown</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, thank you for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an 2013 Mac Book Pro A1278 and I installed a Windows 10 with its Bootcamp feature. I always use windows. But recently my laptop had the problem of randomly shutdown after a period of use. Here I saved the event log of my laptop. Would you like to
 help me to figure out what's wrong with my laptop?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Mac and Bootcamp support as I suspect it is hardware or a bootcamp issue. Other less likely, yet possibilities, are the major drivers such as video, sound, and network.<br />
<br />
Is a mindump or dmp file created? If so please post t so we can download and analyze.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>Here is the help I would post for a PC which you should follow as you can. Definitely check with Mac and Bootcamp support as this could be a known issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ID41 with no Bug_Check - The main cause of this issue as you have described is hardware related :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Over-Clocking -&gt; <strong>best to reset ALL to the defaults especially while troubleshooting</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2. </strong>Memory (check thoroughly as indicated below).<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Power Supply (see below to ensure you have enough power).<br />
<br />
<strong>4. </strong>Over-heating - even if the overall temps are with-in specs a single component can be too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat and fault at a lower temp. Try adding a fan blowing into the case to reduce the effects of heat even more
 than the cooler usually does. Of course ensure all built-in fans are running.<br />
<br />
====================================================</p>
<p><br />
After checking determining the wattage of the power supply you will then need to check&nbsp; the requirements of the motherboard and devices. Usually the video card is one of the&nbsp;major power users.<br />
<br />
How do I determine how big my power supply is?<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p><span>Hi joyheather&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To troubleshoot the issue, please perform these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;<span>Disable screen savers</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Some screen savers can interfere with the computer’s ability to go into and come out of sleep/standby mode. Disabling or changing the screen saver
 may resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer:&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-your-screen-saver-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Turn your screen saver on or off</a></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Run Powercfg command</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run Powercfg Command-Line Options to check the devices that wakes your computer. One of these devices could be causing the sleep issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To run powercfg command:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to start and type cmd.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-Click
 on cmd and select “Run as Administrator”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 “<strong>powercfg –lastwake”</strong>without the quotes on the command prompt and press Enter. This reports information about the event that woke the computer from the last sleep transition.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>To
 get the most detailed info (and probably easiest) on the device that wakes your Windows up during the sleep, type:<br />
<br />
<strong>“powercfg –devicequery wake_armed” </strong>without the quotesand press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>This lists devices that are currently configured to wake the computer from any sleep state.<br />
<br />
If there are multiple devices listed, you may remove or disable one device at a time till you figure out the culprit device.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
Referral link for the command:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To disable the device:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to start and type device manager.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 device manager from the control panel list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 on the device and select “Disable”.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Step 3: Disable the device to wake the computer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Once you figure out which device is causing the sleep issue, perform these steps to disable the device from interfering with the sleep
 mode</span><span> from the device manager.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Procedure to do so:<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to start and type device manager.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 device manager from the control panel list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Locate
 any one of these devices: Network Adapter, Mouse and keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 and select “Properties”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to power management tab and uncheck “Allow this device to wake the computer”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Test
 by putting your computer to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Repeat
 this process&nbsp;for the remaining devices from step c.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>See where it takes.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize your concern that <strong>ctrl+ alt+ del </strong>is not working. This&nbsp;might not work after installing third party apps, or after updating the system with an unofficial firmware. These third party apps are making changes on the Registry and by
 modifying the default values the ctrl + alt+ del feature will stop working.&nbsp; Let me help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before proceeding further, I would like to know few answers.</p>
<p>1. Have you installed any third party software?</p>
<p>2. Did you make any changes in the system prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, <span><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To diagnose whether this issue occurs in
<strong>“Safe Mode”</strong>, let’s reboot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue appears there as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. This helps us in identifying whether the issue is due to some

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the steps given below and check if that helps.</span></span></p>

</p><p>I realize your concern that <strong>ctrl+ alt+ del </strong>is not working. This&nbsp;might not work after installing third party apps, or after updating the system with an unofficial firmware. These third party apps are making changes on the Registry and by
 modifying the default values the ctrl + alt+ del feature will stop working.&nbsp; Let me help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before proceeding further, I would like to know few answers.</p>
<p>1. Have you installed any third party software?</p>
<p>2. Did you make any changes in the system prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, <span><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To diagnose whether this issue occurs in
<strong>“Safe Mode”</strong>, let’s reboot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue appears there as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. This helps us in identifying whether the issue is due to some

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the steps given below and check if that helps.</span></span></p>

<p>Thankyou for the reponse.</p>

</p><p>1. All I did was upload printer driver from HP official site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;This happened after I updated Microsoft new release for window 10. After update was completed&nbsp; I tried logging back into the system. It rejected my password even when I knew my password was correct.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By pressing CTRL-ALT-DEL buttons&nbsp;I added admin password and restarted but now every time I login in,&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;type in password twice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought will be able go back and remove the 1st password bye pressing&nbsp;CTRL-ALT-DEL button but now it does&nbsp;not work.</p>
<p>In other word yes I did made changes by&nbsp;typing in&nbsp; password for Admin .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried recovere program, As soon as I switch on,&nbsp;it&nbsp;ask me&nbsp;to type in the&nbsp;pass word that I added, then it&nbsp;uploads window system and&nbsp;again it ask me to type in&nbsp;password for window which I originally setup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It did not make any difference. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try what you suggested and see if that works. And will update you as soon as I have&nbsp;completed.

<p>No, AFKing is when you log into a game but don't do anything. You just set your controller down and let the game play out so you get the cR without doing any work. Odd. It doesn't look like you have been judging by your game history.</p>

<p>First bans are like this are handled by the developer, right now that would be Bungie over at untie.net. The problem is they are handing control of the game to 343 industries next week I believe.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The problem is in either case your ban can not be lifted and any general rule for contesting bans a legitimate ban will double the punishment. Your ban was do to the player kr33s AFKing, which means your group was banned for party boosting. Since this player
 was in your party, everyone is punished for that indiscretion. This player was part of your party as the GT showed up over multiple playlists (I.e. Swat and snipers).
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You will just have to ride out the ban.</p>

<p>It doesn't work that way. The banhammer picks up patterns. So, if you're partied up with someone for X amount of games, and one of you is AFK for all of those games, both players in the party will be banned. Guilty by association. It doesn't ban the people
 who had nothing to do with it. So as long as you aren't in a lobby with an AFKer for say, 5 games in a row, you have nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>Oh good, thanks for the info brotha, that's good to know. I appreciate the quick response.
</p>
<p>I had a question, actually, that I posted in another group about a possible defect I had. Maybe you could answer it for me. I bought the Legendary editon of Reach, and my son bought the limited edition, so they have the black cases instead of the standard
 green. The disc release button has a harder release than the green cases and both our discs cracked from the center outward and are now unplayable. I'm wondering(since i'm new to these forums) if there'd been complaints of this very thing happening to other
 people. Maybe there was a recall I missed out on?(That would be nice). &nbsp;Maybe you or someone else has heard of this kind of thing...</p>

<p>In fact I have. The discs crack because the plastic inside is harder and more difficult to work with. You need to be REALLY careful when getting the discs out of special edition games (that goes for a lot of special edition games, not just Halo). The cases
 are usually higher quality inside and out.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>So, there are a few things you could do.</p>
<p>1. Contact Xbox support and tell them what happened. They'll most likely tell you to..</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>2. Contact the developer of the game (Bungie). However, Bungie doesn't really have a "customer support" part of their company for some reason. Trying to e-mail them is usually a useless thing to do from what I've heard, and I'm not sure if they have an 800
 number available for support. So, what I would do is..</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>3. Contact the retailer which you bought the disc from. Tell them that you just purchased the editions of the game, and upon trying to get them out of the case to play, they broke. A lot of the time, they'll let you get another copy. I don't know if they'll
 charge you a fee to get a new one or not, but that's info you can find out by talking to them.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>No, there was no recall on any game discs. That's just the way the cases are made for special editions.</p>

<p><span>Hi Richard,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the make and model number of your external hard drive?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the backup wizard doesn’t list your external hard disk, it could be due to many reasons. Please find out if one of these is preventing you from
 backing up files on your hard disk.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime, test and see if backup works in other external hard drive. Or rather, you can check the drive in another computer and see if the
 drive is listed in backup wizard.</span></p>

            The hard drive is an Iomega 500 mb/2.0usb &nbsp;which up until April I had been using for my backups.&nbsp; After it stopped being able to backup I did reformat from fat32 to NTSC. The other ext Drive does not have enough free space to allow a backup. I did run
 a backup to my internal secondary drive. The Drive that is not being seen in backup was able to perform a system image but I can not access for a backup

            You say your drive is: "..500 mb/2.0usb.." - do you actually mean it is a 500 GB (gigabyte) drive? If it really is only 500 mb it would not hold a backup.

<p><strong><span>Hi Richard,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If you are able to save the System image on your external harddrive and unable to select the same harddrive for performing
 the backup, the most likely cause could be that the external harddrive is also included in the backup list.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I would suggest you to check if the destination drive is selected in the backup list, if it is selected then make
 sure to uncheck that drive and then proceed with the backup or if you like to include that drive to backup, and then you need to select a different location as destination.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>So if the destination is the drive that you're trying to back up then you can't back up. Backup cannot be a disk to itself. For example, you can't
 back up the contents of Drive E: to Drive E:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>You may follow the steps for manual backup,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>a) Open Backup and Restore.<br />
b) Select "Setup Backup" or "Backup Now".<br />
c) Then from the list of drivers to be backed up unselect the destination drive if present in the backup list and proceed with further steps to perform the backup.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

                    I cannot rip a cd with windows media player. It has buttons to burn, play etc but not rip! Its windows 8.1 and its living up to the load of old rubbish i was warned it would be, (after i bought it!). All i want to do is rip my cd's then put them on my
 phone and so far have wasted two whole evenings!!! Could do it with Vista with my eyes closed! Feel like taking an axe to it. Help!

            Well i managed to do it but its a total hassle and a rubbish piece of engineering..... heres how.....Open windows media and also open the disc drive containing the cd, when the contents are displayed 'select all' then go to 'open' (its a tiny button at
 the top) and select media player, this links the two, on media player click on cd icon (left hand side) then right click on it and it will give you the rip option. And if anyone has a better way please let me know.

            <p>Method 1 - No Luck!</p>
<p>Method 2 - No Luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After each 'Method' I put CD in and it started playing so I click Rip CD. Same dialog box comes up it starts with - Windows Media Player cannot find file ........etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is absolutely useless to be greeted with this - I am 70 years old - had new laptop for about 3 weeks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not 'played around with any settings' in fact do not expect to have to. &nbsp;Just thought I would start creating my music library again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used computers for over 20 years last old computer ran Windows XP and I used the Windows Media player without any problems creating my library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems my age is moving forward and looking around this site Windows Media player is going backwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone suggested to me they use a Free Music App called - VLC. &nbsp;Has anyone used this? &nbsp;As I am not happy having to try and make this program work - it should do!</p>

            <p>Hi Gilly...</p>
<p>I f you have only had this laptop for 3 weeks I think you should get onto the manufacturer's tech support because you are quite right to believe you should not be having to resolve this yourself. If you cannot rip with WMP, it may be that even if you download
 another program the issue will still persist.</p>
<p>VLC is very good for video by the way, but I don't believe it has a 'rip' option and would suggest 'iTunes for Windows' as a better alternative - but you should try and get this put right anyway.</p>
<p>Do you have technical assistance as part of your purchase deal?</p>
<p>Regards - R.</p>

<p>while trying to connect to the internet i receive the message "Connection status:unknown&nbsp; The account specified for this service is different from the account specified for other services running in the same process" This just starting happening out of the
 blue.When I run the Diagnostic and Repair tool it says Windows cannot resolve problem,contact admin. or ISP.I know my internet service is working fine.I am currently on an e-machine that runs Windows Vista Home Premium and it connects with no problem.My problem
 is that my newer desk top (gateway also running Windows Vista Home Premium) is receiving the Connection problems.Im connected to the internet (DSL) using the Yukon ethernet cable.All the lights are green on the Wireless Gateway so I know the service is fine.Wierd
 thing I did notice,when I go to Network and Sharing and view status the Gateway desktop shows the "Yukon Ethernet controller" as the connection device while the e-machine says Im using "Intel (R) PRO/100VE Network Connection" Im using the same cable(Yukon)
 and set up for both computers,so was wondering what that was about also.Any and all help is appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Proposing the Simple Idea of a Permanent Communications Ban for &#34;Inappropriate Behavior&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I sent a lot of inappropriate messages, admittedly. I was banned by XBL Enforcement. One may ask why I don't deserve a ban when I blatantly broke their terms and conditions. That is not my complaint. I deserved a ban. However, I did not deserve a permanent XBL ban. This ban does not only make it impossible to sign into your account at all, but you can not access games and content you had already purchased. What was the most appropriate for my situation was a permanent communications ban. I would not be able to send these inappropriate messages, and I no longer would be breaking the terms, conditions, or code of conduct. Apparently, this option does not exist when it comes to XBL Enforcement. It's black and white. A perma&nbsp;ban or no perma ban. I have been recommended countless times to submit a case review, and I have, and the case will most certainly not be turned over. There is no way to appeal to XBL Enforcement. I can not complain, nor constructively&nbsp;criticize, nor recommend

            <p>Microsoft must have some strict standards when it comes to enforcement. People should study Ethics for like a day as well as common sense. Because most of the XBL Rules revolve around common sense which believe it or not you can have if you're even 15 years old (some people have it, others don't). Also you have a conscience, right?&nbsp;Think before you act or do something which goes against the Xbox Rules. But the judging should be fair depending on the actions committed and the persons age and background. Ask yourself if you behave the way you do with others online, would you behave that way in school or work? Sure Xbox is meant to be fun. But you need to show manners. If you want to curse hardcore, get a swear jar. The way you talk to other people can have a SERIOUS impact on that person. It may end up with that person feeling really bad. And thus could warrant the same penalty as a hacker/moder. You can't just go around treating people like trash. Sure the odd mild trash talk here and there

 </blockquote> <p><strong>You clearly don't understand digital purchases. When you purchase a game, etc. digitally, you are purchasing a license for that item. That item is attached to your account. If you lose your account because you break the tos, then you lose your license attached to that account. Just another FYI... Any game you have downloaded already can still be played offline (obviously not multiplayer only games). The problem is, after your account is banned, you lose the right to re-download them. You agreed to the TOS. NO ONE forced you to. Your behavior is what lost you your account. I keep saying this but it's that simple. If you don't like the terms, don't agree to them and go agree to another consoles terms. The best thing to do is buy physical. It's not only cheaper, but it is also yours to use on another account. Smarter... some would say. I'm not a lawyer, so I'm sure I haven't worded all this where you can understand it. I'm just throwing out my opinion. It's what we do here. Many people

<p>Rules and LAWS, the penalties and sentencing for such things if you break the rules, are rightfully more harsher, when you affect humans and people. Communication and the way you treat people both in real life and online, can really affect that person. People's lives are highly important. And when you affect people's lives in an adverse way, that can have an adverse affect on people. And you know who gets into trouble, the person who caused it. Thus, being offensive to people which communications is definitely one clear obvious way to do this, rightfully can carry out more serious consequences. The law and rules "ignorance is no defense". We have rules and laws and regulations for a purpose. To bring order, help protect us and others. People who object to this, really need to be schooled in common sense, and need their conscience in check. Exercising your conscience and common sense you shouldn't&nbsp;be breaking the rules. Since most of the Xbox Rules are common sense. YOU KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES if you bre
