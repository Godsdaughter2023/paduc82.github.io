<h2>            Wifi stops working when the charger is not plugged in</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer Predator Helios 300 laptop and the internet stops working when it is not plugged in (Although wifi remains connected). Once the internet has stopped working even plugging in won't bring it back. I have to restart my laptop with the charger
 plugged in and only then it starts working. My power setting is on "Maximum Performance". Can anyone suggest something to rectify the issue?</p>
<p>PS - I make a mobile hotspot and connect my laptop to it since I'm travelling and don't have access to wifi.</p>
<p>Edit- Installshield update service scheduler shows up in task manager and when I stop it my net goes off!</p>

            I will recommend that you create a new Power Plan or change another existing one and reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Right click on Battery &gt; Power Options &gt; Change Plan Settings &gt; Change advanced power settings &gt; Wireless Adapater Settings &gt; Power Saving Mode &gt; Under On Battery, select Low or Medium Power Saving and if that doesn't work, Maximum performance

    <title>Re&#58; Inappropriate Adverts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielleatkinson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re&#58; Inappropriate Adverts</h2>
                    <p>For several days, I have been seeing two adverts for one site whenever I open any of the Microsoft game apps. Not only is it deeply inappropriate in this day and age of time's up, it is offensive, presumptuous and sexist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to report the advert by clicking on the cross and clicking that the advert was inappropriate. For a moment, the ad is closed, then it comes back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reporting to Google, but it will not accept the location of the advert in the report form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I accept that Microsoft needs adverts to make a profit, I accept that if I don't want to see them I should pay for premium, but I feel that if I do that, I am in a sense renting my computer, which I spent a lot of money on in the first place. Nor do I see
 why I should have renew that premium yearly either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not expecting much success in this report, as I have made another complaint regarding Windows 10 before. I hope to be proved wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the advert in question.</p>

<p>I totally agree with you. My wife and I were doing something together on the PC when one of these dreadful pop-up happened. And again the next day when I was on the PC, my wife came in just as another pop-up happened. I was so glad she'd seen the one the
 day before otherwise she may have wondered what I was trawling the internet for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a way to stop them but be warned MS doesn't make it easy and some of the links I'm posting are different now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, click on your User Profile icon "DA" top right of the screen. Then&nbsp; click on Microsoft Account &gt; More help with your Microsoft Account &gt; Privacy and your MSA &gt; Privacy Statement &gt; How to Assess &amp; Control your Personal Data.
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Click on link to opt-out page</span></strong>
</p>
<p>You'll need to sign in to your MSA at many of these stages. This is for Security reasons - MS needs to know it's you not someone else so they'll send you a four-digit code (by phone/text, depending on what you set up. If phone have it handy - if email watch
 your Inbox,<br />
</p>
<p>On one of the above, you'll find what you need. I did and nothing happened at first so I threatened MS that I would report then to various bodies. Still nothing happened so I asked them a simple question - were these dreadful advertisements shown in muslim
 countries? If not should I report that too? They stopped the pop-ups within a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be patient &amp; spend some time. You'll get there in the end but the fact that the solution is so well-hidden shows how mega-bucks income is more important that the customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping this helps you. Do let me know the outcome please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS The MS CEO has an article here&nbsp;<a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-GB/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-GB/</a></p>
<p>(1) MS knows that I'm in GB so your URL might be different.</p>
<p>(2) It's new so I not run through it</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply, I have tried your suggestion and I shall wait and see if it works. Seeing that the adverts were managed by Google, I went into them as well to see if I can opt out there as well. I found out that I can customise what subjects I
 see through them, so I have tried that as well. Now time will tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only upgraded to Windows 10 recently after I almost lost my laptop. The GPU started failing and it was only thanks to a repair shop in Brighton that it was fixed. I was on Windows 8 and everything was fine. When it went wrong and my local laptop repair
 shop could not fix it, I complained to Microsoft when they suggested it was an account matter and they were very unhelpful, to the point of patronising.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with Windows 10 some of the games I love to play no longer work as well as they used to, and that was I what I tried to complain about to Microsoft before. However, because they are not Microsoft games, Microsoft have appeared to wash their hands of
 the matter, saying that it is a graphics issue or compataibility issue - when it isn't as I have tried the compatibility settings as well as graphics, - and contact the sites I got them from, who also refused to help, offering me a free game instead, which
 is not the point. If I had wanted just any game I would not have bothered to complain in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As much as I like using Windows, their customer service is at times appalling.</p>

<p>you have to virtulise windows 95 grab solitare.exe and its other file, then import them into visual studio and save it as a windows univeral app. Then i can transfer it to my xbox and play without any child porn or **** trafficing adverts too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i also think you cant beat windows 95,s solitare.</p>
<p>apart from windows 3.11 work groups one, which was the bomb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry showing my age.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i dont like all the pictures of little girls in bikinis in the store put it that way.</p>
<p>if it carrys on I will just unistall the windows app store</p>
<p>
</p><p>so much grooming on the internet</p>

===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>RTL languages are NOT supported correctly in Skype for years, and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ad p.  say:</h3>
<h2>            RTL languages are NOT supported correctly in Skype for years, and it&#39;s about time to fix it&#33;</h2>
                    For many years, Skype does not implement the BIDI algorithm correctly on their controls.<br />
<br />
On the classic version working with an LTR GUI doesn't allow you to read properly RTL sentences that include some LTR words, and the same is on an RTL GUI, which then LTR sentences with some RTL words also can't be read properly. It is true, both for chat sentences,
 and for the entire GUI.<br />
<br />
On the current version (8.30.0.50) changing the GUI language to an RTL one, still leaves the chat area in an LTR state, which prevent the user completely from being able to read properly any RTL sentences that contain some LTR words.<br />
<br />
BTW, trying to mark a mixed text was a mayhem in the past, and now it is just a difficult task.<br />
<br />
There was a hope that when Microsoft acquired Skype, these problems will be solved, since MS knows very good how to implement BIDI correctly on their products. Unfortunately that didn't happen, I guess since the Skype team is the same team, and no one on Microsoft
 ordered them to do so. All they need to do is to sit down with BIDI experts from MS themselves, or at least use native MS controls which support BIDI&nbsp; correctly.<br />
<br />
<br />
You got many requests in the past years to solve this issue, and it's about Skype will finally be an RTL friendly, like any other regular application.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<h2>            New Inspiron 5680 Hard Drive</h2>
                    So this might be a question already asked before, but I Just recently got a brand new Inspiron 5680. It's been great, but there's something I noticed. I bought the one with the 2 TB storage, and I came to find out that all of that storage isn't even being
 used, and I'm receiving storage almost full on my C: drive which is just over 100 GB. The 2 TB storage is set as the D: drive, and I'm just trying to find out how I can make the 2 TB hard drive my default hard drive, and essentially be my C: drive.

            Hi Austin
<br />
<br />You should move a few things to your D Drive to make that the default data drive:
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Personal Library Folders
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer, in the right pane, right click Documents and choose 'Properties'
<br />
<br />Choose the Location Tab, then in the Location box, type D:\Documents then click Apply and OK and confirm the move
<br />
<br />That will move your Documents folder to the D Drive. When the move completes, you should do the same for the Pictures, Videos and Music library folders. Each time change the folder name, for example, Pictures will go to D:\Pictures and so on. 
<br />
<br />Please be careful, each time check the folder name, before you move the folder
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Move where Windows stores new data on your PC
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - Storage - Choose Where new Content is Saved
<br />
<br />From there you can st a few options to use your D drive, instead of your C drive
<br />
<br />
<br />3.
<br />When the above has been completed, you should run Disk cleanup twice on your C drive:
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Click on your hard drive
<br />On the Manage Tab, click Cleanup
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete
<br />
<br />Start Disk Cleanup again
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />This time in the resulting dialog, click 'Cleanup System Files'
<br />Let Disk Cleanup run another scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete       
        </p>

<p>Hello AustinFuelling,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you purchased a laptop with an SSD and HDD combo. The ~120GB drive is an SSD, really fast storage. The 2TB is considerably slower, the change would be night and day slower. I suggest storing all your big files, pictures/media, and games on
 the bigger hard drive. If you install Windows 10&nbsp; to the 2TB drive, I foresee you to be dissatisfied with the speed difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to install Windows on the 2TB drive anyway, you may run the Windows 10 installation media to create a bootable flash drive really easily. I can help find an easy guide to follow if this is preferable. Otherwise, following what DaveM121 said is
 a good solution...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps a little.</p>

<p>Hi Jennifer Bri </p>
<p>I see this;&nbsp; system error 5 has occurred. Access is denied; when I type CMD in search and use Command Prompt: Then I type in Command Prompt the following-
<strong>net user administrator /active:yes </strong>When I type CMD and right click to run as administrator, user account control pops up and the only option is NO there is no option to click YES</p>
<p>&nbsp; Everywhere I need Administrators privileges. I foolishly deleted the files in Local Disk(C:)&gt;users&gt;administrator when I was trying to sort a problem following advice to use hidden Administrator; I had ended up with the administrator being present on loading
 windows and asking for a password which I had not set up. I also found that I had Administrators privileges in my own user profile and changed this as well to ordinary user then could not change back again. I changed start up to disable all at start up, to
 enable to clean boot my computer and now I cannot change back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I would like to reset my computer to windows 10 x64 Pro version 1709 OS Build 16299.34 that I currently have which was downloaded on top of Windows 7 x64 via the update and download from Microsoft when it was first introduced. However when I have tried
 to do this I found that the software that enables this through settings, Disables my Usbs and I cannot use my Keyboard or mouse as they run through a Wi Fi connector in a Usb slot.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Happened before I deleted said files.</p>
<p>I have read the advice that you supplied a link for in my email. however I am unsure how to proceed except by going to settings&gt;Update and Security&gt;Recovery I could use Advance start up, or more recovery options&gt;fresh start however I'm unsure of which way
 to go. As far as I know I do not have anything that is critical as I use my computer mostly for gaming through Steam that can be reinstalled. and personal files like photo's music etc. that are copied to my extension drives. I would appreciate any further
 advice regarding all this as I am not sure that not having Administrator set up on my computer it may impact reinstalling windows.</p>
<p>Thank you Peter Ferris</p>

<p>Thanks for the information, Peter. When deleting files and folders from your PC, we usually suggest to create a back up to ensure that you can always go back to the previous state of your PC. Since you have deleted the administrator account, it prevents
 you from performing certain tasks in your PC as well as getting the error message. The only way to get this resolved is to perform clean install. Here's how to

<p>I have tried unsuccessfully to reinstall windows on my computer several times and I have recently tried to repair/reinstall with a dvd having changed my dvd player as first bootable device in windows Bios only to find that it is disabled possibly because
 it requires Administration rights to run the software.</p>
<p>My question.&nbsp; Is, is it possible to re enable my Dvd player so as to run the dvd with the repair/reinstall software, I am aware of how to set it in bios as the first to run and the need to have said software in the drive before restarting my computer.</p>
<p>Is it possible to get round all this by buying a new internal hard drive and connecting to my computer. Then installing windows on it.</p>
<p>Are the Administration files unique to a particular computer. I don't suppose it is possible to find administrative software files to download anywhere.</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<h2>            Friends not showing up as online...</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to report a problem with my Xbox Live account. For some reason that I cannot understand, I am having issues connecting with friends that are online. One example of this is anytime a certain buddy of mine is online it is impossible to add him
 to a party or add him to a fire-team as it only ever shows him as “offline”. And he is not the only friend that I have this problem with. I am part of a clan with Bungie and it only pulls the information for a handful of the actual members of the clan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>what do I need to do to fix this problem?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xbox Live had a couple of hiccups this night.</p>
<p>If it's an account problem, you might want to delete your account from your Xbox and redownloading it back. Do not fear anything, your games will stay on the Xbox and you won't need to re-install them and your game progress is stored in cloud.</p>
<p>1.Delete your account.</p>
<p>2. Hard Reset Xbox </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -hold power button for 10sec</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -unplug your Xbox for 3 MINUTES (to perform a CACHE reset)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -unplug and power your Xbox</p>
<p>3. Redownload your account.</p>

<p>Hey StrikeKnight57, before you get into anything too crazy check the basics first.
</p>
<p>1. What is your NAT type showing as?</p>
<p>2. What are your friends (that you can't connect with) NAT's showing as?</p>
<p>3. Can the people that you are having issues with see you?</p>
<p>4. Are you receiving messages from the problematic friends and vice a versa?</p>
<p>Let me know and maybe we can help you out a little more.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Scorpio sounds like jet engine on some games</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Xbox Scorpio and recently on a few games that are enhanced (Black Desert Online,&nbsp;Operencia) the fan spins up and stays on full pelt and sounds like a jet engine and i'm around 8-10 feet away from it. This is even when just in their games menu,
 if I press home on xbox controller the fans stop until i return back to those games</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other games like ESO, Shadow of War, Tomb Raider, etc, etc that I have set for 4K mode, never make the fans spin like this</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this an issue with the console? Will it need repairing by Microsoft and if so how long do they take to do it?</p>

<p>If you're looking to repair the console you can check the cost and details at <a href="http://devicesupport.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Device Support page here</a>.&nbsp; It might not be a hardware issue, since you're saying it's only seeming to happen during gameplay, when it is working on displaying games and not just the dash or home screen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other reports I've seen of the Xbox One X being loud usually describe it as happening outside of games as well, such as
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/7bgjgg/xbox_one_x_loud_fan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> that has a link to a streamable page of what they are hearing, <a href="https://forums.windowscentral.com/xbox-lounge/467768-xbox-one-x-fan-noise.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
or here</a> that has a buzzing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd ask that you check out this page and make sure that it's<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/ventilation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> properly arranged and configured and none of the vents are blocked.</a></p>
<p>I haven't played Black Desert or Shadow of War, but I have not had any issues or heard it be loud during Tomb Raider or ESO play. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a way to share what the sound is like when it's loud compared to when it's quiet that might help us provide more information and better troubleshooting steps that might be best for you.&nbsp; If not, I'd say take a look at the options, and you can
 always request service from <a href="http://devicesupport.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>It's only the two games I mentioned causing problems, it's like the fan is set for max speed in these games which suggest they aren't optimised or are badly coded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It that bad its worse than my 360 elite and original day one xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other games mentioned have no issues and in fact you don't even hear the fan when running them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Occasionally when the Xbox One X gets hot, the fan may spin up. It used to happen a lot with mine but as late hasn't been an issue. I am in the insider preview program and know that a few others had this issue. It does seem to be limited to certain games,
 I wouldn't be overly worried about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just ensure you keep the vents free from dust and other obstructions and with a good all round air flow and you should be fine.</p>

            This could be several things. Could be that a bug in the dev code of the game is causing the system to ramp up. Also could be the beginning of a larger issue internally. I would keep watch on it and if it continues to happen I would def go for the servicing
 route.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had experienced this loud fan sound, then you would know that it's NOT normal. I always turn my Xbox off when this happens. It feels like the system RAM doesn't unload fast enough, and causes several internal processes to work OTT, which causes heat,
 and the fans to spin up unnecessarily. This can lead to problems, and is not the user's fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not a case of, 'do you want your system to work or not'. Please have more understanding for folks in the community that have issues with their consoles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>L</p>

<p>@njaltheblue vents are clear, xbox in open space with plenty of flow as has always been.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>@drifterx22 if you read post it's only certain games and it happens the minute they start, so it's something to do with them games. I've had every xbox so know what they are like in regards to noise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can play black desert online and within a few minutes the noise is bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I play eso and can do for hours and no noise, this is same for tomb raider, warframe and other games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have cover on it, but don't want to ship it off for repair unless have to, will install the games on another scorpio and see if get same issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Walker,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some games have been known to make the fans work harder on them. Games like Black desert, Red dead redemption 2. This is due to the overwhelming graphics. If it continues to do it with more games or get worse then recommend setting up a repair. You can do
 so on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device support</a>. When you go on the site you can see if the console is in warranty. If it is wouldn't hurt to get repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            This happens to me during certain games too, the console will optimise the fan speed depending on the internal temperature.

<p><strong>I want to thank you for your lack of support to correct my problem. I am one of those who made the mistake by converting to w-10 wich i realized was worst than w-8.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the forum, we can see that many of us asked how to go back to version 8. This mean that v-10 does not meet the satisfaction of your customers. A positive reaction from your side is required immediatly to rectify the bugs. I don't know any company
 who last forever. That why it is important to listen the people in giving satisfaction. V-10 was created too fast for some reasons. The forums confirm this.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My problem still exists and i am really unsatisfied. Competition exists.</strong></p>

<div>"Connection error</div>

<div>Can't start the program. There may be a problem with your Internet connection or the LIVE service.</div>

            Actually I've got the same problem and I browse the internet for the solutions, I've tried the full support suggestions, the re-instals and everything what you can imagine, tomorrow I will reinstal my Win7 than I will see maybe the GFWL doesn't like the
 Net.4, so I try to instal the Net.3.5 first. Will see what happens... :S&nbsp;

            Believe me, I have already gone through that horrid excuse for a website, and all the information presented there is completely worthless. I tried contacting support, but all I could find was that stupid "contact an ambassador" **** which I tried mind
 you, but I was told to contact support, which is what I was trying to do in the first place... Please check the links you've provided, as the first one shows absolutely NOTHING about PC or GfWL on it. The second link is to some forums that I didn't even know
 existed on "xbox.com". The pinned posts all say stuff blaming everything on the users instead of their **** service. I will try posting there next. The third link shows a page I've ran into many times tying to navigate that site, and have already looked through
 it and tried it. Please understand that this worked last time I had checked, which was about a week ago, AND I am not the only one having this problem. It IS NOT anything to do with me, it isn't my fault, no matter how much M$ wants to

<h2>            Windows 10 Version 1607 LTSB Cummulative Updates Fail &#40;KB4103723&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When downloading the Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 (LTSB)&nbsp;for x64-based systems (KB4103720), the process hangs up a 9%, then fails.&nbsp;Error Code: Error 0x80073712.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update is also trying to download the 2018-05 Update (KB4132216) and fails that one also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked back in the update history for this particular remote machine and it appears that this has been going on since October 2017. I have tried to download the update from the Windows Catalog, but that update hangs up when trying to copy the package to
 the cache.</p>

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If you still want to troubleshoot the problem:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding your issue, I would first suggest is to
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<p>Thanks for the replies. I did notice that the update KB had changed to <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
KB4103720. That one is still failing. I have tried to reset windows update, without success.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">One at least one machine, I was able to get the update to install, but it removed my default USB printer. Only uninstalling and reinstalling would allow the printer to be available.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For now, I am hiding the update on all remaining 26 remote machines, hoping the Microsoft determines the cause and fixes it in the June 2018 update. But, this is inconvenient
 because, due to the environment in which they operate, I have to have a person onsite initiate a remote support session.</span></p>

<p>The fact that&nbsp;the KB was replaced points to Microsoft knowing that they missed it on this one. So, I contacted Microsoft Support for help. They wanted me to pay $499 before they would help fix what they broke. I wish my customers would accept that program.
 I could intentionally or unintentionally break code, then charge to fix it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On at least one of my client machines, the process broke a service so that the system started getting the BSOD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, there is how I fixed it</p>
<p>1. Download the KB from the catalog - all 1.2 GB.</p>
<p>2. Disconnect machine from internet</p>
<p>3. Stop Windows Update Service. If it won't stop,&nbsp;set on Disable and&nbsp;Reboot.</p>
<p>4. Manually install the update.</p>
<p>5. If set Windows Update to Disable, re-enable it ad set on Manual</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Reconnect the machine to the Internet to check for additional updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the machine that starting getting BSOD, I had to re-image the drive from a backup image, then manually force the update to install before connecting to the internet. Now to get to the other systems that are spread out over 8 states.</p>

<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">pre-installed</span>. I have a DVD from&nbsp;Dell titled Reinstallation DVD Windows Vista Home Premium 32 BIT SP1. Can I make a bootable flash drive from this DVD and if so, how do I do it? I have another computer that I can

            <p>It would help if you said exactly what problems you are trying to correct in VISTA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where you may need that USB Flash Drive for a repair Upgrade Install</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be a good idea to run the System File Checker Tool&nbsp;if you have corrupt files</p>
<p>"How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7"</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></p>
<p>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, click
<strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click <strong>
Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>. </li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>sfc /scannow</span></div>
The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If SFC finds serious faults, you may have to do a Repair Upgrade&nbsp;Installation, or full reinstall if you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can borrow a Microsoft Vista DVD&nbsp;you save doing a full reinstall:</p>

</p><p>If&nbsp;you have the legal&nbsp;right to make a copy of the recovery media on USB stick and if you do not violate any license agreement:</p>
<p>1. Capture the DVD content&nbsp;to an ISO file</p>
<p>2. Write that bootable ISO file to USB stick&nbsp;using a tool</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. To capture DVD to ISO you may use CDBurnerXP:</p>
<p><a href="https://cdburnerxp.se/en/us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://cdburnerxp.se/en/us</a></p>
<p>At startup choose "Copy/grab disc" ( 4th option )</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. To write the bootable ISO to USB stick you may use Rufus -&nbsp;it is a&nbsp;widely-used tool</p>

            <p>Greetings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I was trying to reconstruct the problems I had with my computer, there was a surprising development.&nbsp;As I was repeating some of the steps today&nbsp;to make notes of them, the computer successfully booted up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yesterday the system would not boot up and displayed a gray screen saying windows did not start, with the option to run System Repair highlighted. System Repair would run briefly
 and display a message -&nbsp;Windows Cannot Repair This Computer Automatically. I went through these steps several times
</span>yesterday <span>
with the same results. There was also a chkdsk initiated during one of these steps and some disk&nbsp;problems were corrected. When the system booted up today, there was a problem with some updates to AOL which it was attempting to apply but could not complete.
 I installed the latest version of AOL and those problems went away. At this time, I am proceeding cautiously.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much&nbsp;for all of the suggestions and I may have to refer back to them in the future.</p>

<h2>            Laptop won&#39;t print in colour</h2>
                    <p>I cannot print in colour from my laptop. It prints in colour from my phone, which suggests there is a problem with the system on my laptop. Does anyone have any ideas how to fix this, please?</p>
<p>

            Hi ColinFoord-Divers,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />What's the make and model of the printer?
<br />
<br />Did you download the latest Windows 10 drivers for it from the manufacturer's website?
<br />
<br />Regards.       
        </p>

            Hi ColinFoord-Divers
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps, Connect your Printer to the computer and Switch it ON. In case of Wireless printer, Switch it ON and connect it to the Wifi network.
<br />
<br />1. Run printer troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; On the right side, Click Printer &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />If you have HP Printer - HP provides a tool for HP printers to troubleshoot - HP Print and Scan Doctor. Download it, launch it and follow the onscreen directions to locate problems and fix them
<br />
<br />Download Link - <a href="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/printers/hppsdr/HPPSdr.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ftp.hp.com/pub/printers/hppsdr/HPPSdr.exe</a>
<br />
<br />2. Update Printer Driver
<br />Download printer driver from printer manufacturer's website and reinstall.
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall and reinstall the Printer (Credit to Andre Da Costa, MVP for providing steps)
<br />A. Uninstall Printer
<br />Click on Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Scroll down and click Programs and Features &gt; Select your printer &gt; Select Uninstall
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Select your printer &gt; Remove device
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Scroll down and click Print server properties under Related settings &gt; Under Driver tab, look for your printer &gt; Select it and click Remove button at the bottom
<br />
<br />B. Install Printer 
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers &gt; Reinstall the Printer driver &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; On Right side, Click Add a printer or scanner &gt; If Windows detects your printer, it will be listed &gt; Select the printer and follow on screen directions to set it up (In case of Wifi printer, your computer should also be logged into Wifi network)
<br />If Windows doesn't detect your printer, then you will get a blue message - Click The printer that I want isn't listed
<br />If you are using Bluetooth / Wirelss printer &gt; Select Add a Bluetooth, wireless or network discoverable printer &gt; Choose the printer &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />If you are using wired printer &gt; Select Add a local printer or network printer  with manual settings &gt; Select Use an existing port &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />
<br />4. Clear Spooler
<br />Type Services in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to Print Spooler &gt; Right-click and choose Stop for the Print Spooler service &gt; Go to C:\WINDOWS\System32\spool\PRINTERS. You can also type %windir%\System32\spool\PRINTERS into the address bar in Explorer if the C drive is not the default Windows partition &gt; Delete all the files in this folder &gt; Services console and right-click and choose Start for the Print Spooler service
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Hi Vijay</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this. The problem is when I'm on Word which has some colour pictures and then I go to print - there are no options for colour/monochrome printing, when there should be. I need to be able to access these options - how do I restore them?</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Sometimes a simple remove and readd of printer can fix driver issues.
<br />To do this go to start - settings - devices - printers and scanners.
<br />Select your printer and hit remove.
<br />Then in same window click add printer and reinstall your printer.

<h2>            Hyper-V causing boot loop in Windows 10 Pro x64</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 x64 Pro from Windows 8.1 x64 Pro and activating Hyper-V in Windows 10 x64 Pro my computer reboots.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a couple of tries it goes in automatic repair and attempts to repair the startup.&nbsp;&nbsp; This cycle just repeats itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I tried many combinations of things in the bios, shutting down, reseting the defaults in bios and nothing has worked so far.&nbsp;&nbsp; I rolled back to Windows 8.1 Pro and Hyper-V works fine.&nbsp; I use Hyper-V with the emulators for phone and tablets in Visual Studio
 2013 and 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp; Re installed the upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and activated Hyper-V and same reboot loop occurs.&nbsp; The only way I can boot into Windows 10 x64 Pro is disable Virtualization in bios.&nbsp; Anyone else having similar problems with hyper-V on Windows
 10 x64 Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help?</p>

            Yep experiencing same problem, only difference is upgraded from Win8.1 Enterprise to Win10 Enterprise.&nbsp; Hyper-V was 100% operational for over 1 year on 8.1 using the exact same hardware &amp; BIOS settings.&nbsp; Tried disabling USB, no dice &amp; zero bluetooth devices
 so ruled out those.&nbsp; Core i7 920 running on EVGA x58 mobo so perhaps Win10 doesn't play nice with Hyper-V &amp; the i7 despite 8.1 working flawless with the same hardware.

    <title>Freshly Installed Windows 7 RAM Usage Gradually Increasing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trentthomas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freshly Installed Windows 7 RAM Usage Gradually Increasing</h2>
                    <p>So I have a lot of experience in building custom Windows images, and I'm running into a problem. Essentially, after a fresh install of one of my custom Windows 7 images, and after installing all available Windows Updates, my RAM initially sits at 500MB.
 However, over time, without me interacting with the OS at all (no application is open except task manager), the RAM usage gradually increases to 1.7GB+.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What really confuses me is that I've gone into Task Manager, showed all processes for all users, and manually added up the memory usage for each process, and the total comes out to approximately 150MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Cleared Windows Update DataStore</li><li>Repaired Windows Update Components</li><li>Disabled Windows Update and its services<br />
</li><li>Disabled Indexing</li><li>Cleared temporary files</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>That last one did help significantly, dropping the RAM usage from 1.7GB to 500MB; however, given enough time it just keep creeping back up to 1.7GB. Repeatedly running disk cleaner helps, but it's not a permanent fix, and I shouldn't have to run it several
 times every 15-20 minutes.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if anyone has any recommended solutions that I haven't already tried? Due to the nature of this image, it's very important that the image uses as little RAM as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp;<span>I should probably also specify that this image is specialized for running in Virtual Machines. it's not that I can't give it more RAM, it's more of the fact that I've managed to have it consistently using 500MB

<p>I only attempted to disable indexing and Windows Update temporarily to see if they made a difference, and since they didn't, I turned them back on.<br />
<br />
The problem is not that I need more RAM, the problem is that the system should be using far less than it does, therefore the virtual memory solution does not apply to my situation. That's basically attempting to treat a symptom instead of curing the disease.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in my original post, I already attempted to clear out temporary files, and as I said, running disk cleanup helps, it only helps temporarily and very quickly the RAM usage is back up to 1.7GB+</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed the system restore component from the image, so that suggestion is a no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have completely removed the entire Internet Explorer Engine and Internet Explorer from this image, so there's no Internet Options to interact with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The disk is a fresh install of Windows, occupying less than 8GB of space. I've also removed the defrag component as well, so again, a no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should probably also specify that this image is specialized for running in Virtual Machines, it's not that I can't give it more RAM, it's more of the fact that I've managed to have it consistently using 500MB of RAM when idle in the past, and based on
 user-requirements, the machines need to be able to consume less than 3GB of RAM including all required programs, and this just isn't feasible if I do not resolve this problem.</p>

<p>I have no idea what the problem might be but maybe if you add some details somebody will get some ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keeping in mind that we can't see what you are seeing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where and how are you measuring/seeing that the RAM "initially sits at 500MB"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where and how are you measuring/seeing the "RAM usage gradually increases to 1.7GB+"</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Task Manger what column are you adding up to get the "total comes out to approximately 150MB"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say you could "<span>give it more RAM" - how would you do that?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>None of your images prior to this one seem to have this issue?</span></p>

<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Task Manager's Performance tab to monitor the total RAM usage. In the past, I've been able to leave the VM sitting for hours and it consistently remained between 470MB and 520MB of RAM usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon writing the OP, over the course of 20-30 minutes, the total RAM usage displayed in Task Manager's Performance tab climbs to ~1.7GB. Now it quickly climbs to 2.7GB out of 3GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realized that my Task Manager was showing me just the private working set for memory, instead of also showing me the working set for memory. When I add both columns and Kernel Memory, it's much closer to what Task Manager is reporting in the Performance
 tab, so perhaps that would explain the rest of that. Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm by no means an expert in how Task Manager categorizes memory usage. TrustedInstaller and svchost.exe are both taking up about 200MB each. This would make sense if my problem
 is tied to Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned in my reply to Andrew and my edit to my OP that this image is designed for use in VMs, so giving it more RAM would mean allocating more memory to the virtual machine. But like I mentioned to Andrew, that would be merely compensating for the symptoms
 rather than treating the disease.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had this problem on previous images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hypothesis so far is that something has gone wrong with Windows Updates, and that may be causing the problem. I noticed this problem after some updates failed to install, but following the steps I mentioned in my OP and my reply to Andrew, no difference
 was made. I'm basically stuck in this loop where every time I check the shutdown/restart option, it shows that it is wanting to install pending updates. Every time I restart, it reports to me that the updates failed, and it just does the same thing every restart.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#42;Windows 10&#42; Windows cannot find &#39;&#39;&#39;. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again</h2>
                    <p>Help!!</p>
<p>I need help for this weird error. My avast anti virus has removed a virus recently and now my Windows 10 Home ended up cannot open any apps which require admin privileges. I have tried many ways to fix this problem including further virus scanning and resetting
 the folder options but still not working. I also tried system reset but it still doesn't work at all. Now I can't even use regedit , taskmanager , ccleaner and saying windows cannot find C:\Windows\system 32\taskmgr.exe' Make sure you typed the name correctly,
 and then try again. And same type of message to any programs which requires system privilege.&nbsp; Other apps which don't require admin privilege such as google chrome are working properly and won't show the message on click.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I found out taskmgr and regedit&nbsp; are working in safe mode and same as those apps require admin privilege so I am pretty sure the removal of virus has done some changes to my system settings. Any helps and suggestions for tackling this difficult
 problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
