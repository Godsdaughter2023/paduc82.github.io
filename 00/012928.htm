<p>Thank you Palcouk.&nbsp; Absolutely right, most of my emails downloaded, but not all.&nbsp; I checked back on the server and about 4 months of email is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's not a major issue, but how can I retrieve my Contacts, Calendar, Notes, etc?&nbsp; Can I set up IMAP email account using the original settings and password please?</p>

<p>If you used an IMAP account previously, the folders for Contacts/Calendar/Tasks would be designated "This PC Only" and when the mail account was reset (or deleted) these folders would be lost</p>

https://www.msoutlook.info/question/do-not-risk-losing-your-contacts-and-calendar-when-using-imap</a></p>
<p>Only a pop or Exchange mail account retains these folders</p>
<p>When your mail account is accessed via web browser, are these missing mails shown there?

<p>Thanks for the link, interesting.&nbsp; The POP account is preferable for me, and I backup Outlook when I backup my documents etc.&nbsp; Previously Outlook kept hanging while it tried to synchronise my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The missing emails are not on the Web browser, but I have a backup .ost file.&nbsp; I see there are apps for converting .ost to .pst and then I could import the converted file.&nbsp; What do you think?</p>

    <title>Chrome&#58; Cannot open Office Desktop Applications - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bwilkerson217  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chrome&#58; Cannot open Office Desktop Applications</h2>
                    <p>I have this problem where many of my students and teachers are not reading the prompts when trying to open an Office Online document with the installed application.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they browse SharePoint or OneDrive online to open a document they often will choose
 to open it within the full application.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they are using Chrome they get a prompt like the one below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f185fa15-4631-4c06-ad7a-454718785f0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f185fa15-4631-4c06-ad7a-454718785f0b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think they are checking the remember my choice box and hitting enter which seems to default to Don't Open.&nbsp;&nbsp; From that point Chrome blocks opening documents within the full application forever.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the life of me I cannot find the setting where to change
 this within the Chrome browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I found to fix this is to delete the User Data folder found in the users AppData folder here \AppData\Local\Google\Chrome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While that works it is not something I have been able to direct end users to do and I would really like to find the
 Chrome Setting to reset or clear this so I can make a FAQ about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Reset Settings under Advanced Settings does not work.</p>

            <p>Hi BWilkerson217,<br />
<br />
To open documents in SharePoint Online with the Office desktop client, we can configure it as below:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Go to the library where the documents are stored with classic UI.&nbsp;<br />
2. Click LIBRARY &gt; Library Settings &gt; Advanced settings.&nbsp;<br />
3. In the Opening Documents in the Browser option, select Open in the client application.&nbsp;<br />
4. Click OK.&nbsp;<br />
5. Open the document to check if you can open it with the Office desktop client.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In addition, we can open it with Office applications via the following steps:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In libraries with new experience, click ellipsis next to the document title &gt; Open &gt; Open in Word/Excel.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04122c95-254c-4360-aced-ec46030ea240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04122c95-254c-4360-aced-ec46030ea240" /></a><br />
With the classic UI, click the ellipsis next to the document title &gt; ellipsis &gt; Open in Word/Excel.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d7c195a-e24f-47ab-8f09-a7755223f3c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d7c195a-e24f-47ab-8f09-a7755223f3c5" /></a></p>
<p>For the Chrome Settings you mentioned, I would suggest you clear browser cache to check if the issue can be fixed via More tools &gt; Clear browsing data.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley<br />

            <p>Shirley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your suggestions and the on opening the file with the client application are fine as it will open for other users or if the affected user uses another browser on that same computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearing Browsing Data in Chrome has no affect.&nbsp; I literally have to delete the entire "User Data" folder under the users AppData.</p>

<h2>            Open Sharepoint Online links locally in Explorer&#47;OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we are using Sharepoint Online / Office 365. On my Win10 machine I have installed OneDrive and have connected the Sharepoint library so I can work with the files in the Windows Explorer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, when I receive or open a link to a file in the sharepoint library, I click the link and my internet browser opens and the file/folder is shown in the internet browser.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I want that on my Win10 machine this file/folder opens in the Windows Explorer / local OneDrive so I can work with the files locally and not through the internet browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to I have to configure Win10 / Sharepoint / OneDrive so I can work this way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance! </p>

<p><span>Hi Maddhin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You mentioned “I receive or open a link to a file in the SharePoint library</span>”, does this mean that a link to a file or folder is sent directly to you when someone else shares a file or folder with you? If so, there’s no out of the box
 way to open the link of file or folder in the Windows Explorer / local OneDrive directly.</p>

    <title>Calendar appoints off 1 hour on Sprint Touch Pro 2 after ActiveSync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> engraveer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar appoints off 1 hour on Sprint Touch Pro 2 after ActiveSync although correct on PC in Microsoft Outlook... argh&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I've got a Daylight Savings Time problem that's putting me on a path towards alcoholism. Let me set the stage...<br />
<br />
I'm running a Sprint Touch Pro 2 w/ WM6.5.3. Desktop PC is Win XP, Outlook 2003 &amp; ActiveSync 4.5. I keep the PC continually up-to-date with Microsoft Update.&nbsp; All latest updates have been applied. On the TP2, I've installed the Daylight Savings Time fix from
 Microsoft found here...<br />
<br />
[url]https://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/daylight-savings-update.mspx[/url]<br />
<br />
Off a hard reset (I installed the Microsoft DST fix immediately after the hard reset) when I sync the TP2 with my PC via ActiveSync, all of my appointments on the TP2 during the 2010 DST period (March 14 thru November 7) are off 1 hour (i.e. an appointment
 that shows correctly starting at 2pm in Outlook on my PC shows a start time of 1pm on my TP2). Note that this ONLY happens during the DST period. My meeting on March 13, 2010 displays the correct times on the TP2. My daughter's piano recital the next day on
 March 14th (after the time change) does not. My appointment on October 31st displays one hour early. My next appointment on November 13th (after the time change) displays correctly.<br />
<br />
This doesn't seem to be a widespread problem for folks like the 2016 text message bug. Searching for a solution here and on the various phone forums, only a handful of folks seem to be having the same problem and a chunk of those are having a problem with birthdays
 displaying on the wrong days, not appointments with incorrect start times. No one seems to have found a fix though.<br />
<br />
SOMEBODY out there has had to have experienced this same problem and solved it. I've tried every update and reset suggested in the searches I've found, and to-date, nothing has worked. I'm at wits end and am running out of booze to make the problem go away
 (I've got to say that to put a smile on my face!)<br />
<br />
Please help me.

Jack:<br />
<br />
Appreciate the response. As indicated in my initial post, I installed that fix at the link you posted on my Touch Pro 2.&nbsp; I downloaded the CAB package directly to my phone and ran it. Had absolutely no effect on the problem.&nbsp; Everything the same as it was before
 I ran it.<br />
<br />
I still haven't identified whether or not the problem is with the phone (Windows Mobile) or on the PC (WinXP and/or Outlook 2003... perhaps even ActiveSync 4.5).&nbsp; I've kept my PC updated thru Microsoft Update.&nbsp; Would that take care of any Daylight Savings Time
 updates/fixes or is there another patch(es)/fix(es) that I should run to make certain it's not a problem on the PC?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Rick

            I was just making sure that you ran the PC update and not just the phone cab file<br />
<br />
Did you try changing the timezone on your device then soft reset and bring it back to the correct timezone?<br />
<br />
What zone are you in BTW?<br />

Jack, could you post a link to the latest DST update for my PC? I installed one from back in 2008... is that the most recent?<br />
<br />
Just found on another forum that a user thinks he solved the problem by doing the following on his phone... Went in to his phone's settings and turned OFF the setting to sync his phone's time with the mobile network automatically.&nbsp; Then changed his timezone
 to GMT Coordinated Universal Time.&nbsp; Soft reset... phone still on GMT. Then reset the timezone to his location. Soft reset. At that point, he indicated his one-time appointments within the DST period were correct, but the recurring appointments were off.&nbsp; Said
 he manually went in on the phone calendar and adjusted those.&nbsp; Synced with Outlook on his PC and everything was correct on both the PC and phone.&nbsp; Said everything held after the clock flipped over to the next day and after a soft reset.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not certain if he left the setting to sync his phone's time to the network "off" or if he turned it back "on" after following those steps.&nbsp; Are there any problems you see with leaving that setting "off"?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on this?<br />
<br />
I'm in the Eastern US timezone (GMT-5).

            For what it's worth, I discovered this problem on my relatively new Verizon HTC Touch Pro2 a couple of weeks ago (running WM 6.1).&nbsp; After spending a lot of time trying to figure out what setting to change on the phone, I found the DST update on the Microsoft
 website and installed it, and the problem went away.<br />
<br />
However, today, I was looking at a calendar entry in March and discovered all the times were off by 1 hour again.&nbsp; I tried reinstalling the update, and it made no difference.&nbsp; So I just uninstalled the update and now all the times are correct.&nbsp; I don't understand
 why I had the problem in the first place, why the DST update fixed it (or seemed to), or why the problem recurred.&nbsp; However, you might want to try uninstalling the update to see what happens.

            I am having the same DST problem. &nbsp;After fiddling with settings, and finally getting them back to where they started, appointments generated after March 13, on the phone, appear one hour LATER on my desktop. &nbsp;Appointments generated on my desktop appear
 one hour EARLIER on my phone.

            I've started having this same problem this week also. I'm in New Zealand and all my Windows Mobile appointments are now an hour earlier. I'm running 6.5 and Windows 7 with all updates applied.What was weird is before it started happening my phone said
 it had applied daylight savings changes a couple of days ago. What's changed this week? I also have installed the DST update KB975353, and it hasn't changed? Also running Office 2010, again all fully patched.

                    <p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Help! Inbox and sweep rule does not seems to apply on junk folder</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using <strong>Hotmail.com</strong> email address and need to block/delete&nbsp;email coming from&nbsp;various website
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">based on certain keyword in subject/body</span>. These email come to my junk folder and my Junk email filter is set to exclusive . I created several filters to&nbsp;block/delete email&nbsp;from both&nbsp;inbox/junk folder but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps: I created a filter by going to Option -&gt; <strong>Inbox and sweep rules </strong>
-&gt; +&nbsp;(Add) --&gt; &nbsp;Condition == "It include these words in the subject or body" --&gt; Specify word == "<em>Spam-word"&nbsp;-</em>-&gt;&nbsp;+ (Add) --&gt; &nbsp;Action == "Delete the message"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the inbox rule filter is properly setup&nbsp;with this keyword; Yet I continue to get these spammed email in my junk folder with this
<em>"spam-word" </em>I want to block. These email are not coming from my safe-sender list but from strangers/spammers. I can't&nbsp;use the domain name to block sender as there are so many and it kept popping up</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if this is know limitation/bug with Hotmail.com domain where junk email filter does not work with subject/body filter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was anyone able to get this word based filter to work to block email to show up on junk folder&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I am&nbsp;using&nbsp;Hotmail.com and NOT outlook.com email address account via Outlook mail</p>

<p class="contentHeader2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Update:</strong></span>
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">It looks like&nbsp;when I&nbsp;change the Junk folder filter setting from Exclusive to Standard the word based inbox&nbsp;filter is working. It&nbsp;now going to deleted folder directly&nbsp;that is OK for now (though I prefer for such email to not show

<p>Thanks Rey,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If you have any interaction with development team @ Microsoft it will be really nice to ask their help to enhance spam filter. As I reported, it will be useful if spam filter can be configured such that it block spam/curse-email to even show up in junk/deleted
 folder with "Exclusive" setting for email. Spam is becoming a huge problem for everyone and I look up to Microsoft leadership to help provide better tools and filter for safe and pleasant experience</p>

<p>If the messages are arriving in your Junk Email folder, they are already considered blocked. You cannot prevent the delivery outright, only control the destination folder. Moreover, rules work only on messages arriving in the Inbox. They are not applied

<p>Thank you Brian,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Understood. To me "block" means email to not showup anywhere in any folder- inbox/junk/deleted folder. This term apply well to filters with doamain/email address; however word base block filter still make email to be left in deleted folder and I rather
 not see such email anywhere</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be nice when block&nbsp;means completely blocked and I dont&nbsp;see the email in any folder when I apply word based filter</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to find such filter.</p>

<p>Not so!&nbsp;Selecting the "Exclusive" option still let the spams and the junk mail through! Not all - but more than half. And the&nbsp;other half - often along with the legitimate mail&nbsp;- goes to the junk folder.</p>
<p>Two shortcomings here: One is that one cannot have the option that only the those emails come into the Inbox (or any box), which&nbsp;senders are on the address book or on the safe list.</p>
<p>Secondly, in spite of the phony sender addresses MS&nbsp;knows the actual sender's address and should bounce back the trash.

            <p>Hi Gannoc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear this is happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While we wait for a Community Moderator or Support Engineer to assist you, I'm just curious, have you tried creating another account for testing purposes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be curious to see if that new account functions properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, we'll do our best to get you back up and running with your existing account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and best regards,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

            <p>Good idea. &nbsp;With a new outlook.com account, I &nbsp;had no problems, and all functions work quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was even able to import a few hundred emails from gmail, move them, delete them, empty trash, etc, with no issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account connects to "bay181.mail.live.com" vs "bay77.mail.live.com", so that might be a difference.<br />
</p>
<p>So, hopefully someone at microsoft can "Reset" my account to me a new account and all my problems will go &nbsp;away.</p>

</p><p>The same problem is still there. &nbsp;If I try to delete or move several things, it breaks after 75 or 100 items with the cannot connect message, and I can see 503 errors from the server as it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the new account I created, everything is fast and works fine, so it could be the server I'm on (bay177) or something odd about my account itself. &nbsp; Please let me know if you need any other info.</p>

 I&nbsp;input any of these three accounts and click&nbsp;<em>forgot password</em>,&nbsp;they will be identified and allow me to send a code to my email address. Using this code, I can reset the password for just that account. It does not affect the others. Is your old Skype
 account listed there when you perform a <em>forgot username? </em>If it is not, it is currently associated with a different email address or possibly deleted. If it is, under normal circumstances there should be no reason you cannot reset the password for
 that account. I would only wonder if the account was in some other state like suspended or deleted, if the option was not made available.

<h2>            Android app Allowing You to See Outlook Calendar Events on lockscreen</h2>
                    <p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to give up using my beloved Lumia 950XL last year due to the lack of app support (and the loss of Groove Music...more on that later).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, I now have an android phone, but I cannot figure out how I can see my next upcoming calendar meeting/events in my Outlook. I can only see Google Calendar events, but I use Outlook/Office 365 as my primary calendars for word, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of my colleagues use Glance Plus (TM) as an app, but it only shows Google Calendar events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be wonderful,</p>
<p>Thanks so very much:)</p>

</p><p>Thanks for posting the question you encountered in our forum. According to my test, in
<span>latest version of </span>outlook for Android, we can view the calendar events as the following picture shows. I suggest install Outlook for Android on your phone. You can search it &nbsp;in app store on your phone to download and install it. And then add your
 Office 365 account in it to meet you goal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have any doubts, please feel free to let me know.</p>

<p>Hi Coldwell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your input. I do indeed have the outlook android app on my phone and I see how to get to the calendar. The problem though is that I would like to be able to see my upcoming events when the cell phone screen is dark (or asleep or on standby?).&nbsp;
 The Windows 10 mobile had a great feature where you could "glace" at your clock, date, and your upcoming event on while you phone was in standby. That's my frustrating issue. I can get plenty of apps that allow me to see my upcoming events in the google calendar,
 but not one that can work with the outlook calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that clarify things better? Sorry for not communicating well,</p>
<p>R:)</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;ReginaldWilliams,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to my test and research, the feature that viewing the upcoming events when Android phone screen is dark in is not available now. I suggest submit your feedback in your outlook for Android: click settings (the gear)&gt; Help and feedback&gt; suggest a
 feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and understanding.</p>

            I'm sorry to hear of your trouble with your E71.<br />
There certainly seems to be an issue with your phone and it would be best to go back to your dealer or have it checked out by a Nokia Care technician.<br />
<br />
However, don't let one phone sour your experience of Nokia E71 as a whole. I have a few colleagues who have bought the same model and they are enjoying their phones to the hilt. :D They have not experienced any issues that you have mentioned.<br />
<br />
I hope you give it another chance. It's a beautiful phone and I'm very, very tempted to get one myself after playing with my colleague's phone at work. :)

            have you even read some of the posts in this forum?<br />
<br />
the phones firmware is in an early alpha stage (if even that)!<br />
<br />
I wouldn't dare to submit a software like this to our verification departement (they would ripp my head off) not to mention to SELL something like that!<br />
<br />
The E71 was my LAST nokia!

<p>I spent a good part of the day going back and forth with what is called "customer support" in the Philippines.&nbsp; My problem is that the maps program always gives me an error message stating that "Incompatible licenses found."&nbsp; They had me bring the phone
 back to the default settings only to discover that was not the problem.&nbsp; What a bunch of&nbsp;bozos.&nbsp; They can barely speak English and appear to be incompetent.&nbsp; To reload the maps it takes over an hour and a half and their only response was that they were sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sent an email to see if I can get my money back for the phone.&nbsp; I will never buy another Nokia product given their poor software and customer support.</p>

    <title>how to make a favorites contact list as well as other contacts list. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeyjokester  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to make a favorites contact list as well as other contacts list.</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to have several contacts lists: a drinking contact list, a favorites contact list, a poker night contact list, a university contact list, etc.</p>
<p>I need the ability to easily distinguish all my 500+ contacts apart, and it's great to have the complete list of contacts from facebook,myspace,hotmail,etc., but I don't call 75% of those people more than 2-3x a year. There is a list of about 20-30 people
 that I call regularly, and so I would like a contacts list to be able to just put those 20-30 people. I also have people that I call for school related purposes, and so I would like a school related contacts list for people I only call while at school.</p>
<p>Pinning things to the main menu as tiles is an ok idea, but eventually you have a billion tiles and sifting through them all becomes obnoxious. For this reason, I really need the ability to have a favorites contact list. This is not something I consider
 to be a luxury. This is a feature I consider to be a necessity that should be available on all phones.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Pressing the hash (#) key cycles through the different options (lower case, upper case, numeric keypad etc.), and once you cycled through all of the options without predictive text, you cycle through the same options with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the top right corner of the screen, you should see a small 'pencil' symbol followed by ABC, abc et cetera; if you also have a couple of wavy lines to the left of the pencil icon, then the predictive text is switched on.</p>

</p><p>I can not sign in to ANY office app, none of them, not a single app in the microsoft office suite, I cannot sign into onenote, I cannot sign into word, I cannot sign into excel, nor can I sign into any other office app</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signing into the app in important so I can sync my files and use them on other devices, to be clear, this means I need to sign into the office apps which I can not do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- If I download the files, but I can not sign in I cannot sync the files to use on another device:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ie:&nbsp; If I download to my PC and make changes, I cannot then see these changes on my laptop&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This means if I make any changes offline on my laptop, once online I cannot sync the files to use later on my PC</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of these questions are answered in my post - let me copy paste those for you</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can sign in on the browser but when I click to launch the app I get a permission error</p>
<p>When I sign into any Office app - I get no error, it just remains not signed in&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is office 2016 as stated in the title of the post</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you already try to uninstall and reinstall your Office product. Once you already installed it successfully there is no need for you to sign in with the application. And to clarify, what is the exact license of Office that you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you tried to launch the app and getting the a permission, can you try to provide us a screenshot of it for us to get a better view of your concern.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the screenshot that you've provided, when you click on the "Yes" button, the OneNote 2016 app will ask you to sign. Just to clarify, what is happening when you sign in to OneNote after clicking on the "Yes" button? Please take note that you need
 to sign in to OneNote so that you can access and edit your OneNote Notebooks that are saved from your OneDrive. We would like to know if you're also experiencing the same concern when you open your Word or Excel files from the OneDive website to your Word
 or Excel app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, you can download your files from your OneDrive to your computer so that you can access them even if you're offline. Please take note that you will not be able to download OneNote files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

</p><p>Good day, I have previously answered all these questions in this thread, I have now updated the main post as apparently it was too hard to understand.</p>
<p>I do need to sign in to save and sync the files for use on other devices, which is the whole point of signing in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot sign in to ANY app.</p>
<p>I still need to be able to sign in to the office apps - if I do work offline, then I cannot sync that work when I am online, meaning I need to save to a separate portable drive and risk losing work - I need to be able to sign in to the apps!</p>

 and forth to previous days'&nbsp;wallpapers. How come? I absolutely LOVE Bing's wallpapers!! Since saving them, there's only one that&nbsp;I didn't like, truly......</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;SBernheart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried replicating your issue here on our end. We tried to download the wallpaper from<a href="https://www.bing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">www.bing.com</span></em></strong></a>. Upon checking, the option to download the wallpaper is still available here on our end. On this scenario, we set our region to United States - English. Here's a screenshot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34b18d9d-0518-4b56-8d22-1fc39656e551?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34b18d9d-0518-4b56-8d22-1fc39656e551?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When we tried using a different region, the option to download the image is no longer available. Here's a sample screenshot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e799506e-9b5e-4905-8d9d-eb2971df2715?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e799506e-9b5e-4905-8d9d-eb2971df2715?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like the option to download the image depends on the region that is set on Bing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to this <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong><a href="https://www.bing.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em></span>.</p>
<p>2. On the left side pane, select <strong>Country/Region</strong>.</p>
<p>3. After selecting a country, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

            The syncing is using OneNote 2010 on Windows 7. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am an IT Director at Auburn University. &nbsp;We have a mandatory tablet computer program for our 440 DVM students. &nbsp;All of them are hitting this problem. &nbsp;We print lots of ppt files as handouts into onenote and then they take notes on them. &nbsp;We opened a
 case a while ago and we were told there was no real solution. &nbsp;However, I have been reading online that MS is going to increase the file size limit. &nbsp;I can get around the problem using the new skydrive windows app by saving my notebooks to the synced directory
 on my local computer and letting the app sync it to skydrive instead of OneNote. &nbsp;However, I can't get files greater than 100MB to sync. &nbsp;I can reproduce this very easily. &nbsp;I simply attach a 100+MB files to a page in OneNote and then sync it. &nbsp;It fails every
 time. &nbsp;Remove the file and it start syncing again. &nbsp;My live ID is burtash. &nbsp;I have an unfiled notes notebook on skydrive that has a page named "large file" that is breaking syncing with error&nbsp;</div>

<span>Hi Bill,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I will send a closing email today.</span></p>
<p>
<span>I have also sent a request to the dev team to have this considered for future releases of Office to increase the filesize.</span></p>
<p>
<span>I gave them the scenario in which your use OneNote and SkyDrive in order to help them better understand scenarios like yours and why the increase should be considered.</span></p>

            <p>@ashley_auburn,</p>
<p>I am actually a veterinary student at Tennessee, and I have hit the same problem. I recently purchased a windows tablet in order to have access to my OneNote folders of class/lab materials on clinics, and have realized that this sync with OneDrive is not
 as easy as I imagined! The 100mb folder size limit is a major glitch with OneNote 2013 as well, and I'm disappointed that Microsoft isn't able to accommodate large collections of printouts after this many windows updates (including the overhaul with Windows
 8).</p>
<p>Any information or any alternative solutions you or your students have discovered would be REALLY helpful!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ashley&nbsp;</p>

            I have a notebook that isn't sync'ing, but onedrive.live.com is actually reporting it as 300mb. Is that actually the new file size limit?

<p>Is using a file server something that someone can do in an individual capacity or is it more of a large scale, sharepoint type program? I am just trying to figure out what might be my best option at this point with all of these large OneNote files. Any advice

<p>My advice...</p>
<p>Buy a few cheap usb thumb drives or a usb hard drive. &nbsp;Every week open your backups folder (usually C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote\15.0\Backup ... &nbsp;to check file -&gt; open backups in onenote) and copy everything in there to your usb
 drive. &nbsp;It has saved many of our students. &nbsp;If you want to get fancy, you could use a sync tool like syncback (free) to copy your backup folder to another location.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>

<p>I cannot see much information available for this error code, can you please double check it? Can you also provide the additional information requested by Jack about your phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please try using a data connection and WiFi connection on the phone to download the app - do you still get an error using both connections?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please ensure cookies are enabled on your phone and try clearing&nbsp;the browsing history (go to Settings &gt; Internet Exlporer &gt; ...).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you check if you are able to download apps from your computer on <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Outlook 2016 &#47; 365 Will not add second exchange account</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; Here is my situation, I have Outlook 2016 (which somehow became Outlook 365) on my PC.&nbsp; It had several accounts on it.&nbsp; I had to reinstall some accounts on a new computer.&nbsp; The first exchange worked great.&nbsp; The second did not.&nbsp; It gave the very unclear
 error that something went wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent a day with pointing between one my hosted exchange companies, my DNS, and now Microsoft.&nbsp; Trying to removal variables, I cancelled my hosted exchange and moved it to my DNS (godaddy) which now has both my accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still cannot get the second account to load.&nbsp; I have switched the first and second, and only the first one I put in does not get the error.&nbsp; I never had multiple profiles, and I really need to avoid that.&nbsp; It worked before, now it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have this problem?&nbsp; Fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much in Advance!</p>

            So the accounts weren't previously set up on this computer? That pretty much eliminates the need to delete credentials from credential manager. 
<br />
<br />Try disabling IPv6 on your network card. 
<br />
<br />You can also try the support and recovery utility - see if it is on the File tab under Support. (I thought its included in all builds now.)

<p>This could be your problem: outlook.com is in the middle of upgrading some of us, me included have read only access to calendars while the upgrade is taking place.</p>
<p>It's been handled very badly if you ask me, even microsoft don't know whats going on if you ask them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On outlook.com there should be a one liner somewhere that tells you.</p>

    <title>IE Save Image As command on images will only save file as a bitmap - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasepeters  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE Save Image As command on images will only save file as a bitmap</h2>
                    When I open an image, and then try to save it by right clicking and selecting "Save Image As" it will only allow me to save as a bitmap file, not by the original file extension.<br />
However if I do not open the image and instead right click on the link and use "Save Target As", it will still save with the original file extension.<br />
Why is it doing this?&nbsp; It started only this morning.&nbsp; Less than 24 hours ago the "Save Image As" command was working just fine.<br />
I have already tried the fixes that were listed for the older versions of IE, I cleared the temporary files, cleared the damaged downloaded programs files, then cleared the entire downloaded programs files, and finally moved the Temporary Internet Files Folder
 to a new location as instructed here: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/810978" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/810978</a>.&nbsp; Nothing worked.&nbsp; So then I reset IE8 to original, and that has not worked either.<br />
What do I do now?<br />

<p>Hi ThomasEPeters,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>Following all the steps you mentioned should have fixed the Internet Explorer (IE) issue saving image only as bitmap file.
<br />
<br />
By the way, what is the version of Internet Explorer installed on your computer?</p>
<p>I believe you’ve checked with other websites to confirm if the issue is definitely&nbsp; to do with IE. If not, please check and confirm.</p>
<p>For time being, I’d suggest you to create a test user account and try saving other image file format. This will validate if the issue is specific to that user account.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p><strong>Create a user account<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account</strong></a></p>
<p>Please post back and let us know if the problem recurs in the new test user account. If such is the case, then probably your original user profile is corrupt and we continue with troubleshooting steps specific to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

2. A screenshot of the full error message via work space.<br />
3. How did you configure your account on Outlook 2016, via POP/IMAP or Exchange?<br />
4. Does the issue occur before?<br />
5. Please follow the steps below to check the account settings and change the authentication settings in Outlook as per your Internet Service Provider.<br />
a. Open Outlook&gt; Click File&gt; Info&gt; Account settings&gt; select the account and click on change&gt; More settings&gt; Outgoing Server.
