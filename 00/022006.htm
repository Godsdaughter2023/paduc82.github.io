                    <p>I have been a Skype customer for years. I have a Skype phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last few days:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incoming calls don't work - can't be answered</p>
<p>Incoming calls go directly to Skype voicemail</p>
<p>No emails confirming voicemail messages</p>
<p>Voicemail emails do not show up on my Skype page - have to log on to MS to get voicemail</p>
<p>No custom voicemail message</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to fix this please. All of this started when voicemails were not available on my Skype page requiring that I go to a link that required I sign up for MS account to get my voicemail.</p>

<p><span>I too have a Skype telephone number which I've had for several years and I recently renewed this for another year along with purchasing an unlimited number of both incoming and outgoing US calls.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I paid Skype good money to renew this service on the not unreasonable assumption that Skype would actually provide the service they were taking my money for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Skype has unilaterally removed the ability to receive phone calls on my Skype number. This means that you've been selling this service under false pretenses. It's NOT good enough to say that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"As we want to create the best possible app experience for our Skype users which means we have to make some changes along the way."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Canceling service does NOT create a "BEST POSSIBLE EXPERIENCE" for this or any of your other Skype users. It's a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE for your customers who have paid for a service you were offering but you now, in effect, say:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"We've already taken your money. Yes, we did get it under false pretenses, and yes we have conned you. But TOUGH. We're going to pretend this will IMPROVE your service even though, obviously, withdrawing service is NOT AN IMPROVEMENT!!!"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing a service your customers have already paid for is NOT improving your service. This is simply Microsoft corporate duplicity - even larger profits at the expense of your paying customers. Check with your legal team and they will tell you that your
 refusal to provide the service which has already been purchased is illegal...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reverse your decision and revert to giving us the service which we've purchased. You need to acknowledge that you have a legal obligation to supply the service for which you've already been paid. You realize, of course, that unilateral refusal to
 deliver an already purchased service is illegal ...</p>

</p><p>Greetings to each of you!&nbsp; Please forgive me; I am confused and not afraid to admit so.</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>What has me totally confused is the answer from Skype Customer Service, that Doc Tim posted above, is the same as has been reported in this continuing discussion related to the "Dual Phone" and other phone sets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope it makes sense that I am trying to determine if a separate issue is being reported here, specific to Mac.&nbsp; Thank you for helping me understand the details of your reports.</p>

<p>Hi, DocTim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply and clarifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The information you received from Skype Customer Service related to the RTX DualPhone is indeed correct.</p>
<p>However, you should be able to receive calls to your Skype Number on the other clients (Mac: Sierra, Android: Marshmallow - please forgive me, I am not a Linux user, so I will have to follow up on that one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read several other reports about this, and need to start compiling data.&nbsp; Thanks again for your information.</p>

Thanks for your prompt reply. But Yosemite, one of the two operating systems I use, is Mac OSX 10.10. And, obviously, Skype under Yosemite should be supported since it is indeed "Mac OS X 10.9 or higher&nbsp;". So
<strong>why am we, your paying customers, having problems receiving calls?</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
WHEN SKYPE DOESN'T CONNECT AN INCOMING CALL, HOW DO WE KNOW that we've missed the call?&nbsp; Obviously, there's no way to know that it's been made. That's why
<strong>Skype need URGENTLY - yesterday if not TODAY - to reinstate sending an email whenever an incoming call is not put through for any reason...</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Why was this notification removed? Why haven't Skype reinstated this already?&nbsp; Microsoft don't seem to be treating this as REALLY URGENT which seems surprising if not downright peculiar (said he with restraint.)</p>

ps. Even in Yosemite, your message webpage continues to say "Your version of Skype is out of date, so you'll see these messages on the web. You can either update Skype, or use Skype for Web." But checking the version shows this is untrue, it says I have the

<p>I started this tread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of company, without notice, cuts services/support and then when people complain they finally get around to saying that they will be cutting services/support in a few weeks. Not funny.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use design software that I own that works particularly well on the operating system that I choose to use. Skype had perfectly fine software that addressed these needs for my business until somebody via MS decides that we are not worth any kind of effort
 to support. Even though we have paid for services that were clearly stated at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have another system/drive on my Mac (10.9) that is suppose to be supported. It doesn't work properly either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just another example of a company that wants to force constant upgrades as a part of their business model and frankly doesn't care about what is actually happening to their client base.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lame excuses for these changes are particularly rude. I would think by this time MS has enough money to support existing Skype customers. They choose not to.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5130 XpressMusic WAP problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently purchased a Nokia 5130 XpressMusic which was locked to the UK network "Tesco Mobile". I paid Tesco to unlock my phone so I could use my O2 SIM in it. They unlocked it and my O2 SIM works fine (calls, texts) but the mobile internet and MMS doesn't
 work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I contacted O2 to send me the settings. They emailed instructions as to what I should do and I followed them, however, the phone still will not connect to the internet.</p>
<p>O2 said I should do the following (to set up WAP):</p>
<p>[QUOTE="O2 Customer Support"]</p>
<p>1. Select 'Menu' (press Navi Key).<br />
2. Highlight 'Settings' and select (press Navi key).<br />
3. Highlight 'Configuration' and select (press Navi key).<br />
4. Highlight 'Personal config. sett.' and select (press Navi key).<br />
5. Select 'Add' (press Navi key).<br />
6. Highlight 'Web' and select (press Navi key).<br />
7. Highlight 'Account Name' and select (press Navi key), enter 'O2 WAP GPRS' then 'OK' (press Navi Key).<br />
8. Highlight 'Homepage' and select (press Navi key), enter '<a href="http://wap.o2.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wap.o2.co.uk</a>' then 'OK' (press Navi Key).<br />
9. Highlight 'User name' and select (press Navi key), enter 'o2wap' then 'OK' (press Navi Key).<br />
10. Highlight 'Password' and select (press Navi key), enter 'password' then 'OK', verify password and again select 'OK' (press Navi Key).<br />
11. Highlight 'Use pref. access pt.' and select (press Navi key), highlight 'No' and select (press Navi key).<br />
12. Press 'OK' (press Navi key) to the question 'Define access point settings'.<br />
13. Highlight 'Access point settings' and select (press Navi key).<br />
14. Highlight 'Proxy' and select (press Navi key),<br />
highlight 'Enabled' and select (press Navi key).<br />
15. Highlight 'Proxy address' and select (press Navi key), enter '193.113.200.195' and 'OK' (press Navi Key).<br />
16. Highlight 'Proxy port' and select (press Navi key), enter '8080' and 'OK' (press Navi Key).<br />
17. Ignore 'Data bearer' this should be set to 'Packet Data'.<br />
18. Highlight 'Bearer settings' and select (press Navi key).<br />
19. Highlight 'Packet data acc pt' and select (press Navi key), enter '<a href="http://wap.o2.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">wap.o2.co.uk</a>' and 'OK' (press Navi Key).<br />
20. Ignore 'Network type' this should be set to 'IPv4'.<br />
21. Ignore 'Authentication type', this should be set as 'Normal'<br />
22. Highlight 'Username' and select (press Navi key), enter 'o2wap' and 'OK' (press Navi Key).<br />
23. Highlight 'Password' and select (press Navi key), enter 'password' and select 'OK' (press Navi key). Verify password and again 'OK' (press Navi Key).<br />
24. Press 'Back' three times (right softkey).<br />
25. Highlight 'O2 WAP GPRS' and select 'Options' (left softkey).<br />
26. Highlight 'Activate' and select (press Navi Key).<br />
27. Press 'Back' (right softkey) 4 times.</p>
<p>[/QUOTE]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also used the service ConfirgureMyPhone, where they text you the required settings. This did not work either. O2 used to send you the settings but it is down at the moment so you have to do it manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help? I can't understand why it's not working! I have entered the settings exactly as the instructions said but no joy...</p>

<p>Hi nj15</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried your suggestion, but the problem still persists! Thank you for giving me your help though. It is much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have called both O2 and Tesco Mobile for assistance but neither could come up with a solution. I had the O2 settings sent to my mobile, but they still do not work. This suggests to me that it is a problem with the phone's firmware? As the phone was originally
 locked to Tesco (and then unlocked) i'm thinking maybe that the Tesco firmware is stopping me from using any other internet/mms settings on the phone.. Anyone have any thoughts on this theory?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>O2 said it sounded like the Tesco firmware causing trouble. Tesco said that it wasn't the firmware causing the trouble. They said they had never head of Tesco firmware interfering when a user was trying to use other settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm still totally stuck! I am going to try ringing Tesco (who I originally bought the mobile from) and see if they'll replace the handset with a factory unlocked one (which doesn't have branded firmware on it) as this handset (unlocked, but still has Tesco
 branding) is causing me huge stress!!</p>

            Hi there,<br />
<br />
Sorry that you haven't got it working. But you can try these first before resorting to firmware resetting.<br />
<br />
Go to MENU&gt; SETTINGS&gt; CONNECTIVITY&gt; Packet Data&gt; Packet Data Settings&gt; Edit Access Point&gt; (could you please check if there is anything on the packet data access point) if there is, other than O2's, enter wap.o2.co.uk.<br />
<br />
Go to MENU&gt; SETTINGS&gt; CONFIGURATION&gt; Preferred Access Pt.&gt; (it should be O2's or personal config)<br />
<br />
Then after, under configuration. Press the Act. def. in all apps.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your other suggestions. I have checked the places you mentioned and the settings are as they should be. The access point is set to wap.o2.co.uk and the O2 settings are set as the default profile for all apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I contacted Tesco and they are taking it in for repair. I don't think they fully understand the problem as it was very hard for me to describe over the phone so I suspect they will flag it as "not faulty" when they look at it and return it.</p>
<p>What really sucks is I bought this phone for £55, paid £20 for Tesco to unlock it and now I can't use all the features! I rely on mobile web a lot and pay extra per month with O2 to use it. Not much point in keeping this phone if I can't use the internet
 but I somehow doubt Tesco will refund my £20 unlocking fee as well as the cost of the phone...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh what to do...!</p>

<h2>            Having problems downloading the desktop software</h2>
                    When I click the download for the Windows Phone App for the desktop, the program hangs on the window that states "Application is ready to be installed" and it never gets to the point to click "Install". Is there an issue with the download page?

            Hi GVAdmin,<br />
<br />
Have you already checked the transport rules in EAC? As an Admin, check this on EAC &gt; mail flow &gt; rules.<br />
<br />
Based on the Message Header you have sent, all 3 of them have a SCL value of 5, which is considered as Spam. Therefore you need to
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-sg/library/dn798345(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
set a transport rule</a> to bypass filter the emails from certain recipient(s). <br />
<br />
As an Admin, go to EAC &gt; Mail flow &gt; Rules &gt; Create a new rule &gt; under, <strong>Apply this rule if</strong>, specify a condition that will allow specific senders or email address.<br />
<br />
Under <strong>Do the following</strong>, select <strong>Modify the message properties</strong> &gt;
<strong>set the spam confidence level (SCL)</strong> to <strong>Bypass spam filtering</strong>.<br />
If the issue still persists, submit this false positive message to the Microsoft Spam Analysis Team, who will evaluate and analyze the message. You can refer to this

            That is an unexpected message.<br />
<br />
No you do not NEED Internet Explorer to open these files in Open Office.<br />
<br />
In theory, Open Office should be able to open and edit these files.<br />
<br />
As Doug said, in Open Office, have you tried to use the equivalent of the File &gt; Open (you may have to change the "File Type" to be able to see the Word DOC or DOCX files).<br />

            Thank you both for your responses. I really do not know why I waste people's time asking a question. I am too unfamiliar with anything about computers except for the few processes I use. For instance: I do not know what an "extension: is in the context
 of a computer application. &nbsp;Also, the CD's are not in the Open Office files. &nbsp;They were created four years ago when I had Microsoft Word. &nbsp;When I got my present CPU, it had a trial period for Microsoft Office. &nbsp;During that period, I inserted the cd's in the
 removable disc slot and clicked on the entry I wanted to view and it immediately opened.. I did not extend the trial period as I prefer to use Open Office. &nbsp;However, when I do the above process now, I get the message "Internet Explorer has stopped running."
 That led me to believe that I needed Microsoft Word, in which they were created,to open them. As I say,I do not have Internet Explorer. I deleted it along with the Word trial. &nbsp;I use Google Chrome' &nbsp;A few years back, I was having trouble and a techaid advised
 &nbsp;that I not use Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer as they often caused problems when used together. &nbsp;

            <p>The "extension" in a filename is the part after the period (.doc or .docx). If you do not have file extensions displayed on your computer, you will not see them, but this can be risky, as it makes it easier for malefactors to send you dangerous attachments.
 A .doc or .docx file is a Word file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need to open and edit the files, then you may want to get Open Office (<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.openoffice.org/</a>) or LibreOffice (<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.libreoffice.org/</a>),
 both of which are free productivity suites that include word processing programs that can open Word files. If you just need to be able to read and print the files, you can get the free Word Viewer from

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Oops, sorry. I now see that you say you use Open Office (I was evidently remembering a different question). As Rohn007 says, you should be able to open Word documents in Open Office but possibly not from the CD. Also, if you don't
 know what the file extension is, it's possible the files are actually PDF or HTML files.</p>

            This type of question is exactly why I volunteer my time here (more so than 90% of the questions that are really MS's responsibility that we see on the forum, like the "office 365 is broke" type ). Don't worry about "wasting" our time, as long as you follow
 our suggestions and answer our questions.&nbsp; If you don't understand don't be shy, we can explain. Trouble shooting and education, we are doing a mix of both here, both require a two-way dialog.
<br />
<br />
Although computers have become "as common as toasters", they are NOT yet as simple to use. That to use them effectively (and safely) it still means that sometimes you have to learn more about them than you think you "need" to.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what that tech was talking about, Word and Internet Explorer, are not "more" prone to problems than any other software like Chrome and Open Office. But, if those are the tools you are familiar with, no problem, everything I know suggests you should
 be able to use them in this context. <br />
<br />
I do know that Open Office can edit Word files.<br />
<br />
One thing I have not yet seen suggested is copy the files to your local hard drive.&nbsp; I know Word creates "Temporary" work files in the document directory, maybe Open Office does too, but can't because the CD is read only.<br />
<br />
You still haven't answered the question, did you try using "File / Open" inside of Open Office to open the file?

            I thought I answered it but maybe not in a way you understood. &nbsp;If I go to open Office and click on "file" and then on "open", it opens the page with the files that I have created with Open Office. &nbsp;The DVD's I am trying to view are in the in the removable
 disc tray. Is there another file/open function that I am not finding?Now, when I put a movie in the tray, I then go to the Computer short cut &nbsp;and click on that. That brings up the page with the hard drive and the removable disc lines. &nbsp;The removable disc
 line will have the name of the movie and when click on that the movie begins. &nbsp;It is the same with music. &nbsp;When I do that with the discs I am trying to view and click on the specific entry on that disc I want to view it first brings up an empty page with the
 Internet Explorer "E" icon. &nbsp;There then appears &nbsp;another window with the message "Internet Explorer has stopped working. "As i said I do not now have Internet Explorer.
<div>I wondered if I just did not &nbsp;have the application for opening the discs but then I remembered that when I got this computer it had the two month trial Microsoft Word and I did open the disc that I am now trying to open. &nbsp;I even copied some of the material
 and pasted it into the Open Office site and I can open them by clicking on file/open. &nbsp;Having done it successfully when I had the trial application and not being able to do so now is why I thought I needed to install Microsoft Word again &nbsp;but I did that with
 the same results. Why the Internet Explorer thing is beyond my understanding. I do appreciate your taking the time to help.</div>

            OK, it sounds like you are half way there.<br />
<br />
In the file open dialog, it opens in a default location.&nbsp; You should be able to 'navigate' to the CD in the reader to open those files. I don't have Open Office, so I can't give you specific how-to instructions.
<br />
<br />
You will also probably have to change the "File Type" in the open dialog to be able to see the Word files.<br />
<br />
I think your root problem is that the "default file associations" for the Word files are not set to point to OpenOffice.&nbsp; If the problem was with MS Office I would suggest doing an "Office Repair" to reset the defaults. I don't know if that will work for OpenOffice.&nbsp;
 Instead, you can manually point the Office files to OpenOffice as described in this tip:<br />

            Hi butch58
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.       
        </p>

            Hi Butch
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try uninstall then reinstall Skype to see if it helps. 
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the problem is resolved.

            Can you confirm if this happens in Skype for Web too?

<br />If you are using Chrome or Microsoft Edge, you can give it a try:

<h2>            E7 does not ring&#47;show call</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!<br />
<br />
My E7 sometimes does simply nothing when someone is trying to call me. Doesn´t ring or vibrate or anything. Not even the display changes or shows a missed call after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called my phone with another phone and got the normal call connected signal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outgoing calls are possible but when dialing some numbers it shows a "not allowed" error message...</p>
<p>What the hell?!?</p>
<p>After a restart it works fine again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Software version is 014.002</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any answer!<br />
<br />
Tru</p>

<p>If possible for your product code I would suggest you try and update your E7 with the latest software version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Latest version is either 22.014 or 25.00x</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you download Nokia Suite ,do a full backup of your phones content and then search for updates&nbsp;throygh Tools -&gt; Programupdates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download Nokia Suite from here <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/nokiasuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://europe.nokia.com/nokiasuite</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;also, if the SIM card is older then 2 -3 years old, get a new SIM card as well</p>

First make sure you are using the newest version of your browser. &nbsp;<br />
Some older browsers are no longer fully supported like IE 6<br />
<br />
I recommend that you clear your browser's cache and temporary internet files to make sure that they are not causing your issue.
<br />
This is often caused by a corrupted file in the browser. <br />

            <p>Well, that was useful, I am at last able to print but I wonder, when we were all arbitarily changed on to Outlook, how were we supposed to know that 3 dots gave those options. It has&nbsp;still not solved all my problems though. I did NOT get a print preview,
 it just went straight to print. I usually need to know how many pages it is so I know how much to print. So often there is a final page with only one or two&nbsp;lines on it. It would be even more useful if there was a shrink option as there is on Adobe. Three
 pages can usually be shrunk to two and still be legible, then it can print double sided and save paper. Perhaps you are still improving it; I really hope so--it is not very satisfactory yet.&nbsp;Save paper, save a forrest, save the planet!!!</p>

<h2>            Change Time Format to 24 hour clock in Excel</h2>
                    I want , and use the 24 hour time format in Excel, and have done for a long time in the Windows version of Excel, but having recently purchased a new IMAC, Excel acts a little differently. The IMAC is configured for the 24 hour format, but that has not
 carried over to Excel, so how do I default Excel to show the 24 hour clock?

            There is no default, and Excel does not show a clock. You can format times in cells to show 24 hour time, by leaving out the AM/PM suffix in the format.<br />

<h3> suzannen_ct  say:</h3>
<h2>            Expand&#47;Collapse Ribbon in Excel 2013 Question</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;It's a simple thing - but since I'm not a heavy mouse user - trying to see if it's me or the way it is designed. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>You can double click on a ribbon tab to collapse it (Just like in Office 2010). &nbsp; But it seems like you have to triple click on it (first click shows options - then 2 more clicks to expand it).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is that true - double to close, triple to open.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm&nbsp;guessing&nbsp;it could be - since the toggle button to expand/collapse &nbsp;that existed in Office 2010 - isn't a true toggle &nbsp;anymore.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />

</p><p>I am wondering if there is a way that i can make the account data spreadsheet into a mail merge field so that I can save the step of having to do this for every statement. I have tried this by copying the portion of the worksheet that I want placed into
 Word and hyperlinking and special paste linking the data into the mail merge excel spreadsheet without success.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>is this possible? can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>The MergeTools – 20150422.dotm file needs to be saved in the Word Startup folder.&nbsp; In Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8 or 8.1,

<br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />

In Windows 8,&nbsp; 8.1 or 10, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box
 for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
&nbsp;When that has been done and Word is started\re-started, the tab shown below will be added to the Ribbon:<br />

<h2>            Outlook OWA</h2>
                    I used the OWA to change my out-of-office auto replies, which worked for internal emails correctly but sent the wrong information to external email customers. Is there a way to set it for both customers (I am forwarding an outside
 customer's response)?

            <p>OWA and Outlook are completely separate.&nbsp; OWA questions belong in the <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/exchangesvrclients/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/exchangesvrclients/threads</a>&nbsp;forum.</p>
<p>What you see in OWA for Out of Office replies depends entirely on what Exchange server version you're using.&nbsp; Exchange Server 2010 has the ability to designate separate messages for the internal and the external replies.&nbsp; I'm not sure Exchange versions prior
 to that had that separation, but the people in the Exchange Client forum will know.</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures below explain how you troubleshoot and may try resetting the Word, Excel and PowerPoint Apps on your Android tablet:
<br />
<br />Ensure Word is closed.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Apps or Applications.
<br />
<br />Find the App you want to reset. In this case the Word App.
<br />
<br />Select the App.
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Reset Word.
<br />
<br />Once reset check if you are able to resolve the issue with Word and you are able to login to the Word app. If yes, make sure to follow the same process as above and reset the other Office apps.
<br /> 
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.  
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />
<br />Diego R.

<h2>            Message in body of email not being sent when sharing a spreadsheet as an attachment in email</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently (it used to work) I've noticed that when I share an excel spreadsheet as an attachment to an email, anything that I write in the message body is not sent - the recipient only received the attachment.&nbsp; I can't see anything in the options to change?&nbsp;
 Incidentally, at about the same time I noticed that any emails sent this way were being automatically saved in the Archive sent folder in Outlook, rather than the sent folder for the default email account as they used to be.&nbsp; I'm assuming that something went
 amiss with the last update but I don't know how to fix it so that I can email a message with the spreadsheet I want to share via email.&nbsp; Can anyone let me know how to fix this issue?</p>

<p>Both my wife and I are experimenting the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wife's: Alcatel Idol 4s (T-Mobile), Windows 10, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account, no other account on phone.</p>
<p>Mine: Alcatel OneTouch Fierce XL (T-Mobile) Windows 10, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account, no other account on phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We share an Office 365 family account, and have most all, if not all, the office apps on both phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We first noticed&nbsp; the problem two days ago on my wife's phone. Contacts started disappearing. By yesterday there were zero contacts on her phone. I connected her phone to her laptop and ran the Windows Device Recovery Tool that I had downloaded that same
 day from Microsoft. I ended up reinstalling the OS and starting from scratch. Finally she had all her contacts back after everything was restored. That was yesterday. Today she is missing a few contacts again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just noticed today that on my phone a large percent, well over half, of my contacts are missing too. One name changed from a name to a number as I was sending him a text. I went to the people app and his contact info was gone along with so many others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly we can't access https://people.live.com/ either for some reason. Strangely yesterday I could on our computers (Windows 10, Surface 3 and a 32bit Dell laptop), but not on our phones. Today I can't get to it on my Surface 3 nor on our phones (we're out
 of town so I can't try my wife's laptop), neither with Microsoft Edge nor with Internet Explorer. I don't have Chrome or any other web browser. It's funny though that other "live.com" sites work fine such as office, word, etc. via live.com, just not people.live.com.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having this exact same problem on WP10, Lumia 930.&nbsp; &nbsp;It started 2 days ago and I performed a hard reset hoping it would fix it which it did for one day but the contacts have all just gone missing again from this morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what to do and I also think it may be an issue regarding&nbsp;<span>https://people.live.com/ which is no longer accessible.</span></p>

            This morning (Oct 31, 2017) my contacts appeared on my phone and I was able to locate and place calls.&nbsp; Three hours later, my contacts were "hidden" with a message stating all my contacts were there if I "searched" for them but HELLO... search did not
 find the contacts I needed to find.&nbsp; This is extremely frustrating.&nbsp; None of my connected account someone screwed the pooch if this was an update.

<p>I went to the "show more accounts" link in the People app on my phone and attempted to create a "new" account using the same login and pw for my existing account.&nbsp; I received a message that the account already existed.&nbsp; When I backed out of that screen,
 all my contacts appeared and were no longer hidden.&nbsp; Hope that helps some of you.</p>

            It seems like today most, if not all of my contacts are back in the People app. But many contacts have missing information. For an example, for one contact I have to dial an extension so I have the extension in the contact info. But all I can see is the
 phone number, so I have to use my computer to get the extension.

<p>I actually haven't looked that closely at my contacts to know if some of the data are not displaying on the phone.&nbsp; I find the&nbsp;Search feature doesn't help me much because I have quite a few businesses in my contact list where I use Company instead of the
 Last/First name fields.&nbsp; Search doesn't seem to be able to search this field which is aggravating.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll keep this lwhen I have a few minutes to check my contacts, I'll get back and let you know what I find.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input. I believe I tried that earlier and it did not work. But then after 2 days all my contact came back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now today I tried to use the mail app and the same contacts are missing!(using OS build 15063.674). It is saying there is a sync issue like the message I had on my phone. I had to log into www.outlook.com to find my contact's number.&nbsp;</p>
