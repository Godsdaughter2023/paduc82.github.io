<h2>            Windows 10 Fax and Scan</h2>
                    <p>I activated the Fax and Scan feature in Windows 10 and purchased a modem. The modem is a HIRO H50113 and it is installed and it works perfectly for incoming and screening calls.</p>
<p>When I try to send a Fax using the Windows 10 Fax features, after filling out the form and attaching the document to be faxed I hit send. At that point the fax is placed in a pending mode where it sits. In order to send it I must disconnect the modem wait
 10 seconds then reattach it. Once the computer recognizes it the fax number is dialed and the document is&nbsp;sent.</p>
<p>Is there something or setting that I missed either in windows or on the modem</p>

<h2>            Looking to join black ops clan &#40; uk &#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Could really do with finding a decent clan to join, have been frustrated with the current team ( my friends list ) as even though they are my friends they are not the best at black ops not saying that i am we have a couple of good players but&nbsp; its usually
 not enough to win a game when you go up against a team that are communicating well and foccused on winning the game rather than just racking up kills. i prefer to be able to rack up kills and win the game, need a team that is also capable of doing both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i usually play domination, headquaters and HQ hardcore. if some one could let me know the best place to find team mates or add me that would be good i usually play most nights between 9pm and 12</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Ambush Gaming Recruiting - Casual &amp; Competitive - 16+ Only</b></p>
<p>Ambush Gaming is a fast growing Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 clan and community for ages 16+. We were formed in October of 2010 with leaders and a core group of members from a previous team. Our main philosophy here is to be organized, progress with teamwork,
 have fun, and meet some cool people in the process in a laid back, friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p>As of now we are specializing in Call of Duty: Black Ops, but as we grow we want to expand into different games and major titles. We accept US and EU players so no matter where you live, you’ll always have someone to play with.</p>
<p><b>Some of the current features we have and are planning for are</b>:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 204, 255, 1)">»</span> Active Leadership</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 204, 255, 1)">»</span> Active and always busy forums</p>

<h3> samuelparet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7&#58; This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator</h2>
                    <p>Not email related, not Outlook, or any other version of Windows than Windows 7. And not Office 2007. I have never installed MS Outlook or MS Office on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not found anything on the forums here that actually related to my issue as I do not have any other MS software installed except for Windows itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First chat session: the operator was a bit aloof, kinda annoying. in the end she decided to send me an email with a link for a how-to, but only after the session ended. The link was to the forum post filed under Outlook and Office 2007 that I had previously
 already found (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-outlook/operatoin-canceled-due-to-restrictions/d1fa8445-6556-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second chat session: the guy is dense: kept claiming that I should just follow the directions from the forum which he had not read. He then recommends I do a re-install, or that he can remotely fix my problem for a fee (even though I have disabled remote
 assistance years ago). No ethical problem there, none at all. He also implied multiple times that I have a pirated copy of Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalling Win7 because I changed one setting... and that is MS Support staff. Heck, When I did that years ago, it was because I didn’t' know any other way, because I was ignorant of other solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously I need to get a hold of support staff that can do more than help someone install a printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ISSUE: AVIRA antivirus pop-ups</p>
<p>SOLUTION: change a setting deep down in Windows to prevent those popups</p>
<p>http://tips.betdownload.com/how-to-shut-and-block-ads-on-avira-fre-antivirus-379n.aspx</p>
<p>I made it to step 4 but upon rebooting, I get the error message on anything I click on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have simply un-installed AVIRA but I had just gotten rid of ZoneAlarm because of a network issue and didnt' want to keep trying various anti-virus software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue persist under Windows Safe-mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't bring up a question as to why I am using third party antivirus instead of MS Security Essentials, it does not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I have to pay to get Windows back to usable, I'll just stick with Linux thank you very much</p>

            <p><strong>I do know what setting I changed.</strong></p>
<p>It is the setting on <strong>Step 3</strong> of the how-to that I followed (see OP)</p>
<p>
</p><p>OP states that I cannot run a darn thing without receiving the error message. System Restore is not immune to the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already mentioned that Safe Mode did not help. (see OP)</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Here let me break down the how-to I followed (or you could just follow the link I posted earlier, you might as well because it has some pretty pictures):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Start Menu &gt; Run "gpedit.msc" &gt; OK</p>
<p>Step 2: User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; System</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: double click on "Don't run specified Windows application" &gt; Enabled &gt; Show &gt; type "avnotify.exe" &gt; OK</strong></p>
<p>Step 4: reboot.</p>

            <p>What is "the same issue"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps attempting to add a printer you see something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8aeb323-0bfd-499d-b99c-73c4d0ae8f62" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8aeb323-0bfd-499d-b99c-73c4d0ae8f62" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Messages like that about "...due to restrictions..." are due to Group Policy settings and as you can see it is easy to recreate the issue/problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On an afflicted workstation/system/user and take a look here and if you see the NoAddPrinter key delete it or change the value to zero:</p>

            <p>Yes that was exactly the error I was getting. I resolved it by&nbsp;going to gpedti.msc-User Configuration-Administrative Templates-Control Panel Printers. I set Prevent addition of printers from enabled to Not configured and Browse the network to find printers
 from Not configured to Enabled.</p>

    <title>ScreamRide Level Center Server Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spiralout46and2  say:</h3>
<h2>            ScreamRide Level Center Server Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, I'm hoping that a post here will help this issue. This may be aimed more at the Moderators here than the general community, but I'd appreciate any help from anyone that can offer advice or solutions. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As most probably know, ScreamRide was added to Game Pass some time ago and has had over 25K players, and probably more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem: On ScreamRide, there is a Level Center that you need to use for part of the game and for several achievements. You need to access this Level Center to Share a level that you create to the community, and to download other players' levels. The
 Level Center, or more specifically, the servers for it have had a rocky history of working one moment and not working at all the next, going back over the last few years to 2015. Sometimes the servers don't work for months at a time. Right now, the servers
 aka the Level Center has not worked for the entire month of June, so far. So you cannot share or download any levels for the game from the community.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just recently started the game a couple of weeks ago and immediately ran into this issue. I have tried daily to access the Level Center and I just receive an error message. I have seen other forum posts about this on gaming sites and have messaged with
 several friends and other gamers that are also trying to access the Level Center, as it is the last thing that they also need to do in the game to complete the game. Nobody has had any luck with the servers since May. We all only get error messages when trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted the Developer, Frontier Developments, and they have informed me that they no longer support the game and everything is managed by Microsoft now (ScreamRide is published by Microsoft Studios). Including the servers. So, the servers are maintained
 and managed by Microsoft. So, now I'm a bit stuck because I'm trying to find out how or who to contact through Microsoft about this. I would like to find out, for myself and the rest of the ScreamRide players that are also having the same problem right now,
 if they are aware that the server has been down since May, and if they can fix this and bring it back up for us. Being on Game Pass, with so many players, this needs to be looked at. It's an issue that is making a large part of the game unplayable and making
 it uncompletable for those who like to earn all of the achievements in a game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually found an older post here on the forums, from October 2016, where someone had the exact same issue as the servers were down at that time as well. A nice Moderator here on the site named Mister Maka addressed it and replied that he "reached out
 to the appropriate team for this issue and we'll be sure to reach back out when we have more info". The next day he followed up with "Microsoft’s best engineers are working hard on the problem." Five days later, the original poster wrote "As of right now it's
 working. Either thanks to David or the official staff." </p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/screamride-level-problems/c68e5c7b-64ec-4e30-b1c8-43dbc47a66e7</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, a Moderator was able to forward the problem to a team and Microsoft's engineers addressed it and the servers were working within 5 days. That is absolutely amazing and gives me hope lol. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone here that can help? Can a Moderator let an "appropriate team" know when a server is down for a game that Microsoft runs and maintains? Please, I have been trying to fix this and deal with it for a couple of weeks now and there are many of
 us having the same problems. I've been messaging almost daily with friends and other gamers saying, "Have you had any luck yet?" "Nope, tried for an hour last night, just got error messages." Please help. Even if the servers can just be fixed temporarily,
 it would be something. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance, any help at all is MUCH appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Spiral :)</p>

<p>So, once again just trying to check and see if anyone can help. Any Moderators, MVP's, Microsoft employees on here...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just asking if the server problem for the Game Pass game, ScreamRide, can be forwarded to the appropriate people to see if it can be looked into or fixed, as it was before by a Moderator here forwarding the issue to some engineers at Microsoft. There
 are a lot of people through Game Pass that can't play this due to the servers not working since May.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not a great feeling when games are added to Game Pass, and then the servers go down for it. :( As mentioned above, I've already contacted the Developer and they have not been attached to the game since 2015. They stated that the servers have always
 been under Microsoft (the Publisher), since day one, and they've had nothing to do with servers. So, please, can anyone help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Yeah it would be lovely to get an answer on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My children were attempting to get it to work, and it just wont. I contacted the dev who said the servers are ran by MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i contact MS on twitter, and judging by the forum response here, this seems just as pointless.</p>
<p>

    <title>DirecTV &#40;HR24-500&#41; Surround Sound Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisv784  say:</h3>
<h2>            DirecTV &#40;HR24-500&#41; Surround Sound Not Working</h2>
                    
<p>I have a DirecTV receiver (HR24-500) and I can't get the Surround Sound (BETA) option to work. When I enable that setting and go back in to the TV app, I get no picture or sound. I've tried to change the settings on the DirecTV box itself, and have had no
 luck. I was able to get picture and video if I turn off the Dolby Digital on the DirecTV receiver, but of course, there's no actual surround sound because the satellite box isn't sending Dolby signals. As soon as I turn on the Dolby Digital on the DirecTV
 box, the video freezes and there's no audio. Has anyone gotten this to work properly?</p>

<p>Hi, ChrisV784.</p>
<p>As chintu mentions, the Surround Sound option is in beta, as we're still working out the kinks. That said, we expect it should work for most users. One thing we do know can cause issues is swapping audio formats between stereo and Dolby, so your test case
 of going from stereo to Dolby on your DirecTV box actually might be running afoul of this.</p>
<p>Have you tried:</p>
<p>- Turn on the option in the Settings on the Xbox One.</p>
<p>- Leave Dolby enabled on your STB.</p>
<p>- Cold-restart your Xbox One (Hold Power down for 10 seconds to turn it fully off instead of into standby).</p>
<p>- Launch Live TV.</p>
        </p>

<p>Wow! That totally worked. Makes such a huge difference. My plan for the day tomorrow was to put everything back to the way it was and just run the DirecTV straight through the receiver. Hopefully it continues to work. Thanks Agbaar! Really appreciate it!</p>

<p>Actually, the problem is still here. Anytime the console comes out of standby, the audio and video don't work. I guess I'll just have to hope for an update soon. It works if I keep shutting down the console fully and restarting it, but that's kind of a hassle.

<p>I have the exact same issue with xbox one and the hr24-500. &nbsp;It works until restart. &nbsp;On e you turn it back on no pic or video. &nbsp;I have over 7 hours clocked with support and still have an open ticket. &nbsp; And, yes I have done the reset multiple times. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope for a fix soon.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Messenger 2009 does&#39;nt go to the clock tray</h2>
                    Well guys, I've just started to use the Windows 7 RC x64. This OS is wonderful, fast, and also give me a boost in games. But there is something annoying me: The Windows Live Messenger 2009, when open, doesn't go to the clcock tray, it stays in my taskbar
 (not just the window, but the process). I'd like to gat some help from you guys, because this is annoying me, and everytime I minimize all the windows to take a see in my desktop, WLM 2009 window opens.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.

<p>Hi Variado,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting to "Getting Ready for Windows 7" community forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Involving the issue experienced, if you right click on Live Messenger from the taskbar is it selected as Pinned to the Taskbar or does it give you an option to UnPin it from the taskbar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's pinned or unpinned is somewhat nonessential but may be useful in diagnosing this issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Windows Live Messenger appears on the taskbar as all programs that are opened will appear on the task bar-to the right of the startORB -in Windows 7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you have the Windows Live Messenger Opened or if someone has sent you a response or message then it will be launched, but, if you have it residing on your taskbar in a minimized state, when you minimize other Windows it will not be launched or visible
 unless an unseen response or message has been issued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please assist us with a little further information pertaining to the conditions around the Messenger being launched when all Windows are minimized and we will try to assist you further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You state that your mic is unpluggable. Is that the Xbox headset that is wired directly into the headset adapter that plugs into the bottom of the controller?&nbsp;</p><p>If so, that wire is very flimsy and fails often.</p><p>You might start with just reseating that piece that plugs into the bottom of the controller.</p><p>If that fails, there's a bunch of stuff to try below/<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>What kind of headset are you using? Make and Model</p>
<p>Are you using a stereo headset adapter plugged into the controller?</p>
<p>Does your controller come with the built in 3.5mm jack?</p>
<p>Are you seeing the Mic muted icon in the upper right part of the Home screen?</p>
<p>When you start a party, does it say We can't find a microphone for these people?</p>
<p><br /></p><p>The Xbox One controller uses the same wiring standard that Android phones use (CTIA). If you have an Android phone, plug in your headset and see if you hear anything and try and make a call using the headset, make sure the mic is working too.<br />Apple phones use an OMTP standard and the mic and ground wire are flipped and the mic doesn't work on the Xbox controller.</p><p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p><p>Troubleshooting basics -</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Make sure the mic mute switch on the headset is not on</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Clean the jack that plugs into the bottom of the controller and re-seat the headset jack</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Check the mic on the headset. Some mics are detachable, so re-seat the mic on the headset</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Hard reset the Xbox - Hard reset the Xbox by holding down the power button on the front of the Xbox for 15 seconds. After the 15 seconds let go of the power button then restart the Xbox.</p>

<h3> ianvriend  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to roll back fall creators update after 10 days&#63;</h2>
                    So the new update is causing me a lot of problems, mainly when I try to play a game. It just keeps making programs crash on me. The thing is, I didn't realize that it was the update until it was too late, and now I cant just go into settings and go back
 to 1703. Does anyone know how to revert it? I've tried looking it up, but I just can't find it and I'm getting very frustrated with how difficult this is. It shouldn't be made so hard to fix an update that is causing difficulties.&nbsp;

<h2>            SmartSense not working&#47;keeps resetting it&#39;s self&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm sorry if this isn't the right spot for this, but I'm getting frustrated.</p>
<p>So I play world of warcraft on my laptop, and use smart sense to be able to use the keyboard and touchpad at the same time. As of yesterday it's been giving me problems, but only in this one game. I've updated drivers, restarted my computer, etc. Smart sense
 works fine if I'm using chrome or anything else, but the touchpad delay (which is normally set to 'no delay/off') seems to do nothing, and keeps a delay on at all times no matter what I do. I've gone through tons of pages of people having the same issue with
 nothing working for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help?</p>

            <p>Hi Que Basil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m sorry to know that you are facing issue with accessing corrupt file found after performing System File Checker (SFC) tool. In order to provide you with a quick
 resolution, please reply to this question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the complete error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since System File Checker (SFC) tool detected corrupt files that couldn’t be repaired, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At an elevated command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b>takeown /fPath_And_File_Name</b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>For example, type
<b>takeown /f E:\windows\system32\jscript.dll.</b></p>
<p>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER to grant administrators full access to the file:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b>icaclsPath_And_File_Name /GRANT ADMINISTRATORS:F</b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>For example, type
<b>icacls E:\windows\system32\jscript.dll /grant administrators:F</b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the following command to replace the file with a known good copy of the file:</p>
<p><b>CopyPath_And_File_Name_Of_Source_File Path_And_File_Name_Of_Destination</b></p>
<p>For example, type
<b>copy E:\temp\jscript.dll E:\windows\system32\jscript.dll.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the following section
<b>“If the System File Checker tool cannot repair a file, follow these steps:”
</b>from the below mentioned article for more information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</b></p>

            Hi Imran;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the kb929833 from related thread. Problem in finding files not repaired! The CBS log was created with link to desktop. But that link was showing empty file! From c Windows logs- the CBS file created, would show access denied when try
 to open. I guess the protected content from Microsoft was blocking Admin account access. So I tried my Sky Drive and got the file copied. And Now I can open the CBS file and read; from my documents sync or from Sky Drive folder! Both text files are supposed
 to work Notepad- and I could not get in until by chance I tried to send file to Sky. So reported to Forum looking answer!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CBS files way over my begin status. I was looking for simple faulting program name. I do get file corruption and can always dump/
 reinstall if I know the app problem! But the steps in kb929833 hit the access denied wall! as soon as I hit the find file not repaired steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl

<p>I was following the sfc /scannow instructions and came upon the same difficulty you had.&nbsp; I simply went to the CBS folder, copied the pertinent log file and pasted it to the desktop.&nbsp; I changed the name of the file to .txt and then opened it with notepad.&nbsp;
 Voila!&nbsp; No administrator requirements at all only popup menu to confirm I wished to authorize the change.&nbsp; Now if I had only learned to read Greek!</p>

            Yes!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy the file. I got access after saving it with Sky Drive. My next issue was; Where do we log in to find a current copy? For any file degraded/ needing an update. I get the message that "some files- not repaired." Still looking thru entries and
 trying to learn the Greek. Afraid solutions not solved by auto trouble shoot repair- are just over head for most personal users. Perhaps MS will get this updated to run&nbsp; on automatic for us.

            <p>Wow!&nbsp; This started Nov. 23, 2012 and you are still swinging in the wind?&nbsp; So much for Microsoft's vaunted community assistance capabilities.&nbsp; I'm swinging in the wind as well as the SFC checker corrected the corrupt files yet the problem remains with the
 computer failing to go to sleep on command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So much as well for Microsoft building in meaningful repair programs for those of us with difficulties as this is probably an easy fix for a technical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck to you.</p>

            I did get answer from Moderator here. Just not enough to find Source to repair bad file. I was sent the takedown steps. With the KB article. And no link to replace with good copy! My pc still running- the system updates catch most issues. But repair too
 difficult for casual user. The FixIt trouble shooters are good. MS needs more!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repost the sleep issue and see if auto FixIt has any related solution?

            Thanks Try*3 for steps. Never got the disk from Dell (Inspiron Laptop) but; did do system image. And thinking 2.5 years out side time to restore:) I would have to do your replace steps for install disc- from the "bad" pc showing the "corrupted file not
 repaired"??!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking MS should have a good link for current, needed file. The KB article had bad link at bottom for manual repair- no response:(

            <p>I read your reply and as I am dealing with Windows Vista and in possession of an original HP installation disk that will clear my hard drive my only alternative is to reinstall from scratch or do a&nbsp;complete recovery at this point.&nbsp; Way beyond what I want
 to do while awaiting the return of the wife's HP OMNI120 from&nbsp;the repair facility for failing to awake from sleep&nbsp;on command.&nbsp;<strong>
</strong>One won't go to sleep and the other won't wake up without a hard shut down and restart.&nbsp; If it isn't one thing it's another!</p>

<p>Next I tried to reassign the drive letter from F to H:&nbsp; The screen says the file system is 'RAW and the status is healthy, etc.&nbsp; It's not seeing this as an NTFS format, even though the chkdsk identifed it that way with the correct volume lable, so I know
 it was seeing the right drive.&nbsp; I have almost everything still on my coomputer --this backup is material that I might reassemble from other old backup drives, but this is the best consolicated version of my backups-automatic from Win 7, so I'd rather not lose
 it.&nbsp; Am I out of luck?&nbsp; Is this drive Kaput </p>
<p>and I should give up on it?&nbsp; <br />

            Hi,<br />
I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer of the USB to backup the drive then try formatting the USB and check if the issue persists.<br />

            It sounds like a Windows Access Rights issue. For some reason your ID no longer has access rights to that folder.  Here are some tips on how to "take ownership" of files and folders

<h2>            All kinds of printers on my computer are offline, no ports for printers are availabale.</h2>
                    <p>There is not any working printer in my system. I am using Windows 7 Professional.
</p>
<p>In control-panel for printers (Win+R -&gt; control printers) I can see a list of previously installed local USB,</p>
<p>network printers and sw printers such as "Print To PDF", but all of them are displayed as if they were offline (in grey) - and after check they really were offline.</p>
<p>When I open manager for printer ports (under print processor manager) - I can not see any port (LPT1, COM, USB nor IP ports of
</p>
<p>network printers that were already installed). Spooler service is running.I check the system integrity using system file check (sfc /scannow) with result: performed finding no problems.</p>
<p>Do anybody know what can be wrong with my system and how can I repair it?</p>

            <p>Hello Singh Sarandeep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you very much for your answer and hints. However ... I checked all those things before I put the question.</p>
<p>I have found the source of all those problems in registry.&nbsp; There were deleted some sub-keys in&nbsp; "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors".</p>
<p>I could not find any port in "print-processor manager" (USB nor TCP/IP or LPT) because port monitors specifications were missing in the registry.
</p>
<p>All I had to do to repair whole functionality was adding to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors" sub-key "Local Port" with item "Driver" of value "localspl.dll"; sub-key "USB Monitor" with item "Driver"
<br />
of value "usbmon.dll"; and sub-key "Standard TCP/IP Port" with item "Driver" of value "tcpmon.dll".</p>
<p>In sub-key "Standard TCP/IP Port" i created a sub-key named "Ports" with following items:</p>
<p>"LprAckTimeout" of decimal value 180</p>
<p>"StatusUpdateEnabled" of decimal value 1</p>
<p>"StatusUpdateInterval" of decimal valie 10.</p>
<p>... after that all ... did restart my computer and everything is ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is risk to edit registry, but I hope this description will help to anyone else who faces a problem with the same description.</p>
<p />

<p>Hello community,</p>

<p>Please try to help me cause it's getting worse. My xbox one can't download HOME element, it meas that I can't go anywhere at the Dashboard. I see the green screen animation and then just black screen, sometimes &nbsp;I can see the dashboard however, I'm not able
 to do anything with it. Error appears after some time, about 5 min or so. Every kind of reboot is useless since I've spent about 3 hours with supports and they even can't tell me why I'm experiencing this. Why do I need to struggle like that? Someone please
 help me.<br />
<br />
Awaiting your reply guys!</p>
