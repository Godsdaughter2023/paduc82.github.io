            <p>What is the complete error message you receive? Did you try activating the Office 2010 over the telephone?</p>
<p>Activate over the telephone and see if it helps.</p>

<p>Note: Ensure to select the correct location from the drop down menu to reach the activation team
</p>
<p>Important: When you telephone the Activation Center, you are prompted to read the Installation ID numbers. If you have problems following the guidelines over the telephone
 do not hang up. Wait until you receive an option for transfer. Say “transfer me.” You will be redirected to speak with the customer service representative.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us, I understand your frustration about not able to download the movie you purchased, but first I would need to clarify, do you have any pending update on your device? Which apps are you using to download the movie? Do you also
 get any error message or error code?</p>

            <p>Hello, as far as I can tell there are no&nbsp;pending system updates.&nbsp; the movie was purchased through the Xbox movie app pre-loaded on the surface 2.&nbsp; the error message returns a note that says "can't download.&nbsp; the item is missing or we can't get to it.". I
 have tried on multiple WiFi connections and get the same message.&nbsp; the movie will stream but will not download.&nbsp; I get the same error message on two different movie and a TV show.&nbsp; any suggestions?&nbsp; is anyone else having the same issue?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me help you with your issue in syncing your calendar. Let's find out what are the possible options that we can do to resolve it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are referring to synching Windows Live Hotmail Calendar to Microsoft Office Calendar, you can use Hotmail Outlook Connector. Please refer to this
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2735989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article </a>for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this is not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi I have tried setting up my office 2013 Outlook to connect to the Outlook.com environment with intention to sync mail, calendar and&nbsp;contacts but keep getting connection failure errors.</p>
<p>pop and imap&nbsp;only sync mail, so exchange or exchange active sync (eas) are&nbsp;my preferred target connection methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can successfully connect from my iphone and ipad, both of which sync all objects between&nbsp;each other &nbsp;and the outlook.com environment, which&nbsp;I can see and interact with via the web bowser at sn2prd0102.outlook.com/owa (after logging in at outlook.com)
</p>
<p>[Note: this address has recently changed to 'bluprd0113.outlook.com/owa', following a Microsoft infrastructure migration for our domain]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My email account is in the edu domain space of the outlook environment (user at uqconnect.edu.au)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have tried connecting my Win 7 desktop at work and at home with the following connection methods and settings (neither has connected successfully):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Outlook 2013 EAS using m.hotmail.com as server - connects to a phantom mailbox, e.i.: not to the mailbox&nbsp;I see when directly connected via web browser or on my iphone or ipad, even though the address is the same.&nbsp;I can send mail with this phantom mailbox,
 but it&nbsp;does not&nbsp;recieve mail sent to my address (mail sent to my address is seen in the web browser and on iphone / ipad). Every time&nbsp;I delete the settings and ost files for this setup, and redo it, it connects to the same phantom mailbox (as i set up and
 preserved some folders in the inbox and preserved some sent items).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Outlook 2013 EAS using the following server addresses: </p>
<p>blu-m.homail.com</p>
<p>m.outlook.com</p>
<p>sn-m.outlook.com</p>
<p>snt-m.outlook.com</p>
<p>blu-m.outlook.com</p>
<p>sn2prd0102.outlook.com</p>
<p>sn2prd0102.mailbox.outlook.com</p>
<p>sn2prd0102-m.outlook.com</p>
<p>pod51000.outlook.com</p>
<p>also...recently&nbsp;tried (and failed)&nbsp;after migration to Office 365 backend by Microsoft: bluprd0113.outlook.com
</p>
<p>none of these work. they fail to connect to the server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Outlook 2013 Exchange (with and without https) - used the same list of servers as stated in point 2 above, but the only one that seems to initially connect is: sn2prd0102.outlook.com [bluprd0113.outlook.com (after migration)]</p>
<p>but then when it tries a windows logon prompt appears and nothing i enter into this seems to work. i've tried :
</p>
<ul>
<li>username</li><li>username at uqconnect.edu.au</li><li>username at m.outlook.com</li><li>username at outlook.com. </li></ul>
<p>when setting up with&nbsp;https: </p>
<ul>
<li>url used is: sn2prd0102.outlook.com [bluprd0113.outlook.com (after migration)]</li><li>SSL proxy server: msstd:outlook.com</li><li>basic authentication.</li></ul>
<p>pulling my hair out over this as i wish to sync between two PCs via office Outlook, iphone and ipad. The idevices work fine, the PC's do not. There must be some non-standard configuration that allows the connection from PC's under the circumstances described
 above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any assisitance would be welcome.</p>

            Have had no joy from Outlook forum - they recommend you guys. the problem is connecting to Outlook.com with a specific ...edu domain name (ie: not a Hotmail or&nbsp;live&nbsp;account) my outlook connects to everything else, including outlook.com with a live account.
 I would welcome any further thoughts on this.

 play dvd"s but you have to use&nbsp;media player &nbsp;classic &amp; download media player codec pack I have found that you have to look around a lot because everything is in different places That's about all for now Ill let you know how I go with the update A lot of people
 seem to be having trouble with it See YA&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            VLOOKUP with multiple criteria.</h2>
                    
<p>I want to use VLOOKUP (or similar) &nbsp;with multiple criteria e.g. I have 3 columns of data (column A, B and C). I want to lookup the value in row 2, column C, where row 2 column A and row 2 column B meet criteria I specify. Note that Column A and B each have
 many duplicate values but there are never any instances where the values in Column A and B for any given row are the same in any other row.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Whenever we have multiple criteria, we can use SUMPRODUCT to find the matching row and then INDEX to pull the value from that row.&nbsp; For example in A1 thru C9:</p>
<p>
<table>

<tr>
<td>
<span>average</span></td>
<td><span>cat</span></td>
<td>
<span>31</span></td>
</tr>

<td><span>32</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<span>young</span></td>
<td><span>cat</span></td>
<td><span>36</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<span>young</span></td>
<td><span>fish</span></td>
<td><span>44</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<span>average</span></td>
<td><span>fish</span></td>
<td><span>53</span></td>

<tr>
<td>
<span>young</span></td>
<td><span>dog</span></td>
<td><span>56</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<span>old</span></td>
<td><span>cat</span></td>
<td><span>63</span></td>

<tr>

<span>old</span></td>

<td><span>68</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<span>old</span></td>
<td><span>dog</span></td>
<td><span>77</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>and we want the value for an average fish:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<span>=INDEX(C1:C9,SUMPRODUCT(--(A1:A9="average")*(B1:B9="fish")*ROW(1:9)))</span></td>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try this ARRAY</p>
<p>=INDEX(C1:C20,MATCH(1,(A1:A20=D1)*(B1:B20=E1),0))</p>
<p>The lookup values are in d1 and E1</p>
<p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.</p>

                    The connection with bluetooth on my phone and car works fine, but i can't view my phonelist in the car. I know that you can download a SIS file, but that's only for symbian-phones.<br />
Is there any other way i could view the list of my contacts on my audio-device in the car.<br />

    <title>MANDATORY UPGRADE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alibaba40  say:</h3>
<h2>            MANDATORY UPGRADE</h2>
                    <p>Happy New Year (NOT) Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tonight when I try to log into Skype, I receive a message saying that I will be unable to access Skype unless I update Skype from the Classic 7 series.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise that this has been on the cards for a while but given my previous experience with the upgrade (using Windows 7 Desktop) it was so horrendous that I did a system restore to a date prior to the 'upgrade' (misnomer for downgrade imo).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way around this need to 'upgrade' or will I need to find myself a new programme to use to keep in contact with those in my list?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any advice</p>

            You will not be able to circumvent this as control is at server not at your computer. Latest version 8.36.0.52 is quite stable. Few months back, version 8 did have issues but they are fixed and latest version has almost no complaints.

<p>Horrendous compulsory way MicroHard (not soft) uses to push you into doing things with no explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Key tones were not recognised by the other end in Skype's latest version. I use this for work and need to go through switchboards often so this function is CRUCIAL - got back to a version that worked because I need solutions ON THE SPOT. Is Skype ever ready
 to provide them? No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reports of correct operation by a diehard fan who does not represent MS officially are of no value to me. Sorry about that.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for showing me I'm not alone in being incensed by this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was like 6 months ago, so I just remember I googled the problem and one of the solutions in a forum was to revert to an old version. There was a warning of that being temporary as the upgrade was bound to be forceful soon - which we have clearly seen
 happen - but at least I gained 6 months peace of mind.</p>

<p>Hi Alex (think I have read that right since I do not have pound sign on my keyboard lol)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you, it was around 6 months ago following my first attempt with Version 8, I reverted to Classic 7 using a system restore and have enjoyed a similar period of peace of mind.&nbsp; During that time, I became increasingly frustrated posting on here with questions
 and receiving responses from everyoine else but Microsoft employees.&nbsp; It was rare when MS employees responded but if they did and I asked them a question, they would disappear - never to respond to my questions!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am expecting similar treatment this time and may see the thread removed or locked because MS appear to believe 'most' of the earlier problems have been rectified.&nbsp; They have gone all out to create a&nbsp; programme for smart phones etc - to the detriment of
 desktop users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Terrific PR Microsoft - REALLY terrific.&nbsp; My business would never survive if I treated my customers in this manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder whether MS will respond to the questions I have raised in this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BOOOOO/HISS and Thumbs down</p>

<p>My blind friend cannot reply audio call by using Ctrl + Shift + P.<br />
Key P is to difficult to find on keyboard.<br />
The old "Ctrl + PageUp" was easier to find on keyboard.<br />
<br />
So far my blind friend has refused to upgrade to new version, but now you have escalated the demands to upgrade to new version, and he his signed out when he refuses to upgrade.</p>

<p>Hi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, I was forced to upgrade as well, being told that call forwarding ( to a landline, with a voice message, since you can't leave a custom voicemail any longer) wouldn't work until I did. I upgraded (and, BTW, the call forwarding STILL doesn't work--worked
 for one day, and then stopped again), and NOW, my DND no longer works.&nbsp; No matter what I do, calls come in, and I'm notified.&nbsp; Which I DO NOT WANT.&nbsp; I have international clients, who call at all hours of day and night, so being able to use voicemail is CRUCIALLY
 important to me. I was interrupted SIX TIMES, this morning, with incoming calls, while on a GoToMeeting with 8 other people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so sick to death of this, I can't stand it. THEN, some genius support person tells me that I "need" to upgrade to Skype for Business (as I've used my Skypin Number
<span>and&nbsp;</span>subscription for my business, for &gt;10 years), BUT, wait for it--when I do that,
<strong>ONLY PEOPLE WITH SKYPE FOR BUSINESS SUBSCRIPTIONS WILL BE ABLE TO CALL MY BUSINESS.&nbsp; WHAT?&nbsp; Who the hell would do that?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WTF?&nbsp; </strong>WTF is microsoft doing?&nbsp; I am at wit's end, <em>literally</em>.&nbsp; It's

<p>Agreed, Kimberly.&nbsp; I too am a paying customer.&nbsp; I have used Microsoft products for 35 years.&nbsp; I've about had it with MS's absolutely terrible quality assurance over the past few years.&nbsp; It has tanked unbelievably.&nbsp; I will be looking for Skype alternatives
 and possibly alternatives to other MS products as well.&nbsp; It seems the quicker I can ditch this Skype 8 train-wreck the better.&nbsp; It is beyond idiotic that MS would discontinue Skype 7.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Laura,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can add your students at the same set to your class notebook. You can follow the steps below to do that:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Create a user group by yourself or by your IT admin.</span></li><li>
<span>Populate this group with your students.</span></li><li>
<span>Use the group name during the Add students element of creating a new notebook, or when editing students by using the Add or Remove Student option.</span></li></ol>

<p>I'm sorry - I didn't see your initial reply.&nbsp; How do I create a user group?&nbsp; I think this would be a useful thing, although I now understand that all I have to do is create a list in MS Word of my students separated by semicolons and add the same list to
 all of the classes where I teach this group, but&nbsp;I think it would still be useful to me to learn how to do this in the platform.</p>

<span>Click plus symbol near Groups.</span></li><li><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94bac025-903a-4a8c-8079-4d9742c3b2f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94bac025-903a-4a8c-8079-4d9742c3b2f7" /></a></li><li>

<p>Ok so my dad has been having some problems with him Outlook, when ever we open it, this error message: The path specified for the file is not valid appears.</p>

<strong><span>*.pst</span></strong>&nbsp;file.
<br />
<br />
Let's verify the same and remove it from Outlook profile following steps mentioned below and see if it helps:<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1)</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Close Outlook &gt; go&nbsp;to
<strong>Control Panel </strong>&gt; <strong>Mail &gt; Show Profiles </strong>&gt; select the Outlook profile &gt;
<strong><span>Properties</span></strong> &gt;
<strong><span>Data files </span></strong>&gt; select the
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">deleted Outlook data file
<strong><span>*.pst</span></strong>&nbsp;file from the list
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">and click on
<strong><span>Remove &gt; Close</span></strong>.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
2) Now try re-starting Outlook and verify the result.<br />
<br />
Hope the above information helps. Keep us posted on the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.<br />

<h2>            possible to update firmware on a Kin Two so it becomes Kin TwoM&#63;</h2>
                    I purchased a Kin TwoM on eBay, but the seller shipped me a Kin Two (original firmware version, with features no longer supported by Verizon) by accident or because they did not know the difference.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can return the phone to the seller, but was wondering if it is possible to update the firmware so the Kin Two becomes a Kin TwoM. I haven't found any mention of this online, but it seems at least plausibly possible.<br />
<br />
(Alternately, if the Kin Two will function exactly the same as the Kin TwoM (just without a calendar or calculator) I might just stick with it and pretend the "spot" doesn't exist, and ignore the "loop" screen.</div>
                </div>

            Hello. According to this Wiki, you can downgrade the TwoM to a Two:
<div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Kin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Kin</a>
<div>See the comeback section.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>To upgrade it, you might have to go through the manufacturer, Sharp, who would have access to the TwoM ROM. They have probably long forgotten about it. So, while in theory possible, might be very difficult and expensive.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Maybe it is a TwoM model-wise but it was downgraded to hard-reset all the info off of it prior to selling. It sounds like the OSs are close; the M lacking the cloud features that were inactivated.&nbsp;</div>

            Yeah, I was hoping to go the other way but I expect you are right that only the manufacturer can upgrade the ROM.
<div><br />
<div>The model I received is a Kin Two (not the TwoM) because it doesn't have the "M" stamped onto the under-the-battery-pack label (in clearly post-production ink), the way that updated devices have.</div>

            Hello. If it is a Two and they advertised a TwoM you definitely can threaten false advertising and bad feedback. A good rep eBay seller will make it right. Not sure if there is a difference in market value, though.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I don't think it was out long enough to develop interest in the custom ROM community to mod it unofficially. Also, if I recall correctly, the OS was locked down and kinda like the model for Windows Phone 7. So the manufacturer is really the only way to
 go.&nbsp;</div>

<p>I ordered a Booklet 3G which should be here in 2 days. I intend to format the HD and install Win 7 Professional to get a clean system without all the added bloat. Can anyone here point me to the support site where the booklets software is listed (bios, drivers
 etc)?</p>

<p>I only found the&nbsp;"Nokia Booklet 3G software updater" (not yet available). Will this be everything they offer?</p>

<h2>            Mail merge with letterhead</h2>
                    <p>I have run a mail merge on letterhead.&nbsp; The letterhead has our logo and address details in the header and directors in the footer.&nbsp; When I run the merge, the first page does not have the logo and address details but does have the directors in the footer.&nbsp;
 All the pages after the first are fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            Different first page would be the way to handle this. Are you sure that the header footers are correctly configured?<br />
<br />
Note that Word 97-2003 and Word 2010 handle graphics differently. If this is an old converted document it might be worth rebuilding it from scratch.<br />

            <p>Hi Graham</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the advice.&nbsp; I will try rebuilding the letterhead in 2010 and see if that helps.&nbsp; If it does, I will have to rebuild lots of documents before the rest of the company is upgraded to 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will let you know.</p>

            I have not seen or heard of that specific problem. There is an alternate "auto" scroll method you can try. Anywhere on the page, Press and hold the mouse button / middle mouse button and drag down slightly. You should see a 2 headed arrow display. The
 farther you drag your mouse pointer from that intial indicator, the faster it scrolls.<br />
<br />
In general, the type of problem you are describing is often caused by a 3rd party addon.&nbsp;&nbsp; To test that, try starting Word in Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
<b>Shortcut to Start Word in Safe Mode or Excel in Safe Mode, Hold &lt;CTL&gt; key when clicking on icon or using
<span>using the Start menu search window and entering</span></b><span>
</span><b>WINWORD.EXE /a<span>&nbsp; </span>or<span>&nbsp; </span>
WINWORD.EXE /safe</b>
<br />
<br />
Here are some more trouble shooting techniques you can try if that doesn't work<br />
<br />
<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b>
<b>Trouble Shoot Word problems that occur when you start or use Word 2010, 2007, 2003, or 2002
</b>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541</span></a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>2003-2010</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>NOTE:
</b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie “send to Bluetooth”, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting process.
 Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<b>Don’t Assume ANYTHING!</b>
<p>Don’t assume some part of the trouble shooting processes listed below doesn’t apply to you. Often there are things going on in the background that you just aren’t aware of. For example, when installing software it is all too easy to have
 an unwanted app installed if you don’t carefully read every screen. </p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<b>Uninstall Recent Software</b>
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The following Skype links are an example of this issue</p>

&lt;snip&gt;I found some posts on line about opening each product that was closing in safe mode and disabling the ABBYY Reader add-on.&nbsp; THis solved my problems.&nbsp; Not sure why but I disabled that add on in WORD, EXCEL, and OUTLOOK and they all work now.&nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; While I couldn't precisely say whether the problems from Office stemmed from the iCloud Panel software, I decided to uninstall the software as I don't use it anyway. After doing that, Office is now working perfectly fine. No more
 re-starting or crashing when I'm running IE at the back, nor trying to copy something in Word or Excel. It looks like the iCloud Panel software does have some compatibility issues with Office. &lt;/snip&gt;

<p>Starting in March 2012, "Skype click to Call" has been causing problems File Open problems, and Copy/Paste problems in Office Apps.
</p>
<p>The quick test for this problem is to close all open browsers. If the problem goes away it is probably Skype.</p>
<p>March 30 – MS has released an update to Skype that fixes the problem. Go to the Skype site, download and install the newest version ofc the program.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>For anyone reading this, I figured out the problem after surfing the web for the past 3-4 weeks. Painful process. I have a paid version of Advanced SystemCare Pro, v5.2.0. 3-4 weeks ago, while scanning through it's vast offerings, I came
 across a feature I could activate called "Smart RAM". I turned it on and checked the 5 boxes it offers in the settings. The last of those 5 is "Clean Clipboard". I unchecked this box a few minutes ago and it fixed my issues. I now have no problems with copy/paste.
 Info only, it case it helps anyone.</p>

<p>&lt;snip&gt;<span>&nbsp; </span>Hi, I recently came across this problem in MS Word 2007 where after I type or hit any key on my keyboard while in the Word window, I can no longer highlight text with my mouse (by clicking once at the beginning
 of the text and dragging the mouse to the end of the text portion that I want to highlight). I have found that if I click out of the Word window and press any key on the keyboard, this seems to resolve the problem and I can finally highlight with my mouse.
 However, as soon as I type anything in the Word window again, highlighting with the mouse no longer works. Clicking on any key again within the Word window does not resolve the issue- I have to push a key outside the Word window in order to resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; Hi, I just figured out the problem. I had installed the Synergy program 1.5 weeks ago and by uninstalling it the problem appears to be resolved. Thank you both for your time and help. &nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; I had the same problem, i ran windword in safe mode successfully and disabled ABBYY FineReader 9.0 and the problem was solved as well, all is fine now and office is awesome!!&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; <span>
I ran my old Word 2010 and removed the ABBYY add-in. I didn't have to disable the whole program. I also did the "Quick Repair" and the "Online Repair" of Office 2013 Preview, but I'm pretty sure it was the add-in removal that made the difference.
</span>&lt;/snip</p>

<p>Thanks for all your help everyone.</p>
<p>As a recap:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>My Office 2010 was a Click-to-Run version</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Word suddenly giving me messages about "Downloading the Required Feature," freezing up, slowing down...</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Ultimately had to uninstall Office</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Reinstalled it from the Microsoft website with my product key, choosing the 64-bit version instead of the Click-to-Run version</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Installed all new updates from Windows Updates</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restarted computer</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Word working quickly with no messages, but became unresponsive when trying to open old files</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Went to File-&gt;Options-&gt;Add-Ins-&gt;Go-&gt; and unchecked Bluetooth.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Everything seems to be back to normal, if not better than before.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
<p>
My problem is if I copy text from a web site or from Excel, Access etc into Word all I get is a black spot.</p>
<p>
I have tried a repair install and checking all the settings against my laptop - where this function works properly.
</p>
<p>The problem is caused by a defective Bluetooth add-in for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, turn off the Com Addin.</p>
<p><b><span>Additional Notes:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The defective Bluetooth add-in is usually installed by a Bluetooth driver. (In my case - Intel Centrino Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed Adaptor (v1.1))</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Updating your Bluetooth driver (or reverting to an older version) may also resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Unfortunately simply disabling the add-in through the Word options may result in a 3 second freeze when loading Word 2007. (If this is a problem, changing to a different bluetooth driver version may be the better option)</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Oddly enough, this ended up being the cause of my problem. I had an older print driver installed on my Win7 machine and once I removed that driver, Word started working without any problems!</p>
<p>You can delete individual printer drivers by going into the registry. Note that simply going to Printers and Faxes and deleting a printer there does not delete the printer driver.</p>
<p>Follow <strong><span>Step 3</span></strong> in my previous post about a printer error to remove the printer drivers:</p>

<span>Here is a truely Off-the-wall solution that is in the same class as bad RAM and bad Video Cards</span></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; My problem turned out to be related to the WYSE thin clients we were using to connect to the Win 2008 R2 Terminal servers.&nbsp; The software that allows/enhances use of dual screens called WYSE TXC Multi-Display v1.2.1.7 was causing
 the applications to crash (including IE 9 32bit).&nbsp; Once this software was disabled - The errors stopped.</p>
<p>I have a feeling this software doesn't like Windows Server 2008 R2.&nbsp; It was being used successfully on Server 2003.&nbsp; I have seen a&nbsp; few other posts on Google for people searching for an updated version without success. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<i>Office 2013 instead.&nbsp; I am having problems with Excel, Word and Outlook printing to two separate HP laserjet printers, models 1522nf and model 3015.&nbsp; I can print one file from these applications.&nbsp; The second file locks up the Excel, Word or Outlook
 program and the only solution that I have found is to close out of the program.&nbsp; If I restart my computer, I can then print one file beofre it locks up again.&nbsp; This only happens with my HP Laserjet Printers.&nbsp; I have a HP Officejet 8600 printer that does not&nbsp;have
 any problems printing in Office 2013 Excel, Word or Outlook.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both of my Laserjet printers will print anything on Internet Exployer or non Office based programs without any issues.&nbsp; I have downloaded the latest drivers for these printers and looked for any
 latest updates to Office 2013 and made sure that I had the most recent.</i></p>
<p>I installed the printer driver Vista version for my HP Laserjet 1522 and that fixed the problem with the Spolling / Cache issue with Office 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Buy and HP via phone could not come up with this answer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks again!</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<b>Starting point when Word does something unexpected</b>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word, any version, go to Tools and then Options and study all the settings on all the tabs. You may even find some settings that
 you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If you're wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each time
 the answer was, "I'd use a Word table." By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>

            Thank you for the info.&nbsp; As a result, I looked at what I could uninstall and started with microsoft 2007 trial version - which was pre-installed when the computer was purchased - and which I wasn't aware I still had on computer.&nbsp; Once uninstalled, I tried
 manoevring in word 2013 and it worked great......yesterday - but today the problem is back.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will persevere, and&nbsp;try the other things you suggested.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you again.&nbsp;

            Well, that is a surprise, since I do have both installed and working on the same machine.&nbsp; But since you are not using the trial, it is a good thing to remove it even to simply free up the extra space on the drive.<br />

            This problem does in fact exist. It's easy to reproduce actually: <br />
<br />
1. Open a long document in Word 2013<br />
2. Scroll down a bit <b>using the arrow button in the vertical scrollbar</b> to read beyond the first page<br />
3. Wait a bit without moving the mouse from the arrow button (the one you used to scroll). Actually, you only have to wait until horizontal scrollbar hides itself (about 5 seconds in my laptop).
<br />
4. Try to scroll again without moving the mouse (just clicking, you left the mouse over the arrow button, remember?)<br />
5. Scrolling will not work. It's as if the button is not there. The fix is moving the mouse even a tiny little bit (that produces the horizontal scrollbar to appear again).
<br />
<br />
IMO, the problem is that Office thinks it hid the scrollbars (they are not working) but forgets to stop showing the vertical one (probably because the mouse is over it). Funnily enough, the problem only happens with the vertical scrollbar, the horizontal one
 works as expected.<br />
<br />
Or maybe the problem is simpler: why does Office 2013 hide the scrollbars in the first place? I understand that on a tablet, but on a PC with a display that is 2560 pixels wide, hiding it is plain stupid.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />
<br />
Edit: Actually, the problem seems to happen only with the combination of Office 2013 on Windows 8: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-word/scroll-bar-in-word-2013-freezes-i-need-to-move/896d037d-ede8-4392-b5d2-240962f5362f so
 that explains why it's difficult to see (since so few people seem to be using Win 8)<br />

That's great! :) now, we only should wait for Microsoft to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Notice this thread exists</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Do the testing</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Understand that it is in fact a bug (hardest part, possibly)</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Fix it</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Test the fix</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Distribute the fix.</p>

            MS does monitor the forum, so MS has probably noticed it. <br />
<br />
The hardest part is getting someone there to agree it is a bug worth fixing. <br />
<br />
We can do nothing about that. Your best hope is if a LOT of people complain about it. Even then chances are slim. Look at how many people are complaining about Metro and the "Win 8 start screen" and the bland 2013 color schemes.

You are absolutely correct. I reinstalled my PC with Windows 7 (couldn't stand Windows 8) and the problem happens also with Windows 7, so that seems to point to a bug in Office, nothing to do with the operating system. Strange a bug so simple to reproduce passed
 through testing.<br />

            Hello German, Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
So, Microsoft, are you out there?<br />
<br />
This is a pretty obvious bug that does affect ease of use.&nbsp; For example: you move the onscreen arrow to the bottom of the vertical scrollbar and left-click.&nbsp; The document scrolls down, as expected.&nbsp; Wait ten seconds.&nbsp; Left-click again.&nbsp; You expect the document
 to scroll down again, but nothing happens.&nbsp; You have to move the arrow with the mouse or touch pad, at least slightly, and then left-clicking will make it scroll down.&nbsp; It is very annoying when working one's way through a document to have to keep "waking up"
 the scroll feature.<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, this started happening to me when I installed Office 2013, in a Windows 7 environment.&nbsp; I had been using Office 2010, with Windows 7, for a long time, and never had this problem.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So, may I ask, is anyone from Microsoft reading this?&nbsp; Thank you.<br />
<br />
Mark<br />

    <title>how to export shared contacts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how to export shared contacts&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My organization uses Office 365 Small Business with users using Office/Outlook 2013. We do not use OWA.</p>

<p>We have a shared contacts folder with over 10,000 contacts that we want to backup/export. In Outlook under File -&gt; Export -&gt; save as .pst the other local folders are all listed. But not the shared contacts folders. In the Office 365 Exchange Admin Center,
 I can browse to the shared folder via Public Folders -&gt; More Contacts -&gt; Shared Contacts&nbsp; but there is no backup/export function that I can see.</p>

<p>Help?</p>

<p>hi jennifer,</p>
<p>based on my test, i can select the contact folder under the public folders instead of the primary mailbox to export the contacts.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0cac3928-d6ee-4730-9b59-99dc2a04b843" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0cac3928-d6ee-4730-9b59-99dc2a04b843" /></a><br />
if you cannot see the public folders when exporting pst, i need to collect some detailed information to look into the issue:<br />
1.&nbsp;a screenshot of the shared contacts in the outlook client.<br />
2.&nbsp;a screenshot of the contact folder in eac (exchange admin center).<br />
3.&nbsp;a screenshot of the folder list which displays when exporting pst.<br />
4.&nbsp;does the issue occur to all users in your organization?<br />
5.&nbsp;the versions of the operating system and the outlook client. to check them, go to file&gt;office account.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/928c6f38-7ee0-4ef7-bbd2-a862b99db81c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/928c6f38-7ee0-4ef7-bbd2-a862b99db81c" /></a></p>
<p>to upload screenshots, click use rich formatting &gt; insert\ edit media.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/891f6037-821f-4edb-b267-28424a979a5c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/891f6037-821f-4edb-b267-28424a979a5c" /></a></p>

    <title>Determine Max Date - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Determine Max Date</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue with trying to get Excel to display the latest/max date in a series of 6 fields (all in the same row) - saved in the Date format mm/dd/yyyy.&nbsp; I've tried changing to the alter format of dd month yyyy (eg 20 December 2018) but continue
 to get a #Value - even though the Evaluation steps shows the correct Serial Number for the date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm working on a shared system so I don't have the ability to change the Date Format for all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems too simple to be this problematic - just want to be able to change any of the (6) dates and have the 'display' cell show the that later date - as opposed to having to do this manually.&nbsp;

<p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To change the format of the dates, present in Excel workbook, follow the below steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Select the cells which you want to change the date format.</p>
<p>b. Click <strong>Ctrl + 1</strong>&gt; In the Number tab, select the <strong>Date
</strong>in the Category.</p>
<p>c. Select the format as per your requirement in the <strong>Type</strong>&gt; Ok</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don’t have the format as your requirement, you can create a custom date format, you can refer to this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/format-a-date-the-way-you-want-8e10019e-d5d8-47a1-ba95-db95123d273e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Format a date the way you want</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use the Function provided by HansV, to get the later date among the selected dates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            editing date of birth in Outlook account</h2>
                    <p>Hello, please help, I'm going stir crazy! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to change the date of birth in the Outlook account of our community voluntary group. We gave the date of birth when the community group was born (2015) and it's now (3 years later!) causing problem because we're deemed to be minor. I've linked the
 account to our bank account but parental permission still asked for. I've gone into account &gt; your info but when clicking 'edit date of birth' it takes me to another screen showing gender, country, postcode etc and birthdate but the latter is not editable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from the fact, we've never had this before and it's potentially threatening the whole viability of our charitable organisation, I really hope the Microsoft team can take up and answer our case ASAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Tell me about it.&nbsp; Same thing has happened to us.&nbsp; We set up an email for the business, which shows a date of birth as 2013, and now it thinks I'm a child and wants parental consent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Compromising my business now and I'm not happy either!<br />
</p>
<p>Also, whatever they have done, means I can't access the account on my mobile.&nbsp; It reports a server error every 15 minutes, which is what I have the sync set to on my phone!</p>

<p>Sorry to hear! I was hesitant to put in our Visa card details at first, but then thought I'd try and it seemed to work - I've now been able to change the date of birth on the account and the card details don't seem to have been stored. Cross fingers....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can sort yours out too.</p>

    <title>How do I convert a .tif file to a doc, .docx, .rtf, .pdf, or .txt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arun rattan  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I convert a .tif file to a doc, .docx, .rtf, .pdf, or .txt file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a transcript saved as a .tif file.&nbsp; I want to attach the file as part of an application for a job.&nbsp; However, the attachment will only work if the attached transcript is in a .doc, .docx, .rtf, .pdf or .txt file format?&nbsp; Is the conversion method built
 into the .tif file or do you have to find a converted program off the internet.&nbsp; Is it built into word that it can take a .tif file, bring it in and convert it to a .doc or .docx file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Business will not provision</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; I'm a new employee at my company.&nbsp; When setting up OneDrive for Business, I get an error (via web GUI) that "Sorry for the wait.&nbsp; Your OneDrive is almost ready."&nbsp; This has been going on for over a week now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Sharepoint will also not let me follow relevant sites that I need to follow.&nbsp; I believe this may be related to the OneDrive issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked the folks in our IT department, but they are scratching their heads and don't seem very interested.&nbsp; I need these tools to work so that I can do the job that they hired me for.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span>This issue generally occurs if file association in the user account gets damaged. Creating a new user profile should fix the issue. To create a new user account to do this,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt; user account -&gt;Manage User Accounts-&gt;click Add-&gt;Next -&gt;select Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Finish.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Switch to new user account and check if it works fine</span></p>
