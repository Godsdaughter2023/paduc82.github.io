<h2>            All outbound emails bouncing back to Hotmail.com and co.uk addresses</h2>
                    <p>We have an almighty frustrating issue when sending emails to Hotmail.com and co.uk addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately our frustrations are made worse by the fact that all of the emails bouncing back are intended for customers who are expecting a speedy response to their enquiries as welll as confirmation of their orders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the message we are receiving with the bounced back emails, from outlook.com:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Your message couldn't be delivered because the recipient's email system reported the following error: '550 Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable'. It's possible it's a temporary issue
 with their email system. Try to resend the message. If the problem continues, contact the recipient by some other means (by phone for example) and ask them to tell their email admin about the problem. Be sure to give them the error above, as it will better
 help them diagnose the problem.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em>For Email Administrators</em><br />
<em>This error is being returned by the recipient's email system but it doesn't include a valid, specific, enhanced SMTP status code, making it difficult to assess exactly what the problem is. Please carefully examine the error reported by the recipient's email
 system to help diagnose and troubleshoot the problem. Only the recipient's email admin will be able to fix this.
</em></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em>SNT004-MC1F28.hotmail.com gave this error:</em><br />
<em>Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable </em></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can confirm that all of the email addresses are valid and have been responded to via another email address, so the issue definitely lies with either our email address settings, now being hosted on an Office 365 mailbox or with hotmail / outlook / live
 blacklisting our IP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a solution to this increasingly frustrating and damaging issue?</p>
<p>

    <title>Is the a search function in Nokia Music Manager&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is the a search function in Nokia Music Manager&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So I got my +7000 files in Nokia Music Manager, and like it is in most of your heavy collections, it is not correctly tagged. That means sometimes the title starts with the title and sometimes with tracknumber-title combination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I need a search function. Where is it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi cdrewing,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure, if Nokia Music Manager has this feature of searching by Artist, Title etc., But if your phone is compatible with Nokia Music, you can install Nokia Music which has this feature in it.</p>

<h2>            Manually resizing table columns in Word - cursor issue</h2>
                    <p><span>Since switching to Word 2013 I have found it very fiddly to position the cursor just right to allow me to manually adjust table column width.
</span><span>It switches from arrow cursor to text cursor far too quickly. Unless you painstakingly ease the pointer towards the cell border millimetre by millimetre - a noticeable waste of time if you have to do it frequently, which I do - the resize
 cursor flashes into and out of existence too quickly to be useful.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is there a trick (a keyboard shortcut would be ideal, but I'll take anything) that calls up the resize cursor quickly and reliably?</span></p>

            <p>I don't believe there's any keyboard shortcut, but you can use the column markers on the horizontal ruler to adjust column widths. They should be easier to grab than the column borders.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cba17e2a-eb37-4370-8a01-94f61cec51da" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just move the marker, the columns to the right keep their current sizes and the whole table's width changes. If you hold the Shift key down while moving the marker, the single column to the right adjusts as the width of the column to the left changes.</p>

    <title>N80 Firmware fixes &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mbil  say:</h3>
<h2>            N80 Firmware fixes &#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Does anybody know when a bugfixed firmware for N80 is available ?<br />
<br />
For bugfixed I mean so that WiFi EAP-LEAP and PEAP works with hidden SSIDs.<br />
<br />
I still lack any info about users who succesfully runs a N80 with EAP-PEAP MSCHAPv2 or EAP-LEAP.

            yes I do.<br />
But it doesnt makes a difference what version you run - Nokia simply hasnt yet read the manual on how-to code DHCP clients !<br />
-or at least: this part got lost in compilation when porting codebase to the N80 platform, as it works for N91 !<br />
<br />
I have yell about this for the last 6 months, but nobody from Nokia ever replied or even make any noise ...<br />
<br />
sad ...

            I posted several posts previously on the subject:<br />
<br />
/discussions/board/message?board.id=connectivity&amp;message.id=5731#M5731<br />
<br />
In short terms: WiFi client on the N80 doesnt work at all with EAP as the DHCP part that supposes to start after a succesfully user authentication does not start !<br />
<br />
I have only seen this on N80, as other phones works in the same Wifi environment. Fx. the N91 works.

<div>I use an android phone with a google account before I use a Lumia 800. I do sync contact to my phone from my google account. And I found that window phone can not sync all my contact. Many phone numbers are not synced.
<div>Then I found the reason</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In my Google contact, if I set type of phone the same (i.e works, mobile), window phone only sync one of them. Hik. Here is the example</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Contact 1</b></div>
<div>work 12345 ---&gt; synced</div>
<div>mobile 23455 --&gt; synced</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Contact 2</b></div>
<div>mobile 54321 --&gt; synced --&gt; this is the 1st number entered</div>
<div><b>mobile 65432 --&gt; not synced --&gt; will not appear in my contact number</b></div>
<div><b>mobile 12342 --&gt; not synced&nbsp;</b><b>--&gt; will not appear in my contact number</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>So please check this issue and fix it soon. When you finish please mail to my email *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks and Regards</div>

            Only one mobile number can be synced. Use another field for the other numbers such as work or home.

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5AC21062-8D5B-41D2-A7AA-F1DE30C337D4">a_rwena</a>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Nokia Forums and thank you for your post.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I assume you mean the SIM card got stuck in the phone? If this is the case, please bring the phone to a local Nokia Care Centre at your earliest convenience. They will be able to remove the SIM card and repair any potential
 damage that has been caused to the device.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find the address for your nearest local Care centre on your local Nokia web page under the Support tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please get back to me to let me know if you manage to resolve your issue, otherwise I can provide further support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the same problem. I would take it in to my nearest care centre if I knew where that was. The care centre finder, if you will excuse me saying, is useless. It is based on a search of a known location. If you know where to find a centre you can use
 search, if not you get no result. But if you know where to look, why are you looking?<br />
I live in a small town in north east surrey. There is no care centre here, but in order to find one I have to search town by town and hope I strike lucky. I can just search on London and get the care centres to the north of me - buried in the major conurbation.
 But there may be a centre to the south, east or west of where I am that would be more convenient to visit.<br />
So, is there a list anywhere which simply identifies care centres, perhaps by county, which would enable users to make a bssic human judgement of which is the closest?</p>

<p>&nbsp;If you type Surrey into the centre finder you get a list of all available care centres in Surrey.</p>

<p>Thanks Ray. I had in fact done that, but I had care centres selected as a search criterion rather than all options. The zero return presumably shows that Nokia has no care centres anywhere in Surrey, which seems something of an omission. If you take that
 as a national indicator it would seem that my original suggestion of a list of all care centres would not be too onerous a task to compile and make available on line.</p>

<p>I rang Nokia and they gave me the address of my nearest CarPhone Warehouse. I pointed out that this was listed as a retailer and not a care centre. I was told that whatever department I was talking to "worked on a different system" and that this was an authorised
 care centre. I'll find out tomorrow when I pay a visit.</p>

<p>Just preventeda a red face moment at CarPhone Warehouse by solving my stuck card problem myself. I took off the flexible case. It fits so well I had forgotten it was there, and there is no cut out for the SIM hatch like there is for the USB.:blink:</p>

    <title>Screen clipping with external monitor &#38; windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> octevaobijaju  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen clipping with external monitor &#38; windows 10</h2>
                    In windows 8.1 when I took a screen clipping while connected to my external monitor it only turned the screen (screen 1)&nbsp;I was selected on white, leaving any app that I may have running on the screen 2 (extended display setting) up. But now with windows
 10, both screens go white and minimizes my app running on screen 2. Its really annoying because I'm watching Netflix on&nbsp;screen 2 &amp; I have to keep restarting the video after every screen clipping.&nbsp;Is there anything I can do to not do this?

            Drivers are already updated. It seems its not just the screen clipping that causes apps open on monitor 2 to close. Opening files, office, many other apps, also cause whatever is on monitor 2 to close. Which is frustrating trying to keep a 1 yr old busy
 with a movie on screen 2 while I'm working on screen 1, since the movies keeps stopping every time I open something.

            I can't believe&nbsp; that. When deleting some file, there is an option&nbsp; called "Mark all". But for access points can not!

<p>That option is there for messages because it's quite normal to have hundreds of messages. &nbsp;It's not normal to have hundreds of access points. &nbsp;The phone must have seen more action than Paris Hilton to have that many!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you will either have to delete them one by one or wipe the phone to get rid of them quickly.</p>

<h2>            MS Health Dashboard not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I get the following error message (see the attached pic) when I try to sign on my MS Health dashboard. This is happening since 5-6 days already and independently if I'm using my PC or Android tablet, independently on the web browser. I can't access the data
 neither from my Windows phone. Does anyone know what's happening?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Geo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be a problem with how your devices connect with the network source. Have you checked if the same thing will happen when you're connected to a different network, or when you're using mobile data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can reset the Microsoft Band app for the Android and Windows phones to resolve app connection problems. Please note that doing this will remove the current configurations and files that you have, but they should be re-downloaded once you set up your
 account again. You can also back up your files so you won't lose anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest using InPrivate browsing to access your Microsoft Health web dashboard through your PC. Press the
<strong>Ctrl + Shift + P</strong> buttons on your keyboard to open an InPrivate browsing tab using Microsoft browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hello,<br />
I do not even know where to start ...<br />
Since the 4th of August the problems with Band 2 have arisen.<br />
I started by uninstalling the Microsoft Band app and reinstalling it again on the Lumia 950 XL and it never worked again with a "network error" ...<br />
I saw many similar questions open.<br />
I stopped trying to solve the problem for myself because I noticed that it was a situation centralized on the servers and that modifications were under way (which Microsoft never said which) ...<br />
Today, without doing anything, by "miracle" I verified that everything is working again, app installed on the Lumia 950 XL, Band 2, Microsoft Health Dashboard ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

<p>I live in Tanzania and this problem started for me two weeks ago and I am unable to access the Health dashboard on my computer, two other computers, the app on my phone and through four different network connections.&nbsp; This is almost certainly a Microsoft
 problem.&nbsp; I have tried using three different browsers, and inprivate browsing.&nbsp; Nothing works. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 Images Not Displaying To Recipients-Sent From Constant - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> turnerje  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 Images Not Displaying To Recipients-Sent From Constant Contact</h2>
                    <p>I send out an internal newsletter to the company I work for every month. I tried to use Outlook to create the email, but with all of the information, images, and links I put in the email, it is very difficult to format. &nbsp;I would like to use Constant Contact
 (or something similar) to send the newsletter to the employees, but they will all need to view the email in a web browser because they all use Outlook 2013. &nbsp;Ideally, the employees would be able to just open the email and view it without having to open it
 in a web browser; I know we lose readers when they have to take that extra step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if it was possible to embed a PDF or image that still had clickable links, I would just do that. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>

            Interesting! Every time I send a test email to myself from Constant Contact and open it up in Outlook, I have to view it in the web browser because the images don't show. &nbsp;It is the same for every email I receive in Outlook from any email address that
 is not internal. &nbsp;I think it is a security feature. I might just have to go back to fighting with formatting in Outlook.

<p>
</p><p>If you send yourself a message that you open up at home (preferably not using the same computer) - still have the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(know this has been said before but I have yet to encounter a problem with emails rec'd via CC. Does your company run its own Exchange server? If so I'd be inclined to have a chat with the Exchange admin to see what's running on the email server that may
 be blocking things)</p>

    <title>Page number distance from edge changes when printed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rahqi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Page number distance from edge changes when printed</h2>
                    <p>University formatting says the page number should be 1.3cm from the edge of page. That setting was easy. However when I print it ends up being 1.5cm and I have been told to fix it. Even checking to make sure there is no scaling when printing from word or
 pdf, the change still happens. When I change to 1cm to get the desired distance of 1.3, but I have lost a page int he whole document without changing any other margins. This is incredibly frustrating.</p>
<p>Office 365 latest update on Windows 10 or 7.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

            Do you have the header/footer margin set at 1.3 cm? If so, that is where the number should be, provided there is no Spacing Before/After in the header/footer paragraph.

<p>Just for the halibut, have you tried placing your page number at 1.1 cm? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Most printers have a narrow unprintable margin on each side of the page, 2mm is reasonable. But normally printer drivers do not fudge the margins like that, they just don't let you print in that area.</p>

<p>This is the problem.</p>
<p>These are the settings I have used. I know how to set margins and headers abd footers for sections etc, but when it prints it doesn't follow the settings.</p>
<p>I have tried printer settings to make sure there is no scaling, but still no success.</p>

<p>I have tried that.</p>
<p>I needed to change the measurement in the layout dialogue to 1cm to create an actual printed 1.3cm. The problem with that is that for some reason the number of pages also changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would do that but the dissertation has a combination of portrait and landscape pages. Landscape sections need to be altered from 1.3 to 1cm manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issue is, what happens when it goes to the printer for binding? Will it change again and i pay for binding that will be rejected?</p>

<p>Thanks for checking, but my question relates to why does the printed measurements differ from the settings in the layout. There are no extra spaces in the footer that would affect the distance from the edge when printed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I type this, I am thinking I will check the font - to make sure normal didn't decide to become a multiple measure with a spacing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thesis formatting and printing is a PITA. Grading on trivialities that are out of our control is so petty, so medieval.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have this problem and specific concern, you will have to talk to the printer, and maybe pay, extra for an unbound proof to verify that the margin at the printer is correct BEFORE it goes to binding.

            I use my Q9m all the time with Internet Sharing and it works quite well so I would expect you can do the same.<br />
<br />
Do you have Internet Sharing in your START menu?&nbsp; If not, use File Manager to navigate to the Windows Directory and find the file "IntShr.lnk&nbsp; ".&nbsp; Copy and then paste a it as a shortcut to your Start Menu.<br />
<br />
(It is probably a hidden file so uncheck the Option to Hide Hidden Files and Hide Stystem Files to see it in the directory).<br />
<br />
It is pretty easy to setup.&nbsp; BTW, I always use a USB connection (rather than Bluetooth).&nbsp; It prevents the battery on your device from being drained and keeps it charged from the laptop so you have a full power when you disconnect)

    <title>IE11 has trouble signing in to YouTube and Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diem  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE11 has trouble signing in to YouTube and Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>My computer was a Windows 7 Lenovo X220 that I upgraded to Windows 8, but I had to reimage it last week, and now it's Windows 7 again, and I'm waiting before I upgrade it to Windows 8 for a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in the meantime, I've been using Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 7, and it was working fine for about a day. Then, however, if I attempted to sign into YouTube, I'd get the message "There was an issue signing you into YouTube. Troubleshoot
<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/?p=oops_checklist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>." I followed all the troubleshooting steps, but none of them helped. Thinking it was just a problem on YouTube's end, since I was able to sign into YouTube just a few hours
 ago, I ignored it. But then it never fixed, and I still get this message. When I try signing in on Google Chrome, it works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, when I tried to check my email, I encountered another problem. I clicked the bookmark to take me to Outlook, and it started switching between loading login.live.com and mail.live.com back and forth for a bit, before coming to a page that said "Something
 went wrong and we can't sign you in right now. Please try again later." Again, the sign in works just fine in Google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So with that established, I believe it's an issue with Internet Explorer, and I hope there's a way to fix it. Does anyone know what to do?</p>

<h2>            Meeting cancellation email is resent everytime Outlook 2010 is opened...how to stop&#63;</h2>
                    I'm using outlook 2010 to interface with a google apps account via google apps sync for Microsoft Outlook [laptop running Window 7 Pro x64]. &nbsp;I created a repeating meeting and invited a bunch of people. &nbsp;A few months down the road, I deleted the meeting
 and sent out a meeting cancellation email. &nbsp;All that seemed to work fine. &nbsp;However, now, every time I close and then reopen Outlook it resends the same cancellation email to everyone who was previously invited (specifically it sends a message for a meeting
 on 14 Dec 2011). &nbsp;I've deleted all instances of this message from the outlook calendar, from the google calendar, and from my iPhone (it syncs with google). &nbsp;I've caught a cancellation notice on the way out the door, rerouted it to me, then tried the "remove
 from calendar" button. &nbsp;I've worked with google customer support to eliminate them as a cause...the emails are definitely generated by Outlook. &nbsp;I've tried outlook/repair and outlook/safe. &nbsp;I can't find anything on the web despite multiple google search sessions...my
 customers are getting tired of receiving spam. &nbsp;This has been occurring for several weeks.

            <p>Hello Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no anytime upgrade option available with Office 2016 version. So, you would not be able to upgrade from a lower edition of Office 2016 to a higher edition of Office 2016.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If Office Home and Student 2016 was purchased from a retail store you will have to get back to the retailer and ask for a refund or exchange with Office Home &amp; Business 2016.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In case you purchased Office 2016 from the Microsoft Store you may contact the Microsoft Store:<br />

<p>A relatively minor query, but is there a way I can add the screen clipping option to the Main (not the email) ribbon - I want to be able to screen clip without having to open/pop out the email - is there any way I can do this? I know it only saves three
 or four clicks, but I use this function in about 1/3rd of my mails!</p>
<p>Any help will be much appreciated,</p>

    <title>Which PowerPoint version to use&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> courtenayguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Which PowerPoint version to use&#63;</h2>
                    I am running Microsoft Office 2007 on a Windows 7 system, and often have the following happen when creating PowerPoint shows for email distribution.
<div>I 'time' the slides and also insert sounds {.MP3 or .wav files} on almost all the shows, and then send &nbsp;them out on email.</div>
<div>Many of my recipients can view the shows, they're automatically seeing the slides move and the sounds, but the odd person cannot.</div>
<div>I know they're not all on the same version of Office and/or the same operating system, but one user can never seem to have sound. They're running XP on a laptop, and can see the slides move through, but have no sound no matter what they try!</div>
<div>Any ideas? &nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            It could be either or both.
<div><br />
<div>If the sound is linked, his copy of PPT needs to be able to find the sound file in the first place (in other words, the link must be valid on his computer)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once PPT has found the sound, it has to be able to get some of the built-in Windows components to play it. &nbsp;If the sound is of a type that his PC won't play independently, then it won't play in PPT either.</div>

            <p>I'm pretty much inline with what Steve Rindsberg had to say about the OLE linking embedding comments. That'd be the first thing I'd check. There should be an Edit Links to Files dialog under Office Button &gt; Prepare. At least I think it's repair. I'm running
 Office 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, have you checked online for help articles for troubleshooting sound, either F1 or Bing, or even support.microsoft.com? They should have something if I recall from supporting it a few years back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My answer to your question in the original post's subject line:</p>
<p>Which PowerPoint version to use?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>From my experience supporting PowerPoint at Microsoft for mostly enterprise and premier customers (some personal, consumers), Office 2007 ran best on Vista. Both fully patched: Office 2007 SP3 and Vista SP2. If you have Windows 7 then you should yourself
 be at Office 2010, and have all the latest patches applied. I'm not sure what the target users having the discrepancy are running. The file format used (ppt or pptx or pptm) and add-ins across versions is hit and miss sometimes in terms of a consistently reliable
 experience. It's just not going to happen. But there's the 2007 Compatibility Pack. I typically recommend the author (in this case you) creating it in PowerPoint 2007 saving as a pptx, then copying/sharing for access on the target computer with 2003/WinXP
 or whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's some issues I've seen with web server integration on Office 2007 and Windows 7. HTTP client/server integration in regards to the WebClient service and the old Rosebud and WebDAV stuff that doesn't work so well. There's unwanted or unexpected authentication
 prompts that are harder to mitigate if Office 2007 is on Windows 7 versus Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Device compatibility can also be tricky depending on your hardware. Anything wired into your PC or on-board your portable device (tablet) gets initialized and hooked into PowerPoint when the application loads. So your printer, keyboard, mouse, monitor (graphics
 card), SSD or hard drive, proc, all could be at play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one thing I discourage is running multiple versions of desktop applications especially MS Office suites or apps. Even Publisher 2002/2003 or Visio 2002/2003 with Office 2007 is really a bad idea. There's ways with RemoteApp or Citrix to mitigate special
 needs such as these and virtual machines to avoid dual-boot scenarios. All much better in my opinion to having Office shared components continually have non-versioned components unregistered or re-registered every time you bounce between versions. File associations,
 etc... can and probably will be messed up if you use multiple versions of the applications on a regular basis and the only thing you can do is repair the one you need to use before you use it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The optimal (Windows) operating system paths for reliability and stability for Microsoft Office suite/applications versions running on Windows are as follows:</p>
<p>Office 2003 SP3 on Windows XP SP3</p>
<p>Office 2007 SP3 on Vista SP2*</p>
<p>Office 2010 SP1* on Windows 7 SP1*</p>
<p>Office 2013 RTM** on Windows 8 RTM**</p>
<p>*SP stands for "service pack". Newer versions of Windows operating system may have a newer updated service pack or cumulative update recommended.</p>
<p>**RTM stands for "release to manufacturing". This is the "base" or "no service&nbsp;packs applied"&nbsp;version. It's the original version that's shipped on the media or download. But in this context it simply means either they haven't released SP1 yet or I haven't
 heard of anything for SP1 for 2013 yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your situation:&nbsp;unless you want to throw down money to upgrade to 2010, which may be a little fruitless since 2013 is going to be a better deal, would be to simply run Microsoft Update (Windows Update + opt into Microsoft Update for Office updates automatically).
 If that doesn't work repair Office on the author computer and the target. If you're running multiple Office or PowerPoint versions side-by-side (installed on the same computer at the same time) then just repair PowerPoint in the control panel by repairing
 Microsoft Office &lt;version&gt; in Add or Remove Programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other options would include the latest PowerPoint Viewer, but you'll run into file association conflicts with the last registered app (editor or viewer) will launch the application after the corresponding file type (pptx, ppt, pptm) is opened, depending
 on the current state of the Windows File Associations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do some searching online about PowerPoint not playing sounds on only certain computers for the environment and form factor you're running (OS/Office/hardware) and run the sound troubleshooter and any other multimedia troubleshooters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One other tip, if it's a pptx or pptm (Office OpenXML) extension (not binary like ppt), rename the file extension from .pptx to .zip and check the \media folder, pull that out on the target computer and try to open, try playing with Windows Media Player
 and mplay32.exe (legacy tool only on Windows XP for troubleshooting audio).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another trick I've seen is to save a pptx file as ppt on the creators (authors) 2007 box, close open the ppt and save back as pptx.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Repairing the 2007 compatibility pack on the older Windows XP, pre-2007 box (PowerPoint 2002 or 2003) box is a good idea, you do that the same way under Add or Remove Programs, running Microsoft Update should fully patch the 2007 compatibility pack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, Windows XP is at the "end of life", that is Microsoft will no longer support Windows XP as of April 14th, 2014.</p>

 why there is no option for this.

<p>Hi Chyboy,<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions!<br />
<br />
For us to better understand your concern, can you provide the following information?<br />
<br />
1. Is there any error message when trying to access the applications?<br />
2. Which internet connection are you using?<br />
<br />
You can try these basic troubleshooting steps to isolate and hopefully resolve your concern:<br />
<br />
1. <strong>Reboot your phone.</strong> Turn off the phone, remove the battery and wait for a few seconds. Return the battery and switch on the device.<br />
2. <strong>Restore the phone back to its factory settings</strong>. This process should not delete any personal file saved on the phone.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Menu &gt; Settings and Restore factory sett. &gt; Settings only</strong>. The default code is
<strong>12345</strong> unless otherwise changed.<br />
<br />
3.<strong> Reinstall the software.</strong> Since you're phone is up-to date, you can try to reinstall it using the Nokia Suite:
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokiasuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.com/nokiasuite</a>
<br />
<br />
4. <strong>Reformat the device.</strong> This will wipe everything on the phone, so make sure to create a backup file.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Menu &gt; Settings and Restore factory sett. &gt; All.</strong><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Word 2016 switches to Read Mode when enabling macro document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan_212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 switches to Read Mode when enabling macro document</h2>
                    <p>I have Word 2016 (actually Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus) and Windows 7.&nbsp; I frequently use a custom built .docm form with a few macros linked to buttons on the form.&nbsp; When I open one of these forms I always have to click "Enable Content" to enable the macros.&nbsp;
 For some reason when I click to Enable Content, Word suddenly started changing the View of the document to Read Mode.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a major problem because one of these buttons is supposed to run a macro which opens a second custom .docm form and the macro auto-populates a lot of fields on the second form with info from the first form.&nbsp; This second form is also opening in Read
 Mode though so the macro gives me Run-time error '4605' and says, "The Unprotect method or property is not available because this command is not available for reading."&nbsp; So the macro errors out and doesn't finish running because Word changes into Read Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open any Word file, it is opening by default to Print Layout, which is what I want.&nbsp; But for some reason now when I try to enable or run the custom macros, Word is changing the view to Read Mode which kills the macros.&nbsp; I have been using these custom
 forms at work for almost a year without ever seeing this bug, and I have no idea what changed to cause this.&nbsp; I checked the options in Word for General - Start up options and verified that the box is UNchecked for the option which says, "Open e-mail attachments
 and other uneditable files in reading view."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me figure out how to fix Word so it stops changing itself into Read Mode view?</p>

            Hey guys, thanks for the suggestions and help.&nbsp; FYI, I found the guy who created these custom forms in Word and found out it's the VBA code he wrote which puts Word into read mode.&nbsp; So it's not Word's fault that it goes into read mode!&nbsp; However, the VBA
 code should put it immediately back into print layout but it's erroring out at that point and the only thing we can think&nbsp;is something must have corrupted my Word installation because no one else is experiencing the same issue with these forms.&nbsp; So I'm going
 to try to uninstall and then re-install MS Office to see if that fixes my issue.&nbsp;

<h2>            Nokia N8 Drains Battery in 3 hours and gets really Hot</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I've been having a problem with my Nokia N8,&nbsp; It gets really really hot, and drains my battery in just over 3 hours, I have tried:soft reset, hard reset, its currently running symbian anna with all updates. I bought a new BL-4D OEM from Amazon, and
 the problem persist, so I know its not a battery problem.<br />
<br />
The problem started even before I updated to Anna so I don't think it is an upgrade problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does any body have the same problem?</p>

<p>Sorry, you replaced a non-user-changeable battery with a new one ?<br />
I'm afraid if you did so you already voided your warranty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you sure you don't have WLAN-scanning active, or Bluetooth active ?</p>

<p>No, I don't have the wifi scanning nor bluetooth active, but even with that active i used to have at least 14 hours of battery using a few minutes of 3g internet browsing, gps, music and photos daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone is over 1 year old so I dont think it has warranty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it would benice to know, If nokia repairs this Kind of problems, even if the services cost, because it wouldnt be righ to throw a 500 dollar phone to the trash just because its out of warranty</p>

<p>The strange thing is that some times it even without use, for example some times the symptoms appears after a few minutes of use, but othe times, I get my phone out of my pants for the first time on the day and the phone its extremly hotlike if I have been
 talking or playing for hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the battery replacement I dont think would be an issue in the warranty because, its the same battery, and no body could tell that the phone was oppened</p>

            Have you tried something like Appstop from Nokia Store to see what is running?<br />
Also try a different Sim card, perhaps yours is faulty.<br />
Last resort would be a hard reset and don't restore anything for as while and see what happens.

            Yes I´v tried appstop, nokia battery monitor, without notiving anything strange, about a month ago, my SIM burnt out, I think it was beacuse of the heat, so I replaced with a new one, so de SIM is also discarted. Now I power off the cellphone for a few
 seconds when it starts to get to hot, to avoid any more damage to the sim or internal circuitss

<p>Try and remove the SIM card from the device , and test it for a day to see if the same thing happens. (or just set the phone to offline mode)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has happened to me twice actually.</p>
<p>The Nokia N8&nbsp;had issues with the SIM and accessing the network and got caught in a loop it seemed . It constantly started contacting the operator network over and over again trying to connect with data traffic. &nbsp; This contact with the operator should only
 happen once in a while checking that is has connection with the operator network, &nbsp;but if the phone constantly does this every single second ..this will take a lot of power, and it will make the phone really really warm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has actually happened with my Nokia N95 once as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even tried a new SIM card, but did not help.</p>
<p>What did though was to remove the APN's and get new once from the operator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strange thing was that on both the N8 and the N95 the&nbsp;same&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;was still there&nbsp;after a hard reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My final theory that I came up with was that after I did a factory reset, the phone re-read the APN setting from the SIM card. &nbsp; ..and there was an issue with these APN's&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I changed the SIM, the incorrect APN's was still in the phone, so that didn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But a new SIM, and then a factory reset helped.</p>
<p>Or removing the APN's and getting new ones, and then replacing the SIM to prevent the bad APN's to return seemed to do the trick,. Never happened again on either phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks man, I think you may be right, abpput four months ago I changed service provider with tha protability think to keep the same number, the problem I think started happening about that time, but after that the sim burnt so when i replaced it and the
 problem kept happening i discarted to be the sims's fault. I reemember that when they gave me the new SIM card and I pluged it on my phone, the line didn't get active, so they had to remove the sim and put it on another phone and just then the line activated.<br />
<br />
So I will try your suggestion and come back to you. so the step I should follow if I understood you right are.<br />
<br />
- Backup the phone with no confiurations nor apps to avoid any problem that may be app related.<br />
- Do a Hard reset without the Sim Card so the APNs dont get copied from the SIM Card during the installation.<br />
-Put back the SIM card (preferably a new one)<br />
<br />
If that works you are a genius, i knew some body would have faced the same problem

<p>Actually first thing I suggest you should do is charge the phone fully, turn off the phone&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Remove the SIM card</p>
<p>- Start the device and just let run for a day. (without a SIM)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you can see if the device still gets hot, and if the battery still drains in about 3 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it does, the phone it needs service as already mentioned</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesnt ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Backup the phone with no confiurations nor apps to avoid any problem that may be app related.<br />
- Do a Hard reset without the Sim Card so the APNs dont get copied from the SIM Card during the installation.</p>
<p>-Put back the SIM card (preferably a new one)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- If you put the old SIM card back in (and not a new one):</p>
<p>Go to Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Connectivity -&gt; Settings -&gt; Destinations</p>
<p>The go to Internet, WAP services (and any other group you might have here) and delete all APN's that might have been added when you started the phone with a SIM card in it.</p>
<p>- Visit your operator/carriers website or call them to get new Internet settings for you phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;keep your fingers crossed :)</p>
