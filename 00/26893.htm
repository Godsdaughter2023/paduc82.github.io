<p>Hi&nbsp;Amy Chen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings, based on my search and test result, you can only empty the auto-complete list in Outlook for Mac by removing an address one at a time from the auto-complete list. Detailed steps:</p>
<p>1. In Outlook client, click the New email button to create a new email.</p>
<p>2. In the new email window, type an address in the To: field.</p>
<p>3. Click the "X" button next to the address to delete it from the auto-complete list.</p>
<p>4. Repeat steps 2-3 to delete all other email addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, if there is not an option to delete an address from the auto-complete list,&nbsp;then this is because either this address is coming from the directory or your personal contacts, under these circumstances, you can delete/update entries within your personal
 contacts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply right-click on those addresses that you cannot directly delete from the auto-complete list and select "<strong>Open Outlook contact</strong>", find and delete those address from the address list, then click Save &amp; Close to save the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope above information helps. If there is anything unclear or you have any other question, please feel free to let me know and I will happy to provide further suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 and Outlook Connector error 0x80041059 &#39;Could not authenticate....&#39;</h2>
                    
<p>Win7 Ultimate x64.&nbsp; Outlook 2007 or&nbsp;2010.&nbsp; Outlook Connector 14.0.5117.5000 32 bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a long standing problem I've had on 3 different systems running either Outlook 2007 or 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;Outlook is set up with 3 MAPI email accounts, one @msn.com and two @hotmail.com addresses, all Windows Live accounts.&nbsp;When I launch Outlook, I always get
 a window with three send/receive errors, one line for each account.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><em>"Task &lt;email_addr&gt; reported error (ox80041059):'Could not authenticate against the Windows Live ID service.&nbsp; Please try again later'.</em></strong>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This
 only happens on launch.</span>&nbsp; If I hit the send/receive button manually, everything always works fine and there are no errors.&nbsp; All accounts receive and send mail fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other observation I would make is that this error does not occur with only a single email account configured with Outlook Connector.&nbsp; It seems to be related to having multiple email accounts configured and trying to sign in simultaneously.</p>
<p>Please don't bother&nbsp;recommending uninstalling and&nbsp;reinstalling things, or removing and rebuilding profiles, .ost files, etc.&nbsp; Today I just built a brand new system with a bare metal clean Win7 install, Outlook 2010 and Outlook Connector 14 -&nbsp;and the exact&nbsp;same
 problem occurred the 1st time I launched Outlook after configuring the email accounts! &nbsp;I have also completely replaced my network router with a&nbsp;new different brand.&nbsp; This is what finally led me to report this; I've been waiting for months for this to be fixed
 but it never goes away with the Outlook Connector updates.&nbsp; There is obviously a bug here, probably a race condition with 3 accounts trying to sign in simultaneously.&nbsp; For now the workaround is to leave Outlook open all the time and never close it, but that
 is a pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Here is the macro that you wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp;This solved&nbsp;the problem for me when nothing else would.</p>
<p>As you suggested, modify the Send/Receive groups so that there is only one account in the first group and put the others in the second group called "Others".&nbsp; Disable the automated updates for the second group since this macro updates the second group when
 the first group is finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;Add this to&nbsp;the ThisOutlookSession module:</p>
<p>Dim WithEvents mySync As Outlook.SyncObject<br />
Private Sub UpdateOthers()<br />
&nbsp; Dim nsp As Outlook.NameSpace, sycs As Outlook.SyncObjects<br />
&nbsp; Set nsp = Application.GetNamespace("MAPI")<br />
&nbsp; Set sycs = nsp.SyncObjects<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; Dim i As Integer, syc As Outlook.SyncObject<br />
&nbsp; For i = 1 To sycs.Count<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set syc = sycs.Item(i)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If syc.Name = "Others" Then syc.Start<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
End Sub<br />
Sub UpdateFolders()<br />
&nbsp; mySync.Start<br />
End Sub<br />
Private Sub Application_Startup()<br />
&nbsp; Set mySync = Application.Session.SyncObjects.Item(1)<br />
&nbsp; UpdateFolders<br />
End Sub<br />
Private Sub mySync_SyncEnd()<br />
&nbsp; UpdateOthers<br />

<p>Thanks for your reply and question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried numerous fonts (including Times) and they all work fine. &nbsp;YaHei is the only MS font I have this problem with (gap between an apostrophe and the next letter like this; there' &nbsp;s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really like the MS suite of fonts and am using YaHei UI without the apostrophe problem. &nbsp;I'll be curious to see if others have a similar experience.</p>

            Is there a reason you must use Yahei? I'm not familiar with it myself, and it isn't installed on my system, so I can't offer any personal experience.

            <p>Hi Stefan;</p>
<p>I recently began experimenting with some of the fonts that came with my version of Word (2015), because I'm a writer and do a lot of document drafting and reading on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I discovered was that MS's fonts, like YaHei are easier to read than, say Calibri, Arial etc. &nbsp;I was curious as to why these fonts were easier to read so I searched. &nbsp;I found that these fonts (I think there's around 5 or 6) are designed for better screen
 resolution, clarity etc. &nbsp;So they're easier on my eyes to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, from a professional view, I work in marketing communications and believe that a lot of businesses try to "create" a clever logo for their business -- which rarely works, and they ignore the font. &nbsp;I have learned to appreciate, over the decades, why
 large corporations have such powerful, memorable font.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sad truth is that few graphic designers understand "typography". &nbsp;So they focus on emblems, graphical icons etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like my documents to reflect who I am, what I stand for, and how I present myself. &nbsp;YaHei UI is a font that subtly says exactly what I want it to say about me. &nbsp;And, for now, there's no space between an apostrophe and the next letter (there's vs. there'
 &nbsp;s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your interest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder how long it'll be before some else posts the same problem I've had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>F.</p>

<p>Well, just over 2 years. Using Word 2016 here. It seems <strong>Microsoft Yahei UI</strong> is identical to Microsoft Yahei minus the spacing nonsense. I can't fathom why anyone would want that extra space.

<h2>            Lumia 920 hangs up and not possible to shut down</h2>
                    
<p>Rejected a call after one signal and then the phone hangs up totally. Not possible to shut down even when holding shut down button for more than 60 seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The display shows "Ending call..."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I press windows button I still get a reaction from vibrator bit nothing happens.</p>
<p>If i plug a USB cable to a computer it syncs, but the display is still frozen.</p>
<p>Bluetooth headset, BH-806, still connects but no reaction from the phone (I can hear connect tone in the headset)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone is now getting really warm, which cant be too good for the battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried to call Nokia support 10 times now..."All lines busy"...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody knows how to reset and shut down and restart a Lumia 920 that does not react to pressing the power button more than 10 sec?</p>

<p>My Lumia 920 also has a crash problem, after i opened photo apps and in the same time open browser, my lumia hangs, shut down, and cannot start up again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this problem solved after I did a reset, by pressing volume down and power button in the same time for about 10 second (this tips already in the manual book).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lumia would restart for awhile and start again.</p>

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
have you checked that you have installed all the Nokia system apps in the Store on your 920? if you have performed a soft reset, and are still experiencing issues with your phone, then you need to perform a hard reset (Settings &gt; About &gt; Reset your phone).
 Bear in mind that this does wipe all personal data, so make a backup of all your personal data to PC and / or online storage first.<br />
<br />
Failing this, you will need to take your phone to your local Nokia Care point for inspection:

<p>Hi Nicolas,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In such situations, you should always try a soft reset of the phone. Your phone data will remain intact in this scenario.</p>
<p>Just press and hold Volume Down + Power button for 10 seconds until you feel a vibration.</p>

<p>After this soft reset time and date get reset, too. I've got rid of wrist watch since my 3330 almost 13 years ago, but 3330 have been completely&nbsp;reliable while my 920 hangs up once or twice a month. Is there any way to fix that so the time stays correct?&nbsp;Even
 my old&nbsp;laptop gets BSOD max once a year and this doesnt affect on time, date or other bios parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Additional removal instructions</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A detection of this exploit may be triggered from your <span>Java</span> cache, if a previous attempt at exploit has been made. When using
<span>Java</span>, the <span>Java</span> cache is known as the Temporary Files folder and is commonly located at C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Local\Sun\Java\Deployment\cache\. The Temporary Files (or cache) folder contains webpage content that is stored on
 your hard disk for quick viewing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We <u>recommend that you delete your temporary <span>Java</span> files to prevent the persistent detection of this exploit from within this folder</u>. For instructions on how to delete temporary
<span>Java</span> files, please see the following article:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/plugin_cache.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I clear the
<span>Java</span> cache?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update vulnerable <span>Java</span> applications</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This threat exploits a known vulnerability in <span>Java</span>. After removing this threat, make sure that you install the updates available from the vendor. You can read more about this vulnerability in
<span>Java</span>, as well as where to download the software update from the following links:</p>

            <p>Resizing a presentation can cause distortion, especially if you resize to a format that's not proportional to the original slide size.</p>
<p>I suspect the reason for the odd 13.32x9.99 size is that it's proportional to other sizes PPT uses by default (10 x 7.5 for example), so that you can switch to the larger size w/o distorting your presentation.</p>
<p>If you need to print to the full ledger size page, you'll need to choose custom (or just plug in the dimensions you want .... PPT will automatically choose Custom when you do that).</p>

<p><span>I understand you are unable to update your system to the latest build.</span></p>
<p><span>Have you tried upgrading to the final build of Windows 10?
</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you try installing&nbsp;the final build through ISO</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the link to download Windows 10 installation file.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Download Windows 10 </strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><em><span>Disclaimer:
</span></em></strong><em><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a
 program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your
 computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists.
 If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.</span></em></p>

 whether that is an option? If not, I will have to decide whether to buy Windows 10 for this older PC or reinstall XP. &nbsp;If continuind in the Insiders Program is an option and I can not resolve this issue, I will have to make the same choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also followed the process outlined by Andre Da Costa, but it did not help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Here is some additional information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) When I run Mr. Fix It I get a message advising me that Service Registration is missing or corrupt. &nbsp;When I run the Windows 10 troubleshooter it does not find any error. &nbsp;I have followed recommended trouble shooting steps in

<p>
</p><p>(2) &nbsp;I discovered that there was an extra computer listed under Devices in Manage My Microsoft Account. &nbsp;I assume that this must have happened when I temporarily stopped insider's builds at one point or when I did a fresh install. &nbsp;I deleted the computer
 that did not match this PC and went back through the initial troubleshooting steps. &nbsp;It did not resolve the problem.</p>

 I've changed all&nbsp;my computers over to Duck Duck&nbsp;but have noticed that this is not possible with our 3 WP8s without&nbsp;using maintenance functions.</p>

<p>When, if ever is Microsoft going put on some big boy pants and start showing some individual innovation?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>About the only progress Microsoft is making in catching up with other tech companies is copying their bad ideas. The basis of other successes, such as 3/4G for tablets like iPad and Android has escaped them totally.</p>

<p>Can someone please tell me in VERY non technical terms how to correct the font size for Word 2010. The font is HUGE even on low sizes like 11. For example, New Times Roman size 11, is about 1/2 inch in height.</p>

<p>In VERY non-technical terms, what Vinay is saying is:</p>
<p>The problem is not the FONT size, you said it is 11 pt. The problem is the amount of magnification, or Zoom, applied to the window.</p>
<p>Look on the bottom right corner of the Word application window. Down there in the right corner, on the "Status bar", is a minus sign in a circle joined by a line to a plus sign in a circle with a "baseball home-plate" shaped pointer, the "slider" located
 on the line.</p>
<p>The pointer should be near the middle of the line and just to the left of the minus sign there should be number with a percent sign. Right now the number is probably 150%&nbsp; or bigger.</p>
<p>Reduce the amount of "Zoom" being applied in one of these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the minus sign </li><li>click and drag the slider </li><li>hold &lt;CTL&gt; key down and use your mouse scroll wheel </li></ul>

<h2>            Band settings changing following sync with iPhone</h2>
                    <p>I have had a Band 2 since launch but recently had it replaced due the cracked strap issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The replacement Band is resetting the distance measurement from miles to km every time I sync with the app on my iPhone. &nbsp;I can change this by going into Settings on the Band and 'changing' the language from English to English. &nbsp;This fixes the km/miles problem
 but then results in 24 hour watch mode being turned off so I then have to go and turn that back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else seen this happen and is there a solution please?<br />

            <p>Thank you for reaching out to the Microsoft Band community. </p>
<p>After changing the distance from kilometers to miles please ensure you have set the distance to imperial from the Health app, on the Band tap distance then let the Band sync to the phone. If the watch mode goes off reset the Band and setup the Band again.

<h2>            Word 2016 - How to display replies from a specific person&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Word 2016 (Office 365 and Office 365 Pro Plus:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that to display comments from one author, I select <strong>Review tab &gt; Show Markup &gt; Specific People</strong> and select only&nbsp;the people I want, in this example that is Person X. However, this displays only
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">comments that Person X </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">initiated</span>. I also want to see
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">replies from Person X </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">to comments that
<strong>I </strong>initiated</span> (i.e., I created a new comment and Person X clicked the
<strong>Reply</strong> button, which created an embedded reply identified as having been made by Person X).&nbsp;The
<strong>Show Markup &gt; Specific People</strong> feature hides these replies because they are embedded in comments that I initiated and I selected not to show my own comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried searching the comments for "Person X" but that only showed me locations where I actually typed that name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it is working for me now, the <strong>Show Markup &gt; Specific People</strong> feature is useless because I still have to scroll through my entire 100-page document to find the replies from Person X.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>

<p><span>It is not feasible to display all replies from a specific person directly in Word.</span></p>

<h2>            Settings you chose for the left and right margins column spacing for paragraph Error in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have an application which will print the letters which will be sent to customers. The First page of the letter should be printed in LetterHead paper and other pages should be printed in the Preprinted paper.</p>
<p>It was working fine when we use <strong>HP LaserJet 4250, </strong>But after introduction of HP Universal printer driver<strong>(HP Universal Printing PCL 6 (v5.4))</strong>, everything is collapsed now.&nbsp;When the documents are printed, it is asking for the
 users to manually feed the paper and sometimes&nbsp;it is printing in the&nbsp;plain paper.</p>
<p>We wrote a small application to&nbsp;loop through&nbsp;each pages of the documents and change the First&nbsp;Page teay Setting to&nbsp;letterheaded and otherPage tray as Pre-Printed. It is working with some of the&nbsp;pages in the document and it is not working in some of the document
 and&nbsp;it throws below error message.</p>
<p><span><strong>Settings you chose for the left and right margins, column spacing, or paragraph indents are too large for the page width in some sections</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Please click the Below URL to open the document with the detailed info. Any advise to resolve this would be much helpful.</p>

            The usual solution for this problem is to open the Columns dialog and, even though 1 is already selected for the number of columns, click on the One preset picture. This checks the "Equal column width" box; when that box is not checked, the column width
 is sometimes wider than the page margins instead of adjusting automatically.<br />
<br />
The printing issues I cannot help you with. I'm currently using an HP LaserJet 4100 with a new system. I was able to obtain an HP driver for Windows 7, but because the new system doesn't have a parallel port, I'm connecting via a parallel-to-USB converter cable,
 and I am pulling my hair out over tray selection. I have found that using Printer Auto Select will work most of the time, but sometimes the printer doesn't detect paper in the MP tray (Tray 1) and will insist on pulling from Tray 2 instead, making it virtually
 impossible to duplex manually. Good luck with these issues!

Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />

1. What happens when you try to forward emails from other email accounts?<br />
2. Are you receiving the emails?<br />
3. Did you make any changes to the email account or computer prior to the issue?<br />
4. Does the issue occur with any particular email address from EarthLink or all the email address?<br />
5. Which antivirus program is installed on your computer?<br />
6. Did you check with EarthLink if the Hotmail email address is blocked?<br />

            This is most likely because the document in question was locked by the creator to prevent outside edits being made. This can usually be solved by downloading an unlocked version of the document, providing a password, or simply by switching from 'read mode'
 to 'edit mode' before attempting to save

            Hello, sunjie05 my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor. Today I will be helping you solve your issue. I will be inserting some steps down below that will hopefully help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />. Check if you can see the Reply/Forward icons when you use the web application of your account
<br />
<br />. Change the Reading Pane to “Off” and check if you can see the icon.

I can see the icons in the webmail of my account, but not in my local outlook app. If I reply anyemail from my local outlook app, I can see the icon in both my local outlook app and in the webmail; but if I reply from another computer/phone/webmail, I can only
 see the icon in the webmail not in the local outlook app. Looks like the outlook app can sync the reply status back to the mail server but cannot sync the status from the server (or just doesn't want to display it).&nbsp;<br />
</span></li><li><span><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Change the Reading Pane to “Off” and check if you can see the icon.</span></em><br />

<p>This is very annoying since I need to process many emails every day on different devices (phone/mac/tablet) and I lost track of which emails I have replied.</p>

            Hey, sorry that didn't work.
<br />
<br />How about the following steps:
<br />Go to view
<br />
<br />Go to "Add Columns"
<br />
<br />Move "Icon" from the left side to the right side.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />You may also try
<br />1.  press Windows+r on the keyboard (simultaneously) the Run appears.
<br />
<br />2. Type outlook.exe /cleanviews (Leave a space after Outlook.exe)-&gt; Click OK.
<br />
<br />Note: There is a space between Outlook and ‘/’. The above-mentioned command restores Outlook to default view settings and all the custom views that you created will be lost.
<br />
<br />3. Type Outlook.exe /resetnavpane (Leave a space after Outlook.exe) -&gt; Click OK.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Try those and let me know how it goes.
<br />Thank you,
<br />-Irisdiel H.

<p>Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried 16.21 earlier today - it's the same issue. That's why I moved to a newer version, hoping the issue can be resolved, unfortunately not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, following you advice to check with microsoft in-app support team, it seems I get conflicting message here (Please see the attached screenshot). It seems the support team can reproduce the problem and confirmed with an Outlook product engineer
 that this is by design ....<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/372a4e20-f1d0-4021-9b75-bc02f20719b6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/372a4e20-f1d0-4021-9b75-bc02f20719b6?upload=true" /></a><br />

    <title>How do I get the Skype &#40;the latest version has already been - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I get the Skype &#40;the latest version has already been downloaded&#41; Voice Messaging option&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded the latest version of Skype on my desktop and it does not give me the option to modify the voice messaging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone into my account and change the settings to "Voicemail" and to answer to leave a message if I do not answer in one second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Skype chat window I have gone to Call Settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>--&gt; Tools then to Calls (on the left hand panel) and all I see is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Forward &amp; Voicemails</p>
<p>2. Video Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same when I go into Calls from the Call tab (on the top of the window) then to Audio Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have the "Microphone" icon anywhere on my Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is NO option for "Set up Voicemail" as I have seen in YouTube video tutorials from many Subscribers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help would be most appreciated.&nbsp; Here are the details of my OS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3217U</p>
<p>CPU @ 1.80 GHz</p>
<p>64-bit OS</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed that Skype is different for the cell phone (I have an ATT&amp;T Alcaltel cell&nbsp; phone and the version of Skype is different when I go online at Skype.com to sign on online.&nbsp; To tell if a Skype Contact is truly offline or invisible, on my cell
 phone and on my Desktop I have noticed the name of the Skype Contact moves up and down from time to time even though that it shows them offline.&nbsp; Does that mean they are "Invisible" and there is activity on their account?&nbsp; However, it shows they are "Offline"
 on my cell phone but it states, on my desktop that they are "Offline with Voice Messaging".&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; I have the latest version for both my cell phone and the Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, On each platform (ie:&nbsp; Desktop version, Skype,com version and cell phone version) there are different messages to the same call that I make.&nbsp; It will either say "Call failed", or "Call, no answer" or "call ended".&nbsp; I have also noticed that all three
 messages can show up in the same Desktop version window after I tested to call a Skype Contact repeatedly to test this out.&nbsp; Why the different messages for the same contact either within the different interfaces or within the same Desktop window chat window?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, Can a person who is "Invisible" show the "Offline with Voice Messaging" message on their status?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance and I look forward to hearing from you very soon.&nbsp; I do hope you can answer all my queries for those are the ones that I cannot find answers to in any YouTube tutorial videos or any of the numerous message boards online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers !</p>

<p><span><span>Hi VAZA,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good Day!
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First, regarding</span><span> your question about the voicemail,
 if you are pertaining to customize your voicemail greeting, please be advised that it is no longer supported.
</span><span>Instead, Skype will use the default message for your app language.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Second, please be advised that in the new Skype, we automatically set your status for you. When you are signed in, you will show online,
 with a green dot nn the Chats screen. For more information, you can check this link:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34742/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34742/</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Third, the messages call failed, no answer and call ended vary on the result after the call you made.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Lastly, with the new Skype option to show offline with voice messaging is no longer available.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have further questions, kindly reply to this thread.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you!

<p>Thank you for your quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the "Offline with Voice Messaging" shows up on a few of my Skype Contacts' statuses when they are showing "Offline".&nbsp; Does this mean that they are still utilizing an older version of Skype?&nbsp; If so, which version are they utilizing so I can have
 the same feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You indicated "<span><span>Third, the messages call failed, no answer and call ended vary on the result after the call you made. "&nbsp; Can you go into further detail and your answer to my query did not truly answer it.&nbsp; How does it "vary on result"?&nbsp; What do
 you mean by this?&nbsp; Why do these messages appear?&nbsp; What causes them?&nbsp; Does it happen when the person is only offline?&nbsp; Or invisible?&nbsp; Or did they hang up the call?&nbsp; What is the "official" definition of each message and cause of each?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also, my other query was not answered:&nbsp; "</span></span>To tell if a Skype Contact is truly offline or invisible, on my cell phone and on my Desktop I have noticed the name of the Skype Contact moves up and down from time to time even though that

<p><span><span><span>From your description it clearly follows that you are using the classic Skype for Windows Desktop. The currently latest version of this Skype application is
<strong>7.40.X.103</strong></span><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The link provided by Skype Community Moderator applies to the new
<strong>Skype 8</strong></span><span> version, which is currently only available on the latest Android and iPhone devices.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>With respect to Offline /Invisible status, the whole ide with the Invisible status is that for contacts it should be impossible to distinguish between Invisible and Offline. For
 all instances, they are identical with the only difference that calling an truly Offline contact will result in Call failed message, while calling an "Invisible" contact may actually result in successful call, if the recipient answers the call. "Invisible"
 contacts are actually Online on Skype but just "pretending" to be Offline.</span></span></p>

<p>So,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Called Failed = Truly Offline</p>
<p>
</p><p>Call ended = Contact hung up ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Call, no answer = Contact did not answer and could still be online but "Invisible" or is equivalent to "Call Failed" ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>When will the new Skype 8 be available for all devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I do have the&nbsp;Skype application <strong>7.40.X.103</strong> on my Desktop<span>.&nbsp; And that's the only application unto which I see a few of my Contact's have the "Offline with Voice Messaging" in their status'.&nbsp; Therefore, my question is, what version
 of Skype are they utilizing to have that feature?&nbsp; On the Skype.com version where you sign in online and on my ecll phone it only shows them as "Offline" not with the "Offline with Voice Messaging".</span></p>

<p><span><span>I'm only able to explain what I know from self using Skype, and what I'm using most is also Skype 7.40.0.103 version on a Windows 7 computer..</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When i hover with my mouse over the icon of some of the Offline contacts (and I have no chance to know if they are Offline or Invisible), for some of them I can see the "Offline
 with voice messaging" message. If I try to call such contact, then after a while (if the call is not answered), a nice lady informs me that this contact is currently not available and I can leave a message after the beep.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On Skype for Web (the application you can access from Skype.com or directly on
</span><a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://web.skype.com</span></a><span>), there is no mouse hover event, and Offline/Invisible contacts are just shown as Offline. However, if I try
 to call the same contact as I tried to call from the Desktop version, the Voice message option is also available after a while. So, no difference in the behaviour, apart from the missing information that the contact has Voice messaging enabled.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How this works on a phone, I don't know, because I don't have any Skype enabled phone</span></span></p>

<p>Thank you.&nbsp; I experience the same thing save for one of the Sky Contacts in which the "Offline with Voice Messaging" message is present but when I tested it and tried to call them the system cuts out too quickly and there is no way to leave the Voice Message.
 I do not even have the pop up window as the others do when they are just simply with the "Offline" status.&nbsp; In that case, the Voice Messaging System does come online for me to leave a Voice Message.</p>
<p>

<p>Good evening.&nbsp; I received an email this evening from Microsoft enquiring if my query has been resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No !&nbsp; It has not.&nbsp; I have noticed on your website the visual aides depict the latest version of Skype but are only available on just TWO platforms.&nbsp; This is not helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like my queries answered as to determine if someone is Offline or Invisible and to verify that they received them.&nbsp; I was informed that there is no "Offline with Voice Messaging' features available anymore but several of my Skype Contacts have this
 on their versions of Skype.&nbsp; When I have tried to leave a Voice Message with my Contacts that have this option, a few of their Voice Messaging options do not work whilst others allow me to leave a voice message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, on my cell phone it depicts those of my Favorites that have been active in hierarchal order whilst on my Desktop is depicts them in alphabetical order with no justification as to whether they have been recently online or not.&nbsp; Why is there no consistency
 in the platform? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, after some immense time and energy researching Skype behavioral mechanics I found that even though I am signed out of Skype in all of my platforms, my Contacts see me as "Away" with the yellow circle on their various devices and computers. Why is this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can answer my previous queries as well as those within this email I would truly appreciate it. I also humbly suggest that a consistent platform be devised that can be implemented on all devices and computers so it can be easily managed and understand
 instead of always trying to extrapolate the myriad of anomalies with the platform.&nbsp; Newer versions of Skype should be accessible to ALL.&nbsp; Not to those to whom have specific devices or have a paid service.&nbsp; If you have a Beta version for ALL to opt into that
 would be sufficient as well.&nbsp; Notification BEFORE they are implemented should also be distributed to ALL of your users to prepare them for the changes/updates as opposed to posting it on your website and/or various third party websites.&nbsp; Keeping the lines
 of communication is crucial in order for the users to maintain utilization of your product for nowadays there are MANY OTHER PLATFORMS people can utilize for their communication.</p>

<h2>            Word 365 Crashes when I open&#47;use the Thesaurus pane.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated Office 365 today. When I opened the thesaurus pane to use it, Word crashed and I lost most of what I had written. It continues to crash Word each time I try to use it. I realize the obvious solution would be to not use the built-in thesaurus,
 but I'm a novelist and it's a rather convenient tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Ink Tools Not Available in MS Word 2013 With External Tablet</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a Wacom Bamboo writing tablet to take notes on class handouts in MS Word. When I control my cursor with the tablet, the Ink Tools&gt; Pens section appears in the top ribbon, but when I tap on it, everything but the options for Thickness and
 Select Objects tool are greyed out, disallowing me from writing on the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution I've been able to find is to go to Turn Windows Features On and Off and select Tablet PC Components, which is already checked off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why this is happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Kaylee</p>
