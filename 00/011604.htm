<h2>            How to detach a mailbox from a user and attach it to another &#40;in the same tenant&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all I currently have a windows domain (on a SBS server) and have successfully migrated all my users to Office365 so no more on premise exchange.</p>
<p>I'd like to move my domain to a real Windows AD 2012 (to be able to trust a partner AD in the future)<br />
I will recreate a new domain from scratch, recreate user, move all services on it, perfectly fine.<br />
But the question, how do I handle my User emails? I'd like to avoid recreating new mailboxes and migrating data from old to new mailboxes.<br />
If possible, I wish to detach mailboxes from the current users, and reattach them to the new, It seems to be possible, but I don't manage to do it yet.</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts:</p>
<p>1 - having the A domain with Azure AD connect to the tenant (all mailboxes already in the cloud, A users are well licensed), exemple user account will be called source<br />
2 - create a new DC with the new B domain, install Azure AD to connect it to the same tenant<br />
3 - create a user called dest into the B domain, check that it replicates into the tenant<br />
-&gt; does dest user need to be licensed at this stage as we don't want it to have a mailbox yet ?<br />
4 - use the remote powershell to get the exchange GUID of the source user<br />
get-mailbox -identity source | format-list exchangeGUID<br />
GUID will be this like: ab79ed1c-82c9-456d-940b-9231bddee569<br />
5 - use a third party tool to convert it to a ImmutableID<br />
GUID2ImmutableID.ps1 ab79ed1c-82c9-456d-940b-9231bddee569<br />
the result will be as is<br />
ImmutableID<br />
-----------<br />
HO15q8mCbUWUC5Ixvd7laQ==<br />
6 - change the GUID of the dest user using the ImmutableID for the source user<br />
Azure AD synchro needs to be off<br />
Set-msoluser -userprincipalname *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -immutableId HO15q8mCbUWUC5Ixvd7laQ==<br />
<br />
What comes next ?<br />
remove Azure AD sync from A domain, activate the AD sync of B domain<br />
and DEST is supposed to be using the mailbox of SOURCE now ? When do I have to license/unlicense my users?</p>
<p>Or is there any easier way to do it? Or isn't that better to PST the old mailbox and just reimport it to the new user ?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!!!</p>

<p>All the information you mentioned I think they are referred to the hard-match in Directory Synchronization scenario</p>
<p>I do not think it works for the mailbox because the mailbox database in Exchange Online is not controlled or managed by the immutableID</p>
<p>I think maybe it works for onpremises Exch server but not in Office 365</p>
<p>importing PST is a boring way to achieve this but it is the most safe solution:</p>
<p>check this:</p>

<h2>            View logs of messages rejected during smtp conversation</h2>
                    Is there a way to see the logs for messages that were attempted to be sent from an external source to o365 but were rejected during the smtp conversation?&nbsp; ie inbound email to a non existent user which is rejected with 550 5.4.1 recipient address rejected:
 access denied.&nbsp; I've tried message trace in exchange admin center and security and compliance but I don't see a way to get that info.

<p><span>Hello Javelina73,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>May I confirm if you are using Exchange on-premises server or Exchange Online?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it is the former, you can try to configure the protocol logging which recording the SMTP conversation that occur on Send Connectors and Receive connectors as part of message delivery. For your reference:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Otherwise, I haven’t found any related official document that talk about logging rejected messages during smtp conversation. To help us improve our function, we would be very grateful if you could submit your

            Hi, i'm just here to confirm that 
trexxor is right. Its the font magnifier's problem. Just go to Menu&gt;Office&gt;Font Magnifier&gt;Options then restore to defaults. Somehow the font magnifier will cause the restart problem when you load facebook. I didn't like the font so big and i adjusted it
 smaller, its sad to see my font so big.

<h2>            Excel and Word keep shutting down</h2>
                    I have Office University and it has worked perfectly fine for months until today. Now, whenever I try to open an Excel or Word file, I get an error message that says, "A problem has caused this program to stop working," and that I'll be notified of any
 solutions. Then the program closes. &nbsp;I used Word all day yesterday without a single problem, but today I can't even keep it open for longer than 15 seconds. I've tried regular repair and Internet repair; I rebooted my computer and flat-out shut it down and
 restarted it--nothing has helped. &nbsp;All the other Office programs are working fine. The operating system is WIndows 8; laptop is a Dell Inspiron 14R (i5).

    <title>Export Notebook from OneNote - some sections have not yet been fully - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin h. stecyk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Export Notebook from OneNote - some sections have not yet been fully synced and could not be downloaded</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;- Windows 8.1 Pro<br />
&nbsp;- Office 2013</p>
<p>I have one Notebook of five active Notebooks that I am unable to export. When I attempt to export, I get the following error message:</p>
<p><strong>OneNote cannot pack these sections because some sections have not yet been fully synced and could not be downloaded. These pages will not be saved. Continue anyway?</strong></p>
<p>I have discovered that I have three pages in two different sections that appear to be corrupted. That is, when I remove those three pages, I am then able to export that NoteBook. These three pages, however, look, act, and feel normal. There is nothing to
 indicate that these pages are corrupted, except when I go to perform an export of the NoteBook.</p>
<p>In attempting to track down my problem, I found a blog article that described how to troubleshoot this particular issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://palaticblog.azurewebsites.net/?p=161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">palaticblog.azurewebsites.net/</a></p>
<p>Is there a way or method to 1) find the corrupted pages more quickly and easily; and 2) fix corrupted pages?</p>

    <title>WMDC--Cannot Install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kateri  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMDC--Cannot Install</h2>
                    
<p>Need help badly! System: <strong>Windows 7 x64. Have MS Office Professional x32</strong>, but cannot even get to the point that I can see if the sync with Outlook will be OK.<strong>LG Fathon VS750</strong> smartphone with Windows Mobile 6.5. Bluetooth successfully
 setup; USB cable working as well.</p>
<p>Have tried to install WMDC seven (7) times now. Cannot figure out what or where the problem is. Have done a clean uninstall between installs; have rebooted and cold-booted between install attempts.</p>
<p>Using the WMDC "drvupdate-amd64.exe" installation file. First message that I get says "Unidentified driver" and "Device unplugged". (The phone is connected by USB cable and is powered on. Message from Taskbar says that driver was not correctly installed.</p>
<p>In trying to open WMDC in the Control Panel: It does not open with a double click--have to right-click and select "open"--then can see the green opening box with the message "Please wait while WMDC starts." and it never starts. It closes after about 15-20
 seconds. Then nothing. Same result over and over.</p>
<p>I hope it's something that I am doing incorrectly. The WM phone was my choice because of Outlook and Splash ID and Daynotez, etc. etc. I have been a "Palmie" for about 15 years. Had no idea that the change would be this time-consuming. Think that Verizon
 will not be happy if I go back to the Palm phone which worked perfectly with the MSO 2010 beta and cannot (currently) sync with Outlook in the retail version.</p>
<p>Verizon says that phone does not come with a Getting Started disc; directed to a website which has been down all evening. Appreciate any help or advice that anyone can provide.</p>
<p>Thanks much.<br />

Tips, Articles and Reviews</a>&nbsp;for Windows Phone devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The version I have of Windows 7 included WMDC, so I did not have to download any software.&nbsp; Check your programs and see if it is already installed.&nbsp; If not, check your version of WMDC with the one here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/device-center-download.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download
 Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1</a></p>
<p>When I'm having troubles installing programs, I check to make sure I don't need to unistall the incomplete program, and if I do, I uninstall, then I shut down the computer, count to 10 slowly, reboot, download the correct version, install it.</p>
<p>Once you have done that then simply hook up your phone and wait.&nbsp; WMDC should open, recognize your device and present you with options.&nbsp; It may take it a few minutes to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And remember first synch has to be via cable, afterthat bluetooth is fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your response. Have done all of of that several times. Yes, have WMDC 6.1 from the MS website. WMDC does not open. Have cable setup for first sync. Bluetooth is fine between phone and desktop.</p>
<p>Something is really amiss here. Nothing that I do makes WMDC open (and therefore phone device is not recognized, cannot be "identified" to other programs, and the other DL'd programs cannot be installed to the phone). WMDC will not even open after the phone
 is removed from Printers and Devices in the Control Panel.</p>
<p>IMO the problem is either with WMDC on my system (never tried to open it before) or the newly-distributed LG Fathom needs some tweaking from&nbsp;LG Electronics&nbsp;or from Verizon.</p>
<p>Talked to Verizon earlier today explaining all that I had tried to accomplish to get everything working. Tech support had no answers at this time. They agreed with my decision: I have given up for the time being and reactivated my Palm phone. $440.00 down
 the toilet on phone, accessories and extra software. I have 27 more days to return the phone&nbsp;and (hopefully) the accessories.</p>
<p>So the mystery continues...</p>

<p>Yes, Windows Media Player is installed, recently updated and frequently used for music.</p>
<p>BTW, WMdc still does not open by clicking on the icon in Control Center--have to right-click and "Open."&nbsp; It shows as installed in Control Panel's Programs and Features and in Revo Uninstaller Pro--2 entries WMDC version 6.1.6965.0 and WMDC Update version

<p>This problem is becoming absolutely fascinating! (Not taking into account that I cannot use the new phone.) I checked over in the Win 7 TechNet Forums and there are over 20 threads concerning WMDC. One recommendation to someone who could not get it to install
 correctly&nbsp;was to do a "clean boot." I followed the instructions given and successfully clean booted the computer.</p>
<p>Uninstalled WMDC and WMDC Update. Did another clean re-boot. Right-clicked on the drvupdate-amd64.exe file to&nbsp;(1) Take ownership and (2) Run as administrator. Install file would not run. Double-clicked on the&nbsp;install file&nbsp;again. Nothing...</p>
<p>As a test, I opened a PDF with no problems and clicked on another exe file&nbsp;and its install window opened immediately.</p>
<p>BTW, with all of the uninstalling and re-installing, "dead" WMDC icon remains in the Control Panel. During the clean-boot uninstall, I got this message: The installer has insufficient privileges to modify this file C\Program Data\Microsoft\Windows\Start
 Menu\Programs\Windows Media Device Center.lnk. Isn't a .lnk file merely a shortcut to an executable?</p>
<p>I have DL'd that WMDC&nbsp;install file from the MS website multiple times. Surely it is not corrupted.</p>

<p>Kateri,</p>
<p>Thanks for your detailed responses!&nbsp; You seem a very savvy user, but just to make sure this isn't it one of the MVPs noted this in another post:</p>
<p>"As for Office 2010, it works fine with WMDC if WMDC is installed/reinstalled after it.&nbsp; WMDC needs to configure itself based on the version of Outlook you have installed.&nbsp; Also, you need to open Outlook and configure an e-mail account and PST before you
 sync the first time."</p>
<p>Just want to make sure you have used Outlook sucessfully and there are files to synch with your phone.&nbsp; Meanwhile we are still reaching out to other MVPs to see what else we can suggest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks, wmta2. Outlook 2010 x32&nbsp;retail was installed a full week before I started this WMDC drama. Have email account setup--working perfectly; have about 8 years of calendar events and almost&nbsp;1,799 contacts. Outlook has a number of add-ins, all working
 well. Use it every day, several times a day.</p>
<p>Was using the MSO 2010 beta from January until June 18th. Completely uninstalled and "cleaned" everything before installing the final version. Also, uninstalled MSO 2007 and MSO 2000's Shortcut Bar.</p>
<p>Never used or even looked at WMDC during the Win 7/MSO 2010 period (or before for that matter). Used ActiveSync for 3 months in early 2006.</p>
<p>Palm HotSync is syncing with Outlook 2010 via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Checked to see if there were any other dead links in the Control Panel (41 total links, only WMDC dead). This is from "Troubleshooting in Control Panel (I have no idea what this means):</p>

<p>Kateri,&nbsp; I did hear back from one of my contacts and here's what he had to say:</p>
<p><span><span><span>Odd that the app itself doesn’t load and Windows says it is not a compatible app.&nbsp; This sounds like a windows problem of some type.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>She did say a driver did not load.&nbsp; You could have her open control panel , Device Manager and look under Network Adapters to see if “Microsoft
 Windows Mobile Remote Adapter” shows up.&nbsp; This is the RNDIS driver.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>And the phone name should show up under Portable Devices. &nbsp;This is the second driver that loads.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>She could also check that the “Windows Mobile-based device connectivity”&nbsp; service is started.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Control panel, Admin tools, Computer Management)
 – Under Service and Applications.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Most interesting would be to plug her phone into a different Windows 7&nbsp; (64bit preferred) machine and see what happens.&nbsp; I suspect it will
 work fine.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Would you please check on these and report back to us?&nbsp; Again, my sincere thanks for your persistance in this issue!!</p>

<h2>            Audio Feedback not coming through.</h2>
                    I have recently purchased the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 series gaming headset. (Highly recommend) the headset works with my regular computer audio i.e. Pandora, YouTube, Windows media, etc... but when using Skype video calling with my girlfriend she can
 hear me and see me but I have no audio coming to me, so I can't hear anything she says. I have tried wired and wireless (Bluetooth) both times she could hear me and see me and I could see her but I could not hear her. As soon as I disconnected the headset
 and used regular ear buds or laptop sound, there were no issues. Any help or thoughts would be appreciated. I'd like to be able to use this headset for video calling. (Side note: they work perfectly fine with Bluetooth connection to my phone and wired connection
 to my phone for phone calls.)

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/69d08853-76a3-41bf-8022-310287944703" title="BrianSeeger">
<p>
</p><p>If the Skype works on your regular ear buds or laptop sound, it's possible that your headset is not compatible with Skype and vice versa or your headset exceeds Skype's audio requirement the reason why it's not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to further check this, you may try the following troubleshooting steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the <strong>Start menu</strong> and click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apps</strong>.</li><li>Locate and click Skype from the <strong>Applications list</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced option</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Reset​</strong>.</li><li>Uninstall and reinstall Skype.</li></ul>
<p>If the issue persists, try to run the Audio troubleshooter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the <strong>control panel</strong>, click on the <strong>'View by' </strong>
option on the top and right and select <strong>'large icons'</strong>. </li><li>Click on <strong>'troubleshooting'</strong> and then select the<strong> 'View all'
</strong>option in the left pane, click on the<strong> 'Playing Audio' troubleshooter
</strong>and run it.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if the issue persists, I'll wait for your reply.</p>

            So I tried each of the solutions you suggested non of them work. I tried using Facebook messenger's video calling and had the same issue they could hear me but I could not hear them. I think my headset may just be too advanced. On another note my Skype
 app always says that my camera is being used by another application yet I have nothing else open. Any other thoughts on the headset and issue with computer webcam? Thank you for your help.

<p>So the built in audio device works no problem same as just a regular pair of ear buds. I think my headset me just be too advanced at this moment.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Hitesh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the installation is hanging at different percentages, look at this article:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2813190" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>Microsoft Office 2013 or Office 365 hangs during setup</font></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>If the download is very slow, look at this article:
</font></span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/redir/HA103478444.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>Downloading Office 2013 is slow</font></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Percentage ' &gt; ' 100% could be faulty display issue. If the above links does not help, then you may repair Office 2013 following the steps from the link mentioned below:</p>

<p>I have tried to manually update Office 365 several times now. It asks permission to download the update, says it's downloading, but then never runs. Where did the downloaded file go?</p>
<p>Can the update be run manually? How?</p>

            Hello, thanks to contact the Microsoft Community. My name is Wendy Jones, I am an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />First of all pause antivirus and verify that you have Windows updated. 
<br />If Office can't be updated I suggest to do an online repair from the control panel.
<br />Go to Control Panel
<br />Select Microsoft Office
<br />Select option Change. 
<br />
<br />Then restar machine and verify if Office has ay pending update.

    <title>New Office restrictions - is this a joke&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cybishop  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Office restrictions - is this a joke&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I was in college, I got a copy of Microsoft Office, fairly basic but cheap because I was a student (yay!). I had a laptop at that point in time, and I put it on my laptop and that worked great. Later down the line, I bought a desktop computer and installed
 Office on that so that I could use the program I had legally purchased on either of the machines that were my legal possessions, and that worked great, too. Even later down the line, I bought a new laptop to upgrade from the former one and installed Office
 on that so that I could continue using my legally owned software on my legally owned computers. This also - you guessed it - worked great.<br />
<br />
So imagine my shock today when I discovered that, unless I want to buy into the absolute SCAM that is an Office 365 subscription, I have to buy a separate copy of Office for every single machine that I might be working on. Every. Single. One. Did Microsoft
 have a stroke and decide, hey, let's punish our loyal fans by forcing people who have more than one computer to pay us more for the EXACT SAME SOFTWARE than those who only have one? Let's dissuade people from buying more of our machines because then they'll
 be gouged on the software front with having to buy the exact same software multiple times because for some arbitrary and insane reason, we've decided that our software should only work on ONE machine only, ever, at all? Not to mention the fact that installing
 a new motherboard or processor will make the software no longer recognize the machine and force a completely unnecessary additional purchase of the software!<br />
<br />
So what happened to Microsoft? Are they going so bankrupt that they have to scramble and pinch every penny and try to force more and more additional charges out of their loyal customers? Or have they decided they are the computer overlords, and our computer
 overlords hath declared that ONE is the only acceptable number of computers for a person to possess at any given time? Or is the whole 'software can only be installed on one computer' thing just a further level of the scam to try to force people into buying
 the ridiculous subscription service? <br />
<br />
(And before you trip over yourself trying to convince me that the subscription service is the best thing since sliced bread, save your breath. I only use Word and Excel, so the other programs mean nothing to me. I don't use cloud storage; I'm a writer and all
 my work fits on a 540 MB thumb drive that I bought over a decade ago. And the Skype thing means nothing to me; I get unlimited talk/text/data on a cheap plan as it is so there's absolutely no point for me. So 365 literally offers me no advantage over outright
 purchasing the program set - about $230 - but is $100 EVERY YEAR. Check the math - that means 365 is only a better deal if I only use it for two years and not a month longer. I'm a writer. I've been using Word for DECADES. That's not about to change. Even
 if I have to buy Office (not the subscription) for two machines - which is RIDICULOUS - it still only takes about five years before 365 turns into a total ripoff. So yes. Office 365 is a SCAM. I'm too good at math and logic to fall for it.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for reals - what gives here? Why are we suddenly only allowed to use one computer ever at all unless we want to pay for the exact same software twice or three times or any time we decide to upgrade our existing machines? Why is Microsoft trying to punish
 people who like Microsoft products enough to own more than one Microsoft machine? Why does Microsoft want to drive away people who used to be loyal fans by shoving a vacuum nozzle down their wallets to see how much they can get out before the person sees how
 ridiculous this is and walks away? Because, legit, this is making me want to talk to my Apple friends and see how well their word processing software works...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Zigzag - a friend of mine reported that Windows 10 DOES that, they upgraded the motherboard and had to purchase a new license because the software no longer recognized it as the same computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Palcouk - Examining some factors and a little math: The first Word program to use .docx was released (with Office 2007) at the beginning of 2007. There was a 2010 version and a 2013 version, but the only one that really improved functionality more than just
 some superficial appearance alterations (at least as far as basic users go, rather than people who are doing a lot of document sharing) was the 2016 version, which was just released recently, at the end of 2015. The 2007 version still works fine, so technically
 I could keep using that without an issue, but the 2016 version has some nice features, so I'll upgrade to that.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
That means it took almost ten years before a version of Word came along that had significant enough improvements to be worth buying an upgrade. So here comes the math part:&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 copies of Office now: $460</p>
<p>2 copies of Office 10 years from now: $460 (or so)<br />
2 copies of Office 10 more years after that: $460 (or so)</p>
<p>Total cost after 20 years if I don't use the subscription service: $1,380<br />
<br />
365 subscription: $100 a year</p>
<p>Total cost after 20 years: $2,000</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that's assuming Microsoft doesn't jack up the price of the subscription a few years down the way, which is a pretty big assumption the way things are going. Also, note that the third version of Office in the non-subscription option will be decently usable
 for another nine years, so technically that's 29 years at $1,380 vs. 29 years at $2,900 on the subscription.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So please don't try to tell me the subscription is such a great deal. It's not. It's a ripoff. A scam. Period. And the whole 'you are only allowed to use one computer unless you want to buy more copies of the exact same software' thing comes across as a sad
 attempt to drive people into using the ripoff subscription service because most people won't do the math and realize that paying $460 up front is far cheaper in the long run than the subscription.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It still ultimately boils down to punishing loyal fans who like your products enough to own and use more than one of your machines. I still don't understand what possible point there is in forcing people to either pay WAY more on a subscription service or to
 buy the exact same software over and over except for greed. If there is an explanation, I'd love to hear it, but all it looks like from here is a money grab.&nbsp;</p>

 with a different company or become pirates and have less hassle to deal with. This dictation of how many computers you're allowed to own (how many you're allowed to use software you purchase on) is less of an effective way to combat piracy and more of a money
 grab against the people who have the audacity to like Microsoft enough to use more than one of their machines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>CyB you are partially mistaken. As Palcouk pointed out, if you bought Windows factory installed and activated on the computer you NEVER have had the right to transfer it to a new Mobo, aka a new computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The term that Palcouk didn't mention was that it was a factory license which is called an OEM, Original Equipment Manufacturer, license.&nbsp; It was "bundled" with your computer and you did not pay full retail price for the license. Therefore MS included the
 no transfer restriction on OEM licenses.&nbsp; This OEM restriction also applied to Office back when you could buy it installed and activated at the factory, like Office 2003 and 2007.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When MS came up with Office 365 in the 2013 release, they wanted to "<em><strong>encourage</strong></em>" people to switch from one-payment licenses to keep-paying-forever "subscriptions".&nbsp; So they did something that was entirely within their rights (but
 that many uses feel was dirty pool), they changed the license terms on Office 2013 bundles to allow install on only one computer at at time.&nbsp; They effectively doubled the price of Office 2013 licenses. And 365 gave you right to install on up to 5 machines
 at a time, making it a "<em>better deal</em>" for multi computer owners.&nbsp; Don't forget, at the original release they also made the Office 2013 licenses permanently tied the original computer, just like OEM licenses.&nbsp; Public outcry (or a slick marketing pre-plan)
 convinced them to change that license term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is all about encouraging people to switch to a method of paying for Office that is to MS's advantage. Just like every other term in the license.

                    Snap doesn't seem to work very well at all - when using drawing tools.&nbsp; Used to be able to snap objects or groups to either the grid or to other objects with extreme accuracy.&nbsp; Office 10 drawing is very poor - grouped objects move position when copied,
 snap doesn't seem to snap with any degree of accuracy.&nbsp; Is this a bug that will be fixed?&nbsp; Or am I doing something wrong.&nbsp; Very experienced user of drawing tools in Word and have set snap up correctly

<p>Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the update squiggles disappeared. There is another option, you can also use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2016, click the File tab, and then click Options.<br />
Click Mail , and then click <strong>Editor Options</strong>.<br />
Click to clear the <em>Check spelling as you type</em> check box.<br />
Click to clear the <em>Mark grammar errors as you type</em> check box.<br />
<br />

            <p>ERP or&nbsp;<em>Enterprise&nbsp;Resource Planning</em> is typically a wide ranging collection of programs that work in unison to help manage a company. While Excel may be part of the overall office applications, it wouldn't be the best choice to to be the only one.
 The difficulty in sharing live data between different departments (payroll, invoicing, purchasing, receiving, etc) would be the first obstacle to overcome. My own experience with them usually starts with an SQL database engine as the central repository of
 all information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you read up on what ERP entails and how it encompasses all of the facets of running a business. Microsoft has an ERP product called Microsoft Dynamics. You could start with a few Google and Bing searches to get a broader definition of ERP.</p>

 is a small tiny speadsheet application. I don't agree that its best used to securely handle so much of&nbsp;data shared across&nbsp;multiple users. If I were you I would rather try some&nbsp;open source ERP solutions to experience if they are meeting my Org's requirement.
 Here is a blog listing some open source ERP solutions. Give it a try if meets your need, if not you may try replicating them in Excel but again its not recommended.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Activation Issues - Office 2016 for MAC</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Many of you are probably experiencing issue with Office 2016 for Mac.&nbsp; There are multiple issues, including the dreaded "valid credentials" error. Basically this software doesn't recognize actual active subscriptions. And tech support can't help! a couple
 of hours and nothing...&nbsp;The existing guidance to uninstall and reinstall doesn't work on El Capitan. I tried it four times on my own and seemed to know quite a bit more than the "Answer Tech".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what works -&nbsp; REVERT!!! Do a&nbsp;total uninstall&nbsp;and then&nbsp;install Office 2011 for Mac. It works. Truly a bummer that MSFT can't get it together to get this software to work on Mac El Capitan. My install of 2016 worked for a while, and then just de-activated
 one day. so lame. </p>
<p>
</p><p>you answer is to use 5 year old code and download Office 2011 for Mac. it does work. beware the upgrade, stick with 2011!!!</p>
<p>

    <title>The Microsoft Account does not exist. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hmk7797  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Microsoft Account does not exist.</h2>
                    Hello, I have a Hotmail account which I successfully logged in yesterday using the one time log in. Now today, I am told my account does not exist. I used the one time password because I was unable to log in with my old password for some reason.<br />
<br />
What I had done yesterday when I was able to log in was:<br />
- update my personal information<br />
- delete my old alias e-mail and added my newer Gmail as an alias<br />
- log out<br />
<br />
I tried sending an e-mail to the address which I am trying to long into but it is bounced back saying the inbox does not exist, yet I am unable to create an e-mail with the same address. I tried creating this Outlook account and adding the e-mail as an alias
 to this account but got an error saying it is already aliased with another account.<br />
<br />
Could I get my hotmail account re-activated? What has happened to this account?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

    <title>Word freezes when I try to print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackmaccormac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word freezes when I try to print</h2>
                    I have new computer with windows 10 in December.&nbsp; Installed my disc copy of windows 7 for home. Printing all documents working fine, until today. Word now freezes when I try to print any Word doc. Have to sign out in order to get back into Word. Excel
 and PDF documents print fine. I closed and opened both computer and printer. Is&nbsp;exporting then deleting data key still the answer?&nbsp;

            &nbsp;FINAL SOLUTION:&nbsp;&nbsp; I had problems with Excel and Word (Office 2007) when re-installed on new Windows 10 desktop, after a few weeks. Had to configure to get on,&nbsp;then had stdole.32tb Excel issue and Word froze when I tried to print. Followed various registry
 suggestions and Office repair to no avail. Finally uninstalled/reinstalled Office 7. No more Excel issue - hit shortcut and it&nbsp;came on. But Word asked for&nbsp;app permission as before and&nbsp;still froze upon print command. Realized the Word issue must be an Account
 manager issue. Found&nbsp;site that gave instructions&nbsp;to right click both Excel and Word icons the Properties, compatibility to find&nbsp;Word had "Run as Administrator", Excel not so. So I unselected "Run as Administrator"- no more problem with Word printing or freezing.
 By the way, I&nbsp;am administrator and do not understand why&nbsp;Word froze&nbsp;(had to sign off in order to remove Word from screen).

            <p>You don't need to set it up for every other column: you can use a single column offset to check ans sum multiple columns, without even using SUMIFS, like</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMIF(B:D,"3-111",A:C)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will sum values from column A where column B is 3-111, from column B where column C is 3-111, and from column C where column D is 3-111 - for this example, it would return 20.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We could help better if you were to say what conditions you want, and what sum would result from your example.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business &#40;Lync 2013&#41; Presence Unknown</h2>
                    <p>So I have users in my organization with the presence unknown issue (shows presence unknown when trying to msg someone via Skype/Lync). I have tried all the fixes I could find already on the forums and other sites such as deleting contacts and refreshing
 them, fixing the email and messaging ids and a few other things, but none of them work in the long term. Instead I have devised a way to fix it which has worked permanently for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I uninstall Lync</p>
<p>Then I repair windows office</p>
<p>Next I delete the lync data found under appdata</p>
<p>Then I Run CCleaner and clear out any registry entries that might be lingering around.</p>
<p>Restart</p>
<p>Install lync</p>
<p>Install updates for lync</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole process takes about an hour (the long portion being removing lync, repairing office and updating lync). I was wondering if there was an easier way I could try that doesn't take so long? Any suggestions would be most helpful.</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint presentation mode on iPad</h2>
                    My issue is when I am playing a presentation, the only way to advance the slide is by swiping. This is really annoying when a slide has many transitions. &nbsp;One thing I really like about keynote is you can simply tap to advance the slide/transition. Is there
 any way to do this with PowerPoint? Thank you.

            <p>With a few seconds work (has to be done on a computer, not the iPad) you can make this happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the presentation, choose View | Slide Master</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the topmost master, put a rectangle on the left side of the slide master, give it an Action setting of Previous Slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do the same on the right side but make the Action Setting = Next slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make the rectangles as large as you like side to side; fill the slide top to bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give them both no line/no fill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now test your presentation on the computer in slide show view. &nbsp;Clicking anywhere on the right will advance to the next slide, clicking on the left will go to the previous slide (except where the rectangle is covered by other content on the slides themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Silly simple working example here (I've left the rectangles filled so it's easier to fiddle with them)</p>

    <title>How do I insert an envelope at the END of a document instead of the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I insert an envelope at the END of a document instead of the beginning &#40;Word 2010&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    When I use ADD TO DOCUMENT, no matter where my cursor is, the envelope is added at the beginning of the document.&nbsp; The only way I seem to be able to get it at the end of the document is to set it up from scratch.&nbsp; I have tried to copy and paste the format
 from other documents which miraculously have their envelopes at the end of the document, but no amount of coaxing using paste options will make it work.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate any help.<br />
<br />
Regards, Michelle<br />

            The function always adds the envelope to the start of of the letter? You would have to create a function to add the envelope at the end of the letter, but is there any need to add the envelope to the letter document? You could simply print an envelope
 whenever required, or for more control over the process use <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Envelope_Label_Add_In.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gmayor.com/Envelope_Label_Add_In.htm</a>&nbsp; to print an envelope or create an envelope document.<br />
<br />
I may look at adding the envelope to the end of the letter as my next update for this add-in.<br />

            Thanks Graham - I will look at your addin shortly.&nbsp; And yes, since I inherited this job, and since most of the form documents have an envelope at the end, I don't want to confuse other users with having to sometimes click on envelope or having it come
 out at the beginning of the document.<br />
