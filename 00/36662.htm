    <title>No possible to update to Windows 10 for graphic card limitations - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No possible to update to Windows 10 for graphic card limitations</h2>
                    <p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old-fashioned Samsung Laptop R60E, with Intel Core Duo 1,6ghz, 2 mb ram, 200gb hdd,&nbsp; Ati Mobility Radeon X2300 graphic card. My current OS, is Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GMX have warned me that the display manufacturer of the Graphic Card (nowadays it is AMD, not ATI), has not provided compatibility with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution to solve this inconvenience?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards!</p>
<p>

            <p>Well, finally I have got the solution to find compatible drivers for Windows 10 in old-fashioned laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloading the program 3DP Chip (free download). (You need to disable the antivirus program during the process).</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.3dpchip.com/3dpchip/index_eng.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver changes from the Basic Windows Display with low resolution&nbsp; and recognises your graphic card:</p>
<p>Ati Mobility Radeon X2300.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope will work fine for all of you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards!</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in responding to your query.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glad to know that you were able to fix the issue with Windows Update.</p>
<p>For the other issue, I would have you disable McAfee temporarily (if that does not work, then&nbsp;uninstall)&nbsp;and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note: Disabling antivirus will put your computer at risk. Make sure it is enabled once done with the troubleshooting.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks Nirmal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried that and fully removed the McAfee software using the MCPR programme <a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331</a>&nbsp;which I had seen suggested elsewhere when looking to solve the Windows Update problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, problem still remained so I have reinstalled McAfee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of other points that may be relevant:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. when I was looking for answers to the Windows Update problem I downloaded (on another PC) Malwarebytes and ran it on the affected PC. It detected a Trojan which it deleted and unfortunately I do not have the name of the Trojan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I am unable to start the Windows Security Center at all and get a message saying "The Security Centre service can't be started"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really appreciate your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When (approx. date) did you first install the BT/McAfee application?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Has any other McAfee application <em>or a Norton application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a McAfee free-trial <em>or a Norton free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><u>when</u> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Which of the following<em> </em>updates&nbsp;<em>ARE NOT LISTED</em> in <strong>
Installed Updates</strong> (<em>not </em><strong><em>Update History</em></strong>)? [1][2]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) KB2846071 &amp; KB2850851;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) KB2845690, KB2839894 &amp; KB2839229;<br />

</p>
<p><br />
6. <em>Assuming Java is installed</em>, is <strong>Java Version 7 Update 25</strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp</font></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8b. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Have you ever had occasion to do a Repair Install or a clean install of Windows?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic;
<strong><em>System Mechanic</em></strong>; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo

            <p>Thanks for your help. Answers as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. 2008</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Approx one year ago</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Yes - Norton Internet Security was installed prior to McAfee. I uninstalled using the function in control panel and also ran the uninstall programme on the Norton Website</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. I checked the original order from Dell and it apparently came with McAfee 9.0 Security Center trial version. I think I would have uninstalled this when I installed Norton back in 2008</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. All those updates ARE listed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Java Version installed is 1.6.0-oem the link you provided offers the newer version 7 update 25. I have not upgraded yet until you tell me to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. I have version 11,7,700,224 installed. Again not updated yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. IE9</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. No</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Yes. I have regularly used the registry cleaner included in the free version of Glary Utilities for several years</p>

<em>without</em>quoting my post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <em>Assuming you used/Activated it =&gt; </em>Had the preinstalled-by-Dell McAfee free-trial period already expired by the time you replaced it with Norton Internet Security?</p>

            <p>1. I never used the pre-installed McAfee programme as I was already a Norton subscriber when I changed my PC to the current one. I am not certain of the timing of it being uninstalled though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. At the time the pre-installed version of McAfee was removed (and Norton installed) back in 2008 I was not aware of the
<strong>McAfee Consumer Products Removal</strong> Tool so it wasn't run at that time. I only ran the MCPR tool recently when I removed McAfee as directed by Nirmal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. No. I think it still had a couple of months left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. No. I didn't run the <strong>Norton Removal Tool </strong>when&nbsp;I installed McAfee in 2012 as I wasn't aware it existed. I ran it belatedly when I noticed some Norton programmes still present when I ran the MCPR</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. I don't know whether back-ups have been stored on the PC somewhere but am not aware of any. I picked up the recommendation to use Glary in a Financial Times article years ago</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I managed to update Java and do the deleting as instructed&nbsp;but can't update Flash Player. I downloaded the update onto a SD card using&nbsp;another PC and when I tried to run it from the SD card it just disappears before my eyes. Very strange! Can't download
 it on the problem PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just for clarity the sequence of events here is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2008 - purchase PC and install Norton / uninstall McAfee trial version (without MCPR tool)</p>
<p>2008-Mid 2012 - years of hassle free useage whilst also using Glary registry cleaner</p>
<p>2012 - Install McAfee (as part of BT NetProtect Plus - free to BT boradband subscribers) and uninstall Norton (without Norton Removal Tool)</p>
<p>Mid 2012 - June/July 2013 - continued hassle free useage with many downloads</p>
<p>June/July 2013 - unable to do any downloads and noticed that windows wouldn't update and security center won't start - that's where the thread effectively starts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help</p>

It may have been too late for the Norton &amp; McAfee removal tools to "come to the rescue." As such, there's a very good chance that the BT/McAfee application never installed properly (and therefore has never

    <title>Cannot see Windows XP computers on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dean kent  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot see Windows XP computers on Windows 7</h2>
                    OK, this is rather ludicrous.&nbsp; I have seen numerous similar questions posted over the past two years or so, but most questions remain "does anyone have an answer?"&nbsp; Is networking really that messed up in Windows 7 vs. previous releases and Microsoft not
 interested in solving this?<br />
<br />
Here is the situation:<br />
<br />
1) WRT54GS v6 wireless router.<br />
2) Windows 7 (64bit) PC<br />
3) Windows XP (32bit) Laptop (plus several other XP machines on network)<br />
<br />
Windows 7 networking specifies Work network, with a workgroup name of KENTHOME.<br />
Windows XP has a workgroup name of KENTHOME.<br />
<br />
Laptop (XP) sees three other computers on the network (all XP based) including one called AustinPC.&nbsp; Does not see Windows 7 PC (called DEANMAIN)<br />
Windows 7 machine (DEANMAIN) sees itself, and AustinPC - but no other XP machines.<br />
<br />
I can successfully ping from both the XP and Windows 7 machines to the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting the laptop computer name in the search box in Windows 7 results in 'not found', same with IP address.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've followed every thread I can find, and tried every 'solution'
 - verified all sharing is set correctly on both Windows XP and 7.&nbsp; Verified workgroup is specified correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, in Windows 7, both the machines show up as 'Media devices', not as computers, so double clicking does not open folders but opens
 the Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
What gives?&nbsp; Am I missing some crucial bit of information, or is Windows 7 networking flat out broken with no interest from Microsoft to fix it?<br />

            Can I scream now, or should I first reply - then scream?<br />
<br />
Every, and let me repeat, *EVERY* reply says "follow these instructions", which say to do everything I have done, which includes the simple act of "Click on the computer you want to share with".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Please pay attention:&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no computers to click on in the network.&nbsp; They are not seen.&nbsp;&nbsp; They do not exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can be pinged, but they can not be accessed by name.&nbsp;&nbsp; Putting their IP or name into the 'Search' box results in 'not found'.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are
 in the same workgroup.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are attached to the same router.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I already say they can be pinged?<br />
<br />
So, let me say again - on the XP machine, I can see all of the computers *except* the Windows 7 computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, they are all configured correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Windows 7 computer, I cannot see any of the others - Except one of the XP machines which is listed
 as a 'media device' for some unknown reason.&nbsp; I don't have a home group.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have it set up as a 'work' network, and it has the same workgroup as the XP machines. &nbsp; Did I already say they can be pinged?<br />
<br />
Please excuse my frustration. &nbsp; I keep seeing the same replies, over and over, in numerous locations to questions about this issue. &nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, posters continue to post and say "I still can't see the XP computers on my network" - then someone posts a link that
 says "Follow these instructions", which are the same ones someone else already posted, and which the complainer (me, in this case) has already indicated they have followed (in my case, at least a dozen times).<br />
<br />
I am guessing the answer is:&nbsp; Microsoft has no clue what is going on, and has no intention of investigating to fix it. &nbsp; Yes, I am aware that this works for many people.&nbsp; But, for many others it appears to not work.<br />
<br />
One reason I stick to XP on some machines?&nbsp; Microsoft Movie Maker.&nbsp; In XP it is very nice and functional.&nbsp; On Windows 7 it is a piece of junk.<br />

            <p>Hello Dean Kent, <br />
<br />
Please verify the following information that I have included for Network sharing between Windows XP and Windows 7.
<br />
<br />
To set up Network Sharing between XP and Windows 7, please look over the following information. File and Printer Sharing is different in Windows 7 than from the setup in Windows XP.</p>
<p>1) First, make sure the Workgroup name is the same on all of the computers in the network. On Windows 7, the default workgroup name is "WORKGROUP". On Windows XP, the default workgroup name on Windows XP home computers is "MSHOME". On all other versions
 of XP Professional, it is "WORKGROUP".&nbsp; <strong>(I understand you have already done this step)</strong></p>
<p>On Windows 7 computers, Go to Control Panel, then Network and Sharing Center:<br />
2) Network Discovery: ON<br />
3) Network set to: Private<br />
4) File Sharing is: On<br />
5) Public Folder Sharing: ON<br />
6) Password Protected: OFF</p>
<p>If you set up duplicate (the same) user accounts and passwords on All computers in your Network, you can turn Password Protected to ON. If you have the Password Protect set to On, you will be prompted for a user name and password every time you try to access
 a Windows 7 computer from a Windows XP computer. If you encounter difficulties accessing computers that are visible on the network map, make sure the computer being accessed has an account with the same name/password as the system connecting to it uses to
 login.</p>
<p>File &amp; Print Sharing has to be enabled on any computer you wish to share files or printers from. You also need to actually share the resource in question, right click on the drive/printer/folder, and select sharing. In Windows 7, the Public Folder Sharing
 is the same as Windows XP's Shared Docs.</p>
<p>If&nbsp; you are still having problems after setting up for File and Printer Sharing, then check to see if your Anti-Virus is enabled for File and Printer sharing on their firewall or make sure your rules or exceptions allow file and printer sharing.
</p>
<p>On the Windows XP computers, please verify the following:<br />
1) Look at the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article for information about having the Network Map display. On the Windows XP computer, you will need to install the software component that implement the Link Layer Topology Discovery protocol (LLTD) so the
 XP will show up in the network map on Windows 7. <br />
KB 922120 - Network Map in Windows 7 does not display computer that are running Windows XP<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922120</a></p>
Run&nbsp;the update on the Windows XP computer that you want to appear on the Network Map.<br />
On the Software Update Installation Wizard, click Next.<br />
On the License Agreement page, read the license agreement, click I Agree, and then click Next.<br />
On the final page of the wizard, click Finish.<br />
If you are prompted to do so, restart your computer.
<p>To verify the LLTD Responder is installed and running:<br />
On a computer running Windows XP, click Start, click Control Panel, and then click Network Connections.<br />
Click Local Area Network Connection, click Properties, and then view the list of items used by the network connection.<br />
Ensure that the Link-Layer Topology Discovery Responder check box is selected.</p>
<p>2) It is helpful to run the Home or Small Office Network File and Printer Sharing Wizard, even if it was setup prior to adding a Windows 7 computer to the network.
<br />
a) In “My Network Places”: “Set up a Home or Small Office Network”<br />
b) Go to Start, Accessories -&gt; Communications -&gt; Network Setup Wizard -&gt; Allow File and Printer Sharing.</p>
<p>For more information on File and Printer sharing, look over the technet website:<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx</a>
</p>
<p><br />
Please reply back and let us know if this helped with your sharing issues or if you still need further assistance.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br />
Marilyn </p>

            Marylin,<br />
<br />
Here are my answers:<br />
<br />
<p>1) First, make sure the Workgroup name is the same on all of the computers in the network. On Windows 7, the default workgroup name is "WORKGROUP". On Windows XP, the default workgroup name on Windows XP home computers is "MSHOME". On all other versions
 of XP Professional, it is "WORKGROUP".&nbsp; <strong>(I understand you have already done this step)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Correct: Workgroup is the same on both.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>On Windows 7 computers, Go to Control Panel, then Network and Sharing Center:<br />
2) Network Discovery: ON</p>
<p>&nbsp; Yes</p>
<p>3) Network set to: Private</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoops - don't see this in that screen.&nbsp; Is that in the "Advanced Sharing Settings" or somewhere else?<br />
</p>
<p>4) File Sharing is: On</p>
<p>&nbsp; Yes<br />
5) Public Folder Sharing: ON</p>
<p>&nbsp; Yes<br />
6) Password Protected: OFF</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes - I don't use the same login/password on all machines, because there are actually 4 of us (my 3 sons included) who have computers - but we want to be able to share files and printers (plus, I have at least 4 of my own computers for work, etc. that
 have different logins).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do not have an Anti-Virus program that automatically monitors my system (I use safe practices, and manually run the scan at my convenience... usually every day when I am 'offiline'.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not use Windows firewall - my router has a built in firewall.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On my XP systems - yes, I have KB922120 applied.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a) In “My Network Places”: “Set up a Home or Small Office Network”<br />
b) Go to Start, Accessories -&gt; Communications -&gt; Network Setup Wizard -&gt; Allow File and Printer Sharing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Did both, just to be certain.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>End result:&nbsp; Same as it ever was.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the XP machine, I can see virtually every other XP machine on the network.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Windows 7 machine, it sees nothing else but itself.&nbsp; But, I can PING the other computers.<br />

            I assume that since this last thread was in July, but there was no response ... the same old problem with MS Support continues ... the ball gets dropped and no one wants to pick it up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Win7 just doesn't seem to want to play well with others in the network. <br />
Sometimes I can see others devices in my network but for the most part, everyone is an island<br />
<br />
So sad .. it looked like this thread was actually going to get somewhere

This isn't Microsoft Support.&nbsp; This is a peer-to-peer forum.&nbsp; If you want Microsoft Support, start here:

            Unfortunately, that seems to be the root of the problem (and complaint). &nbsp; This issue has been reported to MS numerous times, and they even have several KB articles on it... which are dutifully repeated on all of the peer-to-peer forums, but in many cases
 these 'solutions' do not work, and MS has apparently never seen fit to actually look into the problem (probably because networking does work for some percentage of users).

            You need to pay for Microsoft Support if you need it, just like you need to pay a mechanic to work on your car, unless you are within the warranty period for the product.

<h2>            Problem related to hard disk partition.</h2>
                    
<p><span><strong>I have a HCL notebook.160Gb of Internal HDD is in it. At first windows xp was in it. then I try to install vista. In xp there were 4 HDD partition
 (drive C, D, E, F. Each of 40GB).At the time of installation of windows vista from the bootable disk, there was a option to reallocate the size of HDD, called drive option. there I deleted all the drives. that time there were 2 unallocated space. one of 120
 GB and another of 40 GB. then I divide the 120Gb unallocated space in 2 partition(Drive C with 50GB and drive D with 70 GB).then I try to make a another drive with rest of 40 GB unallocated space. but there was a error report that was saying “unable to make
 new simple volume, shortage of space”. then I leave it and format the 2 drive C and D with ntfs format and installed vista in c drive. i successfully installed vista and load all the driver. the system is working fine. but when I go to computer management&gt;disk
 management option there I saw that there was a 40 Gb unallocated space. there I try to make new simple volume with ntfs format but the same error is shown again. that me I can make use of that 40GB space. how can I make a simple volume with that 40 Gb unallocated
 space? and I also want to know that why this type of error message is shown? i<span>&nbsp;
</span>am a computer science student, and I want to know about this and its solution. please help.<br />
and one more question is that which OS is good for modern computer systems,xp or vista?and why?</strong></span></p>

<p><span><span>Hi Souravmondal10,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Answers forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the methods mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span><strong>:</strong> Back up all your
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You can try to run a Check Disk in order to know whether there are any bad sectors present on the disk.
 Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>You can solve some computer problems by checking a drive or drives for errors. For example, you can check your computer's primary hard disk to fix some performance issues, or you can check an external
 hard drive if it's not working properly.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Computer by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button and then clicking <strong>Computer</strong>. </span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right-click the drive that you want to check and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Tools</strong> tab, and then, under <strong>Error-checking</strong>, click
<strong>Check now</strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select
<strong>Automatically fix file system errors</strong>. Otherwise, the disk check will report problems but not fix them.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>To perform a thorough check, select
<strong>Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors</strong>. This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on the drive itself, and it can take much longer to complete.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both
<strong>Automatically fix file system errors</strong> and <strong>Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Depending on the size of your drive, this might take several minutes. For best results, don't use your computer for any other tasks while it is checking for errors.</span></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>If you select <strong>
Automatically fix file system errors</strong> for a drive that's in use (for example, the partition that contains Windows), you'll be prompted to reschedule the check for the next time you restart your computer<span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For further reference check the article mentioned below</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Check a drive for errors</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also try the
<strong>Check disk from command prompt</strong>. Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on
<strong>Start</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In
<strong>the Start Search Box</strong> type <strong>cmd</strong> and run it as an administrator.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the command prompt type “</span></span><strong><span>chkdsk DriveLetter: /r</span></strong><span>”
</span><span><span>(/r identifies the bad sectors and repairs them) and Enter.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<span><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> If one or more of the files on the hard disk are open, you will receive the following message:
</span></span></span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you like to schedule
 this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Type
<strong>Y</strong>, and then press ENTER to schedule the disk check, and then restart your computer to start the disk check.
</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<span><span><span>To repair errors, locate bad sectors, and recover readable information, at the command prompt, type
<strong>chkdsk <em>volume:</em>/r</strong>, and then press ENTER. <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If one or more of the files on the hard disk are open, you will receive the following message:
</span></span></span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you like to schedule
 this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Type
<strong>Y</strong>, and then press ENTER to schedule the disk check, and then restart your computer to start the disk check.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After that you can try to create a partition in disk management.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To create a hard disk partition using Disk management follow the article mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Create and format a hard disk partition</span></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Create-and-format-a-hard-disk-partition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Create-and-format-a-hard-disk-partition</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You can run a Diskpart to create a Partition.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To use the Diskpart.exe utility to clean the hard disk, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Insert the DVD into the DVD drive.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>disk selection </strong>screen, press <strong>SHIFT+F10</strong>. A <strong>
Command Prompt</strong> window opens. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type
<strong>diskpart</strong>, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong> to open the diskpart tool.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type
<strong>list disk</strong>, and then press ENTER. A list of available hard disks is displayed.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type
<strong>sel disk <em>number</em></strong>, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>.
<em>number</em> is the number of the hard disk that you want to clean. The hard disk is now selected.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type
<strong>det disk</strong>, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>. A list of partitions on the hard disk is displayed. Use this information to verify that the correct disk is selected.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>7.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Make sure that the disk does not contain required data, type
<strong>clean all</strong>, and then press ENTER to clean the disk. All the partitions and all the data on the disk is permanently removed.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>8.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type
<strong>exit</strong>, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong> to close the diskpart tool.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>9.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Close the
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> window. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>10.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Refresh</strong> button to update the <strong>disk selection </strong>screen. This step lists the disk.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>11.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Run Windows Setup to perform a clean installation of Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further reference check the article mentioned mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<span>You cannot select or format a hard disk partition when you try to install Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2</span>

    <title>video file size and resolution reduced suddenly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wengfoong  say:</h3>
<h2>            video file size and resolution reduced suddenly</h2>
                    <p>The video size in mp4 format had been downsized and the resolution quality reduced dramatically.</p>
<p>May I know the issue, is it due to the window 10 updated? As there is only Microsoft Office 2010 update after window 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know is there any solution to restore the resolution and, if I transfer the videos to external HDD, will the resolution drop again when I watch it on laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to know more about this. Thank you.</p>

<p>Ya, I am using VLC to watch the video. Before that the videos is in 720p but now the solution is in 320p. I tried with other media player too but the result is the same. Then, I checked the file size, it had been downsized.</p>

<h2>            When will I get creators update for windows 10 enterprise edition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As I am a normal user of Windows 10 Enterprise edition and I still won't be able to get the creators update, so can anyone ensure that whether it will get creators update in the future or not.
</p>
<p>In past, the anniversary update gets early available to all the editions of windows, so why is it taking so late now.</p>

<p>I noticed you mentioned normal user - you mean you are not on a domain, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not a domain, then you should see it appear through Windows Update. If not, your system might not have been certified yet for Windows 10 Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
You should also follow Microsoft's advisory and upgrade only when offered through Windows Update:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can check the manufacturers website for the make and model of your computer to determine compatibility. If it is deemed compatible, then you can download the Windows 10 Enterprise Creators Update ISO from MSDN or the Volume License Service Center then
 manually upgrade.</p>

    <title>Windows Media Center Mismatches Channels - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nurbles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center Mismatches Channels</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Win7 Pro x64 for several years.&nbsp; Until recently, Media center worked great with my PCTV 801e USB HDTV tuner.&nbsp; Several months ago some sort of "glitch" occurred and Windows suddenly decided it was a new device (it isn't) and Media Center forced
 me to start from scratch, identifying my region, scanning for channels, etc.&nbsp; I've repeated the process several times, including choosing other locations, and Media Center remains confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, I finally tracked down my license number and the installer software for the PCTV package that came with the tuner and it found over 250 channels (though&nbsp;only about&nbsp;100 are not&nbsp;scrambled) and each one matches the identifier assigned to it by
 the PCTV software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running a channel scan, Media Center reports finding 17 channels, although it seems to have found 80 or more.&nbsp; The analog channels appear to match the guide, but the digitals are generally messed up (for example the local NBC channel is on 2.1, but
 choosing that in Media Center takes me to Univision HD instead).&nbsp; Many of the HD channels that I
<strong><em>know</em></strong> exist aren't even listed, though the tuner can see them fine (as can other HDTV's connected directly to my cable TV signal.)&nbsp; So the problem is absolutely in the Media Center channel mapping.&nbsp; If there is a way to just tell Media
 Center to go to a specific channel by entering the channel number, I've been unable to find it, and with the guide being mapped incorrectly, Media Center's greatest use (as an extra DVR) is taken away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent months (literally) researching this before trying to get help through any Microsoft channel, but everything points to Media Center, so I'm here, hoping against hope that there is a resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone related to Media Center, its guide and how channels are mapped is reading this, it might be useful to know that my zip code is 32955 and I have Brighthouse Cable out of Melbourne, FL.&nbsp; My tuner can do Analog and ClearQAM (the make/model is listed
 above if more details are needed.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is any additional information I can provide that might help someone resolve this, just ask.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the idea, it helped, but probably not in the way it was intended...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GuideTool shows that all of the channels that Media Center found (171, which is probably what it was trying to say, but the final '1' was chopped off the display and it showed only '17' -- a totally different Media Center problem) are mapped to the channel
 numbers I expect.&nbsp; However:</p>
<ol>
<li>I've never managed to find the channels that show the wrong stuff on any other channels that Media Center found and</li><li>Media Center was unable to find several of the channels that I not only know exist, but I am able to watch find with the PCTV software using the same computer, hardware, and OS.</li></ol>
<p>So, I don't really see how the GuideTool would help map what Media Center thinks is channel 2.1 to the real, actual and correct channel 2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would allow me to map a different channel identity to that channel number, but that doesn't appear to be the
 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that Media Center is either using the wrong hardware type to access my USB HDTV Tuner or somehow one of the updates to Windows or Media Center "broke" the driver (or whatever I should call it) that Media Center uses for my device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that totally reinstalling Windows, etc. might resolve the problem, but since I don't have a month to spare for that task, it is not an option.&nbsp;&nbsp;(The "funny" thing is that I needed to upgrade from XP to Win7 in order to get&nbsp;ClearQAM support from
 Media Center for my tuner!&nbsp; I was thrilled when it worked perfectly, but not so much when MS broke it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe this can be resolved without any actual interest from a Microsoft developer who actually works on these things.&nbsp; If that should happen, I'm more than willing to assist by performing any tests that might help them fix the problem.&nbsp; I've been
 a professional programmer for over 30 years, so I can probably perform any tasks they need.&nbsp; (Of course, I haven't been writing anything important and complex, like Media Center -- only plant computer systems for nuclear power plants and boring stuff like
 that -- so I might not have the necessary experience.)</p>

            <p>The guide itself appears to be working just fine.&nbsp; But when Media Center tells me it is tuning to channel 2.1 (WESH NBC HD), it is actually tuning to 26.1 (WVEN Univision HD).&nbsp; It also absolutely refuses to ever find 35.1 (WOFL Fox HD) along with several
 others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found some other articles on line that suggested a complete remove/reinstall of Media Center might help, so I tried that.&nbsp; To be sure, while it was uninstalled I removed the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome folder.&nbsp; THEN I reinstalled (the entire uninstall/reinstall
 process required a couple of reboots, which I performed).&nbsp; On start up, Media Center walked me through all of the usual Live TV setup stuff.&nbsp; I even selected a different (but nearby) area code to see if that changed anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still the same in every way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found the "17" channels being reported.&nbsp; Apparently Media Center doesn't count ANALOG channels.&nbsp; It found only 17 out of the 41 that our cable company (and my PCTV software) say are available for devices with QAM tuners.&nbsp; Since the analog channels
 are going away soon, this makes Media Center even more useless and crippled than I though, since it finds only 1/3 of the existing digital channels and seems to get them *ALL* wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, every digital channel I've checked is (A) mapped to the wrong channel and (B) strangely, mapped to a Spanish language channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Media Center channel list (exported from the GuideTool) and the QAM channel list published by my cable company, but I cannot find any way to upload them.&nbsp; I put them on my own file server, if anyone wants to look.&nbsp; There are TXT and XML versions
 of the Media Center guide:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.svalli.com/files/mc-channels.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media Center Channels (xml)</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a PDF from Brighthouse Cable of Central Florida:</p>

</p><p><a href="http://www.svalli.com/files/QAMTunerLU-CFL032414.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Cable QAM Channel Line Up (pdf)</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to anyone who cares to look, but since only Media Center has a problem, I do not believed this will ever be resolved, since Microsoft exists to make money -- not to help individual customers.&nbsp; Sorry for my cynical attitude, but after 30 years unsuccessfully&nbsp;trying
 to get things fixed (including a bug in Windows 3.0 that still exists in Windows 8.1!) I don't see any other truth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, if you think you can help me kick Media Center in the head hard enough to fix it, I'm all ears, but I don't think its gonna happen.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi sman57,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Scan disk function gets run usually after reboot from an improper shutdown of the computer. So I would suggest you to first check if you are shutting
 down the computer properly. Scan disk has </span></span><span><span>the ability to detect and sometimes recover from physical errors on the disk.<br />
<br />
</span><span>When scan disk there is always an option written at the bottom of the screen that “To skip scan disk checking, press any key within seconds”. I would suggest you to press any key to stop scan disk on this
 window in the assigned time and proceed with booting procedure.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists and if the scan disk is appearing every time at startup I would suggest you to refer to the below article and use the
 steps provided -</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831426</span></span></span></a><span> (You may use the article for Windows 7 as
 well)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.<br />

<p><strong><span>Have you used the second method provided in the article KB831426 which includes the registry changes?<br />
Do you have any security program which is scheduling scans at the system startup? If yes, you may disable the security programs and then check.
<br />
<br />
</span></strong><span><span>You may also use the check disk commands and check if the hard disk has any bad sectors or issues because of which the scan disk is running every time:<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>Warning:</span></strong><span> Microsoft does not recommend interrupting the CHKDSK process. Microsoft does not guarantee the integrity of the disk
 if the CHKDSK program is interrupted. <strong>For safety you can back up your data before using the check disk command.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the check disk commands as follows:<br />
&nbsp;1. Click Start. <br />
&nbsp;2. In search window type 'cmd' and ENTER. Right click and select 'Run as administrator'.<br />
&nbsp;3. Type at the command prompt <strong>CHKDSK C: /F /R</strong> and press ENTER to repair corrupt sectors, if there are any.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>NOTE: The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does, then&nbsp;press Y to schedule a task and restart
 the computer to perform check disk.<br />
Once check disk completes you may boot to the desktop.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be an issue with the device settings issue or may be an issue with the driver updates as well. To assist you further, I would like to know some information regarding it.<br />
1. Are you able to access the webcam normally? (Without using the app)<br />
2. Is the issue confined to the Camera app?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<span>Turn on “<strong>Allow this app to access your: Webcam and Microphone</strong>” option</span> and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to turn on the option:<br />
<span><span>a.<span> </span></span></span><span>Press “<strong>Windows key + C</strong>” from your keyboard to open “Charms bar”.</span></p>
<div><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span><span>Select “<strong>Settings</strong>” option.</span></div>
<div><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span><span>Select “<strong>Permissions</strong>” option.</span></div>
<div><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span><span>Turn on “<strong>Allow this app to access your: Webcam and Microphone</strong>” option.</span></div>
<div><span><span>e.<span> </span></span></span><span>Close the app by pressing “<strong>Alt key + F4</strong>” from your keyboard.</span></div>
<div><span><span>f.<span> </span></span></span><span><strong>Reopen the Camera app</strong>.</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Set the device as default and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to set webcam as default device:<br />
a.<span> </span><span>Press <b>Windows key + W</b>.</span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span><span>Type <b>Devices and printers</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>Devices and Printers</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span><span>Check if the Logitech webcam is listed.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span> </span></span></span><span>Right click on <b>Logitech webcam</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span> </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>Set this device as default</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span> </span></span></span><span>Follow method 2 if webcam is not listed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
Try updating the webcam drivers from the Dell website or from Windows Update and check.</span></p>
<p><span>You may download the driver from the following Dell link:<br />

            <p>Hi Calvin4,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you tell us what projector you are using (Model/manufacturer)? Also, what adapter are you using to connect the projector into the Surface Pro? Is the projector the only external video device connected at the time?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, please make sure you have all the current Windows Updates as well as App updates through Windows Update and Windows/App Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If these steps do not work, try connecting the projector before turning your Surface Pro on and then turn on the Surface Pro to see if it detects the projector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if you need any further assistance.</p>
        </p>

            I finally gave up on trying to get my projectors to connect to my Surface Pro through the Startech.com adapter that had worked before the update to Windows 8.1. I purchased the Microsoft "Mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter," which uses the mini display port
 instead of the USB port. I am now able to connect to the projectors. The product is listed as out of stock on the Microsoft online store, but is available at Best Buy (SKU #9623576) for $39.99.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You need to check with HP Support, their on-line documentation, and also ask in their forums<br />
to see if there is a method to program the F-keys on your model. You might also check with a<br />
real computer shop in your area (one that does its own in-shop service).<br />

            <p>Had a similar problem with Corel Draw X7. The palette shifted and white became a creamy off-white. I also remembered fixing this in a previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this page on the Corel Site:</p>
<span>
<p>http://howto.corel.com/en/dc/Default_Application-wide_and_Document-level_Color_Management_Settings_in_CorelDRAW®_X7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't actually help, but I did go to the Default Color Management box and found that the available color profiles under RGB included one from my PC manufacturer (Lenovo). When I changed to that from the default, the palette was returned to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, my old Windows Picture Viewer also suffered this non-white color shift thing after the upgrade. Luckily, the new Win 10 Photos app is an excellent upgrade from the old and works fine.</p>

<p>Windows 10 license agreement that you agreed to when you activated win 10 requires automatic updates updates. You cannot prevent them or uninstall them. If you are having trouble with an update, reboot your computer and then run Windows Update again. You
 might have missed the Restart request so the update is not complete. If that doesn't work--try the update troubleshooter.</p>

<p>That is an excellent question. That horrid "People" Icon. I mean what IS it FOR, right?</p>
<p>Is Microsoft or (almost as bad, the GOVERNMENT) gathering information about your Contacts?</p>
<p>The people you know, the people you interact with MOST, the people you email questionable (i.e. PORNOGRAPHIC) photographic content to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, no. It's just a service to help you enter their email addresses, etc in your Mail Program emailings without having to look them up. You just start typing either their first or last name and the email address is filled in for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you don't want it. What you want to know is how to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like this: type "PowerShell" in the Cortana/Search Window on your Taskbar.</p>
<p>Right lick PowerShell and select "Run as Admin: from the menu that appears.</p>
<p>In the PowerShell directory copy and paste the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Get-AppxPackage *people* | Remove-AppxPac</span><span>kage</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>Wait for the program to be uninstalled.</span></p>
<p><span>Reboot your device and People will be gone.</span></p>

<br />
There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once
 worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.</p>

    <title>unsaved theme keeps taking over&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewcassato  say:</h3>
<h2>            unsaved theme keeps taking over&#33;</h2>
                    I have seen this posted numerous times but i have not been able to fix it, so I am hoping i missed something that someone might be able to help me with...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When i create a theme with a slideshow and save it as "black" there is&nbsp;instantaneously&nbsp;a new theme called "unsaved theme" that has all the same settings as &nbsp;"black." This is fine for a little while but after some unknown period of time the slideshow on
 "unsaved theme" will just revert to 1 picture. &nbsp;Annoyed, i reselect "black" and delete "unsaved theme" and press OK to confirm but (and this is where all logic by M$ flies out the window) the only thing that happens is "unsaved theme" is&nbsp;IMMEDIATELY&nbsp;rebuilt
 to copy "black" and is automatically selected again. Maybe if I weren't a little OCD (and crazy enough to expect a simple feature of an expensive product to work... what a jerk, right?) this would be something i could ignore. &nbsp;Hopefully theres a fix out there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any help you might have for me!</div>

            Do you have Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) installed ?<br />
<br />
Start EMET:<br />
<br />
click the Start menu orb in the bootom left corner of the screen<br />
<br />
In the search bar type: emet and press enter<br />
<br />
if a prompt appearsjust click Yes<br />
<br />
Click the Configure System button<br />
<br />
Set the following custom settings:<br />
<br />
Data Execution Prevention (DEP) Disabled<br />
Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) Application Opt In<br />
Address Space Layout Randomizer (ASLR) Application Opt In<br />
<br />
Click the X on the top right corner of EMET window to close<br />
<br />
A message saying you will need to restart for the settings to take effect wiil appear.<br />
<br />
Click OK<br />
<br />
Restart windows<br />
<br />
Run microsoft update. It will install 2 updates. <br />
<br />
After these are installed check with microsoft update for updates again. It will the find .net update and install it. (takes quite a while).<br />
<br />
You may be asked to restart windows. Once you have restarted everything should be OK.<br />
<br />
You can now change the settings in EMET again.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps - it is what worked for me, but your mileage may be different.<br />

            Really, Microsoft? That is your answer? If our **** doesn't install, just uncheck it. That is terrific. Your company has the worst support out there. I guess money can't buy intelligence.

            Hi Larry<br />
<br />
Sorry for the late reply. The thread applies to Windows 7 64 bit, not Windows XP. There was ( is? ) a conflict between EMET and .net framework 4 install on windows 7 64 bit. If you do not know what EMET is you probably don't have it installed. It does not ship
 with Windows ( It is an admin tool that most users do not need ).<br />
<br />
You can try Aaron Stebners .net framework cleanup tool if you are having problems installing, uninstalling or patching any .net framework:<br />
<br />
https://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx<br />
<br />
As always make sure you run it from the admin account.<br />
<br />
Forza<br />
