<h2>            win 7 bootable virtual hard drive, no boot manager</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: win 7 bootable virtual hard drive, no boot manager. also need to move it&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, I hope someone can help me.<br />
<br />
I required a second copy of win7 for testing purposes. I created a bootable virtual hard drive with win7 installed on it. However when I restart my pc, there is no boot manager present. I always have to press F11 to enter into the boot menu and then choose
 the drive to boot from.<br />
<br />
My configuration is:<br />
a) C: drive with win7<br />
b) D drive with other data on it (this is also the drive where the virtual hard drive sits on)<br />
<br />
What I did to configure a virtual drive was:<br />
1) boot from my win7 dvd<br />
2) went to startup recovery<br />
3) diskpart &gt; create vdisk file=D:\VHD-Windows7.vhd maximum=40960<br />
4) diskpart &gt; select vdisk file=D:\VHD-Windows7.vhd<br />
5) diskpart &gt; attach vdisk<br />
6) diskpart &gt; exit<br />
7) then went through the rest of the win7 install<br />
<br />
When i check on my normal win7 install:<br />
1) system &gt; adv system settings &gt; advanced &gt; startup and recovery: there is only one entry (i guess the present win7 install)<br />
2) disk management doesnt show the any attached vhd. <br />
3) easybcd also shows a single entry<br />
<br />
my questions are: <br />
1) Is there any way to get a boot manager appearing?<br />
2) I also need to move the location of the virtual hard drive without breakign the boot process. How can I achieve this?<br />
<br />
Any help would really be appreciated. I am worn out with this as I have spent hours searching and trying to find out how to do the above.<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
Peter<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Slow Boot</h2>
                    
<p>Recently Windows 7 has been slow to boot for me.&nbsp; This actually starts after the Welcome screen, not during the Windows logo part.&nbsp; It used to be that the Welcome screen would pop up for only a few seconds and then the desktop would appear.&nbsp; Now it stays
 on the Welcome screen a good 20-30 seconds, the screen goes black for another 30-40 seconds and then the desktop appears.</p>
<p>I've searched online and a lot of people say it's a faulty driver, however I have not installed any drivers recently.&nbsp; I've run a ChkDsk and Defragged my system with PerfectDisk 11.&nbsp; Neither helps.</p>
<p>My systems configuration is a Core i7 2.66 GHz, 6GB RAM, 1TB HDD and an nVidia GTX 260.&nbsp; I have Windows 7 Premium 64-bit.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how I can get my system booting like it used to without re-installing Windows?</p>

            <p>Hi thunderclap82,<br />
<br />
Since the machine used to boot properly there is a good chance that something, such as a
<br />
driver or Windows Update or even one for your antivirus/security programs, and/or a program<br />
you added in the recent past, has caused the issue. Also an interaction of more that one driver<br />
can create such issues so best to update BIOS and all major drivers.<br />
<br />
Run back throught the procedures in my previous message above and if needed try a Repair

<h3> courtney_jll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shockwave flash object and .shd file hangs up printer spool</h2>
                    <p>Since I upgraded to Windows 10, documents keep getting stuck in my print spooler, and in order to cancel the print,&nbsp; I have to stop the print spooler, delete files from Windows/System32/spool/PRINTERS, and restart the print
 spooler.&nbsp; Every time it is a shockwave flash object and .shd file.&nbsp; This is happening for about half my print jobs and I print documents all day so it's very frustrating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After googling the issue I see this has happened to others but I was unable to find a resolution.&nbsp; Please provide a recommendation for correcting this issue and thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Courtney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've already performed some troubleshooting steps, we would like to know if you've already tried the printing troubleshooter on this article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027397/windows-fix-printer-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix printer problems</a></strong>. If not, kindly follow the steps on it to further isolate the issue. You can skip the
<strong>Advanced</strong> section, as you've already cleared the<span> spooler files and restarted the spooler service.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists after running the troubleshooter, we suggest uninstalling the driver for your Hp printer and then reinstall it back. This is to refresh the settings for your printer. We also recommend using a different port in plugging your printer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We'll wait for your response about this matter.<br />

<h2>            Blue Screen after uninstalling a program</h2>
                    I have been using Windows 10 for some time and have had no problems until now.&nbsp; I uninstalled Firefox and was told to restart the computer.&nbsp; Now all that I&nbsp;get is&nbsp;a Blue Screen with the circle moving constantly.&nbsp; I get nothing when&nbsp;I do a CTRL-ALT-Delete
 &nbsp;and turning off the computer and restarting it only returns me to that Blue Scree and moving circle.&nbsp; I also tried using the Shift F8 keys to restart in Safe Mode, but it doesn't work.&nbsp; And, yes, I have already been to the Microsoft "Fix Blue Screen Errors"
 page and no help there.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks Arun but I have already tried that fix and the CD does not start.&nbsp; The computer instantly returns to the Blue Screen with my photo and email showing and that persistent turning circle.&nbsp; It ran all night last night as I was hoping it would eventually
 boot, and it did not.&nbsp; What is odd is that I have another computer (this one running windows 7)&nbsp;and the network will access the windows 10 machine.&nbsp; I am in the process of transferring all my files over to this machine and I have a backup as well.&nbsp; If I could
 get&nbsp;that Blue Screen to go away, I might be able to do something.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

<h2>            How to create a boot disk for Windows 10 without the &#39;install.esd&#39; file</h2>
                    <p>I had a licensed copy of <strong>Windows 7</strong> and just upgraded to <strong>
Windows 10</strong> from the Microsoft website. &nbsp;The install was done from a file named &nbsp;<strong>GetWindows10-pse_ggl.exe
</strong>which was downloaded to my laptop. &nbsp; I wasn't prompted for my <strong>Windows 7
</strong>activation key, but I'm assuming that <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>10</strong> has been automatically activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now interested in creating a boot disk for <strong>Windows 10 </strong>in case I ever run into any issues or have to repair<strong> Windows 10</strong>. &nbsp;The following link describes how to create a boot disk, but assumes that a file named
<strong>install.esd</strong> was downloaded for the <strong>Windows 10</strong> install. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-bootable-iso-file-from-your/07590098-90a9-4c7e-b6fe-5ce1632daf4b</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have&nbsp;<strong>i</strong><strong>nstall.esd</strong>&nbsp;on my hard drive nor did I remove this file. &nbsp;(System and hidden files are displayed on my laptop.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm interested in why&nbsp;<strong>i</strong><strong>nstall.esd </strong>is not on my hard drive and how a
<strong>Windows 10</strong> boot disk might be created without this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Unless you are trying to save the bandwidth, the only difference in the results you get from the article you attempted to link (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-bootable-iso-file-from-your/07590098-90a9-4c7e-b6fe-5ce1632daf4b">How
 to: Create a bootable ISO file from your Windows 10 Download for reinstallation</a>) and downloading / using the ISO image as directed in the link I gave to create said media is that the amount of work it took to get to a finished product... A lot less effort
 by using the ISO with the same (perhaps better) result (and the odds it will work out for you are higher.) &nbsp;;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is nothing put into the image you make using those instructions that makes the image specialized or better for the system it came from that I can see. &nbsp;You still end up with a generic bootable installation media - and, to put it bluntly, you are better
 off that way (generic) for clean installs later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe what you may be wanting is a way to restore / recover the system with all your apps installed on it, but cleaned up, etc. &nbsp;In Windows 8.1, there was something like this as you could create and utilize a Customized Refresh/Recovery Image:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/3610-refresh-windows-8-create-use-custom-recovery-image.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Refresh Windows 8 - Create and Use Custom Recovery Image</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>THAT was a great thing, IMHO. &nbsp;It was not included with Windows 10. &nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, where does that leave someone who wants to have a pristine image of their system with drivers installed, software installed and configured, users created and configured, etc.? &nbsp;System Image Backups!</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5495-system-image-create-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Create a System Image in Windows 10</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now perhaps I am still misunderstanding what you are trying to convey you want. &nbsp;You first pointed to an article giving a way to make an ISO image based off what you already downloaded when you upgraded a system from a previous OS to Windows 10 . . . to
 which I suggested it would be better (better odds of success, likely cleaner result) to just get the ISO image Microsoft allows anyone to grab for free. &nbsp;You then stated that you wanted a "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">boot
 disk based on what was installed rather than a generic image", but there is nothing that I know of that does that - the process you attempted to link to originally isn't making an ISO that doesn't have as much as the ISO you can download as a whole. &nbsp;So, again,
 unless this is to save the 3.6GB-6GB of bandwidth, I still suggest you just get the ISO.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Or do you just want a recovery drive?<br />

<span>Hi FredChase,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Which Windows operating system are you using?</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Are you facing this issue with a specific application or with all the application?</span></p>
<p>
<span>3. Have you made any recent changes to the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>You can try changing the resolution in Windows and see if it helps.
<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>You can also refer to the manufacturer’s website and
<span>&nbsp;</span>try updating the latest version of graphics and video drivers.</span></p>

<h2>            Games randomly stopping&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Haven't had any disc drive troubles or long load times or anything like that with the xbox one yet, but the one thing that irks me to no end is the sudden random stopping of a game in progress. We only have battlefield 4 right now so I don't know if it happens
 with other games, but whilst playing the game will just randomly stop at times and send us to the home screen and then takes a few minutes to be restarted again. Is anyone else having this issue and if so is there a fix for it?</p>

<p>Having the same issue, but it only seems to be on BF4. I have that one and DR3, whilst my friend picked up ACIV. The only one crashing to the Home Screen is BF4 so far. This leads me to believe EA/DICE needs to provide a patch/update to correct the problem.</p>

<p>@SER1FF CARTER I wish that was the case, but finally downloaded KI to try and see if this was happening there, and it is. Not always but 1 out of 3 trips to the KI splash screen result in the same behavior. I've been trying hard to pin down why this is a
 happening by reading the other forum questions but I have a sneaking suspicion people are having the same problem for completely different reasons so it's hard to nail down just one culprit of this mishap. Has xbox said anything about this?</p>

<p>I'm having this same problem with Dead Rising 3. I played about 25 hours or so of the game just fine, but now it undoubtedly shuts the game down at some point. Sucks too as I lost about 3 hours of zombie killing progress. It seems to be getting worse and
 worse too. Now it does it like every 10 minutes. Very frustrating. Seems like an overheating issue to me.</p>

<p>Count me as another whose XB1 has the RAM overload / memory leak issue.</p>
<p>Why does this issue affect some consoles but not others?</p>
<p>Is it even possible for an update to fix this specific issue? I hope so, but the lack of acknowledgement from Microsoft has me doubtful.

<p><span><span>Let us try the following steps, and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong><span>:

 your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software
 is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.+</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 freezes on screensaver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jg_892  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 freezes on screensaver</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated from windows 8 to 8.1.&nbsp; I had no problems with windows 8, but since updating to windows 8.1, my laptop regularly freezes when I'm running iTunes.&nbsp; I have my music playing, but I'm not actually using the computer.&nbsp; When I play iTunes while
 browsing the internet or typing in word, I have no issues.&nbsp; But when I'm using my laptop to play music only, it runs the screensaver.&nbsp; It did this on windows 8 as well but without problems.&nbsp; Three or four times now it has frozen on my screensaver (the moving
 text freezes).&nbsp; The song that is playing will finish, but the next song won't start.&nbsp; I can't use the keyboard or mouse to get the screensaver to disappear.&nbsp; I can't even use Ctrl+Alt+Del to bring up task manager.&nbsp; The only thing I've been able to do is hard
 restart my computer by holding down the power button.&nbsp; If anyone has&nbsp;a solution, I'd appreciate it.</p>

            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It would be great if you can provide more information regarding this issue. Please answer these questions for a better understanding.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer and did you schedule a security scan to run when the computer becomes idle?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you using any third party screen saver program on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could be either due to some issue with the screen saver program on the computer or some conflicts on the computer. I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if that help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Method 1: Disable the Screen Saver feature and check if this happens when the computer is left idle.</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using any third party screen saver program on the computer, you may please disable it. You may also turn off the Windows inbuilt screen saver feature and try to recreate the situation on the computer and
 check if the issue occurs. To turn off the Windows inbuilt screen saver feature, you may follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Got to the Desktop Interface and right click on a free space on the desktop.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the option “<b><i>Personalize</i></b>” from that context menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the “<b><i>Personalization</i></b>” window, click on the link “<b><i>Screen Saver</i></b>”</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the “<b><i>Screen Saver Settings</i></b>” window, select “<b><i>None</i></b>” from the drop down menu under “<b><i>Screen Saver</i></b>” section.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “<b><i>Apply</i></b>” and then “<b><i>OK</i></b>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now, keep the computer idle for some time as you did previously and check if this issue persists even when the screen saver is not activated.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, then this could be due to some conflicts from any third party software installed on the computer. If you have any third party security program installed on the computer in which an idle scan is
 set, then try the next method.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Method 2: Temporarily disable the third party security program. (If you have installed any)</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I request you to contact the technical support and temporarily disable either the security program completely or the idle scan and check if the issue still persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, then let’s check if this is caused by any other third party software on the computer. Let’s perform a clean boot and check the result.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Method 3: </span>
</i></b><b><i><span>Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</span></i></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. To perform a clean boot, please refer to the section “<b><i>How to perform a clean boot</i></b>” and follow the
 instructions for “<b><i>Windows 8.1 and Windows 8</i></b>” from this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><i><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></i></b></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may please note that performing a clean boot does not fix the actual issue. It just helps us in identifying the root cause of the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This can be done by following the instructions for “<b><i>Windows 8.1 and Windows
 8</i></b>” given in the section “<b><i>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</i></b>” from the same given link.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Important: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” for “Windows 8 and Windows 8.1”, to reset the computer
 to start as usual from the above link.</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please get back to us with the results.</span></p>

            <p>Did you ever get this fixed? I think I've been having a similar problem - my computer freezes but I'm able to move the mouse but I can't use Ctrl+Alt+Del to get out of it and I have to do a hard restart too.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The freezing problem went away for a couple months even with my Windows 8.1 photo gallery screensaver running - I'm not sure what fixed it, windows update, running Dism RestoreHealth, running scannow - not sure.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But last night it froze again for the first time in at least a couple months - it was stuck on one of the pictures fading in and out of the photo gallery screensaver. I had to do a hard restart. The only change that has happened is&nbsp;I updated all the important,
 recommended and optional updates yesterday. I realize I may not have needed the optional update, but my computer isn't going to sleep as its supposed to and there was a supposed fix in this update.</p>

<p>In any event, I've changed the screensaver to something other than photo gallery and I ran Dism and scannow again and we'll see if that works. By the way, I believe all my drivers are up to date. Windows 8.1 upgrade has been a huge, huge headache.</p>

            <p>I disabled my screensaver, and that seems to have done the trick.&nbsp; It helped for the first week, then I had it freeze on me once, but I haven't had any issues the last couple months.&nbsp; I don't know if it was because I disabled the screensaver or if one of
 the software updates helped resolve the issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you're still having trouble, you might try disabling the screensaver, as that seemed to help in my case.</p>

            I updated all the February updates - including the optional update. I haven't had any freezes since changing the screensaver from photo gallery. I think I have it on mystify now. I might try photo gallery again at some point, but I'm fine not dealing with
 any freezes for the time being.

    <title>Windows 10 keeps prompting me to restart to update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kai vu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 keeps prompting me to restart to update</h2>
                    <p>Lately, I have been getting a purple box pop on my display, informing me to restart my computer to install the latest updates. The 3 options are 'Pick a Time', 'Restart Now', or 'Remind Me Later'. Often times I am in the middle of something, so I usually
 just hold it off and press "Remind Me Later". The problem is, once I restarted, I still am getting prompted to restart to install updates. I have restarted a few times, but the problem maintains. When I went to "Check for Updates" from the windows search bar,
 Here is what I saw in the Update History:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33abfd20-77f4-4e59-a099-2db0f517e7ab?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33abfd20-77f4-4e59-a099-2db0f517e7ab?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, I have 8 of the same feature update version 1709. I came to the conclusion that I may just need to restart each of those times, but is there possibly a way to get past this, or fix it if it is an error? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Thanks for the update, Kai.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue can occur if a program is interfering with the automatic update process. For example, antivirus programs that use real-time scanning can interfere with the automatic update process.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Issues with installing Windows updates can occur when Windows Update and another program both try to access the same file. Although many programs can cause this issue to occur, the most common are antivirus programs and programs that perform real-time
 backups of system files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's fix this by closing all programs that are running, and then restart your computer. After the computer has started successfully, try installing the updates again. If the issue persists, start
<span>your PC in </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode with Networking</a>, and then install the updates.
<strong>Safe Mode </strong>will start Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services to help troubleshoot issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists after these steps, perform a clean boot of the computer and then install the update.
<span>It will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs that can eliminate software conflicts that occur when you're opening a program or file.</span></p>
<p>

<h3> tikivonnunfps  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Green Screen Bug</h2>
                    <p>Hey I'm T-K, and I've just bought my new <strong>laptop</strong> about a month and a half ago, after about a week and a half of using it, it started to have some sort of glitch/bug/issue when playing videos, this included Youtube, Twitch, Discord (when a
 video is linked), and even videos I have downloaded/were already on the system. It still plays the audio, but the video itself isn't shown.<br />
<br />
- Update, I fixed the Youtube and Twitch issue, which was just changing a setting in Google Chrome (I forget which one), yet YouTube and Twitch videos linked to discord still seem to have this issue.<br />
</p>
<p>- Edit - Found out it was specifically just my Xbox and "Films and TV" applications that are doing it now</p>

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

            When you open an application, it is not maximized, but you could move it and make it the size you like to have it in the required size. This is behavior in windows, so you could see all open windows.

            <p><span>Hi Lara,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the issue that you are currently facing, we will try the best we can to resolve your issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that if a program is not responding, it means the program is interacting more slowly than usual with Windows, typically because a problem has occurred in the program. If the problem is temporary, and if you choose to wait, some
 programs will start responding again. Depending on the options available, you can also choose to close or restart the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you close a program that has stopped responding, all files or documents that you've opened using the program are closed, not just the one that you're viewing when the problem occurs. Some programs might try to save your information, but it depends on
 the program that you're using. To help prevent information loss, save your work frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot </strong>and check the issue.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>(Also holds good for Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information helps. Please let us know if the issue persist and we will be happy to assist you further.</p>

    <title>Where is Screen Saver Settings control panel&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeu2004  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is Screen Saver Settings control panel&#63;</h2>
                    When go to the "Change your screen saver" page in Windows Help And Support, I see a link to the Screen Saver Settings control panel.<br />
<br />
And that works just fine.<br />
<br />
But when I go to the desktop and click on Start, Control Panel, which opens a folder(?) with the "Control Panel\All Control Panel Items", I do not see any control panel labeled Screen Saver Settings or the equivalent.<br />
<br />
How can I get to the Screen Saver Settings control panel directly (i.e. by clicking on Start, Control Panel) instead of going to Windows Help and Support first?<br />
<br />
PS:&nbsp; I did look at the Display and Power Options control panels, to no avail.<br />

Those links are not helpful to me because they require that I install Microsoft Silverlight in order to watch a video.&nbsp; I don't want to do that.<br />
<br />
(If this is the way of the future for Microsoft support online "documents", I am very disappointed.)<br />
<br />
It shouldn't be too difficult for someone who had Win7 to give me click-by-click instructions to reach the Screen Saver control panel.&nbsp; Hopefully, it starts with "click on Start, then Control Panel", then ...?<br />

<h2>            Left side of screen cut-off</h2>
                    Since upgrading to MS Vista the left side of the screen is cut-off. The entire image on the screen is moved a little to much on the left hand. My graphic card is GeForce 6600. If I launch the NVIDIA Control Panel the problem is temporally solved, but minutes
 after, it´s all the same again.

            What resolution are you currently viewing your desktop in?<br />
What happens if the Resolution is changed to 800 X 600 or 1024 X 768 in the Windows Control Panel?<br />
What is the make and model of your display? - We will need to verify all display modes that are capable on this device<br />
<br />
<br />
Many LCDs will only support certain native resolutions, changing the resolution in Display options will resolve&nbsp;this issue<br />
Most LCDs have an auto-adjust option when resolutions are changed but this method of adjustment is not always accurate.&nbsp; Manually adjust the horizontal position on your Monitor brining the picture back on the screen would resolve this issue.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Network drive fails to connect</h2>
                    When&nbsp;I start my laptop I get the message that my network drive failed to connect. I think the reason is because the drive is attempting to connect before the network is active. I always notice that the network is still initializing when I get the error

            Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
So, when you say, "Is there a way to have the drive attempt to manually connect after getting the error?"&nbsp; What exactly do you mean manually?&nbsp; You can connect manually to the network drive after the OS has booted and finished loading everything.&nbsp; I have had
 to do that for as long as I can remember for some locations.&nbsp; For example, my netbook will not connect to my Windows 2008 server automatically on boot.&nbsp; I have a drive letter mapped but the last time it booted it wasn't there and so it still says it won't
 connect.&nbsp; However, as soon as I try using the mapped drive, it WILL connect.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
So, I am wondering if that would be sufficient for you or do you have something that is failing because it isn't connecting right away, or if you are just getting that annoying message which states the obvious and means nothing because you can go click on it
 and it will connect.
