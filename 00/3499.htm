<h2>            How Do I check in a document on a sharepoint directly from PowerPoint&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Office 2011.&nbsp;
<div>I used the Document Connection to check out and download a presentation, it opened in PowerPoint for me to work on.</div>
<div>When finished, &nbsp;I can save the document back to the sharepoint by choosing "Save"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, I have not yet found an option to check in the document on the sharepoint.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>According to the Office:mac suport, there should be an option under "File &gt; Check In" - but in my version, there simply isn't any option available.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>it also says there: "<span>To work with SharePoint in Office for Mac, you have to have Microsoft Office for Mac Home and Business 2011, Microsoft Office for Mac Academic 2011, or Microsoft Office for Mac Standard 2011." - I am unsure which Version I have,
 is there a way to find out exactly? I bought my version through the Home Use Programm of my company, and it came with Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook (which indicates that it is the Home&amp;Business Version). Also, when looking at the Office:Mac Website,
 there doesn't seem to be any other versions than the once mentioned available anyway...</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The Sharepoint is hosted by Microsoft Business Services, I assume the have the latest and greatest in place.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Thanks for your support, would be great not only to know why I am lacking this option, but also how to get it!</span></div>

<p>
</p><p>- Checked out the file from Microsoft Document Connection</p>
<p>- Edit the file in MS Word on my Mac</p>
<p>- CLOSE THE FILE in MS Word (File --&gt; Close)</p>
<p>- Now, the "check in" option appeared in MS DC, and I was able to check the file back in.</p>

            As Jim suggested, troubleshooting specialized issues involving SharePoint requires access to a comparable configuration/scenario. The "typical" Mac PPT user probably doesn't even use SharePoint &amp; those who do may have different setups. Perhaps that's why
 so little has taken place in this conversation.<br />
<br />
Since SharePoint is a specific identity you may also want to investigate this in the
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/categories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="font-weight: bold">TechNet Community</span></a>. The folks there may be able to better address the issue.<br />
<br />

<h2>            How to move files from OneDrive &#40;personal&#41; to OneDrive for Business</h2>
                    I have both a personal OneDrive account as well as a OneDrive for Business (OfB) account.&nbsp; When files are created in a certain folder in my personal OneDrive account, I want to move (NOT copy) them to my OfB account.&nbsp; More specifically, if the file ends
 with a certain extension, I wanted to move it to one folder in my OfB account.&nbsp; Files with any other extensions, I want to move to a separate folder in my OfB account.&nbsp; I've been trying to do this with a Microsoft Flow, but I can't get it to work.&nbsp; Anyone
 know of how to make this work with Microsoft Flow?

<p>Hi MIR1315,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given your requirement, you need to create a custom flow which can move new files from OneDrive to different OneDrive for Business folders according to the file type. The current template might cannot fully meet your requirement. In this situation, I suggest
 you post a new thread in our <a href="https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Flow-Community/ct-p/FlowCommunity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Flow community</a> for professional support and further confirmation. This is the specific channel that handles Microsoft Flow related questions and issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for your help. However, what I did, was use the restore function and take my computer back a couple of days. After that process completed, I reinstalled my 2016 Office Professional Plus from scratch, and it is now working properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only problem I have now, is that I had a 2007 version of Office on my computer. I thought by installing the 2016 version, it would automatically remove the 2007 version. But I find now that some of my documents open using the 2007 version and some documents
 open using the 2016 version. I can live with that, and in time hopefully I will figure out how to have ll my documents open with the 2016 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your quick reply.</p>

                    <p>I had help by someone on this site in putting Windows Media Player onto this desktop PC, I think&nbsp;as we were clean installing Windows 10. I just was given a DVD that I want to play and my computer just popped a box asking to go to the Store to find an APP
 to play it. So, can I have some help figuring out how to make my Windows Media Player be the Default player for CDs and DVDs? I only have one disc drive in this DELL Inspirion.</p>
<p>I opened up Windows Media Player manually and I can't find anywhere telling which version it is. I also can't figure out how to have it play a disc that's in a drive. I've searched all over on it.</p>
<p>Here's what is on the DVD that&nbsp;I'm dealing with right now:</p>

            Hi Jeff
<br />
<br />Windows 10 by default does not support DVD playback, you will need to download a 3rd party player to play a DVD in Windows 10. The VLC player is totally free and supports all media file types, the file on that DVD that you need to play is VIDEO_TS.IFO

    <title>empty comment balloons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rclarkson  say:</h3>
<h2>            empty comment balloons</h2>
                    <p>Suddenly I no longer see a subset of the comments in my document - the comment balloons are there, but they are empty. My only thought is that it has to do with sharing the document with someone who is using Office 2010, while I am using 2016, other than
 that I have no idea. a) any way to get the comments to reappear? and b) how do I ensure this doesn't happen again?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please provide more information before we proceed.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does this issue occurs only with document shared with Word 2010 user?</span></li><li><span>Is Word 2010 user (with whom the document is shared) can view the comments in document?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to create one test document, share it with Office 2010 user and then check if comments stay unchanged. This is to verify if the issue is related with that particular document or is it
 related to Word 2016-Word 2010.</span></p>

            <p>I have this problem too and the response doesn't help. The balloons are there but there is no text, hidden or otherwise, that I can detect. This is true even "show all markup" is on. Furthermore, clicking in the review balloon sends us who-knows-where in
 the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so frustrated by these MS failures and the lack of answers or apologies. These aren't just "little things" ; they waste so much of our time -- those of us who have to work. We don't get paid for the hours per week -- and sometimes hours per day -- that
 we have to use to get around these problems.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I stop a combo selection from overwriting the table&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drichter53  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop a combo selection from overwriting the table&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a table set up that looks like the following:</p>
<p>Player&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Score</p>
<p>Grant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78</p>
<p>Grant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85</p>
<p>Grant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 95</p>
<p>Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 92</p>
<p>Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 96</p>
<p>and so on. I have set them up in this order because I later need to qry out rank of the scores. In my form I have a combo box that you can select from and a subform that only shows the scores of who you have selected.
</p>
<p>Everytime you select a players name it pulls up the tests and score of that person and then in another box you enter the score but if you change the name in the combo box it changes the name in the table after I hit submit&nbsp;ie</p>
<p>Player&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Score</p>
<p><strong>Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;78</p>
<p>Grant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85</p>
<p>Grant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 95</p>
<p>Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 92</p>
<p>Peter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 96</p>
<p>This is because if you are on the first record in the form it is associated with the first line on data in the table. I need to be able to select the name in the cbo box and have it edit or enter the correct information with that persons name and score with
 line I have already typed thier name on.</p>
<p>Any questions please let me know.</p>

            Sounds like you need an *Add New* button so that you can go to a new record and then make a selection.&nbsp; OR you could have the form open to only be able to add new....&nbsp;

            <p>So creating a Add New button would:</p>
<p>after cbo box selection the subform&nbsp;would go to that row of the persons name and the 2nd box says what test it is then I can enter the score and it will add the score to the table to that persons name and not overwrite the 1st person in the table?</p>

A Combo Box used to find a record MUST be Unbound: it should have nothing in its Control Source property. It should have code in its AfterUpdate event to find the record.

            Sounds like your combo is BOUND. If its used to search it needs to be Unbound. When you have a bound control, any changes you make are made in the underlying record.&nbsp;

            For an example of the sort of set-up the others have referred to take a look at ParentActivities.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
In the parents form for instance there is an unbound 'Go to Parent' combo box with code in its AfterUpdate event procedure which moves the form to the selected parent.&nbsp; The activities subform is linked to the parent form on ParentID, so shows only those activities
 for the selected parent.&nbsp; These can be edited or new activities entered for that parent.&nbsp; While this little demo includes only the one control in the subform, there could of course be others as in your case.<br />

            Using the DSum function, which, unlike a subquery, will keep the query updatable, the criteria for the function need to firstly restrict the rows examined to those for the current customer; then for the same year and month of the transaction date; and
 finally for those dates before or equal to the current transaction date.&nbsp; So it would be like this:<br />
<br />
RunningSum: DSum("Sales", "qryF09SalesbyMonth", "[CustomerID] = " &amp; [Customer ID] &amp; " And Year([Date]) = " &amp; Year([Date]) &amp; " And Month([Date]) = " &amp; Month([Date]) &amp; " And [Date] &lt;= #" &amp; Format([Date],"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#")<br />
<br />
I note that you are referencing a query when calling the DSum function.&nbsp; This is probably unnecessary as a Transactions base table could be referenced, the criteria restricting the result to the relevant year and month.<br />
<br />
Note how the date literal is formatted to the internationally unambiguous ISO format for date notation of YYYY-MM-DD.&nbsp; I would strongly advise against using Date as a column name, however, as it is the name of a built in function (returning the current date),
 so could be confused.&nbsp; If you do use it be sure to wrap it in square brackets when referencing it.&nbsp; But it would be much better to use a more specific term such as TransactionDate.<br />
<br />
One other point is that if there is more than one transaction by the same customer on the same day the expression would give the daily closing balance, not the balance per transaction.&nbsp; To do the latter would mean that the transaction date would have to include
 a time of day and be unique per customer, or another column such as a unique TransactionID autonumber column would need to be brought into play to arbitrarily distinguish between transactions by one customer on one day.<br />

<h2>            Office 365 initial installation</h2>
                    
<p>My company has an Enterprise E3 account. My question revolves around the initial installation on a newly deployed computer in a corporate environment. As the IT person can I logon to the computer with my domain account, download O365 including the thick
 clients, and then simply have the user sign in as themselves once the computer is given to them? Previously I have been waiting until I can get the user to logon to the computer in order to download and install office under their credentials. Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Yes. Regarding your requirement, I suggest you use ODT to easily deploy Office client on these computers. The users can then sign in with their credentials to activate their Office client. See the articles below and let us know if you have any further concerns:<br />

            On the iPad and iPhone moving and resizing any object isn't suported as it is on the desktop version. I really like OneNote but there are a few things that are a major nuisance such as this. This is something Microsoft really needs to address and I cat
 understand why such a basic functionality and need hasn't been addressed yet.

            I have also had this problem. I have loved using OneNote for school assignments and projects, but it is also very frustrating. Microsoft, please try to fix this problem. In the mean time, I have been able to make it work by copying and pasting my pictures
 and notes until I get them in the right size. However, i don't have a trick to enlarge pictures. With words you can just enlarge the print size.&nbsp;

            <p>Does it matter what kind of image? I have the same issue. I want to be able to both pull images from the internet and resize and move them, and also take photos with my camera and resize and move them. I can easily copy and paste into MS OneNote IOS as well
 as insert and add into MS OneNote IOS, but I cannot select the images after I insert or paste them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same issue occurs with text. I can place it anywhere, but when I want to move it again, I cannot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question, so you answer less vaguely this time, the images are mainly jpeg.</p>

            I agree. This is a must-have feature that should be included in the mobile version. After all, many people are now using mobile devices for the convenience. I rarely use my desktop simply because it is much easier, and more convenient, to use my iPad.
 I have my iPad with me all the time. I really like OneNote and would prefer not to use another product simply because OneNote for mobile is lacking rudimentary features. And if other applications can do it....

            How is it possible at this point you still can't even move images in the iPad version. Nearly makes it pointless to even use onenote for iPad.

<h2>            Triggers is Master Slide View</h2>
                    I am trying to set up a master slide so I can easily reproduce a slide with some triggered animations. &nbsp;Basically the user clicks a button and some feedback appears on the screen. &nbsp;The user can then click the feedback box and the feedback disappears.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As a regular slide this works fine. &nbsp;However when I try to recreate it in master view I can't do it. &nbsp;I can make the button a trigger with no problem. &nbsp;However when I try to use a text object placeholder as a trigger,PP 2010 doesn't seem to allow it. &nbsp;Specifically,
 the trigger part of the animation dialog box is greyed out. &nbsp;And the trigger option off the ribbon won't display the placeholder object.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Am I attempting something that just can't be done?</div>

<div><br />
<div>"...<b>When I launched Entourage from the Applications folder, not the Dock, Entourage opens without opening a new, blank email.</b></div>
<b><br />
I went a step further and created an Entourage alias in the Applications folder and dragged it to the desktop.&nbsp;<br />
</b><br />
<b>I launched Entourage from that alias, it opened ... without opening a new email.</b><br />
<br />
It appears to be a Dock issue. Would be nice if Microsoft and Apple got together and resolved this, but I'm not holding out hope.<br />
<br />
I didn't have this problem before I downloaded Mavericks, which I have found to be buggy. Response times are slower. And sometimes my menu bar goes transparent the Apple icon disappears from view, though it's there if you hover and click."</div>

As stated in the replies there is report that pro is not having these issues and that the lockdownutil.dll file was not included and that is the issue. One possible solution was to copy the file from a pro version but I do not have access to a pro version of

<h2>            difficulty opting out of insider program</h2>
                    <p>I've been with the Insider Program for about a year, but now I need this particular computer to be reliable/stable as my main work computer. When I attempted to opt out, however, I ran into walls. I can opt out for up to 5 days at a time, but that solution
 seems pretty weak since it would add to my workflow every 5 days to opt-out again, for the life of the computer. So that's a no-go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I searched the topic, I came across this post:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_repair/how-to-stop-receiving-insider-builds/28b954d5-49bb-41f1-82bc-2046bec50b13?tm=1461618142613&amp;auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I like the authority of the post (from a Microsoft moderator) and the date-stamp (April 2016), the advice itself was a bit cryptic and unhelpful. For example, the moderator wrote: "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Keep
 an eye out for the next production, or publicly-released, build to hit your device. When it does, you can opt out.</span>"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two problems here. First, the recommendation is to track Feedback Hub and Twitter to know whether my release is a "production" release. Good luck with that. I searched Feedback Hub and found nothing telling me when the last production build was put out or
 when the next one might be, or whether my current build (14342) is considered production. The second problem is that I've never noticed an "opt out" option during any of the updates I've received over the past year. Where are these things put so that I can
 find it the next time one comes up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, obviously, the sensible solution for me is to download a clean ISO, reformat my drive, and install a known production version of Windows 10. I've been avoiding that because it is hugely disruptive to have to reinstall all my other software and configure
 the computer to behave the way I want it to behave and look the way I want it to look. That's what I'm going to do, I'll just resent Microsoft for making that the best option available to me. I thought that in exchange for letting Microsoft collect data on
 my computer usage for the past year of test releases that they'd at least offer me a working, graceful exit from the program. No such luck, apparently. Yet another reason to complain about Microsoft's approach to end-user experiences.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>To clarify, you have two options to permanently opt out:<br />
</p>
<p>1) Wait until the next public release (probably a better term than production), the Anniversary Update due sometime around the end of July. Once that is released, you can upgrade to it and opt-out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Restore your system to the previous public release, Build 1511 also called the November Update, now and apply public any updates that have been released since it came out via Windows Update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything other than these two options, means you are still using an Insider build with the attendant instability.

            Yeah, that's what the Microsoft moderator said in his post. My point is that there should be a simple GUI button/switch to indicate "Please migrate me from the Slow Ring to the most up-to-date Production Release," and the update manager ought to be able
 to handle things from there. It's worth automating due to the sheer number of Insiders; making each one of us manually track releases or manually roll things back just to opt-out is tedious and unnecessary. That's precisely the kind of work for which code
 is well-suited.

            <p>14342 is a Preview build not retail. On the desktop you will see a watermark above the date..&nbsp; Public releases do not have a watermark.</p>
<p>The last Public release was 10586 released in November and is now 19586.318 with all the updates.</p>
<p>You can get this using the Media Creation Tool.</p>

            <p>There are plenty of Web resources to help you with the Media Creation Tool. Try this: http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-10-media-creation-tool-create-installation-media-upgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Media Creation Tool is a way of taking a *.ISO of Windows 10 and putting it on a USB thumb drive, which you can then boot from to install Windows 10 on a computer (assuming the BIOS settings permit USB booting). Unlike other dedicated media creation
 tools, however, this one also allows you to "upgrade" your existing system. I've never attempted to use this tool for an upgrade, but if you do so it will theoretically leave all your software and data intact and just swap out the OS. If you use the USB-booting
 option, however, it will erase EVERYTHING on your hard drive and you will be left with a factory-fresh Win10 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In sum: the tool can keep your stuff intact, but only if you select the "upgrade" option. (I'm attempting this now; I will report back when I know if it worked.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Ok, @Cincinnatux gave you a very informative reply and a nice reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I think some facts were left out so I state the following to help clarify -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; The Media Creation Tool W10 will just download to your PC and will be in your Download folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; You can choose up front whether you want to be able to put the ISO onto a USB later or just have it on Drive C.</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; The USB option just gives you the option to be able to take to another PC.</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; You could also burn a CD if you wanted to move to another PC.&nbsp; However, the USB is the most common now.</p>
<p>5&nbsp;&nbsp; You are running W10 so any ISO file will load right from Drive C or USB.&nbsp; Just click on SetUp (or close) to start the process.</p>
<p>6&nbsp;&nbsp; Since W10 can load an ISO, you are not booting the USB from within BIOS.&nbsp; Those days are sort of past for an ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we come to your basic question and that is whether you can keep your files, data, programs, etc.&nbsp; I am going to take the "5th" on that one.&nbsp; I have tried such things in the past as in taking a W10 Enterprise to Pro and I was going to suffer data loss.&nbsp;
 However, that was then and this is now and a different scenario..</p>
<p>
</p><p>My best suggestion is to d/l the ISO to Drive C (or USB) but it is really the same damn thing.&nbsp; Kick in the install and see what you are offered.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your only choice is to drop all data, files, etc, then I guess it is on to Plan B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>

            <p>As Mel said, upgrades are often a dicey prospect; clean installs have been the only reliable option in my experience. I attempted the upgrade using the Media Creation Tool a few hours ago, and it refused to protect my stuff. The error it gave me was as follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6572245-e479-4b01-85ce-f823326173b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6572245-e479-4b01-85ce-f823326173b2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I cancelled that action. I'll do a fresh backup of my data and do a clean install instead of upgrading. That was always the smartest option, I was just trying to avoid it due to all the disruption it represents.</p>

            <p>You can stay in the Insider Program by signing up again at the windows insider page. Just<strong> do not
</strong>re-enable the option to receive Previews which is a separate option. After you reinstall the final release you have to sign up again for
<strong>previews </strong>to continue in the Preview program preferably on a test computer. Most of us Insiders have only a test computer setup to receive the previews but we are still insiders on other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't done anything yet, don't sign out of the insider program just stop receiving Previews. You still have to reinstall the final release in a clean install, but you will still be an Insider to keep up with the new developments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No previews will be installed, just ordinary Windows Updates. Warning--you must have already activated windows 10 so be sure to see if your preview copy is activated. After the final release came out the requirement for activation started. You must have
 qualified for the free upgrade to activate. If win 10 preview is not activated, activate it before or after the clean install by using your win 7 or 8.1 key. This is to prevent installing win 10 without having win 7 or 8.1.</p>

<h2>            USB port keeps finding a &#38;quot&#59;new&#38;quot&#59; phone</h2>
                    Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I just installed the latest PC Suite (v 6.83.14.1) and installed new firmware on my Nokia N91 (V.2.29.008) and ran into a new problem (why am I not surprised...).<br />
<br />
Problem:<br />
When I connect my Nokia N91 with the USB cable, my PC (running XP) discovers the new hardware and I get an USB connected icon in my XP toolbar.<br />
<br />
It then _keeps_on_ "discovering new hardware", although I have my N91 connected, meaning that I can't disconnect it through the usual means. I can't even use the Nokia PC Suite to "officially" connect it (using the "Get Connected!" button) since PC Suite freezes
 when I try.<br />
<br />
I can browse my phone using the PC Suite File manager and Music Manager (**bleep**py program that it is...).<br />
<br />
As a results, this constant "New USB hardware found" wastes 40-90% of PC CPU resources.<br />
<br />
What I have tried&gt;<br />
I've uninstalled the PC suite, made sure I've downloaded the newest PC suite. I've ran the PC suite Cleaner and I've restarted my PC 5-6 times. Still the same problem whenever I connect my Nokia N91.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on what I can try?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are helpful!<br />
<br />
ps any idea how I sort my pictures in folders in my phone image gallery? right now it shows all the pictures I have in my phone, despite the fact that the images are transferred in separate folders from my PC -&gt; forever to open the image gallery...

            Hi lysozymes<br />
<br />
In the section "what I have tried" I am not certain whether you mean that you have tried uninstalling PC Suite 6.83 rel_14.1 and re-installing, or whether this refers to a previous version.<br />
<br />
I only mention this because when you try to uninstall 6.83 you can remove the core application but the cable driver portion remains. Unfortunately PC Suite Cleaner does not work with 6.83

            Hi, I have encountered the same problem an solved it as followes: (Sorry, Since I am German, using german Windows XP Home I am not sure, if the translations of the Windows-Menues are correct. But I guess You can get to them if you understand the context)<br />
The Problem is in the "Windows Device Managers Menue(?)". Open it through the "System Control Menue(?)"<br />
I found that under the Menue "Mobile Devices" my Phone "Nokia 6131" was disabled, although the Nokia PC Suite and all related features were working perfectly (except for the Message "New Device foung.." appearing every few seconds).<br />
Click on the right mouse button an select "reactivate". An error message occured saying something like "a problem encountered...." ignore the message an reactivate anyhow. After that the PC and the Phone worked perfectly an the permanent "... found an new device"-message
 (slowing down the system permanently) disappeared.<br />
So try it out, that's the way I solved it!<br />
Sorry for my English, bye

            Hi Scoobyman,<br />
<br />
thanks for replying so soon! very happy that I get response!<br />
<br />
1) I installed the newest vers. of PC suite, which then caused (?) the USB port to keep re-finding my connected Nokia N91. So I tried with another USB port and I kept getting the same problem.<br />
<br />
2) PC suite cleaner did remove some files but didn't manage to uninstall the latest PC suite.<br />
<br />
3) Un-installed the new version of PC suite with the install file I downloaded from Nokia website.<br />
<br />
4) re-installed latest versin of PC suite. But discovered that I still had the same problem with my usb port.<br />
<br />
And of course i had rebooted my PC between installs and uninstall.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm trying what gradeljan16 suggested, by checking the Windows Device Manger. Wish me luck!

            Hi gradeljan!<br />
<br />
thanks for the tips, I believe you gave me the right advice.<br />
<br />
I'm currently checking the windows device manager right now with my nokia N91 connected though the USB cable. there's definetely something wrong since the windows device manager keeps closing and opening (due to the constant updating from the usb port).<br />
<br />
I right-click on the /portable devices/Nokia N91 and chose the update driver but got a "you have the latest driver".<br />
<br />
When choosing "Activate device" I got a "Error message 10, could not activate device". So, I couldn't solve it that way. I got to choose the windows support page for solving hardware problems and it opened up a new window to Windows Marketplace...<br />
<br />
So i'll try and unstall the PC suite and reinstall it again...

            I have a simmilar problem with my Nokia 6630, I have about 6 or 7 odd Nokia handsets and all of them connect perfectly with PC Suite, however since installing the latest version of PC Suite whenever I connect my 6630 via cable or even Bluetooth connection
 Windows goes on a crazy driver installing spree, it consistently pops up saying "found new hardware Nokia 6630" then it says "windows portable media device" then it starts all over again and keeps these pop up menus coming untill you eventually re-start the
 PC. I am runnning XP Professional.<br />
<br />
What I find strange is that all my other phones using the same USB cable and port have no problem at all.

            Hi mbamg,<br />
<br />
My problem was solved by deleting the USB driver for the N91 and reinstalling the PC Suite.<br />
<br />
You can find the usb driver in /Control Panel/System/portable devices/Nokia N91<br />
<br />
Good luck!

<h2>            My Feedback for Windows 10 Tech Preview</h2>
                    <p>Yes, I know, maybe it's too early.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the points that I would like to be adjusted in Windows 10 RTM. Maybe Microsoft it's already working on them, but here we go.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Start Menu</strong></p>
<p>I'm glad to say "Start is (really) back". However would be great to have the possibility to enable the second row, to have there Control Panel, Pictures, Download, etc. The first thing I've done is un-pin all the apps from Start.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Why so big? Mate, I'm using a mouse.</p>

<p>Oh gosh, touchy poups / windows are still here... Mouse, again...</p>

<p><strong>Multi deskto</strong><strong>p</strong></p>
<p>Again, mouse. Why SO big? </p>
<p>The add button is too big as well in my opinion (not in this screenshot)</p>

            Maybe you could just put the icons to all the stuff you want on the right side of the start panel there.&nbsp; Basically just add the things you want.

            I like the big buttons on my HTPC, but windows users want customization, let one user have large scale, one have small scale, some have the metro look, some have the win7 look, how about themes that change more than just the wallpaper?&nbsp; Colours, transparency,
 icons, fonts, create a dozen global themes, let users customise those themes.
