<h2>            A 10 for this game&#63;  really&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>so i finally bought this game this past week to see what all the hype was about. Can someone please tell me it gets better?! i just got out of the vault and as dull as that was i find myself in the nearest town talking to everyone i see for minutes at a
 time. Why in the world do people like having to engage in menu after menu of text?? no wonder they say this game has about 100 hrs of play time. most of it is spent just talking to people...I bought it cause "they" said you don't HAVE to be a role playing
 fan to like this game but apparently you do...mind you i was bored with nights of the old republic for the same reason but i'm willing to hang in there and play through that one simply because of the star wars theme...so i guess what i'm asking is, does this
 Fallout get better? or will i encounter hours upon hours of text and dialogue just to advance somewhere? if that's the case than i will gladly return this thing...and to think i bought the 1st 2 expansion packs thinking i was getting a good deal but&nbsp;as of
 right now i'm feeling a little ripped off even if it cost me 22 bucks for both disks.

<p>It takes getting use to, &nbsp;it's quite slow to start. &nbsp; Looking at your games you tend to be more an action-based person (<i>although you technically do have at least 2 RPGs in your collection</i>).&nbsp; What kind of character are you gearing towards?&nbsp; A straight
 up marksman, a CQC specialist, a Rogue type?&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember as a Western RPG (Wrpg?) it's pretty free-roaming so it's pretty easy to get overwhelmed;&nbsp; do you choose to find daddy or make your own way,&nbsp; do you choose to be good, neutral or bad?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've a feeling that once you find your characters "niche" it'll be more enjoyable to you.&nbsp; If it isn't then you can chalk it up to this not being your general type of genre (<i>FPSs aren't mine</i>).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Yes, it gets better. &nbsp;The beginning is slow and, in places, tedious. &nbsp;Somewhere between 5 and 15 hours in (depending on your play style/speed) things begin to pick up. &nbsp;I kind of consider the game right up to the point where you leave Megaton to be the prologue.
 &nbsp;Most of your time to this point is spent learning about the Fallout world and how the game works. &nbsp;Think of it as the tutorial level many games include, where you spend a great deal of time learning and preparing, and not much time getting anything actually
 accomplished. &nbsp;I'm not sure if I would include the survival handbook quests as part of this prologue or not, given that some of the bits can be completed without leaving town, while others require you to get out there and start exploring. &nbsp;I guess it is sort
 of the gateway quest between the prologue and the meat of the game.</p>
<p>Note that as an RPG there will always be talking to be done. &nbsp;Almost all of your quests are granted as a result of talking to NPCs, but the ratio of talking to action is pretty high in the beginning and diminishes as you move on. &nbsp;If you really want to avoid
 the larger sections of dialogue, or at least space them out, then you should probably do some exploring and search for side quests between each of the main story line quests. &nbsp;If I recall correctly each of these has a bit of talking that needs to be done in
 order to move on to the next section.</p>
<p>You can also run off and do Operation Anchorage and/or The Pitt at very low levels. &nbsp;OA can be done right out of the vault if you have a reasonably decent build. &nbsp;Both should be done while your level is low, or you'll breeze through them too easily. &nbsp;I like
 to secure my megaton home, then run off to OA. &nbsp;Once I've got all the loot from OA safely stored in my home, its off to The Pitt. &nbsp;This has several advantages. &nbsp;First, it gets you into some action pretty quickly, second both result in some very nice loot,
 and third neither one will deplete your own supplies (because you can't take anything with you in either one). &nbsp;Both add-ons are geared towards low level characters, and completing both will give you a good head start on the rest of the wasteland in terms
 of gear, ammo, caps, and level.</p>

<p>hmm; well i guess i tend to go with being good as I tend to think that will give me the "real" ending. (as i did with knights of the old republic). The only problem with that is that a game would have to be extremely good in order to get me to play it again
 the alternate way to see a different outcome. Bioshock comes to mind as everyone praised it but i grew very bored with it throughout that when i finished it I had no desire to play the evil side of it and consider it one of the most overrated games of all
 time. I held off on buying Fallout until now because the price was finally right for me since I was skeptical of it being a role playing game at heart. what convinced me were the high reviews and the fact that &nbsp;"you don't have to be an rpg fan to enjoy". Mind
 you I don't really hate rpg's as I have enjoyed legend of zelda, mario rpg, and a few others from that era...i just feel that if i'm going to invest that much time in a game that i should enjoy every minute of it and the game should make me want to play more...so
 far this game is not... by the way what 2 rpg's are you referring to other than this one? I know knights of the old republic is one (yet to finish for the same reasons as this one) but what is the other?

<p>well thanks for the time estimate as it gives me a better idea of what to expect or not to expect. right now i'm sitting at about an 1 and 20 min at level 3. just came back from getting some food for the lady that runs the supply store but just my luck the
 place is closed so i have to roam the town and wait for her to return ( not my idea of fun), i figured i'd spend some money on the hooker lady while i wait, and see how that plays out but apparently i only have 6 credits even though i haven't bought anything
 and i could have sworn i had over 200 before i encountered the raiders, it's not like they stole money from me being that i killed them all, anyhow,...</p>
<p>can't even disarm the bomb as i am not qualified yet. as for the expansion packs, i thought they were for when you finish the game... i don't know, i guess because i am now an older gamer (30's) i like my games to be a little more fast paced, but i also
 like to be challenged and entertained at the same time (i.e. Portal). I guess i was thinking this game would be more like grand theft auto in that you do have to talk to people and do side quests and such but that game is more fast paced and you're choices
 for conversation rarely extend from one answer to another set of multiple answers. granted i only played through that (or those) games once but it kept me coming back for more the entire time until i finished it...unfortunately I don't think i have the patience
 to play through nearly 15 hrs of fallout to get the game moving at a decent pace. I'll give it another 2 days before i can return it for my money back...too bad as i really wanted to like this game; this game received 9's and 10's across the board from critics
 and users but a game that starts this slow should not rate so highly; maybe it's just me then.</p>

<p>You have to use the rich formatting option to break things out into proper paragraphs in the new forums. &nbsp;As you can see from my previous post I occasionally forget that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With where you are now it won't be 15 hours before it picks up, you should be closer to the 5 hour end of the scale. &nbsp;Note that when a shop is closed you have a couple of options to more quickly pass the time. &nbsp;When you sleep in a bed you can choose how
 long to sleep for, so just sleep until the shop will be open again. &nbsp;If you don't want to wander off to find a bed you can also wait by hitting the back button, which likewise allows you to choose an amount of time to let pass. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds like you're on the verge of entering the game proper, and at this point would probably benefit from finding Bethesda Ruins, my favorite spot for gathering up gear and making some caps in the early part of the game. &nbsp;The place is populated with Raiders,
 enough of them that it can get a bit tough at low levels, but the rewards are pretty good. &nbsp;Lots of weapons and armor that you can repair for use or selling, which should allow you to get your hands on some decent low level gear and a good stockpile of ammo.
 &nbsp;To find it, head north from Megaton until you find a river crossing, then follow the road on the other side. &nbsp;It is almost due north of the Super Duper mart on the other side of the river.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not that it really matters, but I am also a 30-something gamer and remember playing the Legend of Zelda on the old NES. &nbsp;I'm afraid that much like the TV shows we watched in those days, our memories of those games are probably better than the games actually
 are. &nbsp;Over time our expectations have risen significantly, but all we really remember is how much fun we had back then.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add to what <b>phyrian </b>wrote.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Find your "niche".&nbsp; My thing is exploring, so I geared my character toward that end&nbsp; with her skills, perks, &amp; so forth. What type of character interests you?&nbsp; A Gunslinger, a tank/defensive type, a brawler, a "techie"? As I stated before,&nbsp; once you find
 the kind of character that interests you it'll be more enjoyable, at least that's my take.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for some other stuff when starting off.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for the Bobbleheads.&nbsp; They're worth finding as they give you things, either permanent STATS boosts or skills boosts.&nbsp; There's 20 Bobbleheads in the game.&nbsp; 3 are in your general location when starting &amp; you can &amp; should get them ASAP.&nbsp; The first is
 in vault 101, the second is in Megaton, &amp; the Third is in the Bethesda ruins.&nbsp; </li><li>The Bethesda ruins, the Super Duper mart, &amp; the elementary school ruins are fair places to stock up your character, in 2 of thiose places the baddies tend to respawn every 72 hours or so, so you can stock up on their weapons, armor, ammo &amp; sell any excess
 to build caps.&nbsp; </li><li>Karma is pretty blanket, if that means anything to you.&nbsp; So if you're good you'lll be known as good everywhere, even in places you've never been to before.&nbsp; Same goes if you play a "bad guy" or a neutral character.&nbsp; The hardest thing to be is a Neutral
 karma character, since that's a very hard scale to stay in between.&nbsp; </li><li>You get a perk every level, so while you don't have to plan ahead for every little thing, it does help.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>If you get the apartment in Megaton, get that doctors area ASAP.&nbsp; Just about everything edible is irradiated, &amp; that doctors thing more then winds up paying for itself after awhile since it removes rads, heals limbs &amp; restores health.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Things tend to level with you, so level grinding (<i>the Jrpg staple</i>) doesn't really mean much.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>VATS;&nbsp; learn it, love it, use it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hit locations are a beautiful thing.&nbsp; Just be careful when using VATS in melee,as hit locations are only available in that mode with ranged weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Save often &amp; have more then one save.&nbsp; <i>Fallout 3</i> is relatively stable, but I don't like leaving things to chance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also there's more then a few times that you wanna see what would happen if you made decision
<b>X</b> instead of decision <b>Y</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul>

<p>I see, well in another thread someone mentioned a way of breaking up paragraphs without entering the rich text format which consisted of pressing several keys ( i forgot how)...anyhow, the more I hear about the steps to take just to advance a bit in the
 game the more i dread playing it. I just don't like the idea of spending an hour in a game to advance 2% within the game...just like an "action" movie i don't want to sit through an hour of a movie just to get into some action scenes. As for the older games
 of yesteryear, i partly agree with you but like a good song or movie that are considered "timeless classics" their are a select few games from that era that can hold their weight today in terms of sheer entertainment value. games like super metroid and mega
 man come to mind as i can play those over and over again...most of today's so called blockbusters i can only play through once and find no replay value. i include your current crop of grand theft autos, call of duty's and the like...to put it in perspective
 a game that i tend to play regularly with much delight has been pinball fx2, but i digress...</p>
<p>Yes it's true are expectations have risen and as such we should be getting much better games with the much bigger budgets of today.</p>

<p>Hmm, I don't consider SoTN an action rpg more of an action platformer with rpg elements. Castlevania did try leaning more towards the rpg side with Castlevania 2's Belmont's Quest (if i remember correctly) on the nes and even though it wasn't as well received
 as the others that followed, i still find it more entertaining than this fallout... (right now)...in terms of my character in fallout i wasn't aware that i had so many options, i know i took a test in the vault but my dialog with the test giver led me to believe
 it didn't matter...by having different traits and interests i didn't want to diminish my attributes that would impede me from quickly advancing in the game (i.e. easily breaking into terminals, doors, etc.) i guess i'm trying to be a well rounded character
 that can do it all. whatever that may fall under...obviously getting into the bulk of the game will require me giving it more than a week to get into. maybe i'll return it and invest in portal 2 or that new chess game which is hard to find...i guess i'm not
 cut out for today's rpg's but my point about this game was that it wasn't billed as a full out solid rpg; or maybe it was and i overlooked it cause so many were praising the first person shooter element.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My first character ran close to 100 hours of game play without any add-ons and without planning my character out. &nbsp;Most of that time was spent exploring and completing side quests, you can actually do the main story in probably 20 hours or so without too
 much difficulty. &nbsp;He ended up being a pretty well rounded character, and once I started the next leg of the main quest (Galaxy News Radio) things picked up for him pretty quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really don't know why people like to call FO3 a FPS, it really isn't. &nbsp;It has some of the most basic elements of a FPS (you shoot, and your perspective is 1st person), but most of the other elements of a FPS are missing. &nbsp;You have to manage your inventory,
 monitor the condition of your weapons and armor, bullet paths are determined at least as much by your character's skill as by where you put the cross hairs, and the list can go on. &nbsp;I've argued (old forums) with people trying to call it a FPS, because I really
 don't think it belongs in that category at all. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All that aside, try the GNR quest, and if you are still reluctant to keep playing then by all means take it back. &nbsp;FO3 is a game that most people either really like or really don't, and the way the game was marketed and the way people talked about it ended
 up dragging in a lot of people for whom FO3 was not a good match. &nbsp;There is certainly nothing wrong with deciding that this isn't the game for you, I've played plenty of games that got high praise from both critics and players and ended up wondering why.</p>

            Hi AntonioDeganutti ... definitely not 12 hours.
<br />A full reset usually takes 2-4 hours.
<br />Is your hard drive light consistently flashing like it is doing something?
<br />If not then I would force it shut off and reboot and see what happens.       
        </p>

            Hi Antonio,
<br />
<br />That Reset has stalled and is not going to succeed
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power Button on your PC for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down, then restart your PC
<br />
<br />If your PC does not start correctly, try sunning the reset again from the Recovery Environment, if that does not succeed, you will need to clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hello,
<br />
<br />If you're doing complete Reset, terminate this and suggest you to make clean install instead:

<h2>            Windows Batch File</h2>
                    There are many posts about Windows Batch File.&nbsp; I am just trying to find out whether I need this File left on my desktop.&nbsp; The Batch is labeled "Updates" and was left on my desktop after fixing an Update issue by Microsoft with my Windows 7 before Upgrading
 to 10. &nbsp;Upon opening it is scrolls through all the updates.&nbsp; Previously I posted about this and have not received a reply.&nbsp; Looking at it again I noticed it says "Windows Batch File".&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it on my desktop and what can I do with it?

<p>Lo que te han dicho es cierto....intenta explicarte mejor &nbsp;porque así es dificil poder ayudarte. En fin, por lo poco que he entendido tu problema radica en la Gráfica de la consola. Por tanto no te queda mas remedio que mandarla
 a reparar, habla con el SAT antes de que se te pase la garantía.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Si el teléfono que usas no lo atienden &nbsp;o comunica, prueba a buscar en la web de soporte de tu país para buscar los teléfonos buenos del SAT o algún Mail valido a donde te puedas dirigir.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>&nbsp;Lo de los meses GOLD, traquilo que seguro te enviaran alguna tarjeta prepago de un mes para compensar el tiempo que tu consola este en el SAT.&nbsp;Tranquilo que tus puntos y Microsoft Points no los vas a perder.&nbsp;Y por ultimo, lo de
 tu mando, deberias haberlo llevado donde lo compraste y que te lo hubieran cambiado, si no lo hiciste ,ya sera tarde y te tocara comprarte otro nuevo.</p>

            Hi Nick.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you everything possible for keyboard problems.  If you need help with any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />If this began within the recent past,  See if you can  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Check which Updates were installed at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and try uninstalling any from around the time this started.  If they return and cause the same problem then hide them with the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />What also might work is to go into Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Keyboard device, on Driver tab try Updating the driver automatically.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the same location try rolling back or Uninstalling the Keyboard driver, which works in a surprising number of cases where keyboard is messed up by Updates.  Restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />See if the keyboard will work in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If not see if the On-screen Keyboard works at Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard &gt; Turn On the On Screen Keyboard.  
<br />
<br />If so then it could confirm the keyboard is failing, so test it in repair mode to see if it works since it uses different drivers there:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you can contact a laptop manufacturer to see if you can still get it replaced under warranty, or check for replacement keyboards for that model from the PC maker or online from after-market OEM's that exactly match it.  
<br /> 
<br />Try resetting the keyboard:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-settings-default-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-se...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also remap keyboard keys using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap...</a>
<br />
<br />Check in your BIOS or UEFI firmware Setup for keyboard settings there, too.  
<br />
<br />If none of these works then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />Another thing that might help as it solves many problems is to Upgrade to the latest version by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.   This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Installing Windows XP fax services</h2>
                    I'm trying to install the faxing capability onto my computer that's using XP Home Edition.&nbsp; At the "add/remove programs" window, i get the request to put my Windows XP SP 3 disk into my drive.&nbsp; Unfortunately my&nbsp;disk only has service pack 2.&nbsp; I can't seem
 to download the fax services program from the Windows&nbsp;website.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks for any advice you can offer.&nbsp;

            Zebu44,
<div><br />
<div>You should give the CD a try - I am not sure if any of the fax components had changed from XP SP2 to XP SP3 - but the installer should let you install the component. Afterwards, you might try re-applying the SP3 update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You'll find the files you need on the CD here:&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>[CDROMDRIV]:\i386</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>If your computer came from a&nbsp;manufacturer, you may find that you have the installation files on your C: drive - so try telling the installer to look here:</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>c:\i386</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Give the above a try - you aren't going to be able to download the fax components of Windows XP from&nbsp;Microsoft (they don't offer it).</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Good Luck,</span></div>

            Hi ssdd2 ... As far as I know you can't do nested virtualization on a macbook with bootcamp.
<br />It is is a limitation of bootcamp.
<br />See link.

    <title>How do I delete &#34;update for windows 10 for x64-based systems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buburubu916  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I delete &#34;update for windows 10 for x64-based systems &#40;KB4023057&#41;&#34; which appeared without permission this afternoon&#63;</h2>
                    Three random programs appeared on my computer this afternoon: something called "Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant" which appeared on my desktop completely unbidden, and two others that Control Center says were also installed today, although I didn't install
 anything.&nbsp; This all happened after what must have been a virus generated a pop-up that said "Your PC is at risk - updating it now" and had a little progress bar.&nbsp; It also didn't give me any options to cancel it, as the only buttons were "Learn More" and "Minimize".&nbsp;
 Since it was freezing my computer and I couldn't turn the wifi off, I had to physically pull the plug on my modem to halt it.&nbsp; I turned off automatic updates as soon as I got this computer (since everybody I know who's stuck with Windows 10 says it never actually
 stops being a pain otherwise) so that shouldn't have been it, but all of my virus scans have turned up clean.

</p><p>Anyway, I discovered two more programs that were installed today quite without my permission in Control Panel, and while I've been able to uninstall and delete Windows Upgrade Assistant and one other that I forget the name of, a third one called "update
 for windows 10 for x64-based systems (KB4023057)" that's only about 700kb won't uninstall.&nbsp; Windows Installer gets stuck at the "Preparing to remove..." screen and hangs there; I've tried several times and given it up to half an hour to move past this step
 and it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my main question is: does anybody know where this file would actually be stored on my hard drive so that I can delete it manually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(And, as a secondary question, did this happen to anybody else?&nbsp; Is it a virus or a worm or something?&nbsp; I have antivirus software and anti-malware software and both couldn't find anything.&nbsp; Or, has Windows Updates just gotten so bad that its indistinguishable
 from a virus in its behaviors, and if that's the case how do I completely scour it from my system so that it can't keep on metastasizing in random places?)</p>

            Hi Buburubu916, the old ways of turning off Windows Updates no longer work, this method will turn Updates off permanently:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find Windows Update Service
<br />
<br />If it is Started, double click it and stop that service
<br />
<br />CLose the services App
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />sc delete wuauserv
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />If you also have the Update Assistant installed on your system:
<br />
<br />The Update Assistant in Windows 10 cannot be uninstalled, but you can get rid of it 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Task Scheduler and hit enter 
<br />In the left Pane, navigate to: Windows - Update Orchestrater 
<br />Right Pane double click 'Update Assistant' 
<br />Click on Triggers Tab 
<br />On each of the triggers ( At login . . . etc.) double click and uncheck 'Enabled' 
<br />
<br />Under 'Update Assistant, there is another event 'Update Assistant CalendarRun' 
<br />Do the same for all triggers on that event 
<br />
<br />Restart your system, that's It!
<br />
<br />When finished and after a system restart, open the services app and make sure the Windows Update Service is now gone . . .       
        </p>

<p>The first half of this worked great, thank you!&nbsp; I no longer see Windows Update on my list of services at all.&nbsp; But now my Shut Down option has been replaced with an "Update and Shut Down" option... it seems updates are preventing me from turning my computer
 off even after disabling the services and deleting wuauserv through the command prompt.&nbsp; Do you know off the top of your head if this is a related problem, or something separate?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I couldn't find a Task Scheduler, from the second half of your post; I've only got Task Manager, and couldn't bring up a Task Scheduler from Run.)</p>

            Hi Buburubu916,
<br />
<br />If you Click your Start Button, type Task Scheduler, do you nor see the image below to enter that app?
<br />
<br />I would let your PC restart, since the Update service is now gone, it can't update and that would probably clear the 'Update and Shut Down' message . . .<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6217f0dd-9358-4944-bbd0-b40224530f06?upload=true" />

    <title>Add iTunes to firewall&#47;anti-virus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kev914  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add iTunes to firewall&#47;anti-virus</h2>
                    <p>How can I add iTunes to the firewall when I don't know where the Microsoft Store installed it. I've right clicked on the icon to check the properties, but it doesn't show where it is installed. I've looked in program files and it's not there. I've even looked
 in the hidden apps folder and it's not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching the internet suggests that it might be in the WindowsApps directory. But I have no access to that directory...even as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>iTunes worked the last time I used it...about a week ago. But I have made no changes to the PC. I only use it for music. itunes will run but when you go to the store, the page never loads. One time the store loaded when I ran as administrator, but as soon
 as I switched to another tab and then back, the store was gone again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also uninstalled and reinstalled itunes from the Microsoft store and that worked for a couple of tries, but now the store won't load again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the other things they suggest, like updating Windows10 (it does it automatically), verified date and time, check connectivity (all good there), but I can't try the firewall tip, but Microsoft has hidden the exe somewhere for some reason.</p>

<br />
<br />Look in C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\AppleInc.iTunes_12091.4.37126.0_x64_nzyj5cx40ttqa
<br />
<br />So, do this:
<br />
<br />Click Start, type allow an app
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click Change settings
<br />Click Allow another app...
<br />
<br />Enter the following in the Path: 
<br />
<br />C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\AppleInc.iTunes_12091.4.37126.0_x64_nzyj5cx40ttqa
<br />
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Check the box under Private for it
<br />
<br />Click ok

<p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, but I am unable to do this as it won't allow me to enter the path. It allows me to put the cursor in the path both, but the box will not accept keystrokes or allow me to copy and paste. And when I try to browse to the path, it says
 that I don't have rights to the file and when I say continue, it says Denied! TrustedInstaller is the owner of that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even know if that is the problem. I see that Bonjour is allowed through the firewall, but I don't see iTunes listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If itunes is going to be installed into protected folder and iTunes needs to be allowed through the firewall, then Microsoft should add it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything else they say to do, but the store is horribly slow to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My anti-virus is Webroot and it does allow for both iTunes and Bonjour. I did try turning off my anti-virus but that didn't help. I tried turning off the Window firewall but that didn't help either. Webroot say you are suppose to use the windows firewall
 with Webroot as they only monitor outgoing traffice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried installing iTunes on another PC that never had iTunes and the store was still unbearly slow to load.</p>
<p>

            I fixed this by replacing the router.&nbsp; Not sure why the router was the problem. It worked for everything else. But as soon as I replaced the router, the iTunes store started working again.<br />

<h2>            14 meeeeeliioon in 24 hours... not me</h2>
                    <p>I was gifted my PC last year as it was a milestone birthday.... and I was&nbsp;ecstatic with my Alienware desktop (I didn't buy it so stop the negatives people)... this came with the following :
</p>
<p>CPU_Name: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4960X CPU @ 3.60GHz</p>
<p>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 690</p>
<p>LITEONIT LITEONIT LCS-256 SCSI Disk Device</p>
<p>However I have added 2 x 1 TB Weston Digital drives + 1 500gb SSD Toshiba (for games)</p>
<p>Also added a Sound blaster Z</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had well over a year of perfect gaming, video editing etc.</p>
<p>I also participated in the Windows 10 Technical Preview.... </p>
<p>However on 29th July, quite a while since I reserved my W10 slot.... nothing...
</p>
<p>So I went on the insider program web page and downloaded the MediaCreationToolx64.exe</p>
<p>I selected it and choose to upgrade....</p>
<p>It went off and downloaded the necessary files, rebooted, and I was presented with this ":("</p>
<p>rebooted and sent back to W7..</p>
<p>I ran it again... and it dl the files again ... why ????????</p>
<p>it went a little further unit I got the "light blue screen of death" basically a light blue screen and no PC Activity, waited 15 mins and rebooted .... only to get :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I gave it once last try, remember I have W7 with minimal apps installed, nothing major, no complicated software to negotiate... bog standard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>this time it ran and I was presented with CHKDSK (blast from the bast!), I wanted to cancel this but my keyboard was inactive (drivers not loaded), it went through and again I go :(</p>
<p>It rebooted back to W7, however I found that 2 of my hard drivers were now corrupt .. G:\Games and X:\Backup... NOOOO not the backup dive ......
</p>
<p>So I reinstalled W7 and it ran CHKDSK and when I logged in had repaired the damage done by W10.... but again it downloaded and I gave it one last try....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess what ????? :(</p>
<p>If I ever see that again I will book a trip to Redmond and slap everyone with a 12in sexual object....</p>
<p>How I feel at this time like Stressed Eric (YT it) ..... </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had good hopes about W10, was getting excited about it... having this W7 machine, a W8.1 (never going to run W updates on that now), Xbox 360 and Xbox one, plus 2 Windows phones... (which I love) I have lost a lot of faith in Redmond here .....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, I have checked Alienware website, nothing to report, plus downloaded the latest Nvidia drivers as of today....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going back and setting up Windows 7 (release in 2009) ..... Microsoft, you've lost a fan..... goodnight.
</p>

            <p>Also now every time I reboot I get a boot option with 2 options.</p>
<p>Windows setup</p>
<p>Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rollback doesn't seem to work.... why am I getting this ? I know I can edit the boot.ini but why should I ? will this work ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus I have found applications I have just installed... to get me back to a proper W7 won't work !
</p>
<p>For example, installing Office 2010, I installed it but every time I launch an app in the suite it tells me I need to reboot.... how many times ??? I've done it 5 times already.... Microsoft this is my face now :(</p>

            <p>At Last I have finally upgraded to Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically the thing that was stopping me from doing the upgrade was having 6 multiple cores in my processor.
</p>
<p>I booted to my Bios and select 1 processor and it worked a treat.</p>

    <title>Windows 10&#58; Product Key Expires Soon - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Product Key Expires Soon</h2>
                    <p>I have a refurbished Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga (I've always had trouble finding out exactly what laptop I have, I can't find it's serial number anywhere online so if that name isn't enough, I can't help you) with Windows 10 Pro. I've never had problems with windows
 and, in fact, it's still currently active with a valid product key, however, when I logged in today, I got a message from Windows saying my product key would expire soon. Now, seeing as Windows 10 is only 3 years old at most, I see no reason for my product
 key to be expiring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System information:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4300U CPU @ 1.90GHz&nbsp; &nbsp;2.50 GHz</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Installed Memory (RAM): 8.00 GB (7.89 GB usable)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;System Type: 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Pen and Touch: Pen and Touch support with 10 Touch&nbsp;Points</p>

            Hello THEREALELMO6599,
<br />
<br />
<br />First if the device that comes pre-installed with Windows 10 and now you are getting the license error then it means that your key might be rejected. The best will be to contact your manufacturer in order to ask for official assistance and they will walk you through the troubleshooting process.
<br />
<br />1. Restart Windows Explorer process
<br />You can also try to fix the Your Windows License Will Expire Soon alert by running Task Manager on your computer. To do that, follow these steps:
<br />a. Press and hold Ctrl + Alt + Del keyboard sequence and select Task Manager.
<br />b. Then in Task Manager navigate to Processes tab. Find Windows Explorer, right click it and choose End Task.
<br />c. Click on File and choose New Task.
<br />d. Type explorer.exe and press Enter or click OK. Your Windows UI will be displayed once more.
<br />e. you just need to run a single command from Command Prompt to finish the process. To do that, follow these steps:
<br />Press Windows Key + X to open Win + X menu and choose Command Prompt (Admin) from the menu.
<br />In the Command Prompt window type slmgr –rearm and press Enter and reboot your device. Several users reported they fixed the problem by running slmgr /upk command so you might want to try that instead.
<br />
<br />2. Change your Group Policy
<br />
<br />Several users claim that you can fix Your Windows License will expire soon error simply by changing your Group Policy. To do that, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />a. Press Windows Key + R and enter gpedit.msc. Press Enter or click OK.
<br />b. The Local Group Policy Editor window will be displayed. In the left pane navigate to Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Update. In the left pane double click on No auto-restart with logged on users for scheduled automatic updates installations.
<br />c. Select Enabled and click on Apply and OK to save changes.
<br />
<br />3. Disable services
<br />
<br />a. Press Windows Key + R and enter services.msc. Press Enter or click OK.
<br />b. When Services window opens, locate Windows License Manager Service and double click it to open its properties.
<br />c. When the Properties window opens, set the Startup type to Disabled. If the service is running, click the Stop button to
<br />stop it. Now click Apply and OK to save changes.
<br />d. Locate Windows Update service and double click it to open its properties. Stop the service and set its Startup type to Disabled.
<br />
<br />4. Use Command Prompt to find your product key
<br />
<br />Your Windows license will expire soon error message can cause many problems on your PC, but you might be able to fix it by using Command Prompt. Command Prompt comes with a useful command that allows you to find your product key. After you find your product key, you should be able to fix the problem with ease. To do that, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />a. Start Command Prompt as administrator.
<br />b. When Command Prompt starts, run this command: wmic path c. SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey.
<br />d. Your product key will now appear. Write it down or copy it to a safe location.
<br />e. Now open the Settings app. You can do that quickly by pressing Windows Key + I.
<br />f. When Settings app opens, navigate to Update &amp; security section.
<br />g. Click on Activation from the menu on the left. In the right pane click on Change product key.
<br />h. Enter the product key that you got in Step 3. Now click the Next button.
<br />
<br />5. Modify your registry
<br />
<br />a. Press Windows Key + R and enter regedit. Press Enter or click OK.
<br />b. Before you modify your registry, you need to export it. This is relatively simple and to do it you just need to click on File &gt; Export.
<br />c. Select All as Export range and enter the desired file name. Choose a safe location and click on Save.
<br />n case anything goes wrong after modifying the registry, you can just run the file you created and it will restore your registry to the original state.
<br />
<br />After you export your registry, you need to run a single command using Command Prompt. To do that, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Open Command Prompt as administrator.
<br />When Command Prompt starts enter reg add “HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Software Protection Platform” /v NoGenTicket /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f and press Enter to run it.
<br />By running this command you’ll modify your registry and prevent the Your Windows license will expire soon message from appearing. If you experience any issues after modifying the registry, simply run the registry backup file in order to restore your registry to the original state.
<br />
<br />Hope it helps, have a good day

            Hi Therealelmo6599 
<br />
<br />It is likely that the Windows 10 licence you are running is a volume licence version and is meant to run in a Company or organisation where the activation is re-armed on a regular basis . . . 
<br />
<br />Whoever refurbished that laptop, more than likely used a KMS Emulator to crack Windows 10 and Windows Update has found and disabled that . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .

            Hi, 
<br />for home computer this message says the activation was made illegally. This could do unfair seller, technician or any other person during computer repairing. Please, ask laptop manufacturer whether it preinstalled Windows on this device.

                    <p>HI,</p>

<h2>            Xbox gives DCHP error with ethernet cable</h2>
                    <p><span>I am going to try to be as detailed as possible with my issue. My Xbox is connected to a ethernet port on the wall (apartment complex provides internet) and I have always connected this way. I turned my Xbox on today and it asks me for an
 update (I hadn't played for a while).&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p>So I update and when I log in I cant connect to the internet, something about cant connect to DHCP server.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important note: </strong>My roommate is connected to the internet the same way, same plug in the wall but he is able to play just fine (Xbox one).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a work around for this issue, if i log in to the apartment's wi-fi and then connect my ethernet cable the Xbox then changes to wired and everything works just fine. But if I turn my Xbox off and turn it back on the same issue happens again and I
 don't want to log in to the wi-fi every time i want to play (Its a 2-factor authentication)</p>
<p>

<p>What model of the Xbox console do you have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your console's network settings and reset to factory default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clear the system cache and reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now try connect your console to the network and let us know if it can obtain an IP from the DHCP server. If not, take the same ethernet cable and connect it to your roommates console and let us know if your friends console can obtain an IP from the DHCP
 server.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The '<span>DHCP server' is part of your router or internal network you're attempting to connect to, nothing to do with the Internet or Xbox Live.&nbsp; The normal process when you turn on your console (or any WIFI device for that matter) is that it connects to
 the router and, in a manner of speaking, asks the router for a unique internal IP address to connect to the local network and thus, the Internet.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This network access request is handled by the router's DHCP (or Dynamic Host Control Protocol).&nbsp; It's called a 'server' because in large networks a dedicated machine may be assigned to handle the issuing of network IP addresses, hence the confusing
 name.&nbsp; Many people get confused with DHCP and assume it's something outside of their own network.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time this process works automatically.&nbsp; Sometimes however, DHCP has a conflict and tries to assign an IP address in its range to a device, that is already being used by another device.&nbsp; Each device (and when I say 'device', I mean anything that
 can connect to your network wired or wirelessly) needs it's own unique IP address.&nbsp; If, for what ever reason, your console can't connect to the network due to an internal IP conflict, the usual error is a DHCP one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're sharing an Internet connection with multiple people - like in college or university dorm - you may need to contact the network admin for more help.&nbsp; DHCP is a networking error, it's not a console error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that makes sense.</p>

<p>Don't think the DHCP service is running on router/L3 on a campus network. It would make more sense if it were running its services on AD server, or a Linux machine. Also, in campus or enterprise networks, it is very common that the DHCP server resides within
 customers DC. Client machines that sends out a DHCP DISCOVERY for a DHCP server need to have an IP helper that could translate broadcast into unicast, since routers do not flood broadcasts.</p>

            The DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) assigns IP (Internet Protocol) to devices. I would recommend you try to contact the Network Admin, and see what they can do for you.

<p>Resetting my xbox didn't solve the issue, I was busy with school but I was going to try your other recommendations once i got back. However, I remembered the apartment complex sending an email about the wifi router being in the second room of each room (in
 this case mine, but is attached to the wall so you can't turn it off) so before I left for school I used the switch box to cut off all power to my room. When I got back, before turning the switch back on again I quickly cut off the power to the whole apartment.</p>
<p>So far it has been working just fine, pretty weird issue.</p>

            I am sorry to bother all of you again but it seems that every other Xbox update causes my Xbox one to act up the same way having me to re-do the steps above to solve the issue but it is getting very annoying at this point, any of you know a fix I could
 try to fix this issue?
