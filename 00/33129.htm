<h2>            Xbox Live Gold Suspended&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been having an issue that I have never had before regarding my Xbox Live account on the Xbox One specifically. About one month ago I received an email saying this:</p>
<p><span>"We have been unable to charge your credit card for your Xbox Live Prepaid 1 month Gold Membership Card subscription(s) being billed to you through Microsoft Online Services. The following credit card is the current payment
 method on your billing account:</span></p>
<p><span>(credit card type)</span></p>
<p><span><span>Avoid interruption of your subscription service by providing a valid credit card and a current expiration date. If we do not receive your credit card payment within 21 days of this notice, access to your subscription
 service will be suspended."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Sadly, I did not see this email in time to try to fix the issue of which I am still uncertain. I have many questions. The first of which is why I was being charged for a one month subscription in the first place. The only
 reason I can think for this would be that I used a redeemable code for a 1 month live trial around that time. The trial should have been free, obviously, and I had assumed it would simply tack on a free month at the end of my subscription this year.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Second, the credit card that is associated with my Xbox Live Gold account for auto renewal is not expired for another few months yet so why is it that it couldn't be charged?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Third, why is my account suspended and how can I fix that? At first, I had thought that my Gold account had simply expired. I tried both credit cards associated with my account and both times, Xbox Live informed me that
 I could not have any more gold subscriptions linked to my gamertag at this time. I also tried using some free, 2-day trials included with some Xbox One games I had and had never used prior. Each code came back with a message saying:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>"You already have a Gold membership. Give this code to a friend who does not have one."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This would imply that I still have an active Gold subscription, yet when I try to play any online multiplayer it informs me that I am "restricted from this service".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This has been an ongoing problem for about 2 or 3 days now. I just want to know how to get my Gold subscription back so I can get back to playing with my friends. Any help is appreciated.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Josh</span></span></p>

<h2>            Help Downloading Destiny 2</h2>
                    <p>When an update came out for Destiny 2, I immediately tried to update the game. The update didn't work and installation was stopped. From then on, anytime I tried to install the update.,&nbsp;uninstall the game, reinstall the game, and even&nbsp;clear&nbsp;system cache and try all that over again, I would receive the&nbsp;error "0x80070570". I looked up the error and it regards error in downloading Xbox 360 games on an Xbox 360, although I am on an Xbox One. I do not understand why nothing in regards to the game Destiny 2 will work in terms of installment. Any help at all would be appreciated thanks.</p>

Can you tell us if you're using an external drive on your console? Also, are you plugging your console into a surge protector or a wall outlet? These are crucial to know and can help us understand where the issue is coming from. Also, cancelling the update, powering down the console, unplugging the console and router for five full minutes, and trying again.

 </p></blockquote> <p /><p>Yeah, the source destination seemed to have issues accepting the download. We recommend trying those steps again if you have the issue. We also recommend if you're not using the external drive, to unplug it as it seems there are issues with the hard drive accepting content. Thank you. </p>

<h2>            Need help moving DLC from one Xbox to another.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am on vacation with a brand new xbox atm. I'm currently in Canada where as my usual xbox is in the US. I signed onto the same account that I bought the dlc on, went to re-download the dlc and, after reaching 100% progress on downloading it, claimed the
 download was incomplete. I tried this multiple times. Is there a way around this or is it an international transfer issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Print Spooler Service Description says &#8226;&#254;&#206;&#241;&#195;&#232;&#202;&#246; and service was stopped</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>My computer suddendly would not print saying that the spooler service was not running, so I went into services.msc and saw that the print spooler was stopped and was set to manual instead of automatic.
 Also, the Description shows weird symbols ·þÎñÃèÊö</span></p>
<p><span>I googled it and I haven't really seen a straight answer why it changed or why it stopped the service.</span></p>
<p><span>I did find a way to change the description in the registry, if you go to 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Se rvices\Spooler' and then manually change the Description field.</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to know how/why this happened since I want to make sure this doesn't happen again.</span></p>
<p><span>I was printing just fine the day before but this happened the next&nbsp;morning after applying windows updates. I haven't updated, changed or installed any printers' drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>Any info will be much appreciate it.<br />
thanks,</span></p>

<p>Hi Debleena S,</p>
<p>to answer your questions:</p>
<p>- yes, Im able to start the spooler service, I already set it to Automatic and restarted the computer and it's running fine.</p>
<p>- My computer has the latest updates. it's my work computer that it's updated by the company once a week.</p>
<p>- I already ran the antivirus and also antirootkit tools.. everything comes clean.. which makes me believe it's not a virus.</p>
<p>- method 1 doesnt apply because Im able to add printers and remove them. most of them are network printers.</p>
<p>-method 2, like I mentioned before, I did run antyspyware(malwarebytes), antivirus (mcafee), antirootkits(kasperski) and everything seems clean. I havent tried miscrosoft essentials but since it's a 'business' computer, then we do have a webfilter with antivirus
 as well.</p>
<p>I should probably add that everything is working fine, it's just the Description of the spooler service that made me wonder why it happened. I have another computer with the same updates and same configuration (same image) but with no so many printers as
 mine, and this second one does not have those symbols in the description.</p>
<p>Im just wondering if this one has to do more with one of the printers' drivers that could've modified the description of it.</p>
<p>one last thing, i checked the spoolsv.exe version in both computers and both have the same one.</p>
<p>Hope some info can be provided about this since it seems this problem has happened to others but not really a good reason how or why.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi SillyShen,</p>
<p>We have McAfee enterprise antivirus and the version for spoolsv.exe in my XP machine is: 5.1.2600.6024 and the size is 57.5 KB (58,880 bytes).</p>
<p>Im not sure if you're running a different OS but I got to the conclusion that it has to do with one of the many printers' drivers that I installed. I have so many that Im not sure which it is but they're all HP LaserJet.</p>
<p>If you get any info, please let me know. it seems no one has a technical answer but just assumptions like me :)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

            <p>If you want to scan your spoolsv.exe file (or any single file), I would upload it to these two sites where 40+ reputable scanning softwares will examine it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.virustotal.com/</a> &nbsp;(about 40+ scanners)<br />
<a href="http://virusscan.jotti.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://virusscan.jotti.org/en</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;(about 20+ scanners)</p>
<p>The Services you see in the Services Applet get the Description they display from the registry.&nbsp; Each Service has a section in the registry that contains the Description you see and other information about the Service.<br />
</p>
<p>The default Print Spooler Service Description is:</p>
<p>Loads files to memory for later printing.</p>
<p>If your Print Spooler is malfunctioning, of course you should fix it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Print Spooler Service is working okay and the Description display contents are merely annoying (I think it would annoy me) somehow the Description got changed, so change it back. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It could have been from an old malicious software infection, some added/deleted printer, etc. There is no reason to mess with that information though, but who knows what software has been installed on machines these days. &nbsp;If your system is on a network,
 who knows what might have happened.</p>
<p>Before making any changes to your registry by hand or with third party tools, be sure to make a backup of the registry first.</p>
<p>There is no undo or quit without saving option in regedit.</p>
<p>Here is a link to a popular registry backup tool:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a></p>
<p>After backing up take a look at the Print Spool Service in your registry:<br />
</p>
<p>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:</p>
<p>regedit</p>
<p>Click OK to open the Registry Editor.</p>
<p>Navigate to where the Services are, which would be here:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</p>
<p>Then locate and select (highlight) the Spooler Service which would be here:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Spooler</p>
<p>In the right hand side pane, double click the Description value and change it to say whatever you want (or use the default words).</p>
<p>Exit the Registry Editor.</p>
<p>In this case, the effect of this registry edit is immediate and no restart is required, but restart anyway to be sure the changes "stick".</p>
<p>Just because Norton ran clean doesn't mean your system is not infected. &nbsp;It just means that Norton didn't find anything it knows about.</p>
<p>Not all scanning softwares know about everything, so it is prudent to use more than one.</p>
<p>If you suspect your system may have a malicious software infection, I would also do this:</p>
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>

            What is "almost the same problem" and when you try to add a network printer does it say "it can't connect" or does it really say something different?<br />
<br />
If your Print Spooler Service is just totally afflicted, you may save alot of time if you reinstall the Print Spooler Service Service to get a fresh start on it.<br />
<br />
Here is how to do that:<br />
<br />
Before making any changes to your registry, back up the registry with this popular free tool:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a><br />
<br />
You may also manually create a System Restore point before starting.<br />
<br />
Reinstall the missing Print Spooler Service by creating a registry file that you can import into your system (tested on Service Pack 3).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you already have a registry entry for the Print Spooler Service, you may want to export it to a file and save it.&nbsp; The following example is the generic registry code from a working XP Pro Service Pack 3 system.<br />
<br />
Open notepad to create a new text file by clicking Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
notepad<br />
<br />
Copy and paste the following lines of bold text into the new notepad file:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Save the new text file with a .reg extension to your desktop or a folder with a name you can remember, something like:<br />
<br />
<br />
After saving the file, close notepad.<br />
<br />
Locate the addspooler.reg file on your desktop and double click it.&nbsp; If you have 'Hide extensions for known file types' enabled, you may only see the file listed as 'addspooler' without the .reg extension (that is okay).<br />
<br />
If you could click the file and the file opens in something like Notepad or WordPad, you need to start over and this time right click the file and choose 'Open With...&nbsp; Registry Editor' and then import the file.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can right click the addspooler.reg file, choose Open With... and select the Registry Editor which will then import the file.<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative to the question... are you sure you want to add the information to the registry?<br />
<br />
You should then see a message that the information was successfully entered into the registry.<br />
<br />
I would reboot at this point to make sure the updates "stick".<br />
<br />
Now you should see the Print Spooler Service and you can right click it, choose Properties and (if it is not already) set the Startup type to Automatic and start the service if it is not already running after the reboot.<br />

            The aspect ratio (relationship of horizontal to vertical) <br />
of a 5 x 7 is different than an 8 x 10. <br />
<br />
The solution would be to Crop the 5 x 7 with an 8 x 10 <br />
template.<br />
<br />
You will lose some of the photo but at least the result <br />
will not be distorted.<br />
<br />
Windows Live Photo Gallery has a crop tool that has <br />
an 8 x 10 template. <br />
<br />
First...you may want to create a copy of the photo for <br />
editing...then you will have both sizes.<br />
<br />
In Windows Live Photo Gallery...Select (highlight )<br />
the photo you wish to crop...<br />
<br />
Go to...Fix (on the toolbar) / Crop Photo...<br />
<br />
Choose A Proportion...8x10<br />
<br />
Place your pointer on the selection frame and it will<br />
become a 4 way arrow...now you can left click/drag<br />
the selection frame to the position required...<br />
<br />
Resize the selection frame as required by left click/<br />
dragging the corner handles...<br />
<br />
When you are satisfied with the selection...left click<br />
the 'Apply' button...<br />
<br />
The cropped version of the photo will be auto-saved<br />
and can be reverted to the original by re-opening it in<br />
the editing screen and left clicking Undo at the bottom<br />
of the Edit Pane.<br />

<span><strong>Acer&nbsp;eRecovery Facts</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>At the Acer splash screen, you can press Alt and F10 (at the same time you would press F2 to enter the BIOS) to bring up a DOS style version of eRecovery.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The unit is able to reload Windows from this mode faster then from CD.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The password by default is 000000 (6 zeros) and it is displayed when you are asked for the password.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Users are able to change the password in this mode for eRecovery only.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The system can recover from the hidden image on the hard drive (PQService partition) or from CD/DVD media.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>It is possible to reload from the factory style CDs/DVD or the snapshots that the Windows version of eRecovery creates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>In Windows there is 3 ways to access the eRecovery feature.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press Alt and F10 </span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Acer eManager and then double click eRecovery.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When a system is new it should automatically open this application and prompt you to make the recovery media.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>The Windows version of the eRecovery program is more robust then the Dos Version. Listed below are the different features of the Windows version:</span></p>
<p><span>Recovery Settings: Create backup files and Change Password</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Backup snapshot image (create a disc image of your system's current configuration)</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>The system is able to make a CD/DVD image of the current state of the notebooks software including customer installed programs.</span></p>

<h2>            USB Mouse and Keyboard suddenly stopped working</h2>
                    <p>While working this morning (2/20/2018), my USB keyboard &amp; mouse stopped working (running Windows 10 with all business-channel updates installed).</p>
<p>All other USB devices (drives, printers, iPod, hubs, USB 3.0 devices/hubs, etc) work fine; it is only USB HID devices. I can RDC in with no problem.</p>
<p>I have (not necessarily in this order):</p>
<p>Tried updating driver in Device Manager</p>
<p>Tried uninstalling driver in Device manager</p>
<p>Tried running Windows 10 troubleshooters</p>
<p>Tried updating Windows (there weren't any updates available)</p>
<p>Unplugged all USB devices but those in question</p>
<p>Tried running all updated installers for the motherboard in question.</p>
<p>Tried running SFC</p>
<p>Tried running DISM</p>
<p>Restored to a system restore point back when everything worked.</p>
<p>Tried Repair options with a Windows Repair flash drive short of Resetting Windows.</p>
<p>Tried staring in safe mode</p>
<p>Tried starting with only Windows services running</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS/2 mouse and keyboard do work; however, the motherboard only has one PS/2 input, and my Y cable doesn't seem to work</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard &amp; mouse in question work fine when plugged into other (fully up to date) Windows computers. They also work on the computer in question when interacting with the computer's BIOS settings. They work fine if booting the computer up with another
 drive or a Windows repair USB stick.They work fine in the computer in question up until the Windows 10 logo appears during startup, at which point the mouse/keyboard lights/LEDs/laser go dark. Other keyboards and mice (that work on other computers) do not
 work on the computer in question (except, as noted, when interacting with the BIOS or starting up with a different drive).&nbsp;Ergo, it is not a hardware issue, it is a driver issue with that particular installation of Windows that Windows built-in tools are not
 sufficiently self aware to detect and repair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I imagine a Windows RESET would work; however, I am reluctant to try that as I have a LOT of software with a LOT of customized settings (and customized Windows settings) which I DO NOT wish to spend weeks reinstalling &amp; resetting. And anyway, there ought
 to be a way to repair Windows without needing to reinstall everything. Or to copy settings and installed programs from one setup to another (like Win7 Easy Transfer, RIP).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a command line method of reinstalling only the HID USB drivers?</p>

            This seems to be the result of recent cumulative updates. Here is what you can do.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Perform a repair upgrade:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click Command Prompt (Admin)
<br />
<br />Confirm the drive letter for the Windows image. Usually D: –&gt; dir d:
<br />
<br />    Run the following to view the installed packages which will also show a date of install.
<br />
<br />    Dism /Image:D:\ /Get-Packages
<br />
<br />    Find the package(s) that were just installed by date. Run the following command on the last installed package:
<br />
<br />    example: dism.exe /image:d:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_KB4014329~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.1.0
<br />
<br />    Reboot.

    <title>Windows Hello PIN is a security risk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harold e1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Hello PIN is a security risk</h2>
                    <p><span>First of all, I love using facial recognition to sign on.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, Windows Hello has a security weakness you can drive a truck through. If the facial recognition does not work, you can just sign in and take over the machine with a numeric PIN. A PIN is nothing more than a password, only weaker:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span>It only takes numbers. Every website I have ever been to that tells people how to have secure passwords emphasizes the importance of a variety of characters: digits, letters – both lowercase and uppercase, and special characters.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span>Another well-known suggestion for improving the quality of passwords is that they be long. It is much more difficult to remember a long string of numbers than it is an equally long alphanumeric sequence, for which a user can
 come up with some kind of mnemonic. So, what is an ordinary human being likely to do? Write down their long PIN, which is the very worst kind of security.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please allow me to at least use a password as my backup Windows Hello sign-on method.</span></p>

            Thank you for your response.<br />
<br />
I agree that a device specific PIN has security advantages over an account based password.<br />
<br />
However, that is not what I was talking about. I think it is still absurd that the device specific PIN has to be numeric only, as opposed to alphanumeric. Yes, in that case Microsoft will need to give it a different name than PIN. That is a small price to pay
 for improved security.

<h2>            Where can I get a new Windows 7 product key&#63;</h2>
                    So I had an issue with my pc which resulted in my Windows 7 expiring, I can still use my pc but the background on my desktop is completely black and it says "this copy of windows is not genuine" in the corner. I have logged in and sought to resolve the
 issue online to get a new product key but every time I try it keeps coming up with an invalid address or a page to upgrade to windows 10

<p>It's highly likely that you do NOT have to reinstall Windows or buy a new copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way to deal with "this copy of windows is not genuine" messages that appear on a system that you know was previously properly licensed (e.g., you bought the computer with Windows pre-installed by the computer's manufacturer) is to download and run Microsoft's
 "Microsoft Genuine Advantage Diagnostic" tool (MGADiag.exe) and then post the results of that diagnosis in a forum where experts can analyze it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download:&nbsp; <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the tool.&nbsp; When done, the "Continue" button will change to "Copy."&nbsp; Click the "Copy" button and Paste the results into a new question.&nbsp; Do
<strong>NOT </strong>include your actual Product Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Post in one of the following locations and use a Subject such as "Windows 7 Not Genuine - MGADiag Report Included" (I recommend that you NOT add on to this post; there are too many replies already to attract the attention of someone who can analyze your

                    <p>Windows 10 sometimes show my user account, but most of the time i get Other User. How can i fix it? I would like it to show my user account all the time not on and off. I can manually type my username and password to logon to Windows after clicking on Other
 User, but i would prefer Windows to show my username after i press CTRL + ALT + DEL, not Other User.</p>
<p>What settings do i have to fix/change?</p>

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several options that you can do to troubleshoot your <strong>iCloud </strong>
issue. We suggest that you follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Uninstall and reinstall <strong>iCloud</strong>.</li><li>Make sure that your <strong>iCloud </strong>app is enabled to both your iOS devices and to your Windows 10 PC.</li><li>Open iCloud to check if the <strong>Photo Options window</strong> will pop-up.</li><li>If not, create a new user profile named Test and open <strong>iCloud </strong>
from there.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have questions, feel free to post them on this thread.</p>

<h3> captnlen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Win7 with file not deleting</h2>
                    <p>Have posted previous questions and made some progress but when shutting down I still get a screen unable to close a program .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doing %temp% came up with one listing that won't delete because is open and can't figure out to close it.</p>
<p>Think this may be my underlying problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is FXSAPIDeBugLogFile&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 Bytes created 10/6&nbsp; text document.&nbsp; Everytime I boot it is modified and the date modified changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have tried deleting in Safe Mode and it is still open and running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Says open in Win. Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was going to a restore point but the oldest is Oct 26th and get a warning restore points more then 60 days old may not be reliable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open to ideas.&nbsp; Hate to do a full windows reinstall and lose all my data and programs.</p>

            <p>I should have been clearler.&nbsp; When trying to shut down the computer.&nbsp; We get a window that says trying to close&nbsp; a file orprogram.&nbsp; click here to force closing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In System manager nothing shows in spplications.&nbsp; We show 9 % CPU and 98% Ram usage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire system has simply slowed down tremendously in last 2 months </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playing a movie ( not streaming but from a AVI file) will stop and start like buffering but it never used too.&nbsp; Shut down is a long process thanks to the above situation.&nbsp; The entire computer is slow.&nbsp; trying a shortcut to a file or program is slower then
 on my old 3.1 win computer 20 years ago and this is a 2 GB ram, double core CPU unit.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something is eating resources and this is the only thing I can find that is not right.</p>

            <p><strong><em>We get a window that says trying to close a file orprogram. click here to force closing.</em></strong></p>
<p>I did understand. I do not believe in forcing closure. The Applications tab is the first place to check. If nothing is named there it can be security software or malware. There may be other things but these are the two most obvious things that do not appear
 as running application in Task Manager.</p>
<p>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</p>
<p>Boot the computer to safe mode with networking and download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only), update definitions and run in safe mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans. Run Disk cleanUp or cCleaner
 first.<br />

<p>What security software are you using? Some are heavier on resources than others.</p>
<p>When things are slow how does memory usage compare to installed RAM? What is the size of your C partition and how much free disk does the partition have?</p>

            <p>1.9. When you open cCleaner you will see four large icons to the left of the window. These are Cleaner, Registry, Tools, and Options. For routine maintenance you would normally access Cleaner (this is not the Registry Cleaner mentioned later). When using
 for the first time you can just accept the default settings. </p>
<p>1.10. Some comments on settings. On my computer I do not have boxes before Saved Passwords selected. In a less secure environment you might check this option and set cCleaner to automatically run on starting the computer. You may also not want to check boxes
 before Start Menu Shortcuts, Desktop Shortcuts and Autocomplete Form History. You need to check the boxes to suit your requirements. Getting options wrong first time causes irritants not disasters.</p>
<p>1.11. The second icon you see when you open cCleaner is Registry. One reservation many experienced users have regarding cCleaner is that it comes with a Registry Cleaner. This tool should not be used. Using a Registry Cleaner, however good it is, provides
 negligible benefits and there is always the risk of creating insoluble system errors, which can only be resolved by reinstalling the operating system and all that entails. You avoid any possible problems by not clicking on the Registry icon.</p>
<p>1.12 The third icon you see when you open cCleaner is Tools. If you click on this icon it gives you access to further routine maintenance options. The first two tools are Uninstall and Startup. I do not use these Tools, preferring to use other software options.
 The third Tool is System Restore, which is covered in the next paragraph. The fourth tool is Drive Wiper and you will find comments on this Tool later</p>
<p>1.13 Removing System Restore points can be important if you have limited free disk space. The ability to remove them is one of the Tools options. You can selectively remove those created at less important times. This makes it easier to hold restore points
 for longer periods without retaining large unwanted files, which the inflexible approach adopted by Disk CleanUp fails to offer.
</p>
<p>1.14. You cannot remove the latest restore point using Disk CleanUp or cCleaner. If the latest restore point contains malware you can turn off and then turn system restore back on. This has the disadvantage that all restore points are removed when you may
 wish to retain older restore points that are not infected. The way to get round this problem is to create a new restore point when you are satisfied your computer is free of malware and then remove the infected restore point.</p>
<p>1.15. In normal circumstances you most likely will rarely need to use Driver Wiper. However, there are some situations like if you were giving the computer to someone else, then the Tool might be useful. Please note that Drive Wiper, when opened, generates
 a warning message, which should not be dismissed lightly. Using Drive Wiper for the wrong reason could have serious consequences!</p>
<p>1.16. The fourth icon is labelled Options. A lot of configuration options are available there. You can set cCleaner to run when you boot but remember this will slow the boot. Another setting enables you to include / exclude cookies. Yet another enables named
 files to be excluded.</p>

            <p>Well this is getting worse</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran disk cleanup and ccleaner</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That file is still there and won't delete &lt;BG&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Got a couple of other things.&nbsp; It showed a McAfee entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't find any trace in ad/remove in control panel</p>
<p>but ran a regedit find and got a bunch of listings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last to show up were in Legacy MFEAAPFK / 0000 and MFEAVFK / 0000</p>
<p>there is a list of 6-8 lines that are McAfee.&nbsp; Get a warning when try to delete so haven't yet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a bunch of single entries MFEWFPK </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NLFK</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think I should delete all these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCleaner also showed Windows Defender.&nbsp; I was under the impression the MSE replaced defender when installed but if these two Antivirus programs have left stuff in play could be part of problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did a regedit find for defender and found a bunch of registry entries for it too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I delete all entries for both of these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way have 237GB free space on HDD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
