<h2>            Can&#39;t View Sub-Folders on Outlook.com</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have created a folder in my email account a while back with several subfolders for my personal use to store emails of related subject matter. This is very important to me so I have been using my Microsoft Office Outlook 2010 desktop application to export
 a copy of the emails to a .PST file as a back up precaution.<br />
<br />
However, my last back up was a while ago and there was a new email I received. I put it in one of the sub-folders a couple of days ago and just today I noticed that I cannot view the subfolders on Outlook.com.
<br />
<br />
Take a look:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=120149&amp;d=1356225278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.techsupportforum.com%2fforums%2fattachment.php%3fattachmentid%3d120149%26amp%3bthumb%3d1%26amp%3bd%3d1356225278" /></a><br />
<br />
When I click the main folder, no sub folders appear. When I switched over to my Outlook desktop application, I can see all my subfolders.
<br />
<br />
I know what you are going to say: Just use your desktop Outlook application.<br />
<br />
The only problem is that I can't view new emails. There was an email I read already and placed it in the subfolder through the web email access, but I can't find that email anywhere in the desktop Outlook application. I used the Send/ Receive option, but no
 help. <br />
<br />
I really need that email, any suggestions? <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.techsupportforum.com%2fforums%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fnew%2fhide.gif" />

    <title>Publisher 2010 - Labels - Background colors do not print - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hoibo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher 2010 - Labels - Background colors do not print</h2>
                    <p>OK, I've set up my page of labels in Publisher 2010 using Avery 5264.&nbsp; I started off with a clear blank, no presets, no template objects, just the 6&nbsp;light blue bounding borders.&nbsp; I've set up text boxes to hold the content and included two graphic logos.&nbsp;
 These logos I've set to a transparent background color so the background shows through.&nbsp; &nbsp;I adjusted and aligned and edited then grouped these as they are perfect (what I want).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I hit the label&nbsp;background with a colored fade gradient.&nbsp; Then I grouped
 that with the text/logo elements so that the whole thing moves as one.&nbsp; The first label is set so I copy/paste it five times into 5 remaining positions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This looks great on screen.&nbsp; It also looks great in Print Preview.&nbsp; Go to Print and all I get is the text/logo "layer" on all 6 labels but no background colors on any of them.&nbsp; Just white.&nbsp; I took another downloaded template of a different sort and test
 printed it.&nbsp; The background here prints perfectly (so it's not some printer driver or settings issue).&nbsp; I selected everything on one label, and hit "Send to Back" then "Send to Front" - no help.&nbsp; &nbsp;I took a small rectangle element from this test template and
 pasted it into one of the&nbsp;labels.&nbsp; Print.&nbsp; I see this rectangle nicely prints.&nbsp; But my background fades are still absent.&nbsp; Then I took this label set and Saved As a .pdf.&nbsp; It prints perfectly - as a .pdf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a clue perhaps.&nbsp; When I pulled up and downloaded&nbsp;the test template, I noticed that Publisher only shows me a single panel to work with, edit and so forth.&nbsp; However when I go to Print that, Publisher displays all six labels in Print Preview.&nbsp; Then
 the question becomes:&nbsp; Have I basically started mine out incorrectly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I want to understand why my orig Publisher document refuses to print my background colors on these labels.&nbsp; What am I missing???</p>

            <p>Sometimes Publisher chokes when it comes to using a gradient background. Try a solid background and see if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something else to try&nbsp;if you want to use the gradient -&nbsp;After grouping the background and logos, save the group as a picture (.png would be my first choice) (right click and save as)&nbsp;and then insert this new picture instead of the grouped elements. Sometimes
 this approach works around the limitations of using a gradient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally if you are doing a mail merge to labels then you start with a one label publication and print multiple labels to each page or sheet of labels. If you are printing the labels manually then you can create multiple labels on the publication to match
 the size of the page and the number of the labels. Neither approach should affect the printing the color background.</p>

<h2>            How to add automatic colored arrows in Excel graphs &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to add automatic arrows in my excel graphs. currently i have to place them manually. If a certain graph is higher that the other number then the arrow will be green or if lower then it will be red. It also displays a variance in percentage format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there a way to add arrows automatically insert of adding them manually. and if there is a colored arrow option that will be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>below is an example:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6d6852f-02f9-47cd-a931-697d30424b98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6d6852f-02f9-47cd-a931-697d30424b98" /></a></p>
<p>if there is any solution to this please get back at your earliest.</p>
<p>these arrow adding takes up most of the time during the making of the presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry, but such specialised individual arrows cannot be created with Excel charts out of the box. You'd need to do some substantial VBA programming to work out the difference between the columns, the direction of the arrow, the length of the vertical arrow
 part, the label, and all that. It is also quite counter-intuitive how the arrow between the last two columns seems to go in a reverse direction. That is not good data visualisation. The reader of the chart will be confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to consider a Waterfall chart type to illustrate wins and losses from one column to the next. A waterfall chart is a lot easier to read than these columns with ambiguous arrows pointing in different directions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are comparing budget vs. actual, just use a simple clustered column chart. Trust me, the reader of the chart will be able to see if the actual is higher or lower than the budget. You can add labels to highlight the magnitude of the change.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That will be way more efficient than these four seemingly equal columns, which appear in a confusing order (target - actual - actual - target) That is NOT good data visualisation. You make it HARD for the reader to understand what's going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to make it EASY for the reader of your chart. If you need help with that, get a book by Stephen Few, eg. Now You See It, Show Me The Numbers, Information Dashboard Design, Signal and more. Google Stephen Few.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            1208 top frame symbols</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Nokia 1208, bought about a month ago, its working perfectly, except for the font size on SMS's, but thats ok. What bothers me is that, until today, I knew what all the little symbols that appear on the top side of the screen mean (little key when
 its locked, a bell when the alarm is set, envelope for new message), but today a new icon appeared there, and I don't know what it means, or whether its important, or how to make it go away...</p>
<p>It is shaped like a <span>horizontal B --&gt; (_)_(_) &lt;-- kinda like that</span>, but the circles are really really close to each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know what does it stand for? Any help appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Emails headers have multple issues when trying to select all or copy and paste losing formatting</h2>
                    <p>Since the new outlook.com upgrade I can no longer report spam do to the bugs in view source pane ( QA must have taken the day off or be working with spammers?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Select and open a email</p>
<p>2. Click in the view email source pane</p>
<p>3. Select All via right mouse click or keyboard</p>
<p>&gt; The main body of the document and the email pane are now both highlighted ( This is WRONG, the focus should have been on the email source pane only )</p>
<p>5. Click at the top of the view source pane in front of the starting text</p>
<p>6. Drag select a few inches or even move the mouse a tad in the email source pane text</p>
<p>&gt; You now have some view source selected, how much well how knows, if you try to scroll it deselects</p>
<p>7. So start from the bottom and drag select upward and then use the keyboard to Copy the email header source ( don't right click or the selection goes away. )</p>
<p>8. Paste in a text or new email document</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt; The email source has now lost it's formatting and appears as one long line or text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think that MS is on top of spam, phishing and other sneaky stuff, but it has now **** down it's users from viewing the email header source and this needs to be FIXED ASAP and QA should be asked WHY this isn't working or why Dev haven't fixed it,
 yea it's really a top pri to many users and this new upgrade that we all dislike since issues like this are just hanging around.</p>

<h2>            Micro B charger cable for CK-100</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a CK-100 car kit and trying to find a replacement/upgrade charge cable (CA-134) with a USB micro B connector instead of the 2mm that is fitted.&nbsp; The user/installation guide mentions that an alternative USB cable may be supplied but all searches&nbsp;have
 failed to find one.&nbsp; The alternative is to make up a cable RJ45 at the CK end, I can buzz it out but does anyone have the pin out for the RJ45?&nbsp; I've tried the CA-146 adapter and to be honest it's naff -&nbsp;it runs hot and the output is reduced to the point that
 whilst running my satnav app the phone will discharge&nbsp;faster than&nbsp;it can be charged, I've also tried the adapter on a standard car charger with the same results.</p>

            connect your mobile phone over usb cable, and select "data transfer mode" (not pc suite sync). bluetooth will not work, as that is default pc suite sync-mode.<br />
when windows detected your memory card successfuly (you will see the card under "My Computer", start rote66sync software and it will work.<br />
slightly faster is by putting the memorycard into a cardreader, also let it detect the card, and then start route66sync.

            read my answer just below. if you are even unable to read what people answer.... i saw that you did not read my answer, as you say about connectiong by bluetooth. sorry, but that is ridiculous now.<br />
if usb-cable data transfer does not connect, reinstall the drivers for the usb-cable you got with your mobile phone (dont use another one, even if it fits into the usb-connecton in nokia 6110 navigator!). if windows does not conenct it, there is something wrong
 with your windows installation/drivers. if windows finds it, route66 will also detect it.<br />
make sure memory card is in the phone!

            good it works now for you. i guess there was a minor bug, might have fixed itself after a reboot, or some kind of an update (microsoft windows update or route66snyc software update...you never know).

<h2>            E61 - Problems with Copy&#43;Paste</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
the Copy-Paste-feature on the E61 is something very practical. Only, it doesn´t seem to work so well between applications.<br />
I just tried - in vain - to copy a number from a text message to a note - seemingly very simple. I opened both the note and the text message at the same time and pressed that Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V combos, but that didn´t work.<br />
Any ideas, anyone?<br />
Thank you very much!<br />
Best regards,<br />

</p><p>Neither Outlook.com, nor the new outlook mail support custom domains.&nbsp; Microsoft stopped support for the back in 2014.&nbsp; The only products that support custom domains are MIcrosofts paid produce (MS Office Outlook &amp; Outlook Premium)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing anyone can do for you.&nbsp; You should either migrate to one of MS paid products or your own Hosts domain support.</p>

    <title>Internet Explorer 11 crashes when attempting to view a TFS &#40;team - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garyk5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 crashes when attempting to view a TFS &#40;team file share&#41; discussion section</h2>
                    <p>Our company uses TFS rather extensively, as part of our business management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been using it without problems up until recently.&nbsp; I have no idea what has changed, as I made no explicit change to Internet Explorer 11, but here is the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the link for a project discussion page (which would list whatever discussions are already logged for a given project), this message is thrown:&nbsp; "<strong>Internet Explorer 11 has stopped working</strong>.&nbsp; A problem caused the program to stop
 working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available."&nbsp; This happens for ALL discussion list pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on "<strong>Close program</strong>" and IE 11 attempts to close, but ends up throwing the same error again. I have to force close the tab in order to get the crash-loop to stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete all cache.</li><li>Go to "Advanced" and do a "Reset" and reboot.</li><li>Go to Turn Windows Features On or Off, unselect "Internet Explorer 11", reboot, then select IE 11 again.</li></ol>
<p>Windows OS: 8.1</p>
<p>Internet Explorer: 11.0.9600.18231</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot fix the problem.&nbsp; I am being prevented from doing my job duties with my primary computer, as I cannot make entries in the Discussions sections of any TFS project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My home computer does NOT run into this problem. It is running a slightly older version of Internet Explorer 11, version&nbsp;11.0.9600.18161.&nbsp; Is there a specific update that might be causing this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at my wit's end.&nbsp; This is the most perplexing problem I've seen happen with Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Any advice on how to proceed?</p>

            <p>I managed to find some advice about running IE without any extensions active.</p>
<p>So I ran "iexplore.exe" -extoff</p>
<p>
</p><p>NO CRASH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it appears that there is some extension causing the problem. I guess I'll have to try disabling them one by one to see which one is causing the problem.</p>

    <title>No-Width Optional Break - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kiminyme  say:</h3>
<h2>            No-Width Optional Break</h2>
                    I would like to know how to insert a No-Width Optional Break in Word 2016 for Mac. I use this frequently for long strings (like URLs and code snippets) to control where the string can break logically, rather having Word break the string simply because
 there is not enough room for the string on the current line. It appears in the Insert Symbol menu in Word 2016 for Windows, but I can't find it in the Mac version I use for work.

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the above worked for me just now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did, however, find an alternative ... by adding the "Zero Width Space" following my solidus. Word now breaks properly after the solidus when my line is too long to accommodate both of the words joined by the forward slash. Find it as below in my screenshot:
 (search 'space')</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d7442085-7906-4de2-a176-bebc33b96825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d7442085-7906-4de2-a176-bebc33b96825" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I noted that there are also three "joiner" characters (zero width non-joiner; zero width joiner; word joiner) available that I thought initially might help; however, not so much in my quick trial in a document context just now. (Admittedly, I haven't the
 time to look up or test methodically at present, so I could be wrong about their usefulness in this context.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meantime, the zero width space seems a good solution on my Mac anyway (Sierra 10.12.6), working in Word (15.37).</p>
<p>

    <title>Moving local notebook on dropbox to OneNote windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noideawhatisgoingon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving local notebook on dropbox to OneNote windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a Surface 4 Pro with Win10. Previously, I was using OneNote 2013 and used some onenote 2010 files that were on DropBox. However, with OneNote that came on my windows 10 machine, it doesn't seem to allow my the option to import my local
 onenote notebook on dropbox. If I go inside of OneNote win10, click on the three lines and then "More Notebooks...", it only allows me to import from OneNote that is associated with my OneNote account (I'm not even quite sure how to add new onenote files to
 this account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is it possible to use OneNote 2013 instead of the default windows 10 version? It contains more functionality and has much smaller icons.</p>

            <p>First, its absolutely not a good idea to put OneNote files in Dropbox (yes, I know, "but it worked...." :)) It
<em>seems</em>&nbsp;to work well if you just access those notebooks from one system at a time and do not make any changes from different devices. Sync errors and duplicate sections will be the result in many cases. Its has to do with the internal sync mechanisms
 which are designed to work with OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your problem: Yes, the OneNote Universal App which is automatically installed with Windows 10 can just open notebooks stored on OneDrive. The same limitation applies to 7 of the 8 actual OneNote versions (Mac, iOS, Android, Web, WP 8/10, OneNote 2016
 Free, Universal App)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you may use OneNote 2013 or 2016 instead (the one which installs with MS Office, NOT the free version from www.onenote.com!). This coexists with the Win 10 Universal App which you may completely ignore if you want (although its much more Surface-friendly
 in my opinion).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just look in your Start Menu ("All Apps") for "OneNote 2013" or "OneNote 2016". The Universal App is just called "OneNote".</p>

            <p>I have office 2010, so I don't have 2013 available. I'm not sure what happened to my 2010 copy of onenote as the rest of my office products (excel, word, etc) are installed. How do I get to install onenote 2013?</p>

</p><p>On a side note, how can I upload my onenote notebooks to onedrive? Where would I store the file so that onenote universal app can recognize it and open it?</p>

<h2>            An Idea for Thought</h2>
                    <p>There’s no teaser other than creating a new market that could prove extremely valuable.&nbsp; With the advancement of radio-frequency identification chips (“RFID”), wireless frequency networks (“WiFi”), and artificial intelligence (“AI”), why not create a new
 product that is low cost to manufacture that can be sold in a service model?&nbsp; The following ideas warrant consideration.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Key Components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Phone
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Lumia 640 (for example)
<ul>
<li>$129.99</li><li>Specs

<li>(Assumed already deployed)</li></ul>
</li><li>Servers
<ul>
<li>(Assumed already deployed)</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Many, or at least, some of us have had the opportunity to use a dated barcode scanner to handle inventory.&nbsp; Whether it is to search for the location of inventory in the store, identify inventory in question, or search for key logistics information such as
 amount of inventory on hand etc., that model although efficient, could use an upgrade.&nbsp; So here are the ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, let us start with converting the standalone inventory reader into a multipurpose visually attractive slim but strong device
<strong>that can also <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">serve as a phone</span></strong>.&nbsp; Microsoft Lumia 640 is the solution.&nbsp; Microsoft Lumia 640 has an effective 8.0 MP camera that already has applications designed to read barcodes.&nbsp; Microsoft Lumia
 640 is also a phone, which makes productive communication between employees more timely and effective.&nbsp; In addition, Microsoft Lumia 640 has built-in Wi-Fi WLAN IEEE 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, and USB 2.0 and a few other features that will later be more
 optimally utilized.&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Now, as a counter argument one might ask would there be a requirement for a phone service subscription?&nbsp; The answer is no.&nbsp; That is of course unless 3G or 4G proprietary network connectivity is desired.&nbsp; Microsoft enables entities
 to purchase the phone at low cost and out of contract.&nbsp; Assuming the working areas have strong WiFi routers throughout the complex with reasonable to strong signals, existing applications or proprietary applications can be designed through the Windows Store
 to enable VPN secured VOIP and other forms of secured communication for relatively inexpensively.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p>Second, integrate Microsoft HoloLens with Microsoft Lumia 640.&nbsp; This will be a special derivative of Microsoft HoloLens with an inventory management focus.&nbsp; Here is a list of optional components.&nbsp; First, there could be cameras to monitor approved activity
 or take pictures to improve communication.&nbsp; Second, the Microsoft HoloLens could come with a specially designed microphone and earpiece that will enable users to communicate with Cortana (the AI of Windows Phone) hands free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the ideal component for this special derivative of Microsoft HoloLens are one RIFD sensor at the exterior edge of each side of the eye ware.&nbsp; Microsoft would design proprietary software that would use these sensors to illuminate the smart glasses
 with increasing intensity and precision that will help users to quickly locate inventory RFID chips.&nbsp; The Windows Phone would emit a signal for the sought product whereas the Microsoft HoloLens would be on the receiving end of the ping, whereas the Windows
 Phone would nearly instantly process and guide the user, with an understanding of depth and triangulation, to the desired goal, which would be clearly visible through the use of the Windows HoloLens.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
Here is where things get interesting and intertwined.&nbsp; So Microsoft HoloLens is designed with projection technology to project over objects.&nbsp; So for an illustrative example of an application this passage will provide a detailed example.&nbsp; There is this cool
 employee named Jone Doe that works at a growing, tech-savvy company.&nbsp; He is looking for a product called Widget 987.&nbsp; He’s new to the job and honestly has no clue where it is.&nbsp; His boss expects productivity and John does not want to waste his time or his employer’s
 time either.&nbsp; That’s why he uses the Windows Phone.&nbsp; He has a couple of options.&nbsp; He could use Cortana to search for the product that he knows he is looking for or he could issue a voice command.&nbsp; Scenario 1 – the visual or touch learner.&nbsp; While using Cortana
 on Windows Phone while trying to search for inventory Cortana will automatically provide recommendations as each character is typed for product inventory.&nbsp; There would be a duel input screen for UPC or actual product name.&nbsp; Once one input field is completely
 filled then the other would automatically be filled and a picture example would appear on the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; There would be a prompt asking the user if this was the product they were looking for and if the user selects yes then the app would proceed to provide
 detailed information about the product.&nbsp; Conversely, it would provide the user to scroll through pictures and products with similar UPCs or product name spellings unless another search is conducted.&nbsp; Scenario 2 – the audio or visual learner.&nbsp;&nbsp; John wanting
 to keep is hands free for productive use while multitasking issues Cortana a smart command.&nbsp; He could ask a prompt question such as “Cortana, where is Widget 987?”&nbsp; Cortana would prompt a semi-transparent holograph in the Microsoft HoloLens where the user
 would confirm or reject the recommendation.&nbsp; When the desired product is found, in a predefined corner of the Microsoft HoloLens there would be an output field describing the location of Widget 987 that led to the right area of the building in the right row
 in the right section on the right shelf like traditional scanners but more hands free, and visually and actually smarter.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
Taking a moment, Cortana needs to be briefly addressed in more detail.&nbsp; Each employee would need to log into their Windows Phone.&nbsp; As each employee uses the phone, Cortana will provide increasingly optimized recommendations for their close proximity functions.&nbsp;
 This means that as she develops an understanding of the voice style and ways of thinking for the user, as she becomes more adaptive, will confirm the inventory less frequently for highly certain queries and skip right to the result screen with the detailed
 product information commonly seeked also supplemented with an image.&nbsp; This will be done mostly hands free with voice and or eye command.&nbsp; However, it should be noted that Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 could be used interchangeably or simultaneously.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
Returning to John's world. . .&nbsp; He asks for the status for Widget 987.&nbsp; She, Cortana, provides him with a visual and or audio response that only he can see and or hear.&nbsp; She states that she believes there is no inventory on the sales floor and she recommends
 John to get more inventory from storage.&nbsp; However, John, wanting to double check Cortana, eventually found the product shelf location with the help of Cortana’s guidance.&nbsp; He verified that the shelf was empty and issued a command.&nbsp; “Cortana, notify management
 Widget 987 shelf space empty.” Or something to a similar command.&nbsp; Cortana will submit a ticket for management review and tracking for analysis purposes.&nbsp; John adheres to Cortana’s advice and goes back to the storage area.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
It was a mess.&nbsp; He saw that there were a lot of organized boxes but he did not know where to begin looking.&nbsp; Therefore, he issued a voice command (which, could also be sent through the Windows phone via touch screen).&nbsp; “Cortana, activate smart search for Widget
 987.”&nbsp; Cortana responds something to the extent of activating smart search while the vision of the Microsoft HoloLens slightly darkens.&nbsp; Here is where the magic happens. &nbsp;The HoloLens and Windows Phone begins to actively ping and search for the target RFID
 chips.&nbsp; The Windows Phone will send enough power to enable the HoloLens RFID receptors to receive a passive response from the chips.&nbsp; Although at first the ping was very soft, at the option of the user the sound feature could be disabled, as John followed
 the direction of the pings the pings became more rapid like in the video games he plays and then, at a color of his choosing, the lens smartly projects in the screen with increasing intensity the direction and eventually the object that he sought.&nbsp; The best
 way to describe this is as a high tech way of playing Marco Polo but with audio and
<strong>visual</strong> guidance to find the target RFID chip.&nbsp; Wow, this saves a lot of time and improves productivity!</p>
<p>This is the tip of the ice burg for integrating Windows Phone with Microsoft HoloLens and Cortana.&nbsp; The reason why Windows Phone is recommended is because using the store app could enable it to be easily ported to a Windows desktop
 version to make personal workstations and field devices highly communicable and most importantly, in sync.&nbsp; These technologies would have a lot of tracking components that would be sent to an automatic data mining server that Cortana would know how to analyze
 and find products in the building and other tasks more efficiently and smartly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three, why not connect the inventory to the existing WiFi network?&nbsp; There are two approaches to this revolutionary idea.&nbsp; Scenario 1 assumes that only boxes has RFID chips.&nbsp; Scenario 2 assumes that each individual item has an RFID
 chip.&nbsp; Since WiFi uses radio waves like cell phones and other electronic devices, this is where the third revolution makes things really interesting.&nbsp; The entire building ceiling&nbsp; could be gridded with WiFi inventory management hotspots.&nbsp; Using proprietary&nbsp;
 technologies, WiFi radio waves can be used to quickly and effectively and safely make a detailed map of the building.&nbsp; In addition, when used in conjunction with a Windows Phone in a building mapping mode, there would be multiple ways to effectively develop
 a virtual replication of the environmental physical objects, such as product isles.&nbsp; Although this in itself can have many other valuable applications, this section seeks to focus on the inventory management application.&nbsp; Let’s assume John is back in the back
 room of the building searching for the inventory.&nbsp; Sending a WiFi signal from the phone can be taxing after awhile.&nbsp; Why not there be a smart grid that could be tapped on demand.&nbsp; For example, when John asks Cortana for where he can find more of Widget 987,
 Cortana first checks all of the local building WiFi routers using the system to search for the RFID chip in the building.&nbsp; Should the item be found, Cortana will use Microsoft HoloLens to visually and audibly direct John to the RFID chips in question using
 triangulation from multiple WiFi points.&nbsp; This reduces the problem for needing to be in close proximity of the RFID chip.&nbsp; In addition, this provides a continuous means to audit and keep track of inventory, and customers shopping or employees working in a
 warehouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where this idea can, in time, go to the ideal level where every product will have a chip.&nbsp; How much money could thousands of companies save in audit fees per year when conducting a physical inventory?&nbsp; Now, of course there
 would be a few skeptics of technology.&nbsp; First, the RFID chips would have to be implanted in each product where it requires &nbsp;the employee to &nbsp;then intentionally and cleverly modify.&nbsp; Second, there would still need to be a quick, but more efficient audit, to
 find unusual activity, etc. to fight fraud.&nbsp; This could provide strong substantiating and highly credible evidence of inventory on the sales floor or warehouse in the correct or wrong places, but also show where additional inventory in storage is accessible.&nbsp;
 It provides for a complete store audit of physical inventory counts, without rough estimations, and it can be down on a near continuous basis.&nbsp; How much labor can be saved but receive an actual count for all inventory on the sales floor?&nbsp; Just imagine the
 potential for data analysis for inventory flows that would enable new methods for improving inventory turnover to maximize and identify the product placement of items to sell or items to store in a warehouse.&nbsp; Of course, if this technology wanted to become
 more sophisticated and detailed, there could be relay WiFi connects implanted throughout product shelves that could provide even more data to review and make smarter marketing, management, and logistic decisions.</p>
<p>The idea revolves around the idea that companies would need to subscribe to Microsoft Windows server technology to make this all possible.&nbsp; Each windows server would be well integrated with Cortana and other company servers that
 have different operating systems and data management systems, etc., where Cortana would first draw from data from these local severs to provide the confidential data analysis, where ‘data processing power’ could be acquired as a service from Microsoft, whereas
 she would reference the Microsoft databank for vocal recognition, etc.&nbsp; This is just the beginning of the inventory marketing, logistics, and management revolution.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Lumia 1520 , HERE Drive&#43;, problem with lag</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p><span><span>I have </span></span>Nokia 1520.</p>
<p>When I run HERE Drive+ and start navigation then during navigating there are continously 1second lag, the program refresh map on screen every +-1second so its looks like skipping - and there is also delay so I see information on phone +-1second after - when
 I move through i<span><span>ntersection I see it on screen precisely 1s after in "next skip".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>During navigation I turn off everything (wifi,mobile data, blutooth) but problem is still here.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Is it problem with phone? Or with HERE Drive+?<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for tips/help<br />

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Vladimir_M,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the community!&nbsp;:cattongue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does the lag issue happen with HERE Drive + only? How about with 3rd party navigation apps? Are you using HERE Drive + in online mode, or offline? Note that online mode uses internet connection to find your location, while offline navigation uses the
 phone's GPS hardware. Offline mode is more usable in open areas as there are less buildings that may block GPS signals.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try using other downloadable navigation apps and compare their performance with HERE Drive +. Make sure that all running background apps are closed while using HERE Drive +. If you're using HERE Drive + in online mode, make sure that the Wi-Fi or mobile

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
thanks for tips.<br />
<br />
1) I tried GPS CoPilot - it works fine, there is also lags but wery rare its 10x better than HERE Drive +<br />
<br />
2) I am using HERE Drive + in offline mode, lags are the same in city or in open space.<br />
<br />
3) I removed HERE Drive + (and also HERE Maps+) and then installed them back into the phone, but problem is still here.<br />
<br />
During next few days I record HERE Drive + and GPS CoPilot navigating and then I put the videos on youtube and give here link to them and you will compare how it works.<br />
<br />
Because GPS CoPilot is working, I think there is something wrong in HERE Drive + (maybe HD resolution?).<br />
<br />
Is there anybody with Lumia 1520 and non-laging HERE Drive+ ?<br />
<br />
Thank you for helping me.</p>

<h2>            Outlook email meeting invites not coming through</h2>
                    I am having some issues with Outlook meeting invitations. From some (so far) 3 people, the email invites do not come through. Then all Outlook messages get hung up on my laptop. I can receive the invites on the iPhone and if I delete them off of there,
 then my outlook email returns to normal. I have had this issue with individuals at two separate large companies (I run my own business so this is very important). Other meeting invites from other people at these same companies come through fine. And when this
 person had someone else at the company who was also invited to the meeting, forward the invite to me that came through just fine. Any ideas?

            It is a personal account. I tried to isolate what was different about these specific people - I thought maybe it had something to do with their setting up the meetings while they were working from home, which was the case in a few instances. But then we
 did a test when one person was at work and that didn't go through either.

    <title>IE stops working with proxy pac file after loss of connection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            IE stops working with proxy pac file after loss of connection</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have stumbled upon a strange issue with IE. We are using IE 10 on Win 8 PC's. Whenever we have a loss of connectivity (not layer 1) IE stops working with the PAC file. Chrome is working fine. In the same time IE can load the internal pages (ex. intranet).
 If we set a proxy (not pac) IE will work; reverting back to PAC and the issue is there. I discovered that if I disable and enable the network card interface solves the problem (if you have admin right); unplugging/plugging the ethernet cable also solves the
 problem (needs more testing, I just thought of it and tested once). This problem usually appears after connecting the PC to the network and waking up from sleep, but I can't reproduce it every time.</p>

<h2>            invited contacts not showing in family room</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp;a nokia lumia 920 and my wife&nbsp;is using a lumia 822, I have invited her to the family room for us to share calendars, notes, photo's etc. she has accepted invite but nothing shown in members, there was a message in chat from her earlier today but that
 has gone now, just a message saying, Almost ready! We're either waiting for members or still synchronising.</p>
<p>Have tried deleting room and adding a new one but still nothing. Have also noticed my wife's contact info is displaying differently.</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong or is this a windows issue? There seems to be a lot of posts with same problems.</p>

            <p>Hello Richlies,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting in the forum! As I understand your wife does not show in your Family room.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a test could you try inviting a different user to see if they show and also is it possible for your wifi to add you to a room she set up? Thank you</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please let me know if you have any further questions. </p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>
<p>Andy</p>

            <p>Just a quick update, after deleting and adding room many times finally my wife does now show in members, however, her contact details have also been duplicated in contacts, albeit without a picture assigned to contact. Also, everything syncs and updates
 in rooms, notes, pictures calendars but no chat. I am receiving&nbsp;messages from her but when I reply&nbsp;she receives nothing.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive - Account Help</h2>
                    We have several folders in our OneDrive that was set up under a Gmail&nbsp;account that Gmail&nbsp;says does not exist. How can I transfer what is in OneDrive to another OneDrive, since I cannot remember the Gmail password and Gmail says the account does not exist?

<p>Save those folders to a thumb drive if you have one. Sign into that other account on another pc so you don't sign out of the first one. upload.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that Gmail isn't the issue if its on the Microsoft Onedrive system, as it is a Onedrive password</p>
