<h3> mariajj  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2010 ODBC fail with Windows 7 32 bit machine</h2>
                    <p>My computer was upgraded to windows 7 32 bit with Office 2010.&nbsp; Also, Oracle Client 10g was installed to allow connection to my Oracle tables.&nbsp; I created an ODBC via the control panel and the connection test was successful.&nbsp; However, when I open MS Access
 2010 and select link tables using the ODBC just created via the control panel the ODBC failed.&nbsp; When I tried to create the ODBC via MS Access I get the error Non Administrator can't create ODBC.&nbsp; I pressed 'ok' but it appeared I can create the ODBC but I then
 get the&nbsp;error "SQLstate-IM004 [microsoft][odbc driver manager] driver's SQLalloc Handle on SQL_Handle_Env failed".&nbsp; I don't know how to get the ODBC to work with MS Access 2010.&nbsp; As if MS Access does not have permission to read the ODBC but I really don't
 know what the problem maybe and how to fix the problem.&nbsp; Has anyone experience this problem and have a solution they can share.&nbsp; Thanks, Maria</p>

            One thing to try is to NOT use the ODBC applet you see in the Control Panel, and instead use the one you find at &lt;root&gt;\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe. This will create a 32-bit DSN. You should then be able to use that DSN from Access. Of course you'll
 have to have the correct drivers installed, so if you don't see them listed in the Drivers list when running that applet, you'll have to download and install them to your machine.

            I'm not sure what you mean - if you create the correct type of ODBC DSN, then any user should be able to use it. You'd need to create a Machine DSN, I believe, in order for that to work.<br />

            You are correct.&nbsp; I created a machine DSN.&nbsp; I have always created a machine DSN this way any user can use it but since my PC has been upgraded to windows 7 32 bit and MS Access 2010 I can only access the ODBC via MS Access as an administrator.&nbsp; As a non
 administrator I see the ODBC when I attempt to link the tables, and I am able to select the machine DSN but the connection fails to the Oracle database. It does not fail if I run Access as an administrator.

                    As an intrigued Windows Phone 8.1 user, I have fallen in love with Cortana. One of her great features is the "remind me" calendar that shows alerts based on time, location, etc. I'd like to add this calendar/catalog to my laptop's and surface's Outlook
 to get (at least time-based) alerts on whatever device I'm currently working on. Is that possible? Anybody have an idea for how this could be done?

            <p>I was responding directly to your post. It made it look like only appointments created in Outlook (outlook.com?) were recognized by Cortana, and NOT those created in Exchange (using Microsoft Outlook). Are you saying that it does, and that I need to follow
 the Exchange forum?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side note: Microsoft really confused things by calling Outlook.com by the same name as their desktop client, which is more commonly used in an Exchange environment. Hotmail was at least less confusing!</p>

            <p>I agree with you about the names and everything else. &nbsp;Microsoft has always been really bad at branding and seems to go back on itself a lot. &nbsp;Outlook Express was another one. &nbsp;Hotmail, Live, then back to Hotmail Live, and then just Hotmail again, and then
 Outlook! &nbsp;And Windows Mobile, Windows Phone 7 Series, Windows Phone 7, and now it is going back to Windows Mobile again! &nbsp;And the new Universal Modern apps for Office apps have the same names as the Office apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you find out how to get Remind Me into the Calendar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use both Outlook.com and Exchange accounts, so either would be fine for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the phone Calender settings, there is an option to select the colour for Remind Me entries, so it seems that while intended, it is a broken feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this will be resolved with Windows 10 Mobile.</p>

            Currently, as of 2015/9/13, Cortana/search reminders have been added to Windows 10's native (modern and default)
<strong>Outlook </strong>calendar application, so I'm not sure if the originator's question in that sense has been resolved. However, I am looking to have them also&nbsp;show up in
<strong>Outlook 2013</strong> (legacy desktop application) so that I don't have to switch back and forth between<strong> Outlook
</strong>(native Windows 10 modern app) and <strong>Outlook 2013 </strong>(new but legacy desktop application) to see and manage Cortana's reminders. Has someone figured out a way or is this still non-existent? I have already opened up my own&nbsp;question, but
 haven't received a response from Microsoft so I'm hoping others may have answers.

            On your Windows Phone going to your calendars app. Click the 3 bars icon. Select the reminders calendar. Make sure it's checked. And&nbsp;accept. Cortana reminders will show up. In your calendar. And on the tile.

<p>You should be able to go to open up Cortana on the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; Then go to settings and from there notifications.&nbsp; In there you should be able to find an option that allows you to connect your phone and laptop (or whatever windows 10 device your
 using assuming its compatible). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It'll walk you through some steps and send you a 6 digit (I think it was 6 numbers ) confirmation code.&nbsp; I think you'll have to turn your blue tooth on for both devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, my iPhone 6splus was able to connect with Cortana so you should be in the fast lane with a native windows phone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel autosum not working unless I click off the cell or hit enter</h2>
                    <p>Please help me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use autosum formula to calculate totals. I've just got a Surface (swapped from a Mac) and I'm using Office 365. It used to be if I deleted or changed a number, the total would automatically update. Now it will only update if I hit enter or click into another
 cell.</p>
<p><br />
I've just spent a very frustrating hour chatting to a chap from Microsoft who has told me Excel does not do this and that I must be using a macro on the other PCs/Macs I've seen doing it... (I've never used/made a macro, never mind created one by accident).&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>The formulas are set to automatic, it doesn't work in either number or general format.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<h3> lynnparsons wwfemail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access Web App&#58; Can I install multiple instances of  an App Package with the same ID in a single site collection.</h2>
                    <p>I would like to manage an Access Web App database with Development, Test and Production "instances"&nbsp; (or databases/apps) in a single site collection.&nbsp; This simplifies the management of access permissions and navigation among other things.&nbsp; I intend to take
 advantage of the ability&nbsp;publish&nbsp;changes&nbsp;to code from development instance&nbsp;(leaving production data intact) &nbsp;using the deployment/upgrade functionality of access web apps. &nbsp;I have been told this is not possible unless I install&nbsp;my Production, Development and
 Test apps into separate site collections.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I have partially succeeded in setting up multiple instance scenario that I mention&nbsp;in separate sub sites&nbsp;&nbsp;of a single site collection but I am often getting the message "A different version of this app is already installed with the same version
 number.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need to delete the app from the site and the site recycle bin to install this version.&nbsp;"&nbsp; I know for certain I have gotten&nbsp;this when I try to deploy snapshots of production in test and dev.&nbsp; &nbsp;I not only have deleted the app from the sub site
 and recycle bin but also from the 2nd stage recycle bin.&nbsp; I have found that by waiting some time (15-30 minutes) I can often succeed in installing the app package.&nbsp; But there have been occasions where it has taken more than a day.&nbsp; Setting up 3 site collections
 for one Access Web App seems overkill.&nbsp; Is my expectation of being able to manage&nbsp;3&nbsp;apps with the same&nbsp;ID&nbsp;in a single site collection not recommended</p>

            <p>Hi Lynn</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been building Access Web Apps now for 2-3 years and I am pretty certain that I have several copies of the same app in one site collection (but in different team sites). I am no sharepoint expert though - I stick to building the apps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, to set a Dev / Test / Production environment I am not sure you need to have the apps with the same ID anyway. Dev would be the source app, test could be produced using Save as New App (with data) and then production would be a locked app exported
 using the Save for Deployment option (and then Upgrading your previously deployed production app). Each of these would have their own ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also test the upgrade process before sending any upgrades to the App Store (I sell AWA apps through the Sharepoint App Store) as this can cause problems sometimes (there have been 3 occasions in the past year where the App Upgrade process was broken).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am surprised you have an app that takes a day to install - one of my apps in particular is fairly big and only takes about 10 minutes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Julian</p>

            Thank you Julian.&nbsp; My&nbsp;post was misleading.&nbsp; It does not take&nbsp;24 hours&nbsp;to install, it takes that long before I don't get the error message and the installation proceeds to success.&nbsp; The installation takes only moments when it is successful.&nbsp; I am starting
 to wonder if there is a timer job that runs once a week&nbsp;that does some clean&nbsp;up because I have now waited over 24 hours and still the same error message.

            <p>So I believe I have received a conclusive YES&nbsp;from&nbsp;Microsoft (support case) &nbsp;that you cannot add a 2nd app in the same site collection with the same App ID but now I am having problems trying to remove an app and restore an earlier&nbsp;snapshot (same ID).&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I&nbsp;believe I have confirmed that there are no duplicates of the app anywhere else in the site collection (or in any recycle bins) and I am still getting an error when trying to install the snapshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also nearly positive that&nbsp; I have on occasion &nbsp;successfully removed a web app from a site, deleted in the recycle bin and then the 2nd stage recycle bin and then I am able to restore a snapshot with the same ID but&nbsp;success seems to be intermittent.&nbsp;
 It seems almost&nbsp;as if the 2nd Stage Recycle bin is not&nbsp;always clearing right away.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I either get ""an instance of this app already exists at the specified location" or the error in the first post about a different version of the app already installed.&nbsp; Does it take some time for the clearing of the 2nd Stage Recycle Bin to complete?</p>

            <p>Lynn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you ever find a solution to this?&nbsp; I'm experiencing the same issue.&nbsp; I am trying to upload an .app snapshot and am getting the same&nbsp;error.<br />
<br />
Originally the Access Web App was under another subsite that has since been deleted.&nbsp; The recycling bin has been emptied and an administrator cleared the second stage bin as well.<br />
<br />
We are entirely in an Office 365 environment so all I have now is the .app snapshot and no ability to change the version number which seems to be the issue that I have found from searching.</p>

    <title>Build 10130 Arc Touch Mouse and App are broken - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Build 10130 Arc Touch Mouse and App are broken</h2>
                    <p>I already posted this to the Feedback hub. Still, I thought I would bring it to the attention of the insider group, and maybe get a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Arc Touch SE Bluetooth mouse. I opened the Arc Touch app to decrease the clicking sound volume, and when I adjusted the volume clicks became disabled. I can not re-enable them. Also the middle&nbsp;mouse seems to be stuck on disabled. I tried to change
 it, but the app temporarily says the mouse can not be found before resetting everything (including the disabled middle button and scroll wheel). I've un/re-installed&nbsp; the app and removed/paired the mouse but it has had no affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If you have the Arc Touch mouse you may want to avoid changing any settings for the time being.</p>
<p>2) Any ideas how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eric</p>

            <p>Interesting. Seems like newer versions of the MS Mouse and Keyboard center break this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recognizes Arc Touch BT mouse: v2.3.145 (gf's Surface)</p>
<p>Does not recognize Arc Touch BT mouse: v2.3.188 (my Yoga 2 Pro)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both on Win 10 build 10130. I have no idea where my gf got the version from and why it hasn't been updated since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps finding the correct version where you have the reset button. ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I just downgraded&nbsp;from 2.3.188 to 2.3.145 (<a href="http://www.techspot.com/drivers/driver/file/information/16503/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download)&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;on my device by uninstalling, rebooting and installing the older version. After launching the older version,
 it recognizes the mouse again! If you don't have the "restore defaults" button in the "basic settings" tab, click on "app-specific settings" first and then go back to the "basic settings" tab. Lots of veeery buggy software, which we are dealing with here...

The delay delivery thing you're seeing is just the default behavior.&nbsp; I realize it's a sort of confusing bit of UI.

            <p>I figured it out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has to be done from the device app. go to Menu at the top right, go to "Find a workout", then search for the workout you want to unsubscribe from. Select it (it should have a blue dot/star to the right of it), and after it loads, scroll to the bottom
 and end the workout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stay active!</p>

            <p>Not sure about the iPhone app, but I figured out how to remove a guided workout from "my workouts" in the Health Dashboard:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to My Workouts<br />
Go to Favourites</p>
<p>Click the workout you want to remove</p>
<p>Un-star it as a favourite. It will no longer appear in "My Workouts"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This took care of my little annoyance with a Workout Plan I didn't want; hopefully it's useful as a workaround for the iPhone peeps :)</p>

            <span>Hi Vin,<br />
<br />
It is not feasible to send emails using the aliases as the from address in Office 365. The alias can only be used to receive emails. Given the situation, I suggest you submit feedback regarding your requirement via the link below:<br />

            <p>As with any other type of mailbox, sending as alias requires workarounds. But yes, it's possible. Here's an easy to test method via PowerShell:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Where *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is the shared mailbox on which I have SendAs rights (note I'm using my credentials), and&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is the alias.</p>

<h2>            OneNote- everything highlighted in light green all of a sudden&#33; Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So as of two days ago, when I open OneNote, all my notes in the text boxes (in the body, outside of the Headers) appear as if highlighted in a light green colour. It's a little distracting and I'm not able to deselect this, as if it were a feature, in either
 'highlight' or 'background'. </p>
<p>What the fudge guys?<br />
</p>
<p>Any advice is really appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi Alice,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the reasons <strong>why you are seeing some of your notes highlighted</strong> is because
<strong>someone else worked or added a content on your notes</strong> that you have yet to review. To better assist you, we need the answers on the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you working with a <strong>shared notebook</strong>?</li><li>Does the green highlight goes away when clicking on the highlighted part of the notes?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you check the steps in this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Why-is-some-text-highlighted-in-a-shared-notebook-in-OneNote-2016-for-Windows-0480d39e-9849-4a04-9380-ab92c6252783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> to help you with this feature in <strong>OneNote</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

            In my case, every single notebook (dozens) had every page highlighted in Green. No one else worked on them, and most of them are not shared. There must be some glitch? Maybe when I logged in on my phone and updated, it thought that it was another user
 making changes on every single page? Very strange. To fix it, I had to painstakingly go through every notebook and click History/Mark as Read and uncheck "Show Unread Changes in this Notebook." I hope Microsoft looks into this problem that many of us are having
 and figures out what is going wrong. Thank you!&nbsp; --Mark

<p>This works fine when I use just the if statement...it returns the data in column A fine... then I added the AND function because I need 2 conditions met in C &amp; B..but then it only returns A1 each time (because it's false?)....the problem seems to be that
 only if EVERY cell in those 2 rows equal M$1 &amp; N$1 will the correct row in A appear. This is an array formula also...thanks for any help, -Kevin</p>

<p>You cannot use AND and OR in array formula because they process the entire array parameter.&nbsp; Two alternatives:</p>
<p>=IFERROR(INDEX($A:$A,SMALL(IF(($C$1:$C$100=M$1)*($B$1:$B$100=N$1),ROW($1:$100)),ROWS($2:2))),"")</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>=IFERROR(INDEX($A:$A,SMALL(IF($C$1:$C$100=M$1,IF($B$1:$B$100=N$1,ROW($1:$100))),ROWS($2:2))),"")</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; I have not vetted your logic to see if it is reasonable or if it can be improved, perhaps avoiding the AND operation altogether.</p>

<h2>            Search Folder not working</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook 2013 full client connecting to an Exchange server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a search folder called "Inbox-Uncategorized" with the Criteria (under the Advanced tab of the search folder criteria) of "Categories is empty." &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the "Mail from these folders will be included in this search" I have my inbox selected, with "search subfolders" NOT checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the search folder, it says, "Loading..." and has the dots going from left to right, but it never loads/shows anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I change the advanced criteria to some specific category, mail displays properly. &nbsp;But I want it to show uncategorized mail. &nbsp;When I change it back to "Categories is empty" criteria, I get the "loading."</p>

    <title>Pen lags&#47;fails in Slide Show View in PowerPoint 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j1b1p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pen lags&#47;fails in Slide Show View in PowerPoint 2013</h2>
                    <p>Using an ASUS Vivo Tab with full Windows 8 and just released Office 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no lag using the pen to Ink a slide in Normal View or Presenter View, but in Slide Show View it lags terribly and misses pen strokes.&nbsp; The ink is all there when I switch to Normal or Presenter View, so PowerPoint is capturing it, just not rendering
 it in Slide Show View.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I restart the Slide Show, the ink is all there, but adding more ink with the pen lags/fails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Highlighter and laser pointer gestures behave the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have kept the Task Manager open to confirm this is not a processor or memory&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp; I previously had the Preview version of PowerPoint 2013 and it lagged a bit but worked fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that something changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any&nbsp;help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Community and thanks for asking the question. As I understand, when you use the pen in slide show mode in PowerPoint
 2013, it responds slowly and misses pen strokes. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Just a quick question:</span></p>
<p><span>Does it happen with one particular presentation or it happen with all the presentations?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it happens in all the presentations, you may disable the hardware graphic acceleration in PowerPoint and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>In PowerPoint &gt; click on File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; under Display, check the option ‘Disable hardware graphics acceleration’.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope that helps. Let us know if you need more information. Thank you.

<p>Welcome to the forum and it's a pleasure assisting you with your concern regarding your nickname being displayed in your outgoing emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>The name that you’ve registered in your Profile is the same name that will appear when you access Outlook.com, Messenger, SkyDrive and other Windows Live services. If you want to change the name that will show up when sending emails in Outlook.com or Messenger,
 you have to change your Profile name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Excel 365 &#40;2016&#41; crashes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the old puter man  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 365 &#40;2016&#41; crashes</h2>
                    <p>Excel 365 has been randomly crashing for me since I first installed it. I DO NOT have OCR software and I use a Canon MF227DW laser that I've had for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I totally rebuilt the software on my system to see if that would help. I'm running Windows 10 Pro on one system and Windows 10 Home on the other. I have a subscription to Office 365 Home so I'd ASSUME?? that my office suite is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel crashes on almost anything... from sorting to selecting or deselecting filters and even occasionally when doing a manual save. I have Auto-Save set to make a copy every 5 minutes but even that failed yesterday. I ended up re-entering about 3 hours
 of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it crashes it has NEVER been able to recover my file, always says Corrupt, and leaves me hanging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help but don't know where to start. I've, in the past, saved the corrupt files but don't know how/where to contact.</p>

            Try following one by one as check after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />4. Try to login through another Windows profile. If there is some corruption in profile which is causing this problem, this would correct.
<br />
<br />5. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />6. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start Outlook. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />7. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:
<br />Open Excel &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration' &gt; Click Ok and restart Excel.

<h2>            Seperating overtime from regular hours</h2>
                    
<p>I have a formula on <strong>Sheet 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>=SUM(A1:G1)</strong> that adds up my current Manager's hours which equals to<strong>45.0</strong> hours.</p>
<p>I trying to use</p>
<p><strong>=IF(H1&gt;=40,40,H1)</strong> Should remove the <strong>5</strong> hours as over time and leave<strong>40</strong> as regular hours in the cell.</p>
<p><strong>=IF(H1&gt;=40,H1-40,0)</strong> Should remove <strong>40</strong> and leave<strong>5</strong> as over time in the cell.<br />
<br />
I am using this same setup on <strong>Sheet 1</strong>&nbsp;for my employees, but<strong>=SUM(A1:G1)
</strong>is replaced with <strong>=SUMIF(A1:G1) </strong>and the rest of the formulas are the same. Will<strong>=SUMIF</strong> not work with
<strong>=IF</strong>?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Matlock,</p>
<p>The formula is working correctly but you can't see that because of the custom format you have applied to you cells.</p>
<p>The source of the error is in the formula</p>
<p>=(E4-E5)*24</p>
<p>E4 is the start time of 05:00<br />
E5 is the end time of 14:00</p>
<p>You are subtracting the wrong way around and your formula is returning -9. because you have a custom format of 0.0;[Blue]0.0 in the cell your not seing this and the cell is displaying as 9.</p>
<p>the formula I have you has the same custom format applied and is actually returning -55 but is being displayed because of the format as 55</p>
<p>To correct things change the formula in E17 to =(E5-E4)*24 and likewise for all the other cells that calculate the hours.</p>
<p>Use a different custom format for those cells and I suggest <br />
0.0;[Blue](0.0)</p>
<p>That way negative numbers show up in parenthesis.</p>
<p>I have uploaded the corrected workbook here</p>

<p>What I meant by "mix them up" was that if you had used this...</p>
<p><strong>=MAX(40,SUM(A1:G1))</strong></p>
<p>instead of this...</p>
<p><strong>=MIN(40,SUM(A1:G1))</strong></p>
<p>then you would have gotten the result you posted that you got (40 instead of 45 when your SUM was 45), but if you copied/pasted Mike's formula as you said you did, then the result you posted is, simply, an impossible one... MIN and MAX work in very predictable,
 repeatable ways and there is no way the result you say you got is possible outcome for them. And the same would have been true for the other equation as well.</p>

    <title>Internet Explorer 8 Security Warning Popup Window - Can&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john&#43;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 8 Security Warning Popup Window - Can&#39;t Remove&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed IE 8.&nbsp; I also have the Google search toolbar installed.</p>
<p>Everytime I click on a query on the Google search toolbar, and get a page of Google search results, I also get the VERY annoying Windows "Security Warning" popup.&nbsp; The popup headline says: "<span>Do you want to view only the webpage content that was delivered
 securely?</span>"&nbsp; The text beneath the headline says: "<span>This webpage contains content that will not be delivered using a secure https connection, which could compromise the security of the entire webpage.</span>"&nbsp; There is a "Yes" and a "No" button on
 the popup.&nbsp; There is also a horizontal warning bar across the top of the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this context, the warning is ABSURD.&nbsp; There is no danger whatsoever to a page of Google search results (beginning with the url:
<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/</a> etc)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done tens of thousands of such searches without a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any event, I have tried the "canonical" solution to this problem: Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Security Tab &gt; Custom Level &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Set "Mixed Content" to "Enable".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That does *not* work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried setting the "Mixed Content" button to "Disable".&nbsp; That does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried setting the "Mixed Content" button to "Enable" under&nbsp;ALL icons: the "Internet" icon, the "Local Intranet" icon, the "Trusted Sites" icon, and the "Restricted" icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried setting the "Mixed Content" button to "Disable" under&nbsp;ALL icons: the "Internet" icon, the "Local Intranet" icon, the "Trusted Sites" icon, and the "Restricted" icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That also did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot believe that there is not a solution to this problem at this late date, but I have not found one despite having wasted several hours browsing the internet looking for one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a solution?&nbsp; (Please do not suggest the "canonical" solution, which, as discussed above, does NOT work.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the ONLY solution to uninstall Google's search toolbar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS - I just tried the same search in Bing that earned the "Security Warning" in Google.&nbsp; No "Security Warning" on Bing's page of search results (which is virtually identically to the Google page of search results that DID get a "Search Warning").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hmmmm... I wonder why that is?&nbsp; Has Internet Explorer 8 been deliberately designed to drive search traffic to Bing, and away from Google?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**UPDATE: Before posting, I repeatedly closed and re-opened IE to check the popup issue.&nbsp; I just did some work for about 4 hours, and when I came back to IE, the problem was solved.&nbsp; I didn't change anything (or reboot) between now and the time I posted
 the above, so this is somewhat mysterious to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the record, I currently have IE set to the following under all icons (the "Internet" icon, the "Local Intranet" icon, the "Trusted Sites" icon, and the "Restricted" icon): Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Security Tab &gt; Custom Level &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Set "Mixed
 Content" to "Disable".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would try setting "Mixed Content" to Enable, but I'm afraid to mess with it at this point, now that it's working properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**UPDATE 2: The problem is now back.&nbsp; Ugh.</p>

<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

<p>1a. When (exact date, preferably) did you purchase the used computer?</p>
<p>1b. Did you purchase the used computer privately (e.g., from an acquaintace or relative), from a computer repair shop or at&nbsp;a retail store?</p>
<p>2. Was the "fresh install" of WinXP done before or after you purchased the used computer?</p>
<p>3. Who did the "fresh install" of WinXP?</p>
<p>4a. When (exact date, preferably) did you install IE8?</p>
<p>4b. Were you running IE6 or IE7 before you installed IE8?</p>
<p>5. Was the Kaspersky suite first <em>purchased</em> &amp;&nbsp;installed in October 2011 (or 2010)?</p>
<p>6. What&nbsp;(if any) anti-virus application or security suite was installed <em>before you installed the Kaspersky suite</em>, was your subscription still current, and did you uninstall it before you installed the Kaspersky suite?</p>
<p>7a. Do you know if&nbsp;a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] came preinstalled on the computer
<em>when&nbsp;it was brand-new?</em> </p>
<p>7b. Did the computer come with a set of CDs?</p>
<p>8. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>

            <p>1a. When (exact date, preferably) did you purchase the used computer?</p>
<p>April 23, 2009.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. Did you purchase the used computer privately (e.g., from an acquaintace or relative), from a computer repair shop or at&nbsp;a retail store?</p>
<p>An ebay vendor that sold refurbished Dells in large quantities.&nbsp; By all indications a full-time business with several employees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Was the "fresh install" of WinXP done before or after you purchased the used computer?</p>
<p>Before.&nbsp; I know a little something about computers, well, not much, but I'm pretty darn sure it was a fresh OS install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Who did the "fresh install" of WinXP?</p>
<p>The vendor.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4a. When (exact date, preferably) did you install IE8?</p>
<p>December 1, 2011</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4b. Were you running IE6 or IE7 before you installed IE8?</p>
<p>The computer came installed with IE8 (without the popup issue) -- then something happened, I can't remember, possibly an infection&nbsp;-- and when I reinstalled IE I selected IE7 for some reason.</p>
<p>(As I say, I can't remember, but I *think* there was something annoying me in IE8, some feature - it may have been the "Favorites" bar, that sits under the Google search bar, which I hate (the Favorites bar that is, because it's useless (to me - I always
 click on the Favorites pulldown menu between "View" and "Tools"), and I was unable to figure a way to uninstall it; or I may have messed something up in IE8 when I was trying to uninstall the Favorites bar... just can't recall.)</p>
<p>Lately, I been getting more and more notices that IE7 is out of date/insecure, so I decided to upgrade back to IE8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Was the Kaspersky suite first <em>purchased</em> &amp;&nbsp;installed in October 2011 (or 2010)?</p>
<p>I purchased the Kaspersky suite on Oct 13, 2011, and installed it today, December 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. What&nbsp;(if any) anti-virus application or security suite was installed <em>before you installed the Kaspersky suite</em>, was your subscription still current, and did you uninstall it before you installed the Kaspersky suite?</p>
<p>I had a previous generation version of Kaspersky; the subscription ended on Oct 13. There was a gap from Oct 13 - Dec 1 when I had purchased the current Kaspersky but hadn't installed it (because I had to uninstall the old software and reinstall new software
 for the new subscription to be activated).</p>
<p>However, I believe the old Kaspersky continued to run as anti-virus protection (I did not uninstall it until this morning), albeit with the software not updated past Oct 13.</p>
<p>Specifically, I installed IE8 this morning while the old Kaspersky was running.&nbsp; Then when IE8 was installed, I uninstalled the old Kaspersky and then immediately installed the new Kaspersky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7a. Do you know if&nbsp;a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] came preinstalled on the computer
<em>when&nbsp;it was brand-new?</em> </p>
<p>It's a Dell Latitude, so it's possible it did have that pre-installed when it was brand-new, but I have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7b. Did the computer come with a set of CDs?</p>
<p>Yes it did, but they were not Dell-branded CDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>I installed Chrome today *after* all the trouble started with IE8.&nbsp; So far as I know or can recall, that's it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; Advanced SystemCare; AVG PC TuneUp; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; CCleaner)?</p>
<p>No.</p>

I'm pretty certain you're seeing the effects of an going&nbsp;hijackware infection. Before I post a recommended resolution, I have some...</p>
<p><strong>COMMENTS &amp; A FEW, SOMEWHAT-RHETORICAL (at this point) QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>A1a. Did you uninstall IE8 via Add/Remove Programs&nbsp;&amp; reboot before you "reinstalled" IE7?<em>
</em></p>
<p>A1b. Did you "reinstall" IE7 manually or was IE7 offered by Windows Update?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A1c. Is KB2586448 listed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer&nbsp;7 (KB2586448)
</strong>in Add/Remove Programs and are you <em>certain</em> that it's listed as being installed on 13 October 2011?</p>
<p>A1d. Have you ever had occasion to do a <a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Install</a> of WinXP for any reason <em>since you purchased the (used) computer</em> in April 2009?</p>
<p>A2. This is <em>not good</em>.&nbsp; If Kaspersky's definitions weren't being updated at least once-a-day, you might as well have been running without an anti-virus application
<em>installed</em>.</p>
<p>A3a. With&nbsp;that reference to IE6 (i.e., <strong>MSIE6.0</strong>) in your User-Agent string (due in part to the undesirable "<a href="http://www.enhanceie.com/ie/troubleshoot.asp#nestedUA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nesting</a>"), I'd be very surprised to hear that those "out-of-date/unsecure"
 warnings have stopped!</p>
<p>A3b. Your User-Agent string also tells me that Google Toolbar's "auto-updater" hasn't been working properly for several months.</p>
<p>PS: Please do NOT quote this post in your reply - just answer my questions by number. Thanks!</p>

            <p>A1a. I said that when I "reinstalled IE," I "selected IE7."&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I used Add/Remove to uninstall IE8, and would probably have rebooted before installing IE7, but I can't say that with 100% certainty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A1b. Windows Update.&nbsp; Clarification: I don't know if I was specifically on a "Windows Update" page, but I would have downloaded IE7 from a windows.com or microsoft.com site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A1c. Yes.&nbsp; I checked very carefully, and have a screen capture I could attach if this board accepted attachments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A1d. No.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A2.&nbsp; That's possible, I suppose.&nbsp; However, other than the inability to fix this&nbsp;issue, which is&nbsp; built into IE8 (i.e. the appearance of the popup under IE8's default settings), I haven't seen any indicia of an infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A3a. The one place I know I repeatedly saw the warning was when I logged into my Paypal account.&nbsp; I do not see the warning since updating to IE8.&nbsp; (I just checked it again before posting this.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A3b. Okay.&nbsp; I've never been able to stop it from auto-updating, even when I tried to block it with Kaspersky's.&nbsp; The auto-updating is the one aspect of Google's toolbar that I really dislike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks........</p>

So the basis for this conclusion is that I cannot fix IE8's "Security Warning" popup using the canonical method, plus "circumstantial evidence."</p>

<p>Are you saying you are *certain* I have a hijackware infection, in the way you are certain that 2 + 2 = 4?</p>

            <p>​Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community forum.<br />
</span></div>
<span>From the problem description, I see that
</span>you are unable to open tools menu from Internet Explorer 8 to add a trusted PC.
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To open tools menu you may have to press <strong>ALT + O </strong>in the keyboard.
<br />
<br />

            I am not sure where I got the info about&nbsp; Alt + M now, but Alt + O also does not work,although I have since found from another list of short cuts that Alt + T does work.
<br />
<br />
What I am surprised about though is that I cannot find away of getting the Tools Menu on the Tool Bar.<br />
<br />
Any way thanks: Alt + T is the solution. <br />
<br />
Sadly I only have a few more months use of Windows XP as I see that Microsoft Updating is due to finish on 8th April 2013. I am not sure what the risks will be of continuing to use XP?

            I am sorry my comment above did not get a response so far, it seems that different advice is given in different places.<br />
<br />
using Windows XP Service Pack 3 and IE 8 it needs Alt +T to open Tools menu I have now confirmed whereas ALt +O gets no response.<br />
<br />
I would also welcome davise about whether it is safe and for how long it will continue to be save to use Windows XP Service Pack 3 after the 1st April 2013

<h2>            Select encoding that makes your document readable</h2>
                    When I try to open a file on my usb drive, I get "select encoding that makes your document readable." Hitting cancel does not open it and hitting ok brings up nonsense. Is there a way to open this?

            Copy the document to your hard disk and try to open it from there. If the problem persists, the document has most likely become damaged. You can try to recover text (but not formatting) from corrupt documents by selecting "Recover text from any file" in
 the Files of Type dropdown in Word's Open dialog.
