    <title>Skype Display Name - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Display Name</h2>
                    I first signed up to Skype probably 10 or more years ago but haven't used it in years. I just signed in to start using it again and now I found my login is the same as my Microsoft ID. No biggie. However, my display name on the Skype app on my Microsoft
 Surface laptop is "live:richselin" and on my iPhone app the display name is "live:94beb0cfe6e876bc". I can't change the display name through either app or through my account on the Skype webpage. Am I supposed to tell other Skype users, "Hey, look me up on
 Skype. I have the easy-to-remember handle of live:94beb0cfe6e876bc"? There better be a way to change it, otherwise I will delete the Skype apps and look at using Facetime or some other service.

            Hi Richard
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor Specialist on Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />Your "easy-to-remember handle live:94beb0cfe6e876bc" :-) ... is actually your Skype Name. As per Microsoft, "Since the migration of Skype to Microsoft, we only can create an account using an email address or a phone number. This new account creation procedure will generate a Skype Name (in live:ID format) and will no longer give out an option to choose your preferred Skype Name. This new method aims to reduce the sign-up effort by presenting a faster and more flexible experience for new users." <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/i-need-to-change-my-live-username98088069-3551-4f64-a46e-c693eca8cede">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum...</a>
<br />
<br />Having said that, the good news are :
<br />
<br />(1) People can find your account by searching the Skype directory using your e-mail address or phone number.
<br />
<br />(2) You can change your display name:
<br />- Login to your account  : <a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/account/</a> 
<br />- Click on Edit Profile &gt; Edit Profile to enable in Edit mode &gt; You can change your Display Name here
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

<h2>            Computer started to have issues following windows 10 update. Ran a test and found issues. Don&#39;t know how to proceed.</h2>
                    <p>My computer updated for an Adobe security update.</p>
<p>After that update i started getting blue screens, stop code: MEMORY_MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>and my everyday programs, like java, began running into issues with running code.</p>
<p>So i decided to use Memory Diagnostic Tool.</p>
<p>It came up with Hardware issues and Memory issues. It has told me to contact my computer manufacturer.<br />
This computer was built by me and my friend, so I can't contact my manufacturer.<br />
So I am unsure how to proceed.</p>

            Hi Reo.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Your mention of Java is a concern since it's a major infection risk vector.  I wouldn't even run it at all unless a site requires it and then I'd uninstall it again.
<br />
<br />Run full scans with the most powerful on-demand scanners Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>.  
<br />
<br />Clean up anything they find, restart PC and then run both scans again until they come up clean.  Then check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />
<br />Test your RAM overnight to stress it with a more reliable bootable test, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Hibernation error, again - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raynelson330  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hibernation error, again</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7 64-bit.&nbsp; Every night when I leave work, I put the computer to sleep.&nbsp; Twice in the past month or so I come up with an error described in an earlier post "Your computer can't come out of hibernation.&nbsp; Status: 0xc0000411&nbsp;&nbsp; Info: A fatal
 error occurred processing the restoration data.&nbsp; File: \hiberfil.sys&nbsp; Any information not saved before the computer went into hibernation will be lost."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have NEVER used hibernation on any computer that I have ever owned.&nbsp; Why does this happen if the computer is sent to "sleep"?</p>

            <p>I would urge you to shut down your computer instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The “sleep” or “hibernate” functions that&nbsp; run by&nbsp;default in Windows 7 can prove to be problematic.&nbsp; I advise my clients to restrict hibernate/sleep functions for usage only in absolutely needed circumstances.&nbsp; It is commonly problematic and seldom ever
 fixed.&nbsp; Myriads of causes you can spend weeks trying to find.&nbsp; It is simply not worth it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FIRST: If you are running a desktop PC, shut down all sleep and hibernate functions.&nbsp; They are of no value and will cause you problems eventually.&nbsp; But, for some notebook PCs, where the computer is used in a truly mobile sense, where house power is not always
 available, you need these functions to extend battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:&nbsp; The concept of sleep/hibernate was designed to extend battery life.&nbsp; If you are not running on a battery or never do, the very idea is quite useless.&nbsp; If you are doing it because your computer takes a long time to startup, fix that problem.&nbsp;
 Under normal circumstances if you are finished using the computer and do not plan to use it again for at least several hours, shut it down.&nbsp; Leaving it running continuously is a sure way to shorten your computer’s life</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change how these functions behave here:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start globe</li><li>Type Power options in the text box that pops up</li><li><strong>Desktop computers:</strong></li><li>Set all hibernate/sleep functions to NEVER</li><li><strong>Notebook computers</strong>:</li><li>Again, set all hibernate/sleep functions to NEVER, EXCEPT when it is battery powered.</li><li>In the Power Options window, Click Change Power Settings</li><li>Change Advanced Power Settings</li><li>Set hard disk to turn off after 20 minutes of non-use</li><li>Under Sleep, several settings:</li><li>&nbsp;Sleep After NEVER</li><li>&nbsp;Hybrid after: Never</li></ol>

<h2>            Can I install Windows 7 on an Acer Aspire 5600 with an ATI mobility Radeon X1300 graphic card&#63;</h2>
                    My OS&nbsp;on my laptop is&nbsp;Vista Ultimate. Now I want to upgrade to Windows 7 32-bit. I downloaded the windows upgrade advisor and that said that I have to update my drivers for the ATI mobilty Radeon x1300 card after installing.
<br />
But I've seen several messages on Internet that that card didn't work with Windows 7. In the Windows Compatibilty Center some&nbsp;x1300 cards&nbsp;are compatible&nbsp;and some are not. And there I can't find the mobility version.&nbsp;The Acer website has no drivers for an Aspire
 5600 for Windows 7.

<h2>            Windows updates with strange file names such as&#58; 8ec4684be65c36dcea7d6ae23f7b40</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past couple of weeks when I shut down my PC Microsoft has been updating my files.&nbsp; These updates, with strange file names such as:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">8ec4684be65c36dcea7d6ae23f7b40</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">23cfefede5de357fcd71c676</p>

<p>automatically download to my WD external hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I contacted WD and they told me that:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">"<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since there are no backup software in use, this is not caused by any of our software. This is similar though to some files that Windows creates whenever it updates itself, these files are supposed to be
 hidden along with that $RECYCLE.bin folder. My advice is to contact Microsoft and see if these files can be deleted, or if there is way to have Windows change location of these files."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a fix to this problem?</p>

            I attempted your solution and it did not work.&nbsp; I will delete the strange files but with I turn off my PC I get a message that&nbsp;files are being updated and the next time I turn on the PC those strange files once again appear on my eternal hard drive.

            <p>When some programs (including Microsoft programs) install things, it may create a temporary folder consisting of 10-30 random letters and numbers or random numbers and letters in the root drive of the volume with the most free space.<br />
<br />
This explains why sometimes the folders are on your C drive or on some might be on another drive - which one has the most free space?<br />
<br />
For example you may see a folder similar to or called:<br />
<br />
D:\9470bb12e8a4f3447657236478e41c5<br />
<br />
There may be other folders and files under that main temporary folder such as amd64 and i386.<br />
<br />
These should normally be removed when the installation is complete, but sometimes they are not - especially if the installation fails.&nbsp; They are harmless but annoying.&nbsp; You may think something is wrong when there is not or be afraid the files are really needed.&nbsp;
 To avoid confusion you can delete the temporary folders.<br />
<br />
If your installation failed or the installation does not delete the randomly named folder when it completes running and you run the installation again, the installation again will make another randomly named folder.&nbsp; Sometimes you will see several folders like
 this and they can all be deleted.<br />
<br />
You may be able to identify the installation (for curiosity) by looking at some of the folder contents and decide if that installation was okay, just delete the files/folders.&nbsp; If the installation did not work properly for some reason, running the installation
 again will just create a new randomly named temporary folder so the old temporary folder is really of no use.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the folders are stubborn to delete.&nbsp; Even if you are an Administrator on the system you may get a "sharing violation", "access denied", "being used" or similar type message when trying to remove the temporary folders.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installations sometimes use different permissions than a regular user with Administrator group might have so you may have trouble deleting the folders.<br />
<br />
There are many methods to try to remove the folders and some involve third party programs to install or changing certain Windows settings that may compromise your system security if you don't change them back when you are done.<br />
<br />
Booting your system in Safe Mode (pressing the F8 key repeatedly right before Windows loads is a good first method to try and remove the folders since it doesn't involve making any changes to your system configuration or downloading any third party programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the above work, try a popular third party tool called Unlocker.&nbsp; Unlocker will work for any version of Windows.<br />
<br />
Unlocker can be downloaded from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.emptyloop.com/unlocker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emptyloop.com/unlocker/</a><br />
<br />
You may need to use Internet Explorer to get Unlocker to download properly.<br />
<br />
Do not be tempted to download or install any other software that promises some miracle on your system.&nbsp; Just download the correct Unlocker for your system (either 32 bit or 64 bit).<br />
<br />
<strong>Pay attention</strong> when installing Unlocker since it wants to add a bunch of options, addons, shortcuts, and other extras you don't need so be sure to
<strong>SKIP </strong>and <strong>DECLINE </strong>any free things, or other checkboxes for example:<br />
<br />
UNcheck the box to install the Babylon Toolbar and click Next<br />
UNcheck the box to Check for Unlocker updates<br />
UNcheck the box to install the Unlocker Assistant<br />
<br />
DO check the box to install the Explorer Shell extension (you are going to need that)<br />
<br />
Click Install, you do not need to reboot.<br />
<br />
The reason you need to add the Explorer Shell Extension is so when you right click on the offending folder, you will have an Unlocker option to choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explorer Shell Extensions help make up the right click menu when you look at a file or folder.<br />
<br />
Right click one of the offending folders and choose Unlocker, then choose the Action (that would be delete) and click OK and you should see a Success message and the folder should be gone.<br />
<br />
I would just install Unlocker long enough to clean up those leftovers and then, I then generally use Add/Remove Programs to uninstall Unlocker and all parts of it.&nbsp; You can always install it again some other day if you need to.<br />
<br />
Unlocker can be uninstalled when you are finished using it.<br />
<br />
Reboot when you are finished to be sure the annoying folders are really gone. <br />

                    <span>
<p><span>I turned on my computer today, and got the "Blue Screen of Death." And then it automatically restarted itself. Upon the restart, the BSOD returned, and I can no longer even run my computer.
 Every time its turned on the computer goes straight to the BSOD. It won't even run in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I didn't install anything new to my computer recently. It worked fine up until today, when I tried to turn it on. This was the first time this has ever happened.
 I'm worried about my personal files being lost forever.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I know some problems like this can be fixed by uninstalling certain things, but I can't even access Windows at all.</span></span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Your data should be ok as you can always stick the hard drive in another computer or in an external drive<br />
case to recover it.<br />
<br />
We really need the BCCode and other info from the bluescreen.<br />
<br />
========================================<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do not have a<br />
Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker will
<br />
sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------<br />

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there a way i can keep my data on my s360 AND my USB,&nbsp;&nbsp; do i Move the file? or do i Copy the file?&nbsp; i don't know..</p>
<p>and another question is if i my s360 did break and i wanted to put the data on my new s360 how can i do it?&nbsp; because i need to delete all my data on my USB to config it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, telling the Xbox to automatically duplicate your savegames and profile to USB won't work. But you can manually copy certain savegames and other content to the USB Stick, but not all.
</p>
<p>Your Gamertag can not be copied or duplicated. It can only be
<b>moved</b>, which means it copies the Gamertag to the USB Stick and then deletes the Gamertag on the console.
</p>
<p>Also, some Games disable the function to copy or move their savegames or certain content to other storage drives. So it is quite normal (unfortunately), that you can't copy everything for a backup.
</p>
<p>And finally, there is no comfortable tool to batch copy your data. The Transfer Tool will only
<b>move</b> your stuff to another drive, deleting the originals, so you still only have one copy.
</p>
<p>What you need to do is, play a game, and save your progress. After you finished playing, go to "My Xbox", then all the way to the right to the system settings, and then to the Memory options. There go to the harddisc, and find
 your savegame you want to back up. Choose to copy it and select the USB drive as a target.
</p>
<p>But as I said before, not all games allow copying or moving savegames.</p>

                    C-Cleaner tells me I have issues to resolve in the registry. So it fixes the registry. Then it ask me if I want to back-up these issues. Doesnt that sound like a double negative? I dont understand why would you want to back-up some problem and store it
 to a file? Please explain. And what do I do with these files?

            What it is asking ("Do you want to backup changes to the registry?") is poorly worded but it is asking if you want to make a backup of the registry before it "fixes" it.&nbsp; The best thing you could do is quit using the registry cleaner of CCleaner (although
 it may be one of the less problematic registry tools available) and leave your registry alone.&nbsp; It doesn't need cleaning and registry utilities cause far more problems than they cure.&nbsp; I use and like the disc clean part of CCleaner.&nbsp;

            You create a backup, so that you can then restore that backup to 'as it was' when you later find some program or service has stopped functioning as a result of the 'fix'

<p>Have you went all the way to the right off the hub and broke all the bottles so the boats appear in the water; once they do you have to get into each one (Y) and sail them around the water to the right and down the pier to the very left hand side; you must
 do this to every single one!</p>

<p>Are you saying that in bold that it says you have done it but you have not got the points? If so you could try clearing your cache on your xbox and try resailing them all maybe??</p>
<p>As Philip says you have to physically get in each boat and move around - Be careful because I would jump in and sail away then it would respawn whilst I was doing one of the others so I lost track of which I had done,so double check which one you jump in
 before you sail off.</p>

<p>I did it and it didn't pop up, turned out i'd done what mark said and had got confused with which boats i'd actually sailed. I'd suggest just smashing two bottles, get in the boats and sail, back to the dock, smash another 2 and so on.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t activate Windows 10 on new computer. &#40;Long&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> minerslikejs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t activate Windows 10 on new computer. &#40;Long&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone! Recently, I went about building a new computer, and as part of this I upgraded my slow Seagate to a much faster M.2 Samsung drive. I was excited to use my new computer, but first I had to put windows on the new SSD. After trying tools like
 EaseUS Todo Backup, which migrates your entire drive over to the SSD, I couldn't boot from the SSD, so I tried something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used an 8GB flash drive with the Windows Media Creation tool, and put it into my new computer. After installing windows, I found that windows was not activated, even though I had signed in with my microsoft account. I tried the troubleshoot tool and it
 said that I couldn't activate windows because I don't have a key (0xC004F050) and that I couldn't use Windows 10 from my other computer (MSI laptop) because the MSI had Windows 10 Home and the flash drive installed Windows 10 Pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I was unsure how I got windows 10 Pro, but I found the answer. Before I built my new computer, I had a prebuilt Dell XPS 8900 which came with Windows 7, but I immediately upgraded to Windows 10. I learned that upgrading from Windows 7 to 10
 came with a free Pro upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To try to remedy this problem, I ran the Windows Media Installation tool from my laptop, hoping to get Windows 10 Home on my computer instead of Pro. This worked (i'm typing this from my computer!), but Windows still won't activate. However, this time I
 have the option to "sacrifice" my laptop in order to get activated on my desktop. I would prefer not to do this however as I still would like to use my laptop. Additionally, I lost/threw away the original box for the Dell, so I can't find the product key on
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have the Seagate hard drive with windows on it, and all the original components from the Dell XPS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone!</p>

            Hi<br /><br />My name is Lee; an Independent Consultant, I'm here to help you with your problem.<br /><br />First of all let me explain to you how Microsoft license key works <br /><br />If you did not buy Microsoft license key from the official website you will not be able to transfer or reapply the key from anywhere. <br /><br />This is what I can assess from your story and problem.<br />The license key that you have now belongs to the laptop OEM which is tied to your dell laptop and will not be able to transfer or reuse in any form.<br /><br />The free upgrade that Microsoft gave u is directly upgrading the laptop oem key which is also reflect at the back of your computer or beneath the casing. Since the key is tied to your computer you will be able to reformat as many times as you want becuase the digital key is tied to the Motherboard of the laptop. <br /><br />If you want to activate your windows on your computer do head to official Microsoft to buy a windows 10 license key <br /><br />Link

<p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help:</p>
<p>I got the Dell XPS before I got the MSI laptop. But, I created a microsoft account after I got the Dell but before I got the MSI laptop. I used the microsoft account with the laptop, and later configured my dell to have my microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, I lost the box to the Dell XPS desktop and the product key is not written anywhere on the casing. I can send images if you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this clears up the confusion, and thanks again for the quick response.</p>

<h2>            Need to change virtual machine platform for Windows 10</h2>
                    I've been running Windows 10 in a virtual machine as a Windows Insider since the first betas were released to the public. I currently have my VM (Windows 10 Pro build 10158) running in Parallels. I'd like to switch to VMWare Fusion Pro. If I convert the
 VM it will be seen as new hardware, and I'd prefer to do a clean install anyway, since a converted VM probably won't run as well. Am I stuck using Parallels to keep the activated license I have? Or how do I go about getting things set up proper w/ activation
 if I switch to Fusion?

<h2>            Video freezes every 5 to 10 minutes</h2>
                    <p>In yet another crusade to make Skype's basic functionality work, here I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My video freezes every 5 to 10 minutes. I have to turn my camera off and back on. I can't reproduce the problem, as it seems to happen randomly during a video call.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen few other people report the problem, but no solution yet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens with all my contacts, even with a fast and stable connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last month, I was using a 2013 vaio laptop which did not have this problem. It was a 3rd-Gen Core i5 with 8gb RAM, 256GB SSD and a GeForce GT 735M.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, regretfully, I have a 2017 Surface Pro on a 7th-Gen Core i5 with 8gb RAM, 256GB SSD and no dedicated GPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To solve the problem, I have tried, without success:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Changing USB ports in the dock</span></li><li><span>Updating dock's firmware</span></li><li><span>Connecting directly to Surface's USB port</span></li><li><span>Updating to the latest Skype version, 12.1811.248.0</span></li><li><span>Resetting Skype</span></li><li><span>Reinstalling Skype</span></li><li><span>Updating to the latest Windows version, 1709 build 16299.334</span></li><li><span>Updating to the latest camera firmware, Logitech BRIO 2.0.17</span></li><li><span>Updating to the latest camera USB drivers, Logitech USB 1.2.75.23</span></li><li><span>Changing Power Settings - Never sleep</span></li><li><span>Changing Power Settings - Never turn screen off</span></li><li><span>Disabling, all at once, in Device Manager:</span>

<p>Hi Jomel,</p>
<p><br />
As I said, just last month on the same connection, it worked perfectly on my 2013 vaio. Other people on this same connection can also Skype without issues. I'm beginning to think that the problem is actually in Logitech's side. It could be that this camera
 is incompatible with Surface devices.</p>

<p>We're trying to diagnose the issue, that's why I advised you to try a different Internet connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what the findings will be with your consult with Logitech support regarding the compatibility of the camera you're using with your device.</p>

    <title>Video sound but black screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterc306  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video sound but black screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm running windows 8.1 with the updated Movie Maker and I can get sound but no picture. The file is from my JVS Everio Camcorder with 60&nbsp;GB hard drive&nbsp;and the instant I plug it in to my computer, Movie Maker starts up and runs the movie in sound only with
 black screen.</p>
<p>I've opened Movie Maker by itself separately and imported the movie from the camcorder with exactly the same result using the Wizard. What's wrong, anyone know? I tried downloading a free video editing tool called VSDC Free Video Editor, just to see if it
 was the program but in that one I can get the picture but no sound. I'm going around in circles with this and the camcorder is going through the window any moment now. Help please.</p>

            <p>Because it wasn't mentioned, what was the source VIDEO format you are/were working with?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker-file-types-faq&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Movie Maker technically supports many formats; but what's not provided to the public [regular users] is that Windows Movie Maker doesn't recognize those various formats unless the CODEC for that format is installed in the operating system; it's not
 built-in to Windows Movie Maker. And Windows Movie Maker doesn't make any attempts to identify, collect or load those codecs for you; Microsoft leaves that to you to resolve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation of the K-Lite Codec pack isn't complicated. Here's a link to the illustrated [screenshots] process of the installation for K-Lite, with the download link.</p>
<p>Link:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://bit.ly/1gcOesl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bit.ly/1gcOesl</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, convert the SOURCE video.</p>
If you haven't tried already, try converting the video to WMV before using it in Windows Movie Maker.<br />
WMV is Microsoft's video format, Windows Movie Maker should handle the WMV just fine. Finding a proper codec is optimal because you don't have to do any conversion before using video clips in Windows Movie Maker; saving time— but converting video before using
 it in Windows Movie Maker usually is a logical and stable option.<br />
&nbsp;
<p>Freemake Video Converter is one of the most recommended video converters for assisting users converting their SOURCE videos to WMV. Freemake Video Converter is extremely easy to use, but there's some 'opt-out' software bundled with the installer that makes
 user nervous. I've created a post to illustrate the process of the download of the application, the installation step-by-step, explaining which options are optional. I have also provided some screenshots on just how easy it is to convert your video(s) to WMV.</p>

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been tied up with other business and been unable to get back to this until now. I will do as you suggest today if time permits but more likely tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the video format I'm using is concerned, I have no idea because I cannot download it and wouldn't know how to come up with it anyway. All of my 30 odd years of experience with computers has been with programs like MS Office etc. and practically
 nothing with movies. I bought this video camera quite a few years ago intending to experiment with making some home movies when I had some time. Taking the movie was easy but that's where it all ends, at least for me anyway until maybe now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know, part of your reply reminds me of something I learned back in the days when I&nbsp;became an Apple enthusiast&nbsp; when the only other alternative was DOS3. I found myself in a state of continuous war with DOS3 for six years before being introduced to Apple
 Mac and that was a breath of fresh air that I'll never forget. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to business requirements later in life, I was forced to switch back&nbsp;to the Microsoft world and have been very comfortable with the Windows&nbsp;environment for a long time now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point I want to make is this; In the computer world, I learned that it&nbsp;takes&nbsp;considerable more effort&nbsp;for geeks&nbsp;to make something easy for the user and very easy for them&nbsp;to make something hard for the user. Microsoft chose one path because&nbsp; I suppose
 Bill is a geek at heart&nbsp;and Apple chose another with the end user in mind and worked harder to achieve their goal.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up to a certain point, Microsoft learned its lesson and after some kicking and screaming,&nbsp;came up with Windows. I say this because this is how I see it from my particular perspective, having had considerable time with both systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you say,&nbsp;I think it&nbsp;is a shame that Microsoft still appears to cling to some of its old backward thinking and make us work harder, consuming more time,&nbsp;to achieve our goal, when I'm sure that the geeks responsible for Movie Maker could easily include
 the necessary codecs. My camcorder is a JVC and if my information is correct, JVC was the originator of the camcorder and so&nbsp;of course is a well known brand so why would Microsoft ignore their codec? I could maybe understand it if the camcorder was built in
 Timbuktu with an unpronounceable name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also not helpful that they leave&nbsp;a person to flounder around for ages trying to come up with answers before looking for outside help as a last resort. If I was a cynical person, I'd probably tend to&nbsp;think that the geeks have quite a giggle over this,
 but surely not?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what the Apple equivalent to Movie Maker is these days because it has been many years now and for all I know, they may have the same issue but somehow, because of their philosophy towards the end user,&nbsp;I tend to doubt it. Anyway, it's good that
 there are people like you out there who can fill the gap that the geeks leave behind. And as far as the geeks themselves&nbsp;are concerned, well, I guess the Big Bang Theory TV show leaves me with a great deal of more tolerance for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks larry,</p>
<p>Peter</p>

            <p>One of the more ironic things about the latest release of Windows 8 is that Microsoft Windows is supposed to be more friendly and intuitive to the user and yet Microsoft has not changed anything behind the 'window' the only changed the drapes.</p>

</p><p>If Microsoft would take more time, and care/nurturing, they could create a set of baseline applications that everyone would absolutely love, it would draw more people to use operating system; because it's so easy to use, but they don't do that. Instead,
 Microsoft offers a baseline set of applications, Windows Essentials, that are half-baked, riddled with feature gaps/bugs, and with the full intent of only partially satisfying the needs of the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, I don't think Microsoft knows what Windows Essentials is. If&nbsp;they did, you wouldn't have to visit this support form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad you found my information beneficial.</p>

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a shame that Microsoft does not learn anything positive from comments such as ours and I'm sure&nbsp;many more similar&nbsp;on the net.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your comment about baseline applications that actually work because they are bug free, is spot on. It is a complete mystery to me how designers of these applications are so brilliant in their chosen field and at the same time, so utterly stupid for leaving
 their work only half done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, making money is what its all about and that is something they seem to be fairly good at so they obviously don't see any need to change their&nbsp;somewhat arrogant attitude towards the rest of&nbsp;us common mortals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I tried that link but it doesn't work or at least it doesn't on my machine. I&nbsp;can't spare the&nbsp;time&nbsp;right now but when I can, I'll do some research on the net for other programs that might recognize the JVC camcorder and at least get my&nbsp;film onto
 the desktop where I can do&nbsp;some converting as you suggest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help Larry and at least pointing me in the right direction and helping me to understand what the problem is.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peter</p>

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a search for K-Lite Codec pack on the net and it returned quite a bit. I downloaded a full mega pack to start working on with the defaults right away but nothing has happened. By the way, I forgot to mention that Media player and VLC will play both
 video and sound quite well, but of course you cannot do anything with it to edit it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can download the file to play it as it is from the camcorder to the hard drive now and the file is called a 'mod' file if that's any help. Right clicking doesn't give me any option to save it as anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why your link doesn't work for me. Maybe I'm miss reading your figure '1' when maybe it should be an 'l' or maybe your 'O' should be a figure '0'. Anyway I'll try a few variations and see what happens just to see if I can reach the area you
 are talking about and if successful, I'll delete the one I downloaded and installed yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Peter</p>

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up copying and pasting your link into my ie explorer and it worked. I followed your directions and downloaded the K-Lite pack again etc but this strange 'mod' file didn't appear anywhere in the pack but I continued with the installation anyway. I
 downloaded the 'full' pack rather than the standard pack because of the 'mod' file on this JVC camcorder that I've never heard of before. I thought that I would cover every contingency by doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I downloaded Freemake Video Converter, being extra careful not to download any of the other advertising junk that goes with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program refused to recognize the 'mod' file so I couldn't do anything with it. The junk that I carefully avoided downloading with that program, still managed to slip through somehow&nbsp;and stuff up ie explorer program with a thing called Snapdo. I eventually
 managed to find ways to get rid of it but it took a little doing and quite a bit of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I still&nbsp;haven't downloaded a single&nbsp;movie from this machine and in particular, one&nbsp;that I took on and ocean cruise liner and a few other places in Europe that would have been good to have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere along the way a few months ago when I was trying various ways and means to get my film off the camcorder hard drive again, I inadvertently wiped the camcorder hard drive somehow&nbsp;and lost everything.&nbsp;So what I have been doing since then, after rescuing
 the camcorder from the bin, was to make a last ditch effort and try and get some outside help. So I made a couple of short test video's to try and download. I visited a camera shop with the camcorder but they couldn't help much&nbsp;and finally&nbsp;tried the internet
 just now&nbsp;in vain. So&nbsp;in my case anyway,&nbsp;a waste of money for the camcorder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>People are out there and they do make home movies because I've seen them. All I can say is that they must have an extraordinary amount of patience and dedication and they have my utmost admiration for their skills.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for me, I've had enough. I simply don't have the spare time for this. The camcorder is going into the bin for good this time&nbsp;and I'm sticking to&nbsp;photographs from now on. If I ever feel the need to make another attempt at a movie, a friend advised me this
 morning to go and buy an apple again because I remember&nbsp;their system used to be good for this sort of thing a long time ago when I was involved with&nbsp;them&nbsp;and according to him,&nbsp;it&nbsp;still is apparently, even though it means learning a completely new operating
 system now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not much chance of that however even if I was so inclined. They said on the TV news this morning that after Apple had announced a huge profit of so many squillions of dollars, they've decided to up the price on all their Apple products by 30% I suppose because
 they can,&nbsp;but maybe that's just in Australia. In any event, a bit rich for my blood.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my last post on this subject by the way. It's time to move on and put it all down to a bad experience that's lasted several years. Good luck all you people with Microsoft problems and to&nbsp;you people in particular with movie making problems, my heartfelt
 sympathy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time Larry, you meant well&nbsp;and brickbats to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Peter</p>

            What do you mean by "load in server"?&nbsp; Are you running a server? What kind?<br />
<br />
Or do you want to connect a hard drive directly to your network for shared access? If so, you want a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device.<br />

            Sharing a USB attached drive this way tends to be problematic. It can be done but permissions often fail to persist when the host is restarted.&nbsp; I would recommend you either add an internal hard drive for this purpose or, better yet, use a NAS.<br />
