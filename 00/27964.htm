<h2>            Delete a conversation only in the device which deleted it</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Skype 8.33</p>
<p>When I delete a conversation in my Android device, the conversation is deleted from the desktop too.</p>
<p>In the old 7.x this did not happen.</p>
<p>I need my mobile clean, but my desktop with the full info.</p>
<p>How can I recover this functionality?</p>

            Skype has moved away from that approach to managing chat history in the new version.
<br />
<br />I recommend you share you feedback with the engineers so they can acknowledge possibly implement a future solution:
<br />
<br />
<br />File a bug report so the engineers are aware of the problem.

<h2>            Problem with &#34;Adobe Garamond Pro&#8221; font&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made several documents in Microsoft word and Excel using “Adobe Garamond Pro” font. When exported to PDF or Printed, all the output margins get screwed up. On screen, it looks fine but when I print it, all goes wrong. I have wasted a lot of papers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try other fonts like “Calibri”, “Arial” and “Times New Roman” and all are good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don’t understand why “Adobe Garamond Pro” is doing this. Please help, how could I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Google Apps, For Windows Phones&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucy &#38; rika ayakashi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Google Apps, For Windows Phones&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I wrote to Google to provide Hangout app for Windows Phone. In reply they said that they are willing to provide Google Apps if device manufacturer are ready to collaborate with them in development process. Following text is copy of two paragraphs
 of their reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Unfortunately, when developing an app for a third party device we need the collaboration of the manufacturer.<br />
Like in the case of Mac we worked side by side, also with Ubuntu and other Debian based Linux distributions.<br />
Together we achieved the apps their users enjoy now, as well once the app is developed it needs to follow<br />
the manufacturer's store approval like any other app developed for them. As you can see by visiting<br />
https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1216376?hl=en.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">In the case of Microsoft we are more than willing to develop the app, we would love to support that market<br />
share which is vast increase potential customers to use their mobile devices.<br />
With Microsoft we've achieved the use of hangouts through their Desktop environments so far. But, we need<br />
you as their mobile customer to present the need of the use of Google Apps in their mobile phone's so they<br />
can support the development of mobile apps on their devices. We want to serve you in whatever device you<br />
choose to have, but this can only be accomplished through the device users to convince the device<br />
manufacturer to collaborate to develop an app from us.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would love to see Google apps on my windows phones. Could you please communicate with Google, to bring Hangout and other apps to Windows Phone.</p>

            Google is just lying to you. They don't need anyone's help. They just don't want to support windows phones, and have the nerve of pushing the blame to Microsoft. What a horrid company.

            <p>I doubt that, cuz it states that Google is more than willing to provide "Google Apps" for Windows Phones. So explain to me, why do&nbsp;you and everyone that owns a&nbsp;Windows Phone, doubt&nbsp;that Microsoft or Google will collaborate with each other?<br />
<br />
Because The statement that Google said is that they are more than willing to provide "Google Apps" for Windows Phone Users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think that maybe Microsoft is lying to you and all windows phone users, that there going or not going to collaborate with Google.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Are you saying that google engineers are so incompetent that they can't develop apps without Microsoft's help? Everyone else can do their work just fine. Just google who need magical help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The truth is that google won't develop for windows phone because they want you to buy an android phone. Not having google apps if a big impediment for many people. They only make stuff for iphones because they are so popular and it would be stupid not to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft even made a YouTube app once. Google forced Microsoft to delete the app. Obviously they're not interested in offering their services to Windows users.</p>

            <p>Yeah, did you ever think that Google may or may have not givin Microsoft authorization to build a "YouTube" app without their consent?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cuz the way I look at it is that Microsoft does things on there own and does not give a damn about what the customers want, in terms of products or&nbsp;service&nbsp;(Like us for example) but heres the thing, I believe in Microsoft that they will want&nbsp;to collaborate
 with Google. So that everyone will be happy with what they want, including apps, movies etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone always seems to blame Google for forcing Microsoft to take down 1 simple app that was Google based. If you believe that Google is the enemy, then prove me wrong. Because Android, iOS, and even Windows Phone users. should all work together. And not
 bang there F'n heads together.</p>

            <p>Better send a mail to MS store team or support team directly. Send a screenshot of that mail from google too. If they respond, you will know the real case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Google developing apps for Windows, it's still a big debate over whose fault it is. Most of the critics however do agree, that Google is to be blamed here, as they have never taken a single incentive to support the Window store, whereas MS have literally
 provided all apps for Google Play Store.</p>

<p>Obviously this is the wrong forum for you as we are testing future unreleased builds of Windows 10. You should contact the printer manufacturer or the forum for the public release version of Windows 10 at the following link:</p>

</p><p>I would refer you to your printer's manufacturer's website, or the paperwork and cd that likely came with the printer. Most of the time you can do a web search for the printer make and model and get to the manufacture's website (ex. HP Officejet 8010, or
 Brother Laser 2370).</p>

<h2>            Windows phone issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to set up a Lumia 950 and am in a world of pain!&nbsp; If anyone can help with any of these, I will be greatly appreciative.&nbsp; If not, I will get an iPhone!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has the latest Windows 10 installed.<br />
</p>
<p>1. I can't connect any Bluetooth (to transfer my data, headset).&nbsp; The phone is discover-able, but won't connect.&nbsp; Bluetooth is on and when I click on 'Add a Bluetooth or other device' nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I can't login to One Note.&nbsp; I am logged in from other areas, as my contacts, email and calendar have sync'd.&nbsp; In the OneNote app, it asks me to 'Pick an account to sign in with', I click 'Personal Microsoft Account'.&nbsp; It comes up with 'Let's get you signed
 in' Select the account that you want to use with OneNote.&nbsp; The screen is blank except for the Continue button.&nbsp; When I click on that, I am taken back to 'Pick an account to sign in with' and around and around I go!</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I can't sign in to OneDrive.&nbsp; From the photos app, if I click Sign in, nothing happens at all (and none of my photos are there).&nbsp; If I click on OneDrive upload settings, it tells me 'Camera upload is unavailble because you're signed into this device using
 a work or school account'.&nbsp; I'm not, but if I could sign out, I would, but I can't!&nbsp; If I try to sign in from 'send feedback' I get 'Let's get you signed in' with nothing but a Continue button, that when clicked takes me back to the start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I can't do much else on the phone, as I can't get Edge or Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Any ad free alternatives anyone can recommend, or a hack to get one of the Microsoft products on my Microsoft phone!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all I think!&nbsp; Look forward to your guidance (to fix or to a new phone!) :)<br />
<br />
Cheers,&nbsp;<br />
Elizabeth</p>

<p>I hope it would solve the Bluetooth issue. Edge comes built-in with W10M so something is definitely wrong with your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of a hard reset I would actually recommend a full firmware reinstall using the Windows Device Recovery Tool from a PC. Please follow the instructions at the below link:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>After this is complete, set up the phone with your default MS account but do not do anything else. Just make sure it is plugged in to a power source and connected to a solid wifi connection, then run all system and app updates. This could take a good couple
 of hours with several phone restarts, which is normal.</p>

<h2>            Believe or not Happened to me last night.</h2>
                    well guys<br />
last night i was hearing a cricket's or grosshopper voice can't tell u with sure what was there in my lawn under the plants.<br />
sound was quite similar to old ericsson ring tones.<br />
so i decided to record it just to use as ring tone for the fun.<br />
so i used my N95 8GB voice recorder<br />
n result was quite interesting<br />
even a bit of that sound was not recorded.<br />
i can tell u with sure insect sound pitch was quite loud n i was able to hear it about 15 yards or above.<br />
be sure when i was trying to record it distance might 1.5 foot.<br />
i tried to rec it over 5 times but no sound recorded.<br />
a bit different and quite low pitch sounds were around which i recorded easily No problems at all.<br />
<br />
so i try to record that sound on my old Nokia 6630<br />
trust me guys result was same.<br />
<br />
i am really astonish and its quite strange why that loud sound of that tiny insect was not recordable on my both phones.<br />
on the other hand i was able to record bit different and quite low sounds around.<br />
<br />
can some one clear me ??????<br />
<br />
thanks.

            Sorry, I can't think of why it wouldn't record the cricket sound.<br />
<br />
The only thing that comes to mind is that the application is designed to record Voice, hence the name voice recorded. Voice is very funny in that it contains only information in the 400Hz to 4 Khz range.<br />
<br />
So in order to further optimize some voice codecs (like AMR) only record sounds in those ranges (or even lower like 500Hz -3000Hz), so maybe the Voice recorder only works for voice?, Maybe the cricket chirp is at higher frequencies than 3000Hz?<br />
<br />
Other than that I don't know...

            So far tested<br />
N95 8GB<br />
Nokia 6630<br />
Samsung D500<br />
Nokia 6230i<br />
Nokia N73<br />
<br />
No one succeeded to record that crickets voice.<br />
<br />
oh yes<br />
his sound is louder than all other voices of different crikets or insects.<br />
so maybe ur doubt is right that his chirpy sound frequency is higher than 3000hz

            just to expand on el_loco's theory, the phone record sounds within a certain range in an AMR format which is optimised for mobiles and they might have reduced the frequency range of sounds it will detect<br />
<br />
however with video recording, the phones record in a 3gp which can and will handle more data which is probably y it picked up the cricket sounds better

            Bottom line is you need something <i>other</i> than a Voice Recorder to record this sound.

            sorry to tell u guys<br />
that only N95 8GB can record that sound in high quality video.<br />
not in any lower quality or neither any other device can record that sound.

<h2>            Help&#33; A small vertical line keeps appearing every time I view MS Word in fullscreen on my MAC</h2>
                    So I recently just installed MS Office 2011 on my Macbook. When I type on word on a minimized window (so something that fits half the screen), I have no issues. However as soon as I maximize the window, I noticed that a small line that literally looks
 like a lowercase "l" appears on the page. No matter how many times I try to delete it, it will not go away. It also scrolls as you keep typing, and doesn't seem to stay in one spot. Can someone please help?! It's driving me crazy&nbsp;

            The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?<br />
<br />
The Second Question of Windows Troubleshooting: what is the malware/virus status of the machine? If you think it is clean, what programs (and versions) did you use to determine this?<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
One of the prime reasons for lack of Internet connectivity on Windows machines is malware infection.<br />
<br />
If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad). If possible, have all your data backed up before
 you take the machine into a shop.

<h3> stevejking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vba .calculate order in excel 2010</h2>
                    I have a Monte Carlo workbook that was written for 2003, but when I use it in 2010 I get different answers each time I run it, even when using a fixed seed (ie. same sequence of pseudo random numbers). Is this a problem with the .calculate vba instruction,
 how can I force it to calculate the same order of cells each time it recalculates? Thanks.

<br />
IMHO, your design should not depend on Excel's order of calculation of independent formulas.<br />
<br />
(The order of calculation of interdependent formulas should be no different, unless you purposely have circular references and you depend on iterative calculations.&nbsp; Not saying I know of any difference for the latter; but I know that iterative calculations
 are "eccentric" in general.)<br />
<br />
If you do want to control the order of independent calculations, I would suggest that you use a sequence of Range(...).Calculate or Sheets(...).Calculate statements instead of Application.Calculate.<br />
<br />
(I presume you have set manual calculation mode.)<br />
<br />
You might also study http://www.decisionmodels.com/calcsecretsc.htm to see if offers any insights.&nbsp; Notably, you might want to disable multithreading.<br />
<br />
(I vaguely recall that there was some change in by-row v. by-column order of calculation of independent cells.&nbsp; And I thought there is some way to control that order in VBA.&nbsp; But I cannot find that information at the moment.)<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
But I wonder if your assumptions about "a fixed seed" and "sequence of pseudo-random numbers" might be the culprit.<br />
<br />
We cannot seed the PRNG used by the Excel RAND and RANDBETWEEN functions.<br />
<br />
We can seed the VBA Rnd function.&nbsp; But that would not affect the .Calculate method unless you are returning VBA Rnd results using a VBA function called from Excel formulas.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, changes (corrections) in the Excel calculation engine have changed the number of times a formula is recalculated in some cases, ergo the number of times referenced VBA functions are called.&nbsp; So that might alter the sequence of random numbers.<br />
<br />
If you would like to discuss your assumptions about Excel/VBA PRNGs, please post some details about how you are generating the "same sequence of pseudo-random numbers".<br />

<p>Are you downloading from the download manager or the browser download?&nbsp; To check, open your microsoft account, click on profile and at the bottom there are 2 options, your safest option is to use the download manager.&nbsp; With download manager it downloads
 through a secure site and if for some reason you stop mid-download the download manager will restrt where you stopped.&nbsp; Hope this helped.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Hi Denny,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yeah, just stick it into a module and it'll work. To use it in a query, you just call the function as you would any other&nbsp;SQL function. Here's an example:</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT field1, field2, myNormSDist(field3) As Distribution</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM sometable</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE x = y</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But remember I said the code would need to be different if you have to get more than one distribution at the same time (like generating a distribution chart). If you use my code in a query against 100 records, it'll likely take
 200 seconds to run. Do it against 100,000 records and you're better to come back after lunch.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I also saw an error in the 2nd function I gave you. The 2nd function's name should be "myNormDist", not "myNormSDist".</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

ok i will try this.&nbsp; my next question will be.&nbsp; does the above get added into a module or where would i put it in access.&nbsp; and also how does the number populate in my query.&nbsp;do you add the module in the query in design mode.&nbsp;i am a little confused on that.

<div>I think what you mean is NORMSDIST, nor NORMDIST. Either way, Access doesn't them, but of course Excel does.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Public Function myNormSDist(Z As Double) As Double<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim xl As Excel.Application<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set xl = New Excel.Application<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myNormSDist = xl.WorksheetFunction.NormSDist(Z)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set xl = Nothing<br />
End Function</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But just in case you want NORMDIST, it's pretty much the same.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>'NOTE: Requires a reference to Microsoft Excel</div>
<div>Public Function myNormSDist(Z As Double, Mean As Double,&nbsp;Std_Dev As Double,&nbsp;Cumulative As Boolean) As Double<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim xl As Excel.Application<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set xl = New Excel.Application<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myNormDist = xl.WorksheetFunction.NormDist(X, Mean, Std_Dev, Cumulative)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set xl = Nothing<br />
End Function</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To add a reference to Excel, open any code module. Then select Tools | References. Then select Microsoft Excel x.x Object Library, and click OK.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The above procedures each take a while to run (in my tests, about 2 secs) because&nbsp;they have to create and destroy an instance of Excel, but it's OK if you only want to get the distribution once. The code would need to be different
 if you have to get more than one distribution (like generating a distribution chart).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let me know if you need something more flexible.</div>

    <title>Conditional formatting for entire column - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nate p.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional formatting for entire column</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm trying to create a Macro to incorporate a conditional formatting on column "A" based on its comparison with the corresponding value in column "B". If the value in one of the cells in Column A (say "A2") is less than its equivalent cell
 in column B (which would be "B2"), A2 should be highlighted in RED background color. I was able to get it working for specific cells, but I am not able to implement the same for the entire column A. Just to confirm, I don't want the entire column A to be red
 based on any one cell in that column. My requirement is that any cell in the column A should be highlighted in RED color, if it is lesser in value than the next cell in column B (same row). I would really appreciate it if anyone could help me in this regard.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Nate.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Office Free Trial &#38; Printing</h2>
                    <p>I have Win10 and recently bough an HP printer that was working fine. I installed the "Get Office free for one month" software yesterday and already regretting it.
</p>
<p>Printing a document that&nbsp;contains any logo's will only print the logo and none of the text in the document.&nbsp;I've spent all day on this &amp; even tried to&nbsp;go back to the old Word version as the default&nbsp;but&nbsp;Win 10 doesn't allow me to change it from Word 16!</p>
<p>I'm at my wits end and if I cant find a quick solution for this&nbsp;I be will uninstalling the free Office software. By the way, if anyone knows how to fix, I'm not very&nbsp;computer literate so would appreciate a step by step procedure to overcome this. Thanks,

<h2>            high data usage on iPhone app</h2>
                    <span>Hi,</span>
                    <span>Hi,</span>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been using the OneNote app (which, in generally, is great and I love it) on my iPhone 5S to edit and view text-only notebook pages, but my iPhone reports that it has used nearly 100 mb in data (and has led to a surcharge on my cellular
 data plan). I think there is something wrong with the program, as I can't imagine that using the app could have lead to this much data.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do remember opting in to send user data, and I wonder if this is a reason for the excessive data usage.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Could someone look into this, or do other people have a similar issue?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Jeremy</div>

            <p><font color="#000000">Hi Jeremy,
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Here is some quick background on how ONENOTE works. This is primarily a cloud based application. All your notebooks associated with your primary account (Microsoft account) gets stored
 in the cloud. <span>&nbsp;</span>Once you install the app on your device the following happens.</font></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
After sign in </p>
</li><li>
<p>
We talk to the cloud, download all the notebook information/ data down to your device. This is the initial syncing process. So if you have a notebook in the cloud which is about 100 MB, we download that data to your local device.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>
With all your data now locally available on the device, we then sync (up to cloud storage or down to your device) only for those changes that we make. This process usually depends on what changes you make. If you insert a picture from your device which is about
 10 MB then we sync that data to you cloud service </p>
</li></ol>
<p><font color="#000000">Opting into sending user data will not eat up your usage data. Like I mentioned the initial download would probably use most of your data usage, depending on the notebook size.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Hopefully this will help you understand some of the usage information you were looking for.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Subsequently editing pages and taking notes should not eat up much of your usage data. The main items that could eat up data usage mostly likely include images. If you are not sure about the size of data you are about to insert to OneNote,
 I would recommend using WiFi instead of your cellular data. <span>&nbsp;</span>Please feel free to ask away any question you may have on this.
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Thanks
</font></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Teams Assignments</h2>
                    <p>I love using assignments and will be using the export to excel feature to have a tracking record of homework and effort.&nbsp; I would like to share the work I have done with Teams with my colleagues so we can collaborate and share resources..</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this has led to a couple of issues:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">I have added pupils from another class but any assignments that I have already given out to all my pupils with old deadlines are showing up for the new pupils. Can I delete individual pupils from tasks or mark them as exempt
 after it has bees assigned?&nbsp; (This would also be relevant for a pupil who is new to the school or any pupil on long term absence).</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">I would like to group pupils e.g Miss Grant's pupils when assigning tasks, to save us from manually cherry picking from a long list of pupils taking the course.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;... and finally a very important request to make its use sustainable.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">&nbsp;Can I save assignments used this year so I can use them again next session with a new cohort of students?</span></p>

<p>Hello Grant,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply. Here are my answers to your questions: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Based on my tests, if you add a new student to an old Class, he will not see the previous assignments. So, please feel free to add news students to an existing Class.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. It is not feasible to group the students in Microsoft Teams. I think it is a good feature request. It is highly recommended to submit the feedback in
<a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/599053-schools-and-universities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Teams UserVoice</a> to help us improve the user experience. </p>

<p>
</p><p>3. You can create a new assignment based on an existing one. Click <strong>Create-&gt;From existing</strong>, and follow the prompts to choose one from a Class. Then you will be able to create a new assignment for the students based on the existing one.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any other problems when using Microsoft Teams, please feel free to post a new thread in our forum. We are pleased to help you.

<h3> tiro73  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio 2016 Wall resizing with an attached Dimension Controller not working</h2>
                    <p>I am using Visio 2016 Professional on Win 10 and want to sketch a room with 4 walls.</p>
<p>Creating a controller dimension to the walls endpoints works fine, but when I change the length of the dimension to match the size of the room I measured,&nbsp;the wall does not resize along with it, but the dimension scales out losing attachment to the wall.</p>
<p>Snap and Glue are all activated and the dimension glued to the wall shape. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is making it impossible to define precise inner wall lengths, and makes the whole dimension controller useless.
<br />
I am convinced this is a bug, or am I missing something?</p>

    <title>Start Button not working and ADSL modem&#47;router frequently dropping - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psybangas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Button not working and ADSL modem&#47;router frequently dropping out after mid February update.</h2>
                    <p>Okay so I've been running Windows 10 Technical Preview on 3 different devices (a HP laptop, desktop PC and HTPC), for a couple of months now with no real problems. Everything seems to run smoothly, and each device successfully upgraded to the latest build
 (that I'm aware of, being here in Australia) Build 9926.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, my troubles began around mid February when what seemed like a routine update suddenly began to cause problems with my home ADSL connection. I'm talking frequent drop outs, i.e. my Billion 7800N modem/ router began loosing connection with my ISP and
 reconnecting (only to disconnect soon after). It was very frustrating, and in particular I noticed that I'd lost Internet connectivity completely on the desktop PC that was connected via Ethernet cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially I thought it was trouble with my ISP and so began the tedious process of calling for technical support. Since I was travelling overseas in a couple of days, I didn't have much time to troubleshoot things apart from isolating the fact when I removed
 the 3 devices running Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 9926 the problem went away. I even changed hardware, using another modem/router I had lying around (Belkin F9J1102v1) just to be sure the problem wasn't my ISP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I returned from overseas and resumed using the devices only to discover now that the Start Button on the HP laptop was not working properly, and the drop outs were now occurring on both modem/ routers, with different filters tested, and even when the
 phone line was connected directly to the wall socket in a process of elimination. Alas at this point I was scratching my head wondering what the cause of all my problems were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I started researching the problem on this forum and found two posts that were very useful in providing me with a solution to my problems, so in a effort to share what I have learned here is what I found worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve the Internet connection drop outs, I simply reset the Winsock entries and TCP/IP stack by doing the following steps:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows Key + X together and select Command Prompt (run as Administrator),</li><li>Then type the following commands and hit enter after each:&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>netsh winsock reset catalog</p>
<p>netsh int ip reset reset.log hit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then flush your computer's DNS cache.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>ipconfig /flushdns ipconfig /registerdns</p>
<p>ipconfig /release</p>
<p>ipconfig /renew</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot the computer and check your Internet connection by doing a <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Speed Test</a>. This worked for me, i.e. no more drop outs! </p>
<p>
</p><p>And now to fix the Start Button not working issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to run (Windows + r)</li><li>type regedit and press enter.</li><li>click ok when notification window prompt.</li><li>Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER&gt;Software&gt;Microsoft&gt;Windows&gt;CurrentVersion&gt;Explorer&gt;Advanced</li><li>Create a DWORD with name: EnableXamlStartMenu</li><li>Give it value 0</li><li>Log off and login again.</li></ol>
<p>Your start menu should work now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not try this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on your Start menu button.</li><li>Click on search.</li><li>type: power shell.</li><li>right click on power shell from search results.</li><li>click run as administrator.</li><li>Execute code below:</li></ol>
<p>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again this worked for me, i.e. Start Button functionality returned!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why this happened, but hope this advice helps others out there (like myself), who were experiencing the same symptoms that I was. Any clues from Microsoft as to why this may have occurred would be greatly appreciated, as so far this is really the
 only issue I've had running Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>

    <title>Updating Tables, Press and hold esc key... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasperkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updating Tables, Press and hold esc key...</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having a problem with users receiving the message updating tables, press and hold the esc key to stop.&nbsp; This inevitably locks up the database, and requires that every user logout, so we can remove the lock files on the database. I've split the database
 Fe and BE sql, but that hasn't solved the problem.&nbsp; I also have users only use a dev version of the FE when they want to create new access objects, which helps with the problem most of the time.&nbsp; But it still persists.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>

            They are sharing a FE copy for data modifications (a production version), and any object development is happening on a separate Front End, but not an individual copy per user, no.&nbsp; Access to the database is through a Citrix Server.<br />

<p>Is this the only method for preventing these lockups?&nbsp; If so, might I ask how others are maintaining the consistency of each database.&nbsp; When changes to queries, forms, etc. how do you maintain those changes in every database?&nbsp; Changes happen daily in this
 case, so we'd have to manage the propagation of those changes quite often.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help regarding this.</p>

<p>Yes, each user should have their own individual frontend. Access will lock the database from other users if anyone is modifying a code-containing object, such as a form, report or module.</p>
<p>Tony Toews has an excellent frontend updater: <a href="http://www.granite.ab.ca/access" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.granite.ab.ca/access</a> and search for it there. Basically you need a "master copy" of the frontend that will get distributed to all users as needed. If you have many cooks with their spoons in the broth, you'll need some sort of administrative
 change control strategy to ensure that each user's great new features get into the "master copy" appropriately.</p>
<p>Of course if you're frequently making changes <em>just to queries</em> (e.g. changing the criteria) you should consider using Parameter Queries... but I suspect I'm preaching to the choir here.</p>

    <title>Table Referencing in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul f 1970  say:</h3>
<h2>            Table Referencing in Word</h2>
                    <p>I currently use Office 2003, and in Word the Caption function as part of Tables to title each of the tables I present in documents.&nbsp; However, I refer to the tables in the text, and largely construct the document in "random" order with blocks of text etc
 being placed all through the document&nbsp; Thus what is Table 1 at the beginning can end up as Table 3 at the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way of linking the Table reference in the text to the actual table number so as the Table number changes so does the in-text reference?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            Switching to Print Preview and back will update cross-reference fields as well. (I'm assuming that you inserted cross-references via References tab | Cross-reference.)<br />
<br />
However, you must be careful when dealing with cross-referenced items. When you create a cross-reference, Word encloses the referenced item in a hidden bookmark. Later, if you add content at the beginning of a cross-referenced/bookmarked paragraph, the bookmark
 will expand and include the added content. To work around this issue, always add new paragraph at the end of a bookmarked paragraph (not at the beginning).<br />
<br />
To fix an existing incorrect cross-reference, delete and re-insert it.

    <title>Macro to Fill in All Blanks &#40;Empty Cells&#41; with a Period - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Macro to Fill in All Blanks &#40;Empty Cells&#41; with a Period</h2>
                    Greetings!<br />
<br />
Could one of the gurus on this forum help me by creating a macro that can do the following?<br />
<br />
I need to <br />
<br />
1) select several columns,<br />
2) fill in all empty cells in these selected columns with a period,<br />
3) stop working when it reaches row 78214 (the last row of data on my spreadsheet)<br />
<br />
The reason I want to do this is because I am using a pivot table and empty cells are unacceptable.<br />
<br />
I suppose I could fill these blank cells with something other than a period. Any good suggestions? If not, I will go with the simple period.<br />
<br />
I would deeply appreciate your help in this matter.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blank cells are acceptable when using Pivot Tables - what feature of a Pivot Table are you not able to use because of blanks in your Source data?&nbsp; As far as I know, as long as no entries in the Header row are blank, Pivot Table should get created easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, to fill in blank/empty cells with dots, use Find and Replace (Ctrl+H).&nbsp; Leave the Find what box empty and in the Replace with box, type .&nbsp; Click on Replace All.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

And now the requested "guru" has arrived!&nbsp; ;o)
