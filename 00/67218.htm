            <p>Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.</p>
<p>Once you reach the desktop, click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Activation</p>
<p>Click the link x days until activation.</p>
<p>Click the link that says 'Show me other ways to activate'</p>
<p>Enter product key</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Select Phone Activation</p>
<p>Click Next when Enter your key page displayed</p>
<p>Select your country</p>
<p>Click Next, call the number listed</p>
<p>Remember to explain to the call agent your situation.</p>
<p>Provide the generated installation ID when requested by the call agent</p>
<p>They will give you a confirmation ID in return, enter it</p>
<p>Click Next to complete the activation. </p>
<p>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.</p>

            The fee for Gold covers the multiplayer costs (servers, etc), so it wouldn't be fair to make only a portion of multiplayer users pay when a whole other group gets to play multiplayer for free. 'Free to play' means that the developer won't charge you to
 play, but the providers of a multiplayer service (like Xbox, or your ISP) will charge for the multiplayer connection.

<h2>            Unable to &#34;Personalize&#34; my computer</h2>
                    <p>I have been unable to change the background on my computer for months. Yesterday I then decided to update my computer to Windows 10. I was surprised to see the message this morning that I still could not change my background.</p>
<p>The exact message that I am getting is: "You need to activate windows before you can personalize your pc"</p>
<p>I don't think that it is fair that you will have to buy something from Microsoft just so that you can change your background.</p>
<p>Anyone know how to fix this problem?</p>

    <title>Programs Running in Task Manager but not displaying on screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonmercado  say:</h3>
<h2>            Programs Running in Task Manager but not displaying on screen &#40;Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>For the past few months I have been having a problem with a few programs not launching when I run them. They still show up in the task manager under Background Processes and not Apps and take up a bit more CPU. The programs that I have noticed that are affected
 are Origin and GlyphInstall as well as two games on including Total War: Shogun 2 and Rift (which runs off Glyph so it is understandable). I have tried all I can from Running As Administrator to Compatibility Mode but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My GeForce Game Ready Driver is fully updated (347.88). However, over the past few updates there has been a possibly related problem. Whenever I install a new driver from the NVIDIA GeForce Experience program, i would get an error saying "Installation cannot
 continue" with not explanation following. I would have to download the driver from the NVIDIA website to update my driver. I do a clean install every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The oddest part is that these problems never used to exist as Origin worked fine and I have yet attempted to install Glyph or play those games at the time. I cannot pinpoint an exact time these problems occured but my guess is around November and i have
 had this computer since July.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps, these are my PC's specs:</p>
<p>GPU: GeForce GTX 760</p>
<p>CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU 3.60GHz</p>
<p>Memory:16GB (15.94 usable)<br />
OS: Windows 8.1</p>
<p>As well as two 1TB Hard Drives</p>
<p>and Two Monitors (1980 x 1080 ASUS VS247 &amp; 1280 x 1024 Generic Non-PnP Monitor, both at 60Hertz)</p>

    <title>Un-bootable after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dphmhb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Un-bootable after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Twice, in recent weeks, my computer has been left un-bootable after a windows update.</p>
<p>I've managed to fix it on both occasions but I'm not entirely sure how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is, after the initial part of the install and the automatic reboot, my primary boot device (Samsung 950pro in a M.2 slot) is lost. I either boot into BIOS or get a `not a valid boot device` message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the BIOS my 950 is (initially) not there in the Boot Options (though it has become available after a few attempts), only the DVD and one (of two) other hard drives available for selection. The DVD has been reset to the primary and the other HD set to
 secondary</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's all well and good when my 950 does become available for selection but given this has happened twice now I'm concerned that the next time it will remain unavailable (invisible) to select as a boot device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are windows updates affecting my BIOS in the first place? surely the should not!</p>
<p>I'm now dreading the `Restart Required` message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I wrote this question because my father in law can not write it. He can not speak in english. The problem is that he can not communicate with my daughter. Both have each other in contacts book. If one sends message to other, message is not delivered.</p>
<p>I checked that contacts are correct and my daughter does not have my father in law in blocked contacts. We tried to search contact by mobile phone in contacts book and send message but without response. The other contact not see this message. Only their
 own.</p>
<p>We tried to delete contact a add as new. But it also not helped.</p>
<p>Both can communicate with other contacts without problem but not each other. Any advice?</p>
<p>I would be pleased for your help.</p>

<h3> chiques8675309  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 to Windows 10 Remote Desktop Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 machine which I remote desktop connect to often. In it current configuration I am able to initiate a Remote Desktop Session with the following platforms:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>My Windows 8 &nbsp;Phone</li><li>My Ubuntu Desktop (Using Remmina)</li></ol>
<p>The problem is isolated to my Windows 8.1 PC. I have verified the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote connections are allowed on the remote PC</li><li>The remote PC is authorized to allow any PC to log on</li><li>The remote PC is powered on</li></ul>
<p>Ref:&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/remote-desktop-app-faq#1TC=windows-8&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried going to:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>in the registry to clear the cache'd log ins as well. I also deleted <strong>Default.rpd&nbsp;</strong>in my Documents as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>When I try to log in to the Windows 10 machine, the connection is established but the login is not being accepted (keep in mind I used this login using RDP on my Windows Phone and my Ubuntu PC). For some reason it does not accept my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

    <title>Cannot &#34;Generate System Health Report&#34; &#40;i.e., TIME-OUT - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot &#34;Generate System Health Report&#34; &#40;i.e., TIME-OUT problem&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Windows Vista Ultimate 64-Bit OS (on enthusiast-built hardware).</p>
<p>My problem: When I go to <strong>Control Panel / System and Maintenance / Performance Information and Tools / AdvancedTools</strong> and click on<strong>Generate a System Health Report</strong> , it does the following:</p>
<p>1. Collecting Data for 60 seconds... (as normal)</p>
<p>2. Generating Report... (as normal)</p>
<p>3. "<strong>Error:</strong> An error occurred while attempting to generate a report", also "<em>The wait for the report generation tool has timed-out</em> ."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a montage|screenshot of each of these as they appeared to me:</p>
<p>http://i275.photobucket.com/albums/jj307/eyeam2000/SystemHealthReportTimesOut.jpg</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After researching on the internet, I did the following:</p>
<p>1. I opened the command prompt and ran as administrator, to do the System File Checker (i.e., sfc /verifyonly" and "sfc /scannow"). When it discovered an integrity problem with a file called "mpssvc.dat" it repaired it. I ran the scanner several times, once
 with the Vista DVD in the drive (but it apparently didn't need it, and got it from some 'store' on the hard drive), and fixed what it found. The last scan revealed no problem with "mpssvc.dat", which was apparently related to "C:\windows\System32\LogFiles\Firewall"
 (though the exact address it gave was way too long and I didn't write it down. Firewall is interesting, though--the last Update to my machine was for Windows Defender, which is tied-in with the firewall, and seemed to have had some problem installing at the
 time (this past week), though everything with Defender appears to be running fine.</p>
<p>2. I used the Windows Vista DVD to do a Repair, and also check the hardware|memory. No problems there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea what is causing the System Health Report to fail (i.e., TIME-OUT), nor do I know how to increase the time-out (if that is what is needed...?) This June saw a lot of Microsoft Updates (around June 10th; with a Definition Update on the 11th,
 too), and a new Defender update this week. The only thing I've experienced prior to not being able to Generate A Health Report was a curious glitch after watching videos online through the browser--every time I watch a video online, if I do not move the mouse,
 everything lapses into a locked gui and goes to the Password Screen. It's like going into screensaver mode without a screensaver (and my screensaver has been set to "none"). This goes away, however, when I go back in and re-apply the "none" setting for the
 screensaver (in the desktop properties area). So, my thinking is, again...it is something related to the "TIME-OUT".</p>
<p>Could Windows Defender have been installed to where it works, but was installed in a way that messed up something? Would an uninstall and re-install of Defender help?</p>
<p>My Reliability and Performance Index is currently 9.09. (seems it always drops when I get a Microsoft Update--and the index was 9.80 on the 14th). Somewhere between the last batch of Microsoft Updates (and Defender Update) and now...was when the System Health
 Report quit generating.</p>
<p>Any ideas? How do I get my System Health Reports generating again? What do I do about this time-out thing?</p>

<p><span>Hello EyeAmSMF,</span></p>
<p><span>Give a try with the following:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if the below services are started or not:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Performance
 Logs and Alerts.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Problem
 Reports and Solutions Control Panel Support.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Workaround:</span></p>
<p><span>Try<strong>Reliability and Performance Monitor</strong>, which will allow you to generate and view a report which is as similar to
<p><span>While inside the Reliability and Performance Monitor:</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Expand the ‘Data Collection Sets’ folder;</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Right click on ‘User Defined’;</span></p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Select ‘New’,</span></p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Select ‘Data Collector Set’,</span></p>
<p><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Provide a name for the new data collector set,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Ensure that ‘Create from a template’ is selected,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click ‘Next’,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>iii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Choose ‘System Diagnostic’ or ‘System Performance’ (Membership in Local Administrators group, or equivalent, is the minimum required to run this Data Collector Set.),</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>iv.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click ‘Finish’.</span></p>
<p><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Right click the new collection set,</span></p>
<p><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click ‘Start’.
</span></p>
<p><span>To view the data graphically or in the report format:</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Expand the ‘Reports’ folder;</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Expand the ‘User Defined’ folder;</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Expand the name of the newly created collection set;</span></p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There should be two reports inside the folder displaying year/month/date and serial # of report,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The first is the graphical display,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second will be in the report format.</span></p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click on the second report to view.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<h2>            My Pointing Device &#40;mouse&#41; is EXTREMELY Slow After Update</h2>
                    <p>I already went to the device settings and turned it up as fast as it can go. It is painful to have to swipe twice as much to get the cursor from one side of the screen to the other. Why can't it move as fast as it did in Windows 8.0? (This was supposed to
 be a business day for me so I'm furious Windows forced me to update then figure out my new settings.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make matters worse, my pointing device used to have the ability to scroll up and down within windows by placing two fingers on the touch pad. Now I can't even do that. I want my settings back ASAP!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>The update should not have caused this, something clearly went wrong.&nbsp; I bet that the touchpad driver process is not running at startup.&nbsp; For example, most Dell laptops ship with touchpads built by the Synaptics company, and a little touchpad app stays running
 in the taskbar near the clock.&nbsp; It is this app process that provides the features like scrolling and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this were my PC, I would go to support.dell.com and download the touchpad driver and install it again.</p>

            <p>It's a Lenovo. Browsed around online and tried some recommendations. Ended up uninstalling things and now have lost my touchpad and pointing device completely! So much for a productive workday!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no info on how to reinstall, let alone achieve the original settings, anywhere online. Just a bunch of moves backwards that accomplish nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Microsoft for interfering with a busy day! I would have gone with a Mac if I wanted to be told what I have to install and, more importantly, WHEN I HAVE TO INSTALL a complete system update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I'll tell you what went wrong during the update: I have extremely slow internet. Would have taken days to install all 18 updates. So I turned off my computer so I could restart it and get back to work. Thanks again for ruining my workday Windows. I''ll
 be lucky to get anything done this week)</p>

            <p>I can understand the frustration man, but please remember no one here works for Microsoft.&nbsp; It's just a community where I and others try to help out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update is definitely worth installing, but if you didn't have time I would have clicked the "not right now" button when it offered to install it.</p>

            <p>Yeah. It's gone. Tried to see if there were driver updates but updating the drivers removed the touchpad. Completely gone in the device section. Luckily Lenovo IdeaPad Yogas have touch screens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hope was that someone from Microsoft will see the frustration this has caused. I did keep clicking "not right now" since it was released. Internet is too slow for such an update where I'm staying. However, this time the computer only gave a 15 minute
 warning before a forced reboot where a forced 8.1 upgrade began.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Did you upgrade your laptop from store? Mine dell laptop too had same thing. Changed speed and lost its native scroll gesture. All you had to do was to change some very simple touchpad settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for now, since you have uninstalled some drivers (as far as I interpret the situation) and installed new ones, you have lost your touchpad.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion, there is only one solution but due to your internet speed it may not be possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall the&nbsp;touchpad driver from programs and features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the driver from Lenovo's site.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/default.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/default.page</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>then we can change settings like speed and gestures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DOWNLOAD THE DRIVER THAT WEBSITE GIVES YOU AND NOT THE UPDATED ONE. When I tried to install an updated driver, it killed my touchpad. And unfortunately, I didn't have a touchscreen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the procedure if possible and reply. If it works, I can guide you through settings.</p>

            <p>Not really important for the present issue, but did you know that when you get the prompt to install the update, the actual internet use is already done?&nbsp; It downloads little by little in the background, sometimes over several weeks or months, using something
 called BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service), and so once you got that prompt, the download was finished, your Internet speed no longer played a role in the update at all.&nbsp; Food for thought.</p>

<h2>            wireless printer&#47;laptop</h2>
                    I am trying to connect my printer to my laptop but I cannot get it to work. I am in a dorm connected to the free wifi on my surface pro 2 and am trying to connect a printer to my laptop. the printer is a canon mp620 but I have no idea how to connect to
 my laptop. I don't have a router, and I don't know if I need one - I just have my laptop and the printer. How do I connect this printer because I need it for schoolwork sooner rather than later.

<p>Well, you will need to use a USB cable in your case.&nbsp; A wireless printer actually connects to the router and not the computer.&nbsp; The computer sends the job to the router, which in turn, sends the job to the printer and the computer gets a feedback that it
 is doing the job, job status, ink levels, out of paper, and when it is finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cable only costs a couple of dollars and you can get those almost anywhere.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If preinstalled, you can also&nbsp;contact your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.

<h2>            Win 8.1 Logon with a newly created user&#58; The use profile Service service failed the logon, User profile can not be loaded</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to create a new user profile on my windows 8.1 system. When I try to log in to this account this error message appears:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to fix this issue with this kb article:</p>
<p>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947215/en-us</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, that there are no registry entries for the new user. There is also no profile folder under c:\users. c:\users\default is accessible by all users with full privileges. I've also tried to create the user with the build-in administrator account.
 No virus scanner is active. In the event log entries with id 1500 and 1511 are created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the user creation fails at some point. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone has an idea how to solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error may also occur if the user profile folder was deleted manually. A profile folder that is manually deleted does not remove the Security Identifier (SID) from the profile list in the registry.</p>
<p>Follow these steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>log into the built-in Administrator account you enabled.</li><li>Try a System Restore to when things were working. If you can log into your own user account, you're finished. Otherwise continue at Step 3.</li><li><span>&nbsp;</span>The critical files are under %systemdrive%\users\user-account\ntuser. The ntuser.dat file is actually a registry hive. Run Regedit elevated and select HKEY_USERS and "load hive" from the menu. Now navigate to:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList<br />
<br />
There is one line for each profile. If a profile is bad, check:<br />
<br />
a) That the key name doesn't end in ".bak" (remove .bak if there)<br />
b) That the RefCount value is 0 (change it if different)<br />
c) That the State value is 0 (change if different)<br />
<br />
Make any necessary changes, close Regedit and try to log in as that user.<br />
<br />
6. If that doesn't fix your profile, it is corrupted. At that point you should make a new Standard user account and copy your data to it. Do not delete the old account until you have retrieved the data you need!<br />
<br />
Once everything is working, log into the extra administrative account you will make per the suggestions below and disable the built-in Administrator account again for security purposes:<br />
<br />
Click Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Registry disclaimer</span></strong></p>
<p>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added
 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<p>
</p><p>There is no registry entry for the new user and I cannot go back to a restore Point, because it never worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time I've reinstalled Windows. Creating of&nbsp;users does work now. Maybe the Installation was corrupt.

</p><p>If I enable the built-in Administrator I can log in into that account and also perform any installation that uses Windows Installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow I think these are connected to the same problem. My guess it that there is some corrupted registry entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: No I do not have any additional security software installed, only the built in Windows Defender.</p>

            It's about time Microsoft took responsibility for providing operating systems with serious bugs. I have same problem on my new Acer laptop with Windows 8.1. It has taken me age to get rid of all the junk provided and try to set it up where I am in control
 and not some Big Brother MS. ie. One local account with no password and one linked to MS&nbsp; using my MS sign-on (eg Skype, App store), both as Administrator. It was OK one day&nbsp; for my MS sign-on but not the next.. I have tried deleting that account and setting
 it up again but something stops me with same message as first contributor. I spent 30 years as a software developer and it is unbelievable that MS produce such rubbish software and let it loose on the general public. I really believe that MS should be providing
 a one click fix and not expect us to mess around with registry. Rant over.<br />

            <p>Just finished doing today's (18Jun 2014) MS Windows 8.1 Updates and thought I would retry setting up Account again. The one that 'lost' its profile. Lo and behold it worked. So it looks as if the MS Windows update on&nbsp; 16Jun&nbsp; (and possibly earlier versions
 of Windows 8.1) was delivered that could not handle multiple accounts (I set up the 2nd account on the 17thJune).</p>
<p>What a shambles. I've wasted a day chasing my tail trying to follow suggested solutions.</p>
<p>Hopefully they will sack the incompetent programmer. That's what I would have done as a Software development manager in the 1980's and 90's.</p>

<p>I just encountered the same issue on a new laptop. After digging around Google for a while I found the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could be due to the Default User Profile not copying properly to create the new User because of some folder permissions blocking the process. Someone suggested that you toggle hidden files on to see the Default folder in C:\Users, then access the
 folder security and permissions, tick the box to redistribute the rights down to all the child folders.</p>

<h2>            How to restore Windows Mail in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>WINDOWS MAIL IN WINDOWS 7__HOW DO I RESTORE WINDOWS MAIL IN WINDOWS 7?</p>
<p><br />
I installed Windows 7 Ultimate myself roughly a year ago after running Windows Vista Ultimate. Windows Mail was in 7 just as it was in Vista since day one. It may have been shortly after an update, I'm not sure, but I went to use it and it was completely gone.
 I found a programs folder for it, but nothing seems to bring it back to life. I've even tried to restore the programs folder from an image backup and nothing seems to happen. I don't like Windows Live Mail, besides I had a lot of customizations in Windows
 Mail not to mention drafts, and emails I wanted to keep. Where did it go? A deep search can't seem to locate any of the folders, even in the backup image. It's quite possible I lost it previous to the back up, as I don't use my email program every day, but
 I do image my hard drive each night. What can I do? I know someone has probably covered the topic successfully in the forums somewhere, but I can't seem to successfully find the exact answer I need. Recovering my folders aside, isn't there a way to reinstate
 Windows Mail in 7, since there seems to be a root for it buried in the system? Thanks! Robb</p>

    <title>Why does my Windows 10 Pro licence keep deactivating - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does my Windows 10 Pro licence keep deactivating</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having this issue with Windows activation for a few months now at least, just wondering if someone can explain why and how to stop it from happening in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every now and again I will see faint wording on my desktop telling me to activate my copy of Windows 10. I click on the activate Windows link in the system section of control panel, then have to click the troubleshoot link in Windows 10 settings. After a
 few seconds it states my copy of Windows 10 has been activated. However, at a random point in time, the faint wording on my desktop will appear again and I will have to go through the whole process again. This can happen at any time, sometimes a day or two
 later, sometimes up to a week or more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone explain why this is happening and how I can stop this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice, thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Yeah, it looks like you will have to go back to Windows 7, but that Windows 7 license actually entitles you to Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Which edition of Windows 10 is listed on the sticker?
<br />
<br />If its Windows 7 Home Premium/Basic, you can install Windows 10 Home.
<br />If its Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate, then you are in luck, just use the product key to update the product key values in the current installation.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate
<br />
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt chat support:

            <p>Please see the following instructions thanks to Amrita M, Microsoft Support, Moderator:</p>
<p>...you may check if you are able to boot in safe mode. To boot in safe mode first remove the Windows 7 DVD from the drive and press F8 key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Check if you are able to boot to the desktop now. If you are able to boot to the desktop without any error message, go to device manager and disable the display adapters and check if you are able to boot into normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you get an error message saying that ‘installation cannot be completed in safe mode’, then press Shift+F10 key. That will open Command Prompt, from command prompt open Device Manager by typing ‘devmgmt.msc’ in the command prompt and then disable the display
 adapters and check if you are able to boot in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If this allows you to boot to the normal mode and complete the installation process then go ahead and first update the display adapter drivers from the manufacturer’s website and check if the computer works fine.</p>

    <title>Optional Update &#34;Upgrade to Windows 10 Home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denmarfl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Optional Update &#34;Upgrade to Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows7 32 Bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Reserved Windows 10 and the Flag Icon has been in the TaskBar....opening it over the past 2 weeks it showed Reserve Confirmation....and PC Meet all requirements.....so that part of the Upgrade ran fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I noticed the Win10 Icon was gone in the Taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Windows Update and in the <strong>Optional Updates</strong> I have an Optional Update "Upgrade to Windows 10 Home". &nbsp;When I click on More information it opens a Window "Before you install Windows Insider Preview" and refers to Download and install
 only if you want to <strong>Try Software still in development</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes no sense to me...I did nothing to request a Preview version of 10 and as I wrote I properly reserved Win10 and this PC met all requirements. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this Update downloaded in ERROR? Or is this what I should have gotten as the next step to get the 10 Upgrade and should install this Optional Update. &nbsp;(Problem may be moot...I unchecked this Optional Update to prevent it from installing and reopen Windows
 Update and its checked..again...did it 3 to 4 times, same results, its always checked...again)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did I lose the Win10 Flag Icon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do...I do want Win10 and had expected to see the Notification any day that Win10 was ready to Install (since the actual Upgrade Install is started manually by users when they are ready to run the Upgrade). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE</p>
<p>Since this Optional Update would not remain Unchecked, and would have Installed at Shutdown, I went forward and run Windows Update. It showed downloading Windows 10....and while it was doing this I went to C:\ and saw the download was creating the Win10
 Install Foder C:\$Windows.~BT so I thought all was well, all that was taking place was the Win10 Install Files. &nbsp;But I was wrong. &nbsp;After the download completed the License displayed, I selected Accepted.....than I was given a choice to Install Now or schedule
 the Install for a different time today, tomorrow or the day after, no other choices....like, install when you are ready. &nbsp;All that I read about the Win10 Upgrade was that it would download and users choose when to install....and you had up to 1yr to run the
 Install to upgrade for free. &nbsp;So nothing appeared to be going as I had read. &nbsp;I went ahead and selected Install Now....the Install ran....phase Copying Files completed, Phase 2 Installing Drivers completed.....on Reboot from Phase 2....PC began Phase 3...Configuring
 and than a message Popped up about a Memory issue...quickly went off and the next thing it showed was restoring to previous Configuration...that completed and I was back to my original Win7. &nbsp;Windows Update opened by itself, and it showed the Optional Upgrade
 to Windows 10 Update...again. &nbsp;I decided to install\run this Update again, maybe I was missing something, even though the Win 10 reservation had shown the PC meet all requirements.... &nbsp;It ran &nbsp;again, it ran exactly as it did the 1st attempt, got to 75% complete,
 Configuring ....this time it didn't display anything....just re-started and showed Restoring Previous Configuration...and again, back to Win7 with Windows Update Displaying over top of the Win7 desktop and showing the same Optional Update...Upgrade to Windows
 10. &nbsp;I was able to close Windows Update Window clicking on "X". &nbsp;I did check Windows Update History, it shows Upgrade to Windows 10....twice...both times FAILED. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran Windows Update....again, Upgrade to Windows 10 Home....and its checked..... &nbsp;I'm in a loop.....I keep getting the Upgrade to Windows 10 Home Optional Upgrade when I check or PC checks for Windows Updates...when I run this Update.....it download and attempts
 to Install....I get to 75% Configuring....and than restoring to previous Configuration...back to Win 7......</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the Get Windows 10 Falg Taskbar Icon.....It shows Reservation -Confirmed (It gray); It shows that Download-In Progress "Windows 10 is downloading in the background we'll let you know when you can start the Upgrade....and the last item in
 the list is....Upgrade-Coming soon (Its Gray). &nbsp;When I click on VIEW DOWNLOAD PROGRESS.....another window opens.....GWXUX has stopped working ...windows can check online for a solution to the problem......I click Check Online....the GWXUX window closes...no
 return information is received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its clear this Upgrade is now just in a Loop....the Upgrade Optional Update is present, checked, I uncheck it, close Win Update...re-open it, its checked.....twice I try to run the Upgrade...it doesn't allow me decide when to run the Upgrade, the Upgrade
 has run Twice...stopping at 75% Configuring and than back to the Previous Image...Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do...What to Do....it certainly should not be working this way and do hope there is help out here to resolve this issue. &nbsp;I was looking forward to a smooth upgrade...and got none of it...thus far. &nbsp;I would prefer not to do a clean Install.....that
 means wiping out personal data...and there is lots on the PC....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I wipe out the GXW in Windows, the GXW in Scheduler......the 2 required KB Updates ...basically wipe all the pre stuff downlaoded and install on the PC making it ready for Win10 Upgrade...and perhaps the entire Pre-process would start all over.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help! &nbsp;Shouldn't be this difficult....just my bad luck?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>I sure hope there is an answer; my PC just keeps running in the Loop.....turned it on and it has started by itself a 3rd attempt to upgrade from Win7 32Bit SP1 to Win 8 Home.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are copies of the error messages from prior failed attempts from Installed History/View details and, when I click On Windows 10 Flag...Progress of Download</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For me this process hasn't been good. &nbsp;I have 3 other PC's that up until 7/28 or 7/29 showed the Win10 Upgrade Icon...and all showed PC's met all Requirements....but the Upgrade Icon's are GONE. &nbsp;So on those PC's I have nothing to see the Status of the Upgrade...ie,
 waiting, downloading, ready to install...etc. &nbsp;And on 2 I did get OK, Notify me when Ready which I clicked on...so I was feeling good, all was working....but now, today.....nothing is working. &nbsp;PC as I write is running Upgrade for the 3rd time (and whats annoying
 is it started all by itself)...so the LOOP continues...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE....</strong></p>
<p>3rd time completed...same exact results. &nbsp;Upgrade Terminated at 75% Complete, Configuring Phrase.....this time I may have caught the screen reporting possible issie....I saw the screen display collecting error information...and quickly I think what I saw

</p><p>Again, PC reservation showed PC Met all requirements.....Updating from Win7 32bit; Intel Core Duo CPU &nbsp;2.00GHz; &nbsp; 3GB Memory, 172GB Free space on HHD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help....not a good start and I am holding off on the Upgrade of my 2 other PC's.....because I don't want them to be continuing to Loop as is this Laptop....annoying.</p>

            <p>he PC subject of this POST; I upgraded after 3 to 4 Failed attempts, I did research that referred to 000.fcl....found one tiny file with this name in Cyberlink/PowerDVD.....decided to Uninstall the PowerDVD......did registry Clean, Temp clean....turned off
 Microsoft Sec Essentials.....used online download again...this time it went past 75%. &nbsp;When it booted to Win10 Desktop....it clocked\Circled for almost 40 mins before I decided nothing could take that long. &nbsp; I started to try to click on some items, move the
 mouse and things started to display, like Taskbar items, etc. And slowly the PC completed its full boot to Windows10...but that Desktop completion took almost 1 Hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have UNKNOWN DEVICES in my Device Manager List...Hardware id shows it to be my Network Printer. &nbsp;The Printer is also listed under Imaging which it should be bit expanding Imaging...it shows Printer and about 5 UNKNOWN Devices. &nbsp;<strong>What's this
 all about and is there a Fix?</strong></p>
<p>Now I am waiting for PC 2 of 4 that I own to alert me that the Upgrade is ready. &nbsp;Get Windows10 shows "OK, Notify me when ready..... &nbsp; I see the Windows Download Folder C:\$Windows.~BT. &nbsp;I see in Windows Update History....Upgrade to Windows
 10 Home......over the past 4 days....9 attempts to run and all Failed with Code 80240020. &nbsp;I would really like to experience this upgrade run by itself (except for my final OK to install once alerted its ready). &nbsp;But how long is waiting long enough? &nbsp;1 week,
 2 weeks....? How many Failures via the automated process, I have 9 now.....how many is enough to where this process just isn't going to run?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be missing? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't let this reply go unanswered by Microsoft.....since you have already responded and hopefully have a marker to get back to me you will see this update...and provide a detailed response. &nbsp;Thank You&nbsp;</p>

<br />404 is usually a file/webpage not found error within a web browser &amp; can mean the url was mistyped, the page has been removed or there's a problem with the site.

<h2>            canoscan 3000F Drivers for windows XP</h2>
                    After years of working well, my Canoscan 3000F will not work . I am running Windows XP and it appears that the PC no longer recognises the Scanner. I have uninstalled and re-installed the programme to no avail.<br />
Any suggestions ?<br />
