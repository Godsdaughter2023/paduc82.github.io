    <title>Internet Explorer Address Bar will not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan giusti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer Address Bar will not work</h2>
                    <p>Running on a Windows 7 64bit SP1 machine fully updated. Scanned for malware, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue:<br />
Typing out a url in the address bar in Internet Explorer 11 does not navigate. We just observe circle icon spinning (and twitching sometimes). I've noticed that I can get to sites using desktop shortcuts, but clicking on any links on any page produces the same
 issue. Nothing in the group policy was changed recently that we're aware of. The behavior only manifests on this one workstation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we've tried:</p>
<p>-resetting the advanced IE settings</p>
<p>-running IE with no addons</p>
<p>-Resetting IE and rebooting</p>
<p>-Checking that IE is the default browser and its file associations</p>
<p>-Downgrading to IE8 and reinstalling IE8 and reinstalling up to the latest version</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue manifests on earlier versions of IE (9 and 10) as well. Internet explorer is the default browser and I've checked the program defaults.</p>

<h2>            Action Items in Outlook</h2>
                    How do I program for Action Items in Outlook? Right now when I send an HTML the Outlook renders an unsubscribe button (as an Action Item) but the button does not work. Is there something I can include in my email to make the Action Item work?

            That picks up the unsubscribe link in the message header.  Although I'm not sure it's working - my newsletter uses this format in the header and the link doesn't work here. List-Unsubscribe: &lt;<a href="https://unsubscribe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://unsubscribe</a> link&gt;
<br />I get a dialog that says it doesn't have unsubscribe information. 
<br />
<br />According to this: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41266990/how-to-make-the-unsubscribe-link-in-outlook-work-for-newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41266990/ho...</a>, the unsubscribe link needs to contain the user's email address - my links use a GIUD identifying the subscriber.

            Thank you for responding. So after looking at the list-Unsubscribe link you provided, the next question will this work with vb script being used to generate the recipients name, email address, and unsubscribe page?

            As long as the script generates the header and adds a ‘properly formatted’ list-unsubscribe entry in the smtp header, it should work. <br /><br />If your list software processes email with unsubscribe in the Subject field, that link would be perfect. <br /><br />I use sendy, a php application, to generate bulk mail but it doesn’t add the mailto in the list-unsubscribe header line, only the http part. Outlook.com’s unsub link doesn’t work with this. i might look at changing it, just for kicks, but don’t want to manually unsubscribe people. :(

<h2>            Sudden influx of spam into inbox</h2>
                    A couple of days ago my inbox began to be flooded constantly with junk mail, spam, you name it.&nbsp; All emails of this type used to go straight to my junk mail.&nbsp; All of the addresses they are sent from are randomly generated and different so impossible to
 type them all in to use the rules feature.&nbsp; I saw elsewhere on this forum other people have had this same issue and the response was it was an outage somewhere on Microsofts end and you are working on it.&nbsp; Can you please help and let me know when this will
 be resolved?&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;

            <p>i also have same issue.</p>
<p>I found this problem on Windows phone 8.1. After phone freeze cannot turn on/ off with power button and cannot be charged&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to restart by hard reset (vol down+pwr btn)</p>
<p>Phone able to boot up and charge battery, but after that i found it won't save picture no matter use which software to take photo.</p>
<p>When restart, sms which i didn't read keeping alert. Even if open to read, it won't remember that I've read it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep trying other options, factory reset will be the last choice.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No, unfortunately this is not the issue. The problem arises from a keychain problem, and the only way to clear it up is to delete the existing keychain, starting afresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally got Office 365 to behave nicely after re-formatting my hard drive. I decided it was time to do a clean instal of everything, and rid the root Library and user libraries of all the smegma that builds accumulates when uninstals of old software only
 go part of the way to removing useless files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that most software is downloaded from the developer's sites, we are liberated from the obstacle course of inserting CDs and painful authentication of software we already own. Do prepare by making backups and additional copies of all folders so you
 can go look to verify what to copy across and what not to.</p>

<h2>            Skype Meeting Broadcast regkey</h2>
                    <p>According to this page, there is a regkey for broadcast audio mode that will optimize audio for Skype for Business when the audio source is a professional audio mixer or some other external audio source, https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Best-practices-for-Skype-Meeting-Broadcast-18b02fc1-02be-4229-af3b-1e794af58875.</p>

<p>Thanks Allison. &nbsp;I have added the key and rebooted, but the audio quality is still very poor. &nbsp;It doesn't seem like the regkey had any affect. &nbsp;Did I configure it correctly?</p>

<p>Hello Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems right. Did this user use his current credential to log into Skype for Business? Quit Skype for Business and then delete the sign-in information,&nbsp;&nbsp;go to %localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\ , remove folder with name sip_username completely.
 (Note: 16.0 means you are using Skype for Business 2016 version).</p>

            <p>Hi Evan</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are still in the very early stages of the Win 10 preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure that the developers have a good idea about the future compatibility components, but they will not be announcing or discussing these until much later in the pre-release versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us testers, I doubt that many of us will be doing any game testing until a much more stable preview is released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the best sources for information will be the Teched Europe developers conference. I'm sure that Windows 10 will be heavily covered there.</p>

<p>i have about 100 various games in my steam account. for most of my games, i had to re-validate my local game files in the steam menu. the more stubborn games, i had to uninstall and re- install. so far, "fallout 3" which did not work for me in Win 8, does
 work with WTP. all of my more recent graphics unfriendly shooters seem to start fine. and function well.&nbsp;

            <p>I will be receiving a new ASUS G750JS, on Friday, it will mainly be used for Gaming, and some notebook activities. The notebook comes standard with Windows 8.1 on a 1TB drive (7200rpm).&nbsp; Before, I start the process or loading/configuring Window 8.1, I was
 discussing the aspect of changing out the hard drive and installing windows 8 pro via upgrade path from windows 7 pro.&nbsp; Then it was suggested to install Windows 10, so I think I will take on the challenge.&nbsp; I am a STEAM member and have over 400+ game on my
 accounts.&nbsp; I am not a developer, I am only a IT Support Technician.&nbsp;&nbsp; So..let's check it and see what happens, I don't mind the tinkering with OS, as with most gaming, you fail the 1st time, you get a do over.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an added note, I have been gaming on an Alienware M14X R2 with Windows 8 for the last 2 years.

            I installed windows 10 beta on my Imac in bootcamp.&nbsp;<br />
My main OS is still OS X. Windows is there only for Visual Studio and games.&nbsp;<br />
And from what I see about games is that Dragon age 3 runs on high/very high.<br />
As do most of other games. Was there any performance improvements &nbsp;- Im not sure, yet Im glad that there was no breaks as it was with Vista/7 , 7/8.

<p>i can tell you of the games i have that do not launch on my comp. so far the newer graphics hungry titles launch and play with no problems other than 1. SLI Bridge continues to be undetectable through Nvidia control panel, even though it detects the presence
 of multiple cards in my system. i hope Nvidia comes up with a driver to address this issue before the official release of W10. 2. counter strike series other than global offensive will not launch on Windows 7 or 10. this issue may be present in the half life
 series. (not sure. currently not installed). i think the issue with the Valve games comes from an issue with the half life engine, not necessarily W10. it feels like , the older the title, the more likely it is you might have problems. newer titles I.E. Metro,
 Company of Heroes, Medal of honor, Sniper series, and wolfenstein new order play just fine on W10-AMD, And Intel builds. good luck.

</p><p>I want to open a discussion for those on the developers version of Windows 10 who are into gaming to relay feedback to the rest of the community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 for gaming, I was told that they had improved on some of the basic usage of RAM from Windows 7 to Windows 8 which they may have been, I didn't notice anything major as a Multimedia creator and gamer Also when gaming
 I came up with loads of problems and games just not working at all, or very poorly which can be just as good as not working.</p>
<p>I do know there will be DirectX12 with Windows 10, which is supposed to "rival" Mantle Technology by AMD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to sum it up:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Is <strong>Windows 10</strong> an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
improvement</span> or is it time for us to all switch to <strong>Linux?</strong></p>
support compatibility</span> of older versions of Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am asking these because I don't have the time, <em>or the download speeds for game downloads,</em> in my schedule as of the moment to test out Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Please keep in mind some answers might be very opinion-based since Windows 10 is basically in Alpha/Beta version.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Thanks for your responses!</p>

<p>i can tell you of the games i have that do not launch on my comp. so far the newer graphics hungry titles launch and play with no problems other than 1. SLI Bridge continues to be undetectable through Nvidia control panel, even though it detects the presence
 of multiple cards in my system. i hope Nvidia comes up with a driver to address this issue before the official release of W10. 2. counter strike series other than global offensive will not launch on Windows 7 or 10. this issue may be present in the half life
 series. (not sure. currently not installed). i think the issue with the Valve games comes from an issue with the half life engine, not necessarily W10. it feels like , the older the title, the more likely it is you might have problems. newer titles I.E. Metro,
 Company of Heroes, Medal of honor, Sniper series, and wolfenstein new order play just fine on W10-AMD, And Intel builds. good luck.

<p>Steam users- make sure you verify game cache if you are having launch issues. especially as you install new Builds as they are released. I notice a loss of game files when I was installing new builds all the way up to my current "9888" build.

<h2>            In Excel 2010 cannot freeze 1st column</h2>
                    <p>Using Excel 2010 running under Win 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can freeze the top row of my spreadsheet just fine, but <strong>I cannot freeze the 1st column</strong>,
<strong>alone or together with the top row.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be some reason for this, but I cannot think of one. I don't think I'm in any mode that would prevent freezing, because the top row freezes and unfreezes just as it's supposed to. And yes, I have B2 selected when I use the Freeze command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maddening, because I've designed a sheet that completely depends on my being able to freeze that first column. Any ideas?

<p>
</p><p>The frozen top row will keep column labels visible when you scroll down. The frozen first column&nbsp;will keep the row labels visible when scrolling to the right. If your sheet is more than a screen high, then the first column will scroll down, too, so the row
 labels for those rows become visible. </p>

<h2>            Default configuration for POP3&#47;IMAP4 features in Exchange Online</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>i would to know if POP3/IMAP4 features are enabled or disabled by default in Exchange Online.</p>
<p>Checking on TechNet i found that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>this article states that are enabled by default: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn551174%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</p>
<p>
</p><p>this article states that are disabled by default: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn551172(v=exchg.150).aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the truth? :)</p>
<p>I believe that the answer is enabled by default, so my&nbsp;question is: is there a way to change this behavior and configure Exchange Online to set POP3 and IMAP4 to be disabled by default when creating a new mailbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone can help?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p><span>Hi Lo,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>POP3 and IMAP4 are enabled for all users in Exchange Online by default. The second article you mentioned applies to Exchange server.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About your requirement “is there a way to change this behavior and configure Exchange Online to set POP3 and IMAP4 to be disabled by default when creating a new mailbox?”, I have done some tests and research and found it’s not feasible.
 As a workaround, you can use the following two PowerShell cmdlets to disable POP/IMAP for all mailboxes in your organization.</span></p>
<p><span><em>Get-Mailbox | Set-CASMailbox –POPEnabled $False</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Get-Mailbox | Set-CASMailbox –IMAPEnabled $False</em></span></p>

            <p>Hi Ivan,<br />
<br />
I do understand that you have tried editing the registry and running the Office repair. However, it is also recommended that you try the following methods if you haven’t tried them:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set your Outlook 2016 as the default mail client. The detailed steps are:<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click “Control Panel”&gt; search for “Default Programs”&gt; “Set your default programs”&gt; Outlook 2016&gt; “Set this program as default”.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a2cff35-10cb-4b34-8fc9-50f3119073f9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a2cff35-10cb-4b34-8fc9-50f3119073f9" /></a></p>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Based on my experience, the issue might be caused by the 64-bit Office. So, it is recommended that you try in-stall the 32-bit Office 2016. By default, the users can directly download the 32-bit Office in
<a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Portal</a>&gt; Install software. Note: Before it, it is needed to un-install the previous 64-bit Office 2016 via

Office 365 Fix It tool</a> (Option 2). <br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Check “<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/813745" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here is an easy fix” and “Let me fix it myself</a>”.<br />

            I bought my nokia 110 with 13.5 MB free phone memory. Now it is 2 months from when I bought it. It now has only 10.3 MB. Even when I clear my phone memory by dialling *#7370# there is no increase on the phone memory. Please help me to recover my lost memory
 manually because it will go to 0MB. I use internet thats why there is a fluctuation of memory.

            Probably it could be because of applying themes from memory card. It is better to apply themes first by moving some of them to phone memory and applying them from there.<br />
<br />
To clear that hidden space, try reinstalling the phone software using Nokia suite.<br />
<br />
Back-up important data before reinstalling.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            Exactly that is the real problem. The problem is themes. But even after I lost about 2.5MB for themes, I am still losing phone memory slowly by slowly when I use Internet. Even when I format phone memory I cant regain it. Please tell me how I can install
 nokia suite on my nokia 110. Does it work on it. Give me the download link to download that software (lite versions) Thanks.

            Nokia suite is actually a PC software.<br />
You have to download it and install it on your PC, you have to connect your phone to PC via USB cable and there you go, you can reinstall the phone software using Nokia suite.<br />
<br />
You can download the latest Nokia suite from <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokiasuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.nokia.com/nokiasuite</a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps. :)

            But nokia 110 has no where to connect USB cable to PC. Which other method can I use to format that hidden memory without connecting to the computer. Because it has no where to plugin to PC. Thank you.

            Well then, only way left is to copy those themes to internal memory and apply them.<br />
Hope you got an idea of how you can save the remaining internal memory from being occupied because of applying themes from memory card.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            @Edsoni,<br />
<br />
The themes when you apply from the memory card gets copied to phone's internal hidden memory which we'll not be able to see with any file explorer app.<br />
<br />
That occupied memory cannot be released. You may try to copy the same old themes to any folder of internal memory and apply, this may release the internal memory.<br />
<br />
From what I know, applying any number of themes in the internal memory wouldnot occupy unwanted extra space or waste the internal memory.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<h3> abhik ranjanthakur  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to sort out duplicate values from a column to another in excel&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>In column A there are some names with few duplicates with some without any duplicates. &nbsp;I want to put all those names in column B without any duplicates and without deleting them in column A. For example, in column A the name John is repeated 8 times,
 Harry is repeated 11 times, Tina is repeated 6 times and Mathew is repeated 15 times, and Robin, William, Peter and Mary has no duplicates. Now I want that in column B all the above names will come only once (not more than once) but they will stay same times
 in column A. And as I go on putting more names in column A in future the same process will be applied in column B as before. Is it possible in excel? If yes, How?&nbsp;</div>

The option to have attachments included in a mail merge in Outlook or in Word is currently not yet implemented. Although there is no native way to do this in Outlook or in Word there are workarounds available that will let you achieve your desired output.<strong>
</strong>One method that is listed on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/email-merge-in-word-attach-file-as-a-pdf/2098b7fc-9824-406e-b1b3-9e0102c09691">
 This uses an add-in that allows user more functionality when using the mail merge option.</span></p>

    <title>Nokia N95 Text Message Folder Access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reeyano  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N95 Text Message Folder Access</h2>
                    Hey there,<br />
<br />
I'm a new owner of a Nokia N95. After some serious effort, I was able to get copies of my messages from folders on my old 6610i (the connector on the phone would only work when the cable was forced and held into the phone lol).<br />
<br />
Anyway - the point is, now I want to transfer those messages to my N95. The problem is, I have folders in my text message section of the phone, but I can't **bleep** access them from the Nokia Phone/Message browser?? It might just be me, but that is a serious
 load of bs if you can't.<br />
<br />
If it isn't possible to access those folders, then how the hell can I transfer those messages? I was thinking maybe if I can make a backup of the 6610i messages using the Nokia Content Copier, then maybe I could restore them on the N95. Is that a plausible
 idea?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Ryan

            hi, i swapped phones and used my old mem card which had all my old messages on and when i went into inbox on new phone they wasnt there. is there a function where you set the n95 to store messages on memory card. i set memory to store messages then went
 back to inbox and there they all were.so all i can suggest is set to store messages on mem card and then maybe you can open them.

            I don't think it is possible, I fell into the trap of backing up your content using PC suite before doing an upgrade, for those who don't know it doesn't let you restore your backed up stuff. I needed to get a separate app to open the backed up content
 file and extract everything out of it, I wasn't too fussed about the settings and photos but I did want my contacts and messages, after much struggling I could restore my contacts but not my messages

<p>hi harold vlademirreal,</p>
<p>it appears that the message trace results are not properly uploaded. could you please re-upload them via clicking
<strong>use rich formattin</strong>g and <strong>insert/edit media</strong> for our further analysis?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f06069f9-99e9-4cd5-9627-f0aff6cca940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df06069f9-99e9-4cd5-9627-f0aff6cca940" /></a><br />
<br />
moreover, i’d like to confirm the following details to look into the issue:<br />
1. regarding ‘i already send the setting send emails outside my organization and check all the settings’, may i know the detailed settings you’ve configured for our reproduction? some related screenshots are appreciated.<br />
2. about adding 2 external email addresses on your address list, did you create <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb124381(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

3. which kind of accounts are the problematic external contacts? are they both from another office 365 organization or gmail/hotmail accounts?<br />
4. does the issue persist if another user in your organization sends an email to the distribution group?<br />
5. was everything working fine before? if not, what if you create a new distribution list?</p>

<p>Hi Harold VlademirReal,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I know you have created 2 mail contacts for the 2 external accounts in your Office 365, and then added them to the a distribution group (DG). To further understand your situation, I’d like to collect the following information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Regarding “<em>if i put only 1 of them they will received it, if i put the 2nd ID the only ID will received is the first</em> one”, can you provide the screenshots with detailed steps of the two tests?&nbsp; We will check if we can reproduce the issue from
 our side.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;The two problematic mail contacts and the two external email addresses. For privacy concerns, I have sent you a private message to collect them. Please click on the link below to access your private message:<br />

<p>Hi Harold VlademirReal,</p>
<p>Thanks for your private message.</p>
<p>I understand the situation now. From the message trace you provide above, we can see an event named “DROP”, it means the email sent to the DG was expanded to every recipients and the recipients in the DG did receive the email individually. However, the issue
 seems like the two external accounts can’t receive the email at the same time. <br />
To check if the email have been already delivered to the external recipients’ side, but can’t be delivered to their end user’s mail client, can you contact the administrators of the recipients’ side to check it?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Gary</p>

<p>i already have a call with the external user there are no any logs coming from their end. if i send email on distribution list only one of them will get the message and that's the only log we can get and nothing on the 2nd recipient

<p>Hi Harold,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates. I did some tests on my side but couldn’t reproduce this issue.</p>
<p>To identify if the issue is related to the recipient side, could you create a new distribution group and add two external test contacts to it. Then check if the two external contacts can receive the email sent to the distribution group. It may take some
 time for the external contacts to receive emails.</p>
<p>To protect the privacy, I have sent you the test contacts via a private message. Please click this link to access the message:&nbsp;https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations</p>

<h2>            Do I need a 365 account to use Micrsoft online Excel and Word apps&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a shared iPAD at work. The Online Excel and Word apps had been previously downloaded, and worked great. However, I've been locked out of editing the documents, and am told that I must log in to continue editing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to sign in, I'm told that our email address is being used for multiple accounts, and that our password is incorrect. I've not had any luck resetting the password using the reset tool, as the email address is not recognized at this step.</p>
<br />
<p>Is it possible that we did not sign up for a 365 account when we downloaded the apps? Is one needed to continue to use them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what to try next, please help!</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Word - There was a problem sending the command to the program</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>&nbsp; I'm running updated Win8.1 Office 365 Home Premium edition and whenever I open Word doc I get the error:&nbsp;</div>

"There was a problem sending the command to the program"
<div>&nbsp; I've tried all the fixes I could find online. &nbsp;I can open Word with no error, just not files that I've created.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; I've attempted the fix-it app, no luck, there is no compatibility tab, or general option to change DDE.</div>

            <p>Hi Jefferson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you facing any issue while working with the preview apart from the drop in fan speed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cool the computer&nbsp; components, fans are used to move heated air away from the components and draw cooler air over them. Fans attached to components are usually used in combination with a heatsink to increase the area of heated surface in contact with
 the air, thereby improving the efficiency of cooling. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Fan speed usually differs as per the requirements of the Operating System. Ignore the change in speed for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to get back to us in case there are any issue with the functionality of the preview.</p>

    <title>Closing All OneNote 2016 Notebooks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> itxpress  say:</h3>
<h2>            Closing All OneNote 2016 Notebooks</h2>
                    <p>I'm re-opening a locked thread found here:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_win10-mso_2016/how-to-close-all-notebooks-in-onenote-2016-no-more/c4cd3e5c-0b55-42c4-a00c-6f8d6b0efa8d</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because this is getting ridiculous. I have clients who use OneNote extensively. They create a notebook for each client and over time they have a lot of notebooks 'open' because they're trained by all other software behavior that when they close a window
 - it's CLOSED. But with OneNote the notebook stays in the background open and syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a terminal server this is a nightmare. We're seeing PER PROCESS loads of 6-13% on a 24 core server. Disk usage spirals over time since 3-5 employees may need to open a client notebook over the course of dealing with a client. Do the math - it's brutal.
 In Office 2013 they could customize the ribbon with a 'Close Notebook' button but you can't even do that anymore. We have to 'restore' a saved ribbon from Office 2013 to get it because it's not available as a button. Getting them to go into their (long) list
 of notebooks in the pulldown, right click, and select 'Close Notebook' is impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's like every new iteration of OneNote makes it HARDER to use properly if you have more than a few notebooks. Even worse - when you used to delete the OneNote cache, it was kind of like SafeMode in that all notebooks would be closed. But now... OneNote
 just reopened EVERY notebook they had open, filling the cache right back up. And for some users it can take 20-60 minutes. During an emergency situation - we wiped out everyone's cache and the next morning was rough as everyone logged in and got OneNote going.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not say cloud - not an option. I just don't understand why MS makes it so hard to close notebooks and manage OneNote in a corporate environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is an EASY way for users to CLOSE a notebook and a way to close ALL notebooks for users who refuse to do it...</p>
