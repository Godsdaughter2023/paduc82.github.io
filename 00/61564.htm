<h2>            How do I get a DPR-1260 Dlink wireless print server to work with Windows 7 laptop&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Recently bought a DPR-1260 print server. It works great&nbsp; with my Windows XP Home and Windows XP laptops.&nbsp; I can't get it to work with my Windows 7 laptop.&nbsp; I loaded Windows 7 drivers for my HP C4280
 printer onto the HP Windows 7 laptop and&nbsp; ran the setup wizard on the DPR-1260.&nbsp; The Wizard runs to the end then asks me if I want to print a test page, but does not print.</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of time looking at web postings on many sites trying to find wireless print servers that work with Windows 7 laptops.&nbsp; There are some confusing posts about setting up TCP ports.&nbsp; Is
 this what I need to do?&nbsp; Is there a recommended wireless print server that works with Windows 7 laptops out of the box?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi FBINAA154,<br />
</span></span></strong><strong><span><span>I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7programs/thread/360b7fac-6545-4c24-8161-da8828c3e152/<br />
<br />
If the above steps fail, I would suggest you to un-install and re-Install Media Center and media player.</span></span></strong><span><br />
</span><span><span>1. Open Programs and Features by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Programs, and then clicking Programs and Features.<br />
2. On left hand side, click on “Turn windows features on or OFF”<br />
3. Uncheck “Windows Media Center” &amp; “Windows Media player” you will get an error message<br />
4. Click on Yes and Click OK<br />
5. Re-start the computer.<br />
6. Once you re-start the computer make sure you put back the check mark to media center to re-install.<br />

            Vijay,<br />
<br />
Sorry if I confused you.&nbsp; My Windows 7 laptop is brand new&nbsp; (HP Pavillion dv6-1375dx).&nbsp; It is not an upgrade from Windows XP.&nbsp; Everything works great on my Windows 7 laptop, except for wireless printing&nbsp;via the dpr-1260.&nbsp; I have some old Windows XP laptops
 that work great with the wireless print server, but I want to retire these XP's and move to Windows 7 laptops.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I can't find any documentation from any wireless print servers (D-Link, Netgear or&nbsp;Linksys) that claim to have a solution for Windows 7 devices.&nbsp; Should I return the wireless print server&nbsp;and wait until someone is selling a Windows 7 wireless print server solution?&nbsp;
 Is there something I can download that would allow a Windows 7 laptop to work with my wireless print server?<br />

            <p>Even easier. Disable Antivirus and Firewall until you finished the program installation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>
<p>If you leave the antivirus on the antivirus sees the program as a virus or intrussion.

            Administrators run with the same access token as standard users&nbsp;when&nbsp;User Account Control (UAC) is enabled. So&nbsp;the only difference is the one that you have noted BJM. If you're a standard user, you have to type an administrator password.&nbsp;If you're an administrator
 you can just click Continue to allow a process&nbsp;to use the administrator’s full access token.<br />
<br />
Note that we do other things to protect&nbsp;administrators&nbsp;in Vista (example: not giving them write access to system files and folders by default). Our data shows us that most machines (75%) run with a single account with full administrator privileges.&nbsp;See

"... In Windows Vista, standard users are prohibited from installing most programs, changing system settings, and performing other tasks that are the province of administrators. If, as a standard user, you attempt to do something that requires administrator

            Hi Shinmila H,<br />
<br />
As I told you in my previous post. I Coiped the two FSX Disks to a new folder on my computer but it
<br />
did not work, I got the "1607" error message so could not install FSX.<br />
I do not what happened, it must have been a miracle. I was on my computer this evening working with<br />
some images that I wanted to email to my brother in America. SUDDENLY the dialog box for installing<br />
FSX appeared on my screen giving me the opertunity to install the program. I clicked on Install and the<br />
program started to install from the two disks I earlier copied to a new folder on my computer. The
<br />
program installed both disks and the program is working. I do not know how this happened, I was not<br />
even thinking about FSX or working with the program.<br />
Anyhow thanks to you suggesting to copy the two Disks into a new folder on my computer, the
<br />
program is installed and working.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
<br />
Marc

</p><p>I understand that memory instability can cause these issues but I've been running my RAM at 3200mhz for months without a hitch, and it's been thoroughly tested with Prime95.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

            Hi WolffeCrowe 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type msinfo32 in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .nfo file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.

<br />Also, can you do the following: 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type eventvwr in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file

<h2>            Problem with Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.256 on Vista</h2>
                    <p>After using my recovery discs on my Dell laptop, Windows Update has been working to update everything. All seemed fine until the update agent automatically updated itself to Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.256 and then the updates stopped working. It looks
 like it is searching for updates with the green bar going back and forth but this goes on for ever and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried going back to a previous restore point and using 'fix it' without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can get my Windows update up and running again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My operating system is Windows Vista Home Premium SP2.</p>

            <p>I had been having problems with start up taking a long time and sometimes not starting at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the recovery discs and it reverted back 5 years to factory settings which included a 30 day trial of McAfee. This was uninstalled once i installed my own F-Secure security. All was going well, spent the last two days doing updates. Computer seems
 fast again and empty of rubbish. Vista updated to SP2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic updates then updated Windows Update and since then it just hangs. A restore point didn't work. I have been reading that this has been a common problem with this WU update. Tried Microsoft Fix It but it didn't.</p>

            <p>1. The recovery was done on 13. April 16.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The system is 32 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I let the McAfee run as my security whilst I used windows update. During this time I had lots of updates including Vista SP2. I reloaded my Microfoft office, updated IE from 7 to 9. Installed Flash Player. Towards the end of the installation I installed
 F-Secure. This program automatically removed McAfee. I don't recall ever downloading the McAfee removal tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The created date of F-Secure was 15. April 16.</p>

            <p>Update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After leaving Windows Update on all night and part of this morning, the update window was still hanging as if it was stuck.&nbsp;However, I noticed that there was the update icon in the toolbar and on the shutdown button. I therefore shutdown the computer and
 it updated 150 updates. It went through the 3 stage set up on restart and all seemed fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone back onto Windows update ad it is showing a big red cross with it recorded that I have never updated, but my update history is showing all the updates successfully installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now run Windows Update again and it is now showing 32 updates to install and it seems that the update window is now working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way I resolved this is left WU running for about 10 hours, and disabled 'sleep'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this problem is resolved but will update here in a few days when I am sure.</p>

            <p>Yes, I am having problems accessing all of those pages you mention on IE9. I am also unable to reply to this post via IE9 and have to use Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Internet explorer 9 is shown in my installed updates on 14.04.16.</p>

            <div>You are talking about partitions, not drives. When you split a disk into several parts then you get a number of "partitions". When you then format such a partition then you get "drives".<br />
<br />
You can have up to four primary partitions. One of them can be an extended partition. If it is then you can create in it as many drives as there are letters in the alphabet.<br />
<br />
Primary partitions are bootable. Logical partitions are not bootable.</div>
<br />
The native Disk Manager cannot convert one partition type to another but many third-party partition managers can.

<p>First off, this was announced to be free literally as dice released that info, so they had to have planned it before. Corporations are large, slow machines. They can't make changes that quick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that they made more stuff free after the initial reaction though.</p>

            <p>I don't know what you mean about checking the email in web. &nbsp;I followed your link but that was not the problem. &nbsp; I guess I didn't explain myself very well. &nbsp;Here's the scenario: &nbsp;I receive an email, I open it, I click "show images" and everything is fine
 EXCEPT that there is a empty box where apparently a picture should be and at the inside top left-hand corner there is an X (like you use to close out a window). &nbsp;In my case, I know there should be a picture there because the person who sent it to me mentioned
 the picture (nothing threatening, it was a picture of his kids). &nbsp;So, do you have any idea what's happening? &nbsp;I think it's in some kind of setting where I've disallowed certain kinds of graphics, but I have no idea where it might be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I appreciate your help.</p>

            <p>Hello jayess99,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting back with the additional information. What Helene meant when she asked if you checked the mail in web is, does the issue also occur when you open the email using a web browser such as Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to verify, did you follow the steps provided on the given link? If not, then I would reiterate the steps here for your convenience. Please refer below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows Live Mail.</li><li>Press <strong>Alt + F</strong>, click <strong>Options </strong>then select <strong>
Safety options</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li><li>Under <strong>Download Images</strong>, uncheck the box for <strong>Block images and other external content in HTML email</strong>.</li><li>Check the box for <strong>Show images and external content sent from email addresses in my Safe Senders list</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply </strong>then <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>After following the steps above, you should now be able to view the images properly. Hope that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to us if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi again - I went through all the steps, unchecked the first box, checked the second box, put my brother on the safe senders list, put my nephew on the same list (because my brother had forwarded the email from the nephew to me) &nbsp;and then I closed the mail
 program. &nbsp;I re-opened it, found the email, no picture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This is baffling. &nbsp;BTW, the "safety options" thing was under "tools", Alt+F brought up the "file" menu. &nbsp;Anyway, if you have any more ideas, I'm open to suggestion. &nbsp;thanks again. &nbsp;jf</p>

            <p>You know, I hate to sound unappreciative, but Microsoft makes things so blasted difficult for those of us who aren't techies. &nbsp;I have just spend over two hours trying to get this Outlook think working, had to call the phone company, changed my PW for my
 email account, could not get logged on to the Outlook site, finally got on, tried to muddle my way thru their lame instructions, actually had no idea what I was doing, finally got an account set up, but there is no mail in the inbox. &nbsp;By the time I got to
 that point, I was ready to punch someone. &nbsp;I gave up. &nbsp;I have no idea how to proceed from here. &nbsp;I guess I'll just have to live with it. &nbsp;But to be perfectly honest, this really p******s me off. &nbsp;Why should something this simple be made so incomprehensible?
 &nbsp;Well, at least I think it should be simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Once again, Microsoft wins and us dummies just have to accept the few crumbs that are thrown our way. &nbsp;Pitiful.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your reply. Sorry to hear that you are having issues accessing your account&nbsp;in Outlook.com. You've mentioned that there's no email on your Outlook.com inbox. We would like to verify if you are using the same email address in Outlook.com and
 in Windows Live Mail. If yes, please provide us your affected email address on the private message area that I've initiated for&nbsp;investigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also, may I ask for your Windows Live Mail build version. This will isolate outdated version of the program.</p>

            <p>Hi Jf,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply and we appreciate your cooperation. I understand your hesitation. We're here to help you. Upon reviewing the information that you've provided, I have determined that you are using the later version of Windows Live Mail. With this,
 there's a possibility that the version caused the issue. Please update your program to its
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials-other#essentials=overviewother" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>latest version </strong></a>(<span>Build 16.4.3528.0331)</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: Before upgrading, </em><span><em>check that the messages and contacts you want to save are available when you sign in to the web version.
</em></span><span><em>If some of your messages and contacts are available only in Live Mail, export your messages before removing the account. See
</em></span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><em>How
 do I import and export email, contacts, and calendars with Windows Live Mail?</em></span></a></span><span><em>.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've checked also on your account and determined that it is an EASI
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(Email As SignIn) account. It will just help you to access Microsoft Services but it doesn’t really have an Inbox so emails from your contacts will not
 come with it. You can only receive emails from Microsoft. Hence, all incoming emails will still be on your email provider's server.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">For further isolation, what configuration settings did you use when you added your account in Windows Live Mail? Is it POP, IMAP or DeltaSync? You can try
 reconfiguring your account in Windows Live Mail using your email provider's server settings after upgrading your program. You may contact your email provider for the server settings.</span></p>

            <p>OK, I downloaded the "latest version". other than a bunch of totally unnecessary word-processor-related add-ons it looks pretty much the same. &nbsp;At least after I figured out how to get rid of the calendar (I think most people know what the date is). &nbsp;I read
 your comments about the EASI, have o idea what you're talking about. &nbsp;If you're referring to the Outlook thing, that part is correct - after I installed it, there is nothing there. &nbsp;It doesn't have any messages from my embarqmail.com account. &nbsp;So in that regard,
 I have o idea what use Outlook would be to me. &nbsp;You said I should check that my messages are available when I sign in to the web version - again, I hate to sound like a broken record, but I have no idea what that means. &nbsp;What web version? &nbsp;Outlook? &nbsp;We've
 already been through that, there are no messages there. &nbsp;The only reason that I installed the new version is that I still have the old version on my laptop, so if all else fails, I can use that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I probably sound terribly ungrateful for all the help you have tried to provide, but this going around in circles and trying to interpret things that I know nothing about is a royal pain. &nbsp;It's a little like asking your doctor a question about your cancer/heart
 attack/pregnancy, whatever, and he replies with technical medical school jargon as if he were talking to another doctor. &nbsp;How about if he tried to explain how an MRI works? &nbsp;Imagine how you would feel. &nbsp;that's how I feel right now. &nbsp;And to top it all off,
 I had to call the phone company because I forgot my PW for my embarqmail.com account and ended up talking to an absolute idiot who did something, don't know what, so that now, every time I open my email program, I have to sign in, never had to do that before.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry for the rant. &nbsp;Back to your questions, I think the answer to your last question is that I have a POP whatever. &nbsp;I'm almost afraid to call the phone company for anything. &nbsp;I checked my email after installing the new program and it appears that it's
 working. &nbsp;But back to the original problem (the one that instigated all this) - the email with the photo in the body of the email? &nbsp;There is still no picture, , just a blank box with a small box containing an x in the top left-hand corner</p>

</p><p>Our apologies for the confusion. To answer your questions, I will enumerate them below:</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t turn on&#47;enable my WiFi &#40;Only for my PC, all other PCs in my house, along with phones, connect fine.&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm going to tell this as a story, it will be a bit long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's an Acer Predator G3-710 (Desktop PC) Windows 10</p>
<p>I boot up my computer this morning. We had had a couple power surges beforehand, but my computer is plugged into a power-stick that is a surge protector. When I turned it on, I noticed it was taking longer than usual, so I turned it off and on again while
 it was booting up. The power button has lights around it that are usually lit up. The whole time it's been on today, the light hasn't been on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>All other computers in my house are working fine, as are the phones</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if any of that mattered, but I added it in just in case.<br />
<br />
So, when I log on, and go onto Google, it says it isn't connected to the internet. I go to Settings, and see that the Internet is turned off. I click the switch that says 'Off' (multiple times throughout the hours I've been trying to fix this), and a couple
 things might happen. Sometimes, I click the switch<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1eb40e0f-4fb1-4a53-b940-bb03ded0bf4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1eb40e0f-4fb1-4a53-b940-bb03ded0bf4a" /></a>and
 it will move to the right, but then back to the off position immediately, no matter how many times you click it.</p>
<p>Sometimes it will turn 'on', but not really. It would have the thinking icon, and I would go to a different settings page and return and it's back to the off position.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've Googled a bunch of stuff, and here's everything I can remember doing. I don't know the order, so it isn't in order.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>I reset the Network settings</li><li>I restarted my PC multiple times</li><li>I restarted the router</li><li>The troubleshooter told me that there should be a switch somewhere on the computer or function keys that I have to use to enable wireless capability, but I couldn't find either. I googled how to enable&nbsp; wireless capability, came up with that ^, but also
 that I need to go to settings, click 'Change adapter options', and enable Wi-Fi, but the only option is to&nbsp;<em>dis</em>able it, so it is already enabled.</li><li>I snooped around, looking at the adapter's properties <span>(Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless-AC 7265)</span></li><li><span>I updated the 'Realtek PCle GBE Family Controller's driver</span></li><li><span>One site said to go to the Device Manager, click the adapter, go to advanced, scroll down to 'Wireless Mode', and make sure the value was correct. I went to anther computer in my house (All others working fine, as are the phones), and made sure the
 values were the same. They were.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>I changed the value for 'Wireless Mode', then changed it back.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>A picture of the screen that comes up when pressing 'Change Adapter options' --&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3b8e5b6-bbf3-498a-8e46-e4671404098c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3b8e5b6-bbf3-498a-8e46-e4671404098c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently connected via an Ethernet cord to my router, which works fine. The only thing that seems to be broken is the computer's ability to have/enable wireless internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If anyone has a solution, please tell me. Thanks.</p>

Not connected to Wi-Fi icons. The first one, '</span><strong>The physical Wi-Fi switch on your laptop or tablet is turned off.</strong><span>&nbsp;'

<h2>            Wifi network not showing up in list of available networks</h2>
                    One of my family members recently gave me a factory-reset Toshiba laptop. When I try to connect it to my house's wifi network, the network does not show up in the list of available networks. Any idea what's causing this, or how to fix it? Also, I assume
 that my family member was able to connect the laptop to his wifi network.

<br />If your computer can connect to the previous WiFi networks automatically, but there are no network names showing on the network list, then this could be an issue with the network discovery. To check if this is the case, open the Control Panel, go to Network and Internet, click Network Sharing Center, and click Advanced sharing settings, then check if the Network discovery is on. If it's not, select Turn on network discovery, then click Save changes.
<br />
<br />If the issue persist after enabling the network discovery, you can follow other helpful steps from this article: Fix network connection issues in Windows 10.

            No, like, it shows every network within range&nbsp;<em>except</em> for the one at our house, and other devices are able to connect to our home network, so I know it's not an issue with the wifi.

            It...almost works? But when I enter the info for the network (like the network's ID + password), it says that the network already exists, and it takes me to the "connect to a network" menu that's next to the time and date in the lower right corner...where
 the network does not appear!

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused to you with the user accounts on Windows 10.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the user profile services are corrupt.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>I suggest you enter into <strong>safe mode </strong>
and enable built-in administrator and check with the status of User profile service.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Start computer in safe mode.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Type <strong>Settings</strong> in the search box on the desktop, select <strong>
Settings.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Here select <strong>Change</strong> pc settings and then <strong>General.</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;Scroll down to <strong>Advanced start</strong>up, click <strong>Restart </strong>
now.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click on <strong>Troubleshoot, </strong><strong>Advanced options</strong>, and
<strong>Startup</strong> Settings.<br />
5.&nbsp;Click Restart, select<strong> Safe mode </strong>and then press Enter.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Enable Built-in administrator.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Press<strong> Windows + X</strong> key together on your desktop screen.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click on <strong>Command Prompt (adm</strong>in) to open <strong>Command Prompt.</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;Type the following command and hit Enter: <br />
•&nbsp; <strong>net user administrator /active: yes</strong> (Check for the spaces)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; Now log off from the current user and try to login to the administrator account that is enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Please follow the same steps and type net user administrator /active: no to disable admin account after the troubleshooting is done.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to create a new user account (Microsoft account) and check if you are able to access the content from your computer<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Create a user account</strong><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: Create a Microsoft account</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: Check the status of User profile services.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps: <br />
1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows + R</strong> to open <strong>Run command</strong>, type <strong>
services.msc </strong>and press <strong>Enter.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Search for <strong>User Profile Service</strong>, right click on it and start the service.<br />
3.&nbsp;Also, set the<strong> Startup </strong>type to <strong>Automatic.</strong><br />
4.&nbsp;Now check if you are able to log-in.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Kindly update the status of the issue, we will be happy to help you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank</p>

            <p>Well Pavan, thank you for replying. Another software engineer and I have just spent 90 minutes attempting to follow your advice on how to fix this. We have given up in despair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, your suggestion to get into help mode on windows 10 could not be followed. When we typed Setting in the search box, there is no option CHANGE pc settings. &nbsp;We did google it and found out how to start in Safe mode using the Shift key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when we got the 'net user administrator' command to run, it created a new Administrator account which we could use (without password), but it was in very safe mode and would not allow us to modify users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting back to normal mode was a challenge, and we were then able to reset the command to no.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>all of which leaves me wishing I hadn't bothered to attempt to create a new user. How can it possibly be so complicated??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dee</p>

<h2>            Zoo Tycoon 2&#58; Interface Color&#47;Control Panel</h2>
                    I own Zoo Tycoon 2: Ultimate Collection, and the software I play it on is Windows 10. The silver color of the interface in ZT2 Ultimate Collection I just don't like. So here is the question I would like to ask: How do you change the color of the interface&nbsp;(control
 panel)? Can anyone help me? It is okay if you can't change it. When I got Radical Remake the interface was black which was a ZT2 mod and I really do not like the black interface. If anyone knows how to change it please reply to this post. Thank you! :D

<h2>            Want to use Canon pixma MG2900 printer in wireless mode</h2>
                    <p>I purchased this printer and I am able to use it through USB, but I would like to use it wireless. It came with a CD, but my laptop doesn't have a dvd player on it. Except for buying an external dvd player, is there a website that has the contents where
 I can download it?</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 7 does not recognize my usb drive &#38; ipod. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greengambyte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 does not recognize my usb drive &#38; ipod.</h2>
                    
This has been really bothering me. Windows 7 works perfectly with my old programs after my upgrade. Only when I plug in my usb external drive and ipod touch, ipod video...it does not recognize it. I tried device manager and looking for it there, it does
 not show up. When I go on safe mode, "USB mass storage" shows up but I cannot update cuz it keeps saying it already has the best driver installed. When I look at "properties" it says there is no driver installed.
<br />
<br />
With my ipods, I tried stopping and restarting ipod service, apple mobile device, itunes. I tried reinstalling a newly downloaded copy of iTunes at least 4 times. That does not work.
<br />
<br />
There is a registry fix for this on Windows XP titled "Windows XP cannot detect a USB flash drive, an Apple iPod, or an external hard disk drive" but does not have one for Windows 7. The XP fix even has a download fix for fixing the registry. Is there one also
 for Windows 7. <br />
<br />
I am going through the trouble of installing Virtual PC and XP mode just to use my devices. Please help!

<p><span><span>Hi ,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are you getting any error messages in the Device Manager?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Unplug the device, try in a different port and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open Device Manager and check if the USB drive has a yellow exclamation mark. If it has a mark, then
</span><span>update the driver for your USB flash disk.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Follow these steps:<br />
</span></span><span><span>1. In the device's Properties dialog box, click the Driver tab.
<br />
</span></span><span><span>2. Click Update Driver to start the Hardware Update Wizard.
<br />
</span></span><span><span>3. Follow the instructions to update the driver.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer this link to troubleshoot problems with USB devices:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This link is for Windows Vista but it also applies for Windows 7.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check the link mentioned below, it may help you fix the issue.</span></span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>My suggestion would be to update the iTunes software to the latest since this has resolved sync problem for
 most of the users.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download the latest version of iTunes from:</span></span></p>

</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Run the installation after downloading from the link.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The device may also need a firmware update.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Connect the device and check if there’s any iphone firmware update available for it.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also follow these steps to
</span><span>delete the <strong><span>UpperFilters</span></strong> registry value and the
<strong><span>LowerFilters</span></strong> registry value. These values may cause access problems.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click
<strong>Run</strong>, type regedit, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. </span></span></li><li>
<span><span>Locate and then click the
<strong>UpperFilters</strong> registry value. This value is located in the following registry subkey:

</li><li>
<span><span>On the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, click

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 redeem code not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own Minecraft PC edition and tried to claim the Windows 10 edition via the Mojang website. I have attempted to redeem the code, but when I enter it into the Microsoft online store, I get a message saying that the code has been redeemed, but I still don't
 have access to the Windows 10 edition, either here or on Mojang's website. I originally tried to claim it back in December, but when it didn't work, I decided to try later and then forgot about it for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>

            Finally figured this out - it needs to be downloaded from the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Store App</strong>, not using a browser. Really not obvious and hard to find out. Hope that helps others in the same boat.

<h2>            Windows won&#39;t work - &#34;No bootable drive&#34;</h2>
                    When I turned on my Toshiba laptop this morning, it gave me this message:&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>"PXE-E61: Media test failure, check cable&nbsp;</div>
<div>PXE-M0F: Exiting Broadcom PXEROM&nbsp;</div>
<div>No bootable device -- insert boot disk and press any key"&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The computer is a Toshiba Satellite laptop. It's about four and a half years old. Taking out the battery and restarting it did not work. &nbsp;The computer runs Windows Vista.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have seen this problem asked already, but none of the answers make sense to me. Could someone please explain to me if I can fix this, and if so, how? &nbsp;Please explain all the steps I need to take as I don't know what BIOS is or other things I've seen
 mentioned. Thank you very much. </div>

            Hi, thanks for the replies. I did not do anything out of the ordinary before this appeared. Tried hitting F8, but it just went to that same screen again.
<div><br />
<div>The computer is a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S59695. Thanks for any help.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can get into Boot Menu and Setup Uitility, btw (those are the prompts I see on the very first screen before it goes to the "no bootable disc" screen). On the Setup Utility screen, under hard drive, it says none. Yep, I've got a really bad feeling about
 this.</div>

            Nope, not even close. It's almost five years old. Is there any chance that if I take it in somewhere they might be able to save any data? I'm not holding my breath.

<p>Hi IbrahimAbdel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand, the webcam is not working on Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the make and model of the computer/webcam?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Is this an inbuilt camera or an external camera?</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What happens when you try to open the camera?</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Where does it show <span>device is working properly?</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Was it working fine before?</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us try the following methods:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1: <span>&nbsp;</span></b>Run hardware and devices troubleshooter:</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: </b>Update the drivers for the webcam from the manufacturer’s website and see if that helps.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3: <span>&nbsp;</span></b>Run SFC scan.</p>
<p><span>System File Checker (sfc) scan will replace corrupt or missing system files on your computer.</span></p>
<p>Use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>It may ask for Windows DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance, we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

    <title>WIN 10 reports hard disk error drive C - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wadefrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIN 10 reports hard disk error drive  C</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday my windows 10 advised my of a disk error on drive C...I backed up and made a recovery thumb drive. I called Asus, the guy was a dimwit advising me that if I send my computer in they cant put windows 10 back onto it, he didnt know what to do about
 the hard disk error, only advising me of waht they would do. After that I called a local man, he advised me to do a chkdsk through DOS. That took place on startup ran for 2 hours done. Restarted the computer after 3 hrs. found problem with hard drive error
 again...so I installed Seagate disk repair...ran that, no errors found, ran deeper scan, no errors found...then 2 hrs later, windows detected hard disk error. So then I ran the internal scan and fix disk with windows...after 2 minutes windows advised me that
 it had discoverd errors on drive C, and to fix them, so I rebooted the computer and after 3 minutes windows had fixed the errors. Now today after running for about 6 hours guess what, windows detected a disk error, so I scanned it again with the enternal windows
 check disk program and it said (no errors found) on drive C. I have a Asus ROG G751 gaming laptop, I7, geforce 860m, 24 GB of Ram. Please help, I think it might be a windows error instead of my computer.</p>

            <p>I tend to agree that the drive is good as it passed the Seagate tests. To confirm it, there may also be a test in BIOS you may run. (I know there is one in this Dell Inspiron 3542 that runs for hours.) But don't make changes in there that neither of us may
 understand.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;It says: Be sure computer has shut down, then press ESC as you boot, perhaps continuously.</p>

</p><p>If&nbsp;your BIOS&nbsp;has a test for the drive -&nbsp;&amp; the drive passes - then I think Win 10 has installed badly for you. Here is someone (Anthony Garreffa) with an ASUS ROG G751 who had to install it&nbsp;twice before it would work...</p>

            <p>I found your support site...</p>

<p>Support Site for NP305V5A</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Unfortunately</em>, none of the 38 "answers" there mention your problem. Also, it says your computer has a storage capacity of 320 GB,&nbsp;but we know it&nbsp;is 640.1 GB. Finally, the downloads all seem to be for Win 7 or XP, &amp; I can find no diagnostic tool
 for your hard drive there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One month of Win 10 before the problem showed up -&nbsp;I'm hoping that Win 10 didn't
<em>cause </em>a hard drive problem, instead of just misreport it.&nbsp;I don't like that CrystalDisk seems to corroborate ChkDsk. Here is a site that does offer a tool said to be authored by Samsung...</p>

<p>Samsung Drive Diagnostic Utility (Hutil) 2.10</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that corroborates both CrystalDisk &amp; ChkDsk, I must think your hard drive is actually bad (sorry to say).</p>

            Thank you so much for your detective work. I'll try that out. In the meantime I'm backing up all my important info and data in case of the death blow. Guess it could happen soon, or in months, so playing it safe. Cheers.<br />

            <p>You are welcome. That's smart to have backups. Also - unless you'll just go for a new computer - perhaps start shopping for a replacement drive, &amp; plan out the switch procedure. In the meantime, maybe "R-Clk START, Task Manager" &amp; keep an eye on disk activity...</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is usually fairly low with little bumps up/down, unless the virus checker has kicked in or you scan the drive for errors. Then, the process responsible will light up below...</p>

<p>You might find an errant or unnecessary process constantly using the drive. Good luck, &amp; keep us informed.</p>

            Hi, I upgraded my Toshiba Satellite L655 to Windows 10 Pro on the 29 of July (used to have Windows 7 Home Premium) A few minutes after (or almost as soon) it finished upgrading Windows tells me that there's a problem with my hard disk. I press ask later
 and use my laptop for a full day, I close it and a 5 min later I hear a notification, went to check and it's the same error message. Is this a Win10 problem or...?
