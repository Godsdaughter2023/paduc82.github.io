<h2>            In PowerPoint VBA, how do I refer to the ACTIVE slide&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to be able to insert an object on the active slide in VBA code. I could only find</p>
<p>ActivePresentation.Slides(2).Shapes.Addshape...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>like I have to refer to a particular slide rather than the active one. I'm sure it can be done, but couldn't find it by browsing the object browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Would someone from Microsoft please answer this note&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; One of my employees let me know that on their Windows 8.1 Windows Update Screen the first thing that they see is an "Update to Windows 10.&nbsp; Reserve yours now" announcement and they have to jump through several clicks and attempts to actually see what updates
 are REALLY available for 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp; My question is this:&nbsp; Does Microsoft actually think that Windows 10 is ready for general release?&nbsp; Or are you so desperate and panicked that you feel the need to "toss it out there"?</p>
<p>&nbsp; This is an excerpt from a memo that our IT Department sent out to ALL employees today:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; "Please be advised that with the full release of Windows 10 the IT Department will have to STOP our policy of assisting home users with their systems.&nbsp; As many of you know several of us in IT have been "testing" Windows 10 pre-release and have found it
 to be so bad in a desktop environment and absolutely useless in our company structure that we will not be providing support for the operating system if you decide to install it on your personal equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Everyone is advised to DO NOT EVEN ATTEMPT to install Windows 10 on ANY company computer!</strong>&nbsp; Anyone attempting to do so will be responsible for the cost of repairing or replacing the computer.&nbsp; This means ALL company computers.&nbsp; Desktop,
 laptop or tablets that are owned and utilized by the company.&nbsp; THIS WILL BE YOUR ONLY WARNING!</p>
<p>&nbsp; We are sorry that we will have to end the private assistance for our employees.&nbsp; It has always been something that we here in IT enjoyed and hoped that it was a benefit to those of you that utilized our service.&nbsp; However, Windows 10 is so poorly implemented
 and such a "buggy" mess that we do not feel we will be able to dedicate the time that will be needed to repair installations or make it work properly for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have any questions, please contact IT and we will try and answer them."</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; There is just NO WAY we can allow this into our work environment and would certainly never advise our people to utilize it.&nbsp; Can you honestly justify releasing this OS into the general public with many, many users that are not going to understand what
 the heck a "work-around", "patch" or CMD sequence is??&nbsp; Are you folks truly getting that completely out of touch with your actual users?&nbsp; Or do you think that we don't have any choice or say in the matter?&nbsp; Running on the "We are Microsoft!&nbsp; We WILL control
 your computers!" attitude or the "We are Microsoft!&nbsp; We know more about your business that you do!"?&nbsp; Or many of the other "God complex" things that seem to be coming out of your statements?</p>
<p>&nbsp; So please, someone at Microsoft, please give me an honest and true statement.&nbsp; Stop all the rhetoric, PR trash and general garbage that is being spewed out and thrown down like gospel.&nbsp; How about some plain old common sense communications for us.&nbsp; Can
 you do that please?</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thank you in advance.&nbsp; I am truly looking forward to a response from someone in a position of authority to actually answer a set of straightforward question with some actual straight forward information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take care</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ps:&nbsp; I had to select "Windows Update" because you don't actually have a topic for straight answers.</p>

            <p>The only Microsoft representation in this forum are volunteer MVP's and Moderators, and outsourced "technical support engineers", although on occasion Gabe Aul makes an appearance out of the blue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I share your concern for the quality of the builds juxtaposed against the fast and heavy marketing tactics. &nbsp;It also seems that the compatibility scanner is giving the green light on computers that have known existing hardware/driver issues, for example,
 graphics cards that do not have fully functioning drivers. &nbsp;If the priority is on getting people switched to Windows 10 rather than on the quality of Windows 10 itself, it's a short term strategy with a huge medium to long term downside. &nbsp;I'm concerned that
 the marketing departments are dictating things that engineering cannot deliver with sufficient quality or on time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great to have someone in a position of authority address this on behalf of Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failure to address the quality of Windows 10 before release will result in a disaster for the end users, and ultimately Microsoft. &nbsp;I'm sure they're doing everything they can to get ready for release, but the responsible thing would be to delay the launch
 until it's right. &nbsp;July 29 just isn't enough time, given that drivers are not yet ready or not fully functioning for hardware from mainstream suppliers such as Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Realtek, including hardware found in Microsoft's own Surface devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only now, ONE Metro app, the calculator, can finally run in more than one instance starting with build 10130. &nbsp;This is just not good enough. &nbsp;The save play would be to restore Win32 functioning and not push anything into WinRT/Metro until after it's functioning
 as well or better than the Win32 equivalent. &nbsp;Metro is consistently an inferior experience for end users, from slow launching, to the operation of the app itself.</p>

            <p>(I apologize now for the long read, but I hope that you'll bear with me and read it through...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say that my gut reaction, as a fan of Windows 10 and as an IT guy, is that your IT department is laughably incompetent... at least judging solely by the gloom and doom of their email. But, that's not a lot to go on nor am I aware of the big picture
 of your business, and so I generally find it more appropriate to accept that given the situation they may not have the resources needed to effectively manage your systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As such, I want to offer up my own personal experiences with Windows 10 as I've been on the Insider program since its initial build last September, and as an IT guy with 25 years experience (including being a tester for EVERY release of Windows since Windows
 95), and hopefully you can pass this information onto them for their consideration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start with... if your work systems are joined to an Active Directory (AD)&nbsp;domain, you should NOT see the W10 upgrade reservation notices at all. It's a parameter coded into the update to purposely block domain joined and Windows 10 Enterprise systems.
 IF your systems are not domain joined (and worse if they are running Windows Home edition of any version), then they are certainly capable of receiving the update notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the first question I would have for you / your IT team... are these systems joined to a domain, and if not why not? The next piece of advice I would have is if there is a server setup for AD, then THEY should be controlling the update experience through
 Windows Software Update Server (WSUS) and blocking KB3035583 from your enterprise. Block it, uninstall it, whatever makes them happy, because I DO 100% believe that Windows 10 should ONLY be deployed to a business system when the IT department is ready to
 handle that upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the BYOD of supporting home systems, well, that's a quagmire of its own that I'd rather not deal with... and in my own business, I never support home systems, because I just don't have the time or interest in being everyone's tech support, lol. BUT,
 for whatever reason that they are forced into it, well my deepest sympathies are with them! ALSO, I would seriously advise them to implement a service like Azure AD and Windows Intune to help them manage those systems more easily. Azure AD is FREE for up to
 300,000 AD objects, and Intune is something like $5/user, so there's an easy cost justification to business to say, "If I have to support them, I need this tool to do it effectively, and it will cover us on Windows, iOS, Android, and Mac devices."</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so kind of all the provisory "what the heck is your IT department doing" questions out of the way, I want to tell you a story about my experience with Windows 10 as to how it relates to other IT/business projects I've worked on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 6 months ago, I changed jobs after spending 6 years with a company. At that previous employer, I was one of 3 IT people serving 13 sub-business units at about 90 locations. We had a TON of construction projects going on at any given time. I don't know
 if you've ever experienced a construction project, but it is easily the best comparison to software development I have that accurately relates the whole experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a construction project starts, you take this barren, empty space and you turn it into a shiny new place with all this stuff, right? But what does it look like on any given day during the process? In a word? Chaos! And honestly, complete utter chaos
 and destruction. There's boards, beams, dust, dirt, drywall, paint, wires, light fixtures, and insulation and all this **** EVERYWHERE! Not to mention, there's all these people running around like mad trying to get things done and then they leave in the middle
 of the afternoon, and you think, "how in the HELL are we going to have this finished if they only work 'half days' like this?!" (And quick aside, they're not working half days, they just start a lot earlier than most people or have less access to the space,
 but whatever.) However, as things are built up and put together, the project comes down to putting on the finishing touches, and an official "open" date is set, generally even announced. That creates a hard deadline for the project and sends everyone scrambling
 on it to get things done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how does that relate to Windows 10? Well, it's pretty much the same thing as any software development process... Windows 10 Preview on any given build is better AND/OR worse than other builds. This section-- the Start Menu, let's say-- is nearly complete.
 It's working very well, and it looks great, with just a bit of finishing touches on the paint and cleaning up all the dust. Meanwhile, the new Mail &amp; Calendar app, is an incomplete mess still... it crashes, it doesn't have all the features yet, and you can
 tell that half the drywall isn't even put up let alone ceiling tiles and light fixtures. So, it's easy to highlight this one piece, and say, "we're not going to make it!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here's the thing... Windows 10 isn't launching today. It has 2 months to put on all those finishing touches. Not only that, Windows 10 introduces us to Windows as a Service, in which we mean to say that it's an ongoing project. We're opening THIS PORTION
 of the building on this day, and we have this future annex going to open on this other day. It's also as if to say, we know that we're opening on this day, but not all of our inventory is in house yet, so we're only going to sell or operate these aspects until
 we're ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add to that the fact that when we get a build in Preview, we're looking ONLY at the portions of code that were signed off on for that build. There are still TONS of parts that haven't been signed off on yet, because they weren't done enough to include in
 these preview builds... just like when we happened to see the building status at 4:30 in the afternoon after the construction crew went home for the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as a customer... we don't always care about all those details... what WE care about is the finished product... the grand opening, right? And when we walk into that store or business, and we see all these nicely decorated walls and shelves are stocked
 and whatnot, we're happy with it for the most part... but maybe we get upset that this one thing isn't in inventory yet, and the employee says, "Oh, I'm so sorry for the inconvenience, that inventory is coming on Tuesday!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I see Windows 10 today? Well, I have my "issues" with it today... I see a product that is unfinished, but coming along VERY NICELY. I use it on a Surface Pro 3, so I have it docked to a big 27" monitor at my desk that I use with a traditional keyboard
 and mouse, I go mobile with it as a laptop, and I also use it as a tablet. It suits ALL of these very well... in spite of a few preferences not being there (I submitted feedback), and my BIGGEST issue is not having new Intel display drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can tell you that it is EXTREMELY well suited for desktop use and functions almost identically to Windows 7 for anyone using a mouse and keyboard. You will have VERY LIMITED learning curve to know how to use it! If you're coming from Windows 8.1, there's
 actually a bigger curve to get past, because of returning to a more desktop-focused OS again, but you can nearly get the functionality back to 8.1 if you so desire... limited exceptions there like the charms bar, if you liked that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about crashing? Well, yeah, I've had some. Most of them were due to known issues and just not having the finishing touches done yet. But for the most part, I'd say 90% of my stuff is fine and works EXACTLY as I expect it to work. All of my apps -- desktop
 and modern -- work as expected, and I get the benefit of running apps in WINDOWS again and not just full screen mode that kills my productivity for multitasking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, bottom line-- am I panicking? No. Do I think that IT departments should be planning for Windows 10 on day 1? No! But do I think IT departments should be fearful or threatened or concerned about Windows 10? Definitely NOT! Should they be working with
 the latest builds and preparing for their own rollouts over the next year? ABSOLUTELY YES! Anyone IT department that doesn't exercise their upgrade rights to rollout Windows 10 over the next year is most definitely incompetent, because there are a LOT of things
 that will benefit us greatly... especially if we tie to Azure AD with our internal AD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been long-winded enough for now, so I hope this helps alleviate some concern.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure how many OS betas you guys have been a part of, but I can tell you that drivers are among the LAST thing to get released with a new OS. Until the core kernel changes are complete and MSFT gives the driver vendors completed kernel code to test
 against, it's near impossible to sign off on driver updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expect those drivers to start releasing late-June/early-July if previous OS releases have served as any indication.</p>

<p>Agreed sir,</p>
<p>the win 10 'release' will NOT be ready in July - period !</p>
<p>Drivers for all hardware will NOT be ready in July - Period !</p>
<p>The security violations and vulnerabilities in win 10 will NOT be suitable to either home OR business use - PERIOD !</p>
<p>
</p><p>The continued (FORCED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) update and changes to the system - in whatever way MS wants - in win 10 - is a constant security and standardisation threat to either the home or business user.</p>
<p>MS have stated that IF you agree to the T&amp;C's you WILL have forced updates and changes - at the will of MS - NOT security updates as such - ANYTHING that MS wants to pass down as bloatware, spyware, payware, testware, alphaware, betaware - ANYTHING - you
 - as the user ARE CONTRACTED to accept whatever they 'give you' - however it screws your PC - you have NO CHOICE - you cannot over ride it as a normal user !.</p>
<p>
</p><p>your system will always be a beta platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OP is absolutely correct - no one of sane mind would recommend - OR accept this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you SIGN AWAY your original license - your are screwed baby !.</p>
<p>
</p><p>STICK WITH WHAT YOU HAVE - let it develop and be smashed in the courts and the EU especially - then, when they effectively release win7 SP2 - ok... otherwise.. you have GOT to be having a 'larf'</p>

<p>You are free to believe whatever you want, but MY experience over the past 9 months has been very good with it, and as have the dozen or so guinea pig users I have running it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an eternal keyboard and moues&nbsp;junkie, and I've had zero trouble navigating. Likewise for my mouse-oriented users. In fact, I almost rarely use touch, and in fact, if you were sitting in my office with me right now-- I'd challenge you to an operating
 test for 10 and 7, and I'd put $100 against you that&nbsp;I'd do anything in 10 faster than you do it on 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the tone of your post, I suspect that you're here mostly to whine, and that's fine... everyone can have their opinions, but I think the OP is better served with facts and views that give REAL experiences and consideration than just reading a bunch of
 fussing.</p>

<p>According to my own experience and to many complaints on UI/UX published by desktop users throughout this forum, Windows 10 is touch-centric&nbsp;and&nbsp;it is&nbsp;not designed and not intended for desktop environment.</p>

<p>Agreed sir,</p>
<p>the win 10 'release' will NOT be ready in July - period !</p>
<p>Drivers for all hardware will NOT be ready in July - Period !</p>
<p>The security violations and vulnerabilities in win 10 will NOT be suitable to either home OR business use - PERIOD !</p>
<p>
</p><p>The continued (FORCED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) update and changes to the system - in whatever way MS wants - in win 10 - is a constant security and standardisation threat to either the home or business user.</p>
<p>MS have stated that IF you agree to the T&amp;C's you WILL have forced updates and changes - at the will of MS - NOT security updates as such - ANYTHING that MS wants to pass down as bloatware, spyware, payware, testware, alphaware, betaware - ANYTHING - you
 - as the user ARE CONTRACTED to accept whatever they 'give you' - however it screws your PC - you have NO CHOICE - you cannot over ride it as a normal user !.</p>
<p>
</p><p>your system will always be a beta platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OP is absolutely correct - no one of sane mind would recommend - OR accept this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you SIGN AWAY your original license - your are screwed baby !.</p>

<p>Hi Debi,</p>
<p>Yes, you are right. To get the new Office 2016 apps now, your organization has to be signed up for First Release or you have one of these Office 365 plans: (Note: When Office 2016 is installed, Office 2013 will be removed.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Office 365 Business</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Office 365 Business Premium</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Office 365 Small Business Premium</p>
<p>1.Open any Office application and select <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong>. (If you're doing this from Word, select File &gt; Office Account.)</p>
<p>2.Under Product Information, select <strong>Update Options</strong> &gt; <strong>
Update Now</strong> to make sure you have the latest version prior to upgrading to Office 2016.</p>
<p>3.Sign in to Office 365, at <strong><a href="http://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">portal.office.com/.../MySoftware.aspx</a></strong>.</p>
<p>4.Select a <strong>Language</strong>, then select <strong>Install</strong>.</p>
<p>Note: If you’re in First Release, you’ll see the option to install at the bottom of the software page.</p>

                    <p>I do not want Bing, ever. But&nbsp;Bing Search keeps reappearing as my homepage. I keep turning it off but it keeps comming back - like a bad penny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BING IS A PREDITORY VIRUS !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not care if someone in Redmond thinks is new and better. I am going to ask Semantic and the other anti-virus people to solve this curse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also want to seperate my PROGRAMS folders from the&nbsp;SYSTEM and place them on a different larger drive. In this new world of very fast SSDs where the system and swap file belong, moving the bloated programs should be a given.&nbsp;I was able to move my USER folder.
 You can not tell me that Microsoft engineers are not smart enough to figure out how to move the PROGRAMS folder. Like BING, they just want it their way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that Google and other search engines should sue Microsoft over this issue. Or perhaps a Microsoft Users Group class action lawsuit. Maby that would get their attention. Any lawyers out there who would like to try it? :-)</p>

            <p>Hi,
</p>
<p>What changes did you make to the computer recently?</p>
<p>What is the security software installed on the computer?</p>
<p>Try these steps and let me know the status.
</p>
<p>Step 1</p>
<p>Run the Fixit from this article to rename the hosts file:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972034</a> Once this is done reboot the computer.</p>
<p>Step 2</p>
<p>Follow the steps from this article: Fix your hijacked web browser
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/browser-hijacking.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/browser-hijacking.aspx</a></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p><b>Remove Bing</b></p>
<p>Click Start &gt;
<span>control panel&gt;programs and features&gt;select and uninstall Bing toolbar. Once this is done remember to restart the computer. You could try this trick to remove
 Bing tool bar where in you have to download and install any other 3 party toolbar and make the other toolbar as default
</span><span>in the Search Providers window, which activates the Remove option for Bing. Once you have removed Bing then you may either retain the
</span><span>3 party toolbar or
</span><span>uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><b><span>I would also like you to know that the Program files folder cannot be moved as this will result
 in instability or non-operable operating system.</span></b></p>

<p>That's really disturbing to hear.&nbsp; I haven't been able to open my calendar from my desktop pc in about a week. I'm using IE11 on Win7 Home Premium.

That never did anything for me at all. I tried compatibility view, adding the site to the trusted zone, and clearing cookies. None of it worked. My solution above worked.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also--somewhere in the support forums, I did find a list of compatible IE browsers for the Calendar.&nbsp; IE11 was NOT listed.</p>

The first thing you will have to do is uninstall IE11.&nbsp; Those instructions are listed above.&nbsp; Once completed (you might have to restart your PC a time or two), download the correct IE10 for your operating system (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-10-worldwide-languages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie-10-worldwide-languages</a>).&nbsp;
 You'll have to restart a time or two again, but it will reinstall IE10.</p>

<p>The simplest way is to go to <strong>Settings&gt;System&gt;About</strong>, and press
<strong>ALT+PrintScreen</strong>. Open <strong>ms</strong><strong>paint</strong>, paste in the image you've saved to your clipboard, save it, then insert it into a new reply using the picture icon on the reply taskbar. You should have something like the image
 below.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 10122 Update problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to update my PC from Windows 10 Insider Preview version 10074 to 10122. Downloading update in Windows Update goes well, but unfortunately, installation breaks at 93% of overall progress(75% of Configuring settings), and I see black screen as long
 as the pc is turned on. When&nbsp;it reboot, it restore previous version of operating system. After it, I see message box with error 8007002C - 4000D. When I go to Settings-&gt;Update &amp; Security&nbsp;I can see error 80070652. It may be important, that at 75% the pc rebooted
 and after it, there appeared a message about the critical error C0000022 while updating - 2 of 273(amd64_ava). Then it continued installing at previous progress, but it didn't last for a long time... I don't know what I should to do. I've tried several times.
 I've done some googling, but I haven't find anything meaningful. Could anyone help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I'm sorry if my English is bad.</p>

<h2>            will not load some very common web pages, while older machines have no problem</h2>
                    A new machine, just a couple weeks old, running Win 7 64 bit.&nbsp; It will load some - but NOT all - internet pages, using either the latest IE or Firefox.&nbsp; Sites that won't open include "Microsoft.com" and "Frys.com", which is where the machine was purchased.&nbsp;
 Firefox stops on MS page with "waiting for code jquery.com" message in the bottom corner, while for Frys it is "waiting for frys.com".&nbsp; Cleared cache, played with DNS servers, checked for malware, restored to earlier date even though I know "Frys" did not
 open at any time.&nbsp; I've reset IE settings and tried everything I have been able to find on the 'net, all to no avail.&nbsp; I have always used the Win Firewall and MS Security Essentials.&nbsp; The kicker is that 2 older XP machines on the same router have absolutely
 no problem.&nbsp; Plugging the new machine directly into the DSL box. makes no difference either.&nbsp; I'm out of ideas and hair to pull.

            The idea of the Page Layout Master view is to make a sort of template for a more-or-less fixed-size product, such as a newspaper, newsletter, or magazine. You make nice page layouts with new stories that flow from one text box to another.<br />

<h2>            Office 97 and 2003 &#34;preparing to install&#34; EVERY time</h2>
                    I have an eldery relative who is still using Office 97. I know, it's old, but she doesn't want to spend money on a newer version.
<br />
<br />
Anyways, she also calls me for help, and i find it easier to launch my copy. I used to have it installed on the Windows 98SE side of my 98/XP dual-boot computer, but I rarely use 98 these days, and I thought it would be convenient to have 97 available in XP
 mode for this situation.<br />
As per the instructions here, I installed 97 first, then 2003<br />

<br />
"Preparing to install" message when you start Word If you have multiple versions of Word installed on your computer, when you start Office Word 2003, the Windows Installer may run and display a message that states that it is preparing to install before actually
 starting Word.<br />

<br />
<br />
I know there used to be a registry hack to stop the darn thing, but I'll be darned if I can find the 97 version, I can only find the one to make 2003 and 2007 coexist. Also I did follow the instructions in the dual-boot parts.<br />
<br />
Could somebody please post a link to the registry fix to stop the darned "preparing to install" message?<br />

                    <p>Hello together,</p>
<p>
</p><p>il try to use my Microsoft Account to send Meeting Requests to other People. My Meeting is added with all Attendees to my Calendar, but all the E-Mails to the Attendees are not send. I think this has something to do with the primary Alias. My Microsoft Account
 looks like "someone_at_outlook.com" but as a primary Alias, I use "someone_at_mycustomdomain.com". All is fine, if I use "someone_at_outlook.com" as primary Alias, but no Request is send if I use "someone_at_mycustomdomain.com" as primary Alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How could I send Meeting Request with "someone_at_mycustomdomain.com" as Sender?</p>

            Hi Gabrieldedeco,<br />
<br />
We suggest you check if the missing tile has been unpinned:<br />
1. Sign in to the Office 365 <a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
portal</a>.<br />
2. In the upper-left hand corner, click the app launcher, then click View all my apps.<br />
3. If the missing tile is listed, pause on the tile,&nbsp; click the ellipses (...) and click Pin to app launcher.<br />
<br />
If you are a global admin, you are able to add a custom tile to the My apps page. In this case, Video can be added to your app launcher manually:
<br />
Go to <a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">admin center</a>&gt; Company Profile&gt; Custom tiles&gt; Add a custom tile and Pin to app launcher. For more detailed steps,

<br />
If it is not your situation, could you please provide the information below for better investigation?<br />
1. A screenshot of the affected user’s App Launcher.<br />
To insert a screenshot, please select the<strong> Insert Image</strong> icon.<br />

            &nbsp;Thanks for the reply, The icon is not unpinned, that was the first solution I tried, I looked for it in all my apps, and also I didn't want to add a tile because the icon is always a small picture in the middle of the tile.I am the global admin for my

    <title>Onedrive Shared Folders Showing Empty - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyduck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onedrive Shared Folders Showing Empty</h2>
                    <p>I share a couple folders with someone via a link or direct email from onedrive and they seem to be able to see it.&nbsp; I check the link and I can see everything. Then I send out another link or invite to share folders of the same folders to someone else and
 the folder to the first person are suddenly empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to share the same folders with different people at different times but it seems that by inviting someone else to view the project folders it then deletes the folders for people that I had previously sent it to.&nbsp; How can this be fixed? Am
 I using the right program for what I am wanting to do or should I be using something else?</p>

<p>Yes I am following the instructions in the link you provided.&nbsp; I allow viewing but no editing.&nbsp; I also do not set a expiration date.
</p>
<p>As for the permissions screen, there are so many permissions that I can't fit them all in the screen shot.&nbsp; Could it be that since I have sent so many invitations out that the system can not manage them?&nbsp; I am a general contractor so I am sharing the plans
 for projects with a lot of sub-contractors to get a bid from them.&nbsp; The permissions shows that there are 2016 links and 848 people with access.</p>

<p>Hi CyDuck,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Base on my test I can't reproduce your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that may I confirm that what happens if you share this folder to the first person again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you try to share with a few people to see the outcome? This helps to narrow whether you sent too many people that make the file empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, may I know that whether only the folder has the issue or all folders have the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, please screenshot of "the Shared Folders Showing Empty" and please check the permission about the person when the first person&nbsp;is suddenly empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a bunch for your help trying to fix my issues with this but I got tired of fighting with it and need to be able to continue working so I just switched to another platform to handle the task.&nbsp; Its incredibly frustrating to have to do so but I don't
 really have anymore time or energy to devote to trying to fix something I didn't break.</p>
<p>

<p>=FormatTelNo([Tel])</p>
<p>I have tested the output of the function itself and it is being triggered and returning the proper value, but the form's value is not changing.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; How do I get it to take the function returned value?</p>

            <p>We will need to see a Copy/Paste of&nbsp;the function's code to tell what it's doing.</p>
<p>The BeforeUpdate event can not change the control's value, so AfterUpdate&nbsp;is the event to use.&nbsp; Code like this directly in the event procedure can do what you want:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.telnum = FormatTelNo([Tel])</p>
<p>To do it without an event procedure by calling the function directly from the AdterUpdate property, the function needs to change the value of the control and&nbsp;thus must be able to figure out&nbsp;which control is using it at the time.&nbsp; You can use the form's ActiveControl
 property for that, but then the function would need to know which form contains the control.&nbsp; That's easy if the function is Public in the form's module, just use Me for the form object:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.ActiveControl = whatever</p>
<p>But if the function is in a standard module so it can be used in more than one form, then you need to pass the form object as an argument to the function.</p>
<p>The AfterUpdate property would then be:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =FormatTelNo(Form, Tel)</p>
<p>and the function would look like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Public Function FormatTelNo(frm As Form, Tel As String)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frm.ActiveControl = whatever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End Function</p>
<p>Notice that the function does not return a value.&nbsp; It has to put the result back into the control's value.</p>
