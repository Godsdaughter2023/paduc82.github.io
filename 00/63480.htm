<h2>            How to do a clean Install of Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a samsung laptop with Windows 8 pre-installed on it. Later I upgraded (For Free) to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to remove everything and want to install Windows 8.1 after formatting hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone guide me where to download Windows 8.1 from and which key to use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Cannot turn &#34;Airplane Mode&#34; off&#59; PC&#39;s Wi-Fi cannot connect.</h2>
                    <p>Dell XPS 8500 with Win 8, upgraded to Win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System crashed (cause unknown). &nbsp;A system refresh was required to restart system. &nbsp;Reloaded Win 8 updates, installed Win 8.1 upgrade and re-installed programs. &nbsp;Attempted to connect laptop and printer to the Dell Wi-Fi network. &nbsp;Trouble shooter said to disconnect
 Wi-Fi adapted and reset Airplane Mode. &nbsp;Airplane mode remained grey and would not reset to "Off." &nbsp;Repeated procedure and &nbsp;rebooted with the Wi-Fi adapter disabled. &nbsp;No change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored the system to the earliest point after re-installing all the Win 8.1 updates and Airplane Mode on button remains grey. (The restore require reloading &nbsp;the programs I had just reloaded after the system refresh, a giant time waster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone to this Forum, viewed the YouTube videos, read through all the Google findings on Airplane Mode and Wi-Fi and nothing suggested causes the Airplane Mode to be turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest a cause and offer corrective action. &nbsp;If the suggestion is to do something as "administrator," please explain how to change to the administrator mode. &nbsp;I am both the "user" and the "administrator," but cannot find a understandable explanation
 of how to switch from one to the other.</p>

            <p>Hello Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Airplane mode</span> is a setting that gives you a quick way to turn off all wireless communication on your PC. As the name implies, it's especially useful when you're on an airplane. Wireless communication includes Wi-Fi, mobile broadband, Bluetooth,
 GPS or GNSS, near field communication (NFC), and all other types of wireless communication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that in Windows 8.1, the Airplane mode option on the Networks area is designed to quickly turn off devices, then resume them again by turning off the Airplane mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Airplane mode is enabled on your&nbsp;computer and you can't turn it off because the switch is grayed out, check that there's no physical wireless On/Off switch on the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a physical wireless switch, and it's set to Off, you won't be able to turn off Airplane mode. Set the wireless switch to On and the option to turn off Airplane mode should be available.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks but you might re-read my original post. &nbsp; I tried your suggestions during the first of many hours I have invested in trying to resolve the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your beginning assumption that I did not know the purpose and function of airplane mode is frustrating. I expected more from a "Microsoft Engineer." &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>My Wi-Fi server broadcasting again! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Airplane Mode is switch is still set to "On" and it is still grey and cannot be changed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I knew what setting/configuration change made it work but I quit testing each single change because of the time required. &nbsp;It could even have been the result of one of yesterday Win 8.1 updates.</p>
<p>

            <p>Ramesh.Kumar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I again ask you reread my post. &nbsp;I am running a Win 8 system with the Win 8.1 upgrade. &nbsp;The suggestion your offered works ONLY for Win 8 systems. &nbsp;The missage I received was a big circle with an X centered in it and the directive "This snapin may not be
 used this edition of Windows 8.1" &nbsp;It then suggests I go to the "User Accounts" in the control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There it informs me that I am the Administrator, that the guest account is turned off. &nbsp;Nowhere do I find anything to click unless I want to "Change the Type of the Account." &nbsp;Clicking on change the account, "Standard" and "Administrator" and the administrator
 button is filled in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean I am already the "Built-In Administrator" or do I have to master another arcane Windows process to manage my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, you have done nothing but waste my and your time. &nbsp;Twice you have provided solutions that you would have known were inappropriate IF you had only read my posts!</p>

            <p>Not sure if you have already resolved the issue; but wanted to share my solution anyway which I found somewhere and lost the link.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an issue when the WiFi would connect but not work. Airplane mode would be ON, and when I attempt to turn it off it would toggle back to on. THis is on a desktop system (not a laptop; custom built, with windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case the culprit was the UPS connected to the machine with the default driver.<br />
<br />
To verify - disconnect UPS and reboot - the whole Airplane mode will be gone and wifi will work properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix - install UPS driver from the UPS manufacturer - in my case I had APC Smart UPS 750 connected, I've installed PowerShute business edition agent. Reconnected UPS and rebooted - no airplane mode and all still works fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speculation:<br />
Apparently when the system sees UPS without the third party driver attached it think's it's a laptop and optimizes and configures itself in a mobile mode. Installing third party driver causes the ups port to be claimed by the third party service which prevents
 windows from making assumptions.</p>

            <p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>I have the same problem and it started a few days ago.&nbsp; I was watching a video online and had a few other IE windows open - swapping back and forth - and suddenly, the machine went into Airplane mode.&nbsp; I cannot turn it off manually... If I click on an IE
 window, I can request it 'fix' the problem - and it does, but when I click on the icon in the lower right it&nbsp;&nbsp;shows the network connection isn't available (grayed out)&nbsp; and&nbsp;I cannot change out of airplane mode...Even if I just fixed the connection, if I click
 on that icon in the lower right, it shows that it's in airplane mode and will not let me change it - it's grayed out.&nbsp; it's very strange...</p>

            <p>Great News Ramesh Nov. 26 above links to the solution - here's the answer - try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Had this issue today and this is what worked for me. I have a dell laptop M731R with a 17.3" display. I pressed the blue&nbsp;<strong>Fn</strong>&nbsp;key + the&nbsp;<strong>F2&nbsp;</strong>key with the wireless symbol on it and the message "Airplane mode turned off" appeared.
 Now my wi-fi is turned back on. Hope this helps. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my machine it's Fn key&nbsp;+ PrtScr but it worked like a charm - I can even use the icon on the lower right again!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried every wi-fi setting I can locate (on both the Control Panel and On Settings). &nbsp;Nothing made any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The UPS was disconnected and the PC rebooted without the USPS. &nbsp;That made no difference. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I temporarily disabled my AV software and firewalls and rebooted. &nbsp;No difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought maybe getting the new XPS 8900 would solve the issue. &nbsp; I booted up the new PC plugged in the Ethernet cable and let the &nbsp;machine load all the MS upgrades to the Win 10 native OS. &nbsp;Took many hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Airplane mode was locked in the on position before I loaded any additional software onto the new Dell so I do not think it is a software conflict.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is with the Windows 10 OS, or one of the Win 10 upgrades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions? &nbsp;This has become a giant PITA for me. &nbsp;I am having to run all my Wi-Fi connections off a separate modem and that in itself creates other problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Microsoft, find a solution.</p>

            <p>I'll speculate here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The reasoning is that part of the problem is that the system thinks your desktop is a portable.
</p>
<p>I feel it's one of the misbehaving HID devices not designed up to spec messing up the OS handling of airplane mode services ans support (see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj128401%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try this</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Based on your response you did have UPS connected at least once. Connect UPS back. Go to Batteries in Device Manager and Uninstall the driver (Properties-&gt;Driver-&gt;Uninstall). Also uninstall anything UPS related in the Human Interface devices related to
 UPS or battery. Then disconnect UPS. Then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is not gone - try this</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Check your system if you have any other rogue HID drivers.&nbsp; Disconnect and/or uninstall and/or disable the driver of all weird peripherals (bluetooth dongles, etc). Look in the device manager under Human INterface devices. Disable all of them (except
 your keyboard and/or mouce, so you can still manipulate your machine) and see if the issue persists (don't forget to reboot).
<br />
<br />
If the issue is gone - start enabling back the HIDs one by one rebooting after each and checking for the issue. This way you'll find offending device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists - either your keyboard or mouse can be culprit. Disable each in turn (re-enabling the other one not to lose control of your machine; or use remote control)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, please report back if you are able to resolve it or not.</p>

<h2>            Invalid ip configuration&#47;cannot reach DHCP&#47;169.xxx ip config</h2>
                    Hi, I recently upgraded my pc build and put it all together. After booting it up and it seems to be running fine, I cannot connect to the internet. My network status is connected but not able to access the network. I get an error saying I don't have a
 valid ip configuration and that I cannot reach DHCP server. My auto configuration ip is a 169.xxx.xx.xx. After a night of trying every possible way to resolve this problem I am here looking for guidance. Thanks in advance.&nbsp;

<h2>            Computer stuck in boot loop after power putage during update.</h2>
                    I was 'AFK' for about half an hour and when I came back I discovered my PC updating with 20% progress and then I experience a power cut/outage. After regaining power I switched my PC back on and discovered it is now stuck in a Loop: It says 'Zoostorm'
 with a loading circle underneath it (what normally displays when starting up my PC) for around 20 seconds, the screen goes black, new display and at the bottom of this black screen it says 'Attempting to recover installation' with a loading circle above for
 around 1-2 seconds, new display at the bottom of this black screen is says 'Restoring your previous version of Windows...' for around 1-2seconds, then another black screen comes out for around 1-2 seconds, finally it cuts out and my monitor displays 'No Signal
 Detected!' (What normally happens when my PC is turned off). I had my PC turned off and all the wires disconnected overnight (for 14hours total) and it has now been in this loop for an hour so I know for sure there is no progress

            Hi Jadon,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset

            You need to use any file sharing website like Google drive or onedrive to send the files to me.
<br />Here is a rough idea of what you need to do in order to send the files to me except for the fact that you need to do it for the rollback files I mentioned above rather than event logs

            Code
<br />0xC1900101 - 0x2000c
<br />
<br />Cause
<br />Windows Setup encountered an unspecified error during Wim apply in the WinPE phase. 
<br />This is generally caused by out-of-date drivers.
<br />Mitigation
<br />Disconnect all peripheral devices that are connected to the system, except for the mouse, keyboard and display. 
<br />Contact your hardware vendor to obtain updated device drivers. 
<br />Ensure that "Download and install updates (recommended)" is accepted at the start of the upgrade process.
<br />
<br />What external devices are connected to the PC?

    <title>Xbox crashes when playing videos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petemoss41  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox crashes when playing videos</h2>
                    Everytime I watch a video on YouTube my xbox one freezes the video and instantly shuts down. This has even happened when watching a game trailer in the xbox store. Has anyone else had this problem? This wasn't a problem when I got my console on day one,
 it has only happened in the last week or so. I guess I'll have to contact Microsoft and get a replacement...does anyone know how long that process takes? What sucks is most of my games are digital downloads. If I get a replacement console I will have re download
 everything and there goes my bandwidth for the month.

<p>Just download your most played if need be. I also heard they send you a loner first and put a holding charge on a credit card so at least you have your one until the 'loner' comes. Sadly you would have to download games on your loner and then do a again
 when they send back your refurbished original. I could be wrong though, I'm just going off hear say</p>

<h2>            Hotspot turns off mobile data transfer</h2>
                    <p>Anyone has the mighty unluck of turning the hotspot on, turns immediately off the mobile data. Once upon a time ago I downgraded from W10M to 8.1 to correct the issue, but then upgraded with no problem. Everything went marvellously, but recently this phenomenon
 started again to rise from the flames of W10M h@ll. Turning on hotspot -&gt; mobile data turns off. The status bar shows "turned on", the Settings "shows turned off".</p>
<p>Unless you are too aimless in your life to be unbored by Microsoft products it is a nice feature. But as I am willing to use my phone to share Internet for my laptop this feature causes me quite a lot of headache. Needless to say, it only lasts just a few
 days, then I go and by any Android device, that meets this simple requirement; share mobile data internet via Wifi.</p>
<p>Have luck in your life, more than me.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that must make you feel upset and we will work toward fixing this situation for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try performing a soft reset and check if the issue persists. Follow the steps provided by one of the MVP in the link below:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">Click here</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you do not have the latest build installed which is build 14367, I suggest you to install it and check if the issue persists. For more information on this build, refer the article below:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/06/16/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14367-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14367 for PC and Mobile</a></strong></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for being rude, I should not write that lines.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>Soft reset done</p>
<p>Result: none</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hard reset: done</p>
<p>Result:none</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insider Preview? As a normal 1bit user I do not understand, why stable end user versions should be replaced with Insider Preview Build? However, I could not find the way, to install that build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover: now Wifi does not turns on, just waits, pulls beautiful dotted lines, and remains off. What 8GROM and 1G RAM can do, it is done perfectly, but functions were better with WP8 and WP8.1. Sorry for writing that, but that is not only my opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I am trying Windows Device Recovery Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next step is Huawei P9 lite...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have fun, follow 9GAG.</p>

            Hi Kai.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most through way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The button that says 'Remove' is disabled for English (United Kingdom)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Moreover, I have never installed this myself, and never agreed Windows to put random languages in my preferences. I used to have 2 languages, this morning I have 4:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My first question is how to remove unneeded languages and only have ENG US and БГР BGPT and second how to prevent this to happen again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

            If you add a secondary language to Windows 10 version 1803 that shares the same base language as the Windows display language, neither language can be removed.
<br />
<br />For example: If English (United Kingdom) is the current Windows display language, and you then add English (India) to the Preferred languages list, afterwards neither English (United Kingdom) nor English (India) can be removed from the Preferred languages list.
<br />
<br />Note: The most notable effect of having multiple related languages in the Preferred languages list is additional entries in the text input selector. You can remove unwanted language list entries using these steps:
<br />
<br />1. From the Start menu, search for powershell.
<br />
<br />2. Right-click Windows Powershell in the search results and choose Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Type or copy/paste the following command at the command prompt, and then press Enter. 
<br />
<br />Get-WinUserLanguageList
<br />
<br />After typing this command, make note of the “LanguageTag” listed for the language you wish to remove, as you will need it in the next step.
<br />
<br />4.  Type or copy/paste each of the following commands at the command prompt, and then press Enter. In the following commands, instead of typing &lt;languagecode&gt;, replace it with the language tag you wish to remove, such as en-in for English (India).
<br />
<br />$LangList = Get-WinUserLanguageList
<br />$MarkedLang = $LangList | where LanguageTag -eq "&lt;languagecode&gt;"
<br />$LangList.Remove($MarkedLang)
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $LangList -Force

<h2>            Intel HD Graphics 620 to Miracast problem</h2>
                    <p>Trying to connect via Screen Mirroring to Samsung TV and the error on the tv reads "Video data not supported".
</p>
<p>Been having the same issue with Intel 4400 and had to downgrade drivers to make it work. Tried it this time as well, but no driver version is compatible with Miracast.</p>
<p>To avoid silly and generic answers, I have tried all available versions of drivers, the laptop connects effortlesly with HDMI cable and have updated Windows 10 to the latest available version.</p>
<p>Intel and Microsoft support line urged me to open a thread in here, so it could escalate to bug report.</p>

<p>As I have clearly stated beforehand, I would appreciate if you skipped the silly suggestions and just open a bug report!</p>
<p>Kaby lake processors were not around before Windows 10 and, with this in mind, your suggested solution is totally useless.<br />
</p>
<p>No changes were made. The connection doesn't work. Simple as that! On an older 4400 Intel graphics processor, the solution was to roll back to an older driver. This time around, the laptop wasn't working with the stock driver being used, wasn't working with
 an earlier version, and surprise, didn't work even though I updated the drivers. No change was made that made an impact on the problem at hand.</p>
<p>To further assist with your ignorance, I would reccomend to read the thread before answering. Thank you.</p>

</p><p><span>When you install a new printer, Windows typically names it after the manufacturer or model. You can rename by following the below given steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key and type <strong>Devices&nbsp;and Printers</strong> in search box and hit enter.
</span></li><li><span>Right-click a printer that need&nbsp;to renamed, and then click <strong>Printer properties</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the <strong>General</strong> tab,&nbsp;and then type the new name in the text box.</span></li></ol>

            Stumbled on to changing the printer name in Windows 10. Go to Printers and Devices from the control Panel&nbsp;and double click the printer you want to change the name on. That will open a number of options for that printer. Double click the Customize Your
 Printer option and that will open printer properties for that printer with the current name highlighted. Just enter the new name and you're finished.

 However for my HP2025, I had to click on the "Change Properties" button at the bottom left of the dialog box before I could change the name.&nbsp; Guess your mileage will vary with different drivers, even from the same company.&nbsp; But thanks to all who posted help

    <title>Xbox Music Player on Windows 8.1 PC not playing AIFF format - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jochie van der merwe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Music Player on Windows 8.1 PC not playing AIFF format</h2>
                    I use Windows 8.1 (all software up to date) on my PC. The default music player seems to be Xbox Music Player. When I try to play an AIFF track on the Music Player, it displays a message that the track is incompatible. However, if I play it on Windows Media
 Player, it plays. So, I suspect that the necessary AIFF codecs are somewhere on my PC where Windows can get them. Somehow my Xbox Music Player app which is one of the native Windows 8.1 apps that came with my Windows 8.1, has an issue with AIFF files.
<p>
</p><p>Is there&nbsp;a known&nbsp;issue with Xbox Music Player on Windows 8.1 and AIFF files, or is it just my Xbox Music Player acting up? Any ideas on getting my Xbox Music Player to play with AIFF files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for my insistence to get the Xbox Music Player to work with all my music files is to allow me to synchronise my iTunes music with my WindowsPhone. It seems that if a music file cannot play on the Xbox Music Player on my PC, it also cannot play
 on my WP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also would not like to duplicate my high quality iTunes files to MP3 files just for the sake of synchronising my iTunes collection with my WindowsPhone. If I could get AIFF files to work on my Xbox Music Player I could download all my iTunes files in high
 quality AIFF format with no duplications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas to help solve this Xbox Music Player/AIFF conundrum will be much appreciated.</p>

    <title>Entitlement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russtafarian-22d99e8d-c63d-4233-be3e-b1051f256b7e  say:</h3>
<h2>            Entitlement</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently read that as an Xbox gamer and someone who has spent much time on the system, that I have a sense of Entitlement. I agree. I'm entitled to get what I pay for, when I'm supposed to, to have a network that is reliable and a community that is
 policed appropriately. Please read below the post I refer to.</p>

<p>"On here we are sick to death of people ranting about what they think they are entitled to for free, or what they are currently being given free is not good enough.</p>
<p>You buy and play games for your own entertainment, you are not doing microsoft any favours, you are entitled to nothing."</p>

<p>I'm not sure what he talking about, as in 12 years I have received nothing for free, been double-billed, had my account hacked, my GT spoofed and finally my account made inaccessible by Microsoft's security updates. I have removed my GT and account from
 my xbox and now play offline only. The idiot that wrote the above comment, Lizard perhaps you can qualify his remarks, has summed it up perfectly. Give your money and time, buy the consoles, upgrade to gold, play on the network for years, make some friends.
 In 2 days, due to poor support, console issues and comments like the above, I dropped everything. All my DLC and what was left on my pre-paid gold account sacrificed in the name of poor service, support and security.</p>

<p>The only thing I've felt I was "entitled" to was what I paid for and haven't received.</p>

<p>Well done on totally misquoting me.</p>
<p>At no point did i say people should not be entitled to what they pay for.</p>
<p>My point was, no user is entitled to free stuff simply because they have been a customer for a length of time.</p>
<p>I also feel very strongly against those people that come here ranting on the 29th of each month that the free games for gold "are not good enough"</p>
<p>At no point did i mention being double billed,hacked, gt spoofed or inaccessible etc,etc.</p>
<p>If you are going to quote someone and call them an idiot, GET YOUR FACTS RIGHT FIRST.</p>

<p>It's a Dog eat dog world OP. </p>
<p>I don't play online for much the same reasons either, but I wouldn't give up my tag, games with gold, DLC etc in protest over it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to make Live better? Then it starts with dumping the propaganda we all were programmed into since birth. For even if we (gamers) ran the system, it would no doubt be run much the same as it is now.
</p>
<p>Perks. I paid for Gold, initially for Halo 4 Spartan Ops a few years back.</p>
<p>On that note: Please make H4:Sp Ops available offline for the 360</p>
<p>Even though I no longer game online. I have nonetheless received a return on my latest 12 month sub (March to March 2016) with Gold by way of GwG.
</p>
<p>Oh, well. For what it's worth: My 2 Cents! </p>

<p>The network is reliable,i've been on xbox live since about 2003 &amp; in all that time live has been down about 4 times.</p>
<p>It is policed properly,just have a look at the ban/suspension forums.</p>
<p>Your gamertag wasn't "spoofed",just because you've picked a gamertag that doesn't mean someone else is not entitled to make a variation off that tag if they want.</p>
<p>Your account can't be "hacked" &amp; setting up security proofs is a very simple process,not sure how it's Microsofts fault if you can't follow the easy steps.</p>

<p>I haven't had too many problems with xbox live in my time. Of course, the original xbox 360 and the 5 repairs I had to go through, but ever since, it's been going great. Yeah xbl goes out once in a while, but that's life and it's bound to happen. Sometimes
 mistakes happen, XBL isn't perfect either, so mistakes are bound to happen. </p>

<p>Badger, I have more diplomas on my wall than you would think. One is an MCSE. It's not the steps to follow, it's the service when the steps don't work. You, Owen and Doc seem to have a tag-team thing here. I'm sorry that I share a different opinion than
 yours, based on years in this industry, but I do. To have Ambassadors explain why I'm wrong is counter productive, and frankly insulting. I'm not the only one saying these things. I never have been. The strong push-back from people with vested interests only
 adds to the problem. You obviously have an agenda, as I do. Mine is to explain to people to be careful before going on Live. They need to know that MS cannot be depended on to secure their system, and even after a problem, is very slow to react. Yours simply
 seems to be try and discredit the people making these comments. Things haven't changed in these forums in 12 years. Same people think they have more power than they do. Same people think others want or care about their opinions.</p>
<p>Better get back to work before your boss discovers you're playing around on his network again. :-)</p>

<p>@Russta -- I understand your frustrations, but the vast majority of us have never experienced those things, so we come on here to tell the same people you're trying to tell, "that it isn't as bad as this one person makes it out to be."</p>
<p>Also, while gamerscore is not the end all/be all for gaming experience(s), how does one play Xbox for 12 years and only accrue a 2675 score?!</p>
<p>Anyways, best of luck to you.</p>

<p>Hello Tomas!</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Thanks for bringing this situation to our attention on the forums. I understand you are having trouble connecting to Xbox Live through your Xbox App on Windows 10 is that correct? If so, I suggest you try fully powering down the PC and then unplugging it
 from the power for a minute or two. Once that is done try it again, if the situation persists you may want to try Uninstalling and Reinstalling the Xbox App itself.

<h2>            Windows 10 64bit Randomly Unresponcive and Freezing.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 always seems to have problems for me, this time I randomly hear some kind of windows alert sound semi frequently. Also most all windows button on my tool bar do not work, start menu cortana and notifications to be specific. Windows also randomly
 freezes and stopps working, I can't click anything or do anything new but anything currently running keeps working such as videos, I just can't pause/unpause them. I have gotten a error window saying windows stopped working and asking if I would like to close
 it before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any advice/help with fixing this problem is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I have tried everything in this list: http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/has-your-windows-10-start-menu-stopped-working-here-are-four-ways-to-fix-it-11364000314532</p>
<p>besides system restore, which I am hesitant to do because windows 10 will just have another problem for me that I will need to troubleshoot again.</p>

            <p>A clean install of Windows 10 on fully supported hardware always works correctly the first time. Anything other than that is a gamble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade your operating system, you may or may not be successful, and even if you seem to be successful at first, your operating system may suffer later. ('You' here doesn't refer only to you personally.) This is true regardless of what operating system
 is installed and regardless of how technically experienced you are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why people who really understand technology always prefer a clean install. However, a clean install demands a great deal of technical knowledge because you are starting from scratch. Most people have no reason to possess that kind of technical knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An upgrade to Windows 10 on fully supported hardware only works correctly if your previous operating system and all installed software are setup and maintained only in ways that are supported by the software developer. That's not the case for a great many
 people, who do all kinds of unsupported things to their computers. Upgrading a computer like that is totally unpredictable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, the best thing to do is to show your computer to a professional. If that person is able to diagnose what's going wrong and fix it, great. If they can't accurately diagnose the problems, or if there are too many problems to fix, then the best
 thing to do is to backup your personal data and do a clean install.</p>
