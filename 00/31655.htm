Hello,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I am working towards writing a powershell script for uninstalling the current version 54.0.2840.99 m of Google Chrome from my machine but could not be able to do so. I am using the following piece of code in my script:<br />

However, when I try and install it, I get this:<br />

I have also gone into "Turn windows settings on or off" and ticked the box for SP1, but nothing is working.<br />

Any ideas?<br />

<p><span>Hello iam117,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After looking at your screenshots you are trying to install PowerMarker V3.25 which is looking for .NET Framework version 1.1.4322. Windows 7 has .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 installed
 with the operating system. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The PowerMarker v3.25 released on 2/5/2006 and seems to be intended for Windows 98. I would suggest that you use the Compatibility Mode and select Windows 98.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right click on the program's shortcut, .exe file, or installation program.</span></p>
<p><span>Click on Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the Compatibility tab.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To Run a Program in Compatibility Mode -
</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: Runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows. Try this setting if you know the program is designed for (or worked in) a specific previous version of
 Windows. </span></p>
<p><span>A) Check the Run this program in compatibility mode for box.
</span></p>
<p><span>B) Click on the drop down menu arrow and select which version of Windows the program was made for.</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: Always pick the latest Windows version the program was written for to have a better chance of it running properly in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>To Change the Settings for a Program -
</span></p>
<p><span>A) Check or uncheck the settings you want for the program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To Change the Privilege Level of a Program -</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: Runs the program as an administrator. Some programs require administrator privileges to run properly. If you are not currently logged on as an administrator, this option is
 not available. </span></p>
<p><span>A) Check or uncheck the Run this program as an administrator box to enable or disable this option.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To Change All of These Settings Above for All Users -</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: Lets you choose settings that will apply to all users on this computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>A) Click on the Change settings for all users button.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>B) Repeat steps 4, 5, and 6 in this window to apply them to all users on the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>C) Click on OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Click on OK to apply the changes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please reply back and let us know if these suggestions helped to resolve your issue as they may be of benefit to others with the same problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,
</span></p>

    <title>Please recommend a good 3rd party backup software that puts me in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alokep  say:</h3>
<h2>            Please recommend a good 3rd party backup software that puts me in control</h2>
                    Whats a good backup software that lets me control which directories to back up, select destination, schedule etc?<br />
<br />
File History is easy to use, but not very transparent.&nbsp; I'm not sure which files it backs up (I have multiple user accounts on my PC).&nbsp; It also makes it inconvenient to look for a single file to restore.&nbsp; The image backup is a all-or-nothing solution, which
 is an overkill for many situations.<br />
<br />
Is there an solution that will <br />
a) let me select directories to backup<br />
b) let me select the destination<br />
c) backup windows settings (like system restore, or invoke system restore when the backup runs)<br />
d) make it easy to restore individual files, including older versions or files removed entirely from the PC.<br />
e) backup all users<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Aloke<br />

            One can search for and try out 3rd party software, of course.<br />
I was hoping to get input from the community on that and benefit from their collective experience.<br />
<br />
However, considering the lack of response.. maybe every one is suffering through the limitations of File History (as documented in this article, especially the last part thereof:<br />

                    <p>Over the past week I have been consistently seeing "X&nbsp;is not in your contacts" within Skype both on Android and Web. I have signed in/out, reset my login credentials, reinstalled the Android app and re-added these contacts. But somewhere the association

I have not disappeared from their lists.</li><li>Also experiencing intermittent search results. If I search for someone I may or may not see them on the first try</li></ul>
<p>I am at a loss as to what to do past this point. It's interfering with my usual use of Skype. I am happy to upgrade to a paid plan or something if it would resolve this. It is a tall ask to request my contacts which to another messenger however so I want
 to try to get it up and going again ideally.</p>

<p><span>Julie_S1,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am using&nbsp;</span>web.skype.com. I do not see any area within here to get a version number. I see&nbsp;<span><a href="https://s4w.cdn.skype.com/0-239-0/js/main.js" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://s4w.cdn.skype.com/0-239-0/js/main.js</a>
</span>in the code which perhaps 0-239-0 has something to do with the versioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Android it shows version 8.15.0.4. The problem exists quite clearly and is easier to replicate on the web version. I just happen to use mobile from time to time and noticed it also behaving erratically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example from a conversation with someone who was a contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/451090e7-7eb9-4aae-bcc4-c36da266b72b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/451090e7-7eb9-4aae-bcc4-c36da266b72b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I will note that as of today I am not seeing these messages. They could come back. But the ones from yesterday telling me to add this contact are no longer there. Like before it was very random and could happen at any time and to any contact. It also appeared
 to wipe out the chat history with these people as well.</p>

<p>I'm sorry Julie_S1, I find the instructions unclear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've told you that I experience this problem on your website and it just so happens the problem carries over to your Android app. You have now asked me to uninstall and reinstall Skype. Let me reiterate: I am using web.skype.com and my contacts continue
 to go missing and I am prompted to re-add them. I also experience intermittent search results when trying to locate contacts and often am just left with a spinning loading icon and no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I would love to uninstall and re-install web.skype.com I feel this is not in my bag of tricks. That website is likely managed by Microsoft and I am not in charge of that one.</p>

<h2>            error 651 in windows 8</h2>
                    <div>I use a desktop with win 8 pro installed in it for connecting with web. i keep the modem in "always on" mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;The pc worked just fine for 2 months after which i started connectivity problems, for which i contacted my network provider. they changed parameters and port ( don't know what it is; it &nbsp;was told by them like this to me ) and everything started working
 fine again. but since past week this problem has cropped up again and the above solution from our network provider isn't working.</div>
<div>when i changed the modem mode " start as disconnected" mode and tried to connect the internet, the following error appeared &nbsp;</div>
<div>It says "Error 651: Your modem (or other connecting device) has reported an error"</div>
<div>i have tried most of the simple things like restarting the modem, resetting the tcp/ip settings, disabled my firewall, etc except for the replacing the raspppoe.sys &nbsp;file.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i would like to try this option too but from where do i get this genuine file for win 8 pro 64 bit to replace my current file ?&nbsp;</div>
<div>is there any other solution ?</div>
                </div>

            <p>I have tried all of the above but it comes down to installing a new driver for error
</p>
<p>I can get wifi but not broadband cable and diagnostics say compi]ter is OK </p>
<p>but says DNS server error </p>
<p>Telstra said its a Microsoft product and will cost $200</p>
<p>I simply cant believe that a company like Microsoft can cause the problem by downloading 8.1&nbsp;not offer on line help
</p>
<p>My daughter also installed office for apple and it didnt work Dick Smith said call Microsoft but they didnt answer
</p>
<p>I have been using Microsoft since windows 3 but I am afraid its the last straw and will warn all my professional friends on the dangers of 8.1
</p>
<p>My neighbour downloaded 8.1 and her computer was trashed as well </p>

<h2>            xboxlive gold</h2>
                    What happened to xbox live gold family? I have a gold membership and a child accout for a child. For some reason the child account has no gold access anymore. It seems to have worked about a month or so. Now unless I sign into the console as an adult first,
 the child cannot go online or play multiplayer games. Also ive searched for solutions on my microsoft account and found nothing. What is the reason and solution for this?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Yes, I view photos fine in other apps on this HTPC. In Windows Media Center for example.</p>
<p>2. Yes, the whole photo become bigger.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;It's just former Windows Explorer where you manage folders and files. As I understand in Windows 8 it renamed to File Explorer. In File Explorer when activate images or folder with images in Picture tools&nbsp;Manage tab you have the option named Slide show.</p>
<p>4. It's just an ordinary computer that I use like HTPC.</p>
<p>5. As I understand File explorer slideshow uses some default app. I don't know what is it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Vladimir</p>

            I'm using my Panasonic 37-inch TV as my PC monitor using HDMI. The pictures were fine on Windows 7 Ultimate Slideshow, but since upgrading to Windows 8 Pro, all my pictures are zoomed AND cropped in File Explorer Slideshow. Portrait pictures are only showing
 left upper corner. Landscape pictures are showing the left upper portion of the black sidebars and less of the left corner of the picture (less when compared to the Portrait pictures). My TV is capable of using 1920x1680 Full HD mode and my Graphics card is
 a 1GB ATI Radeon HDMI. As I've already stated above, everything was fine in WIn 7 Slideshow, with 150% and 175% Display Resolution zoom controlled by Windows 7. In Windows 8 with the same Display Resolution zoom settings, the pictures viewed in Win 8 Slideshow
 are OVER-zoomed beyond the right-hand and bottom edge of the screen. The Pictures can be viewed correctly when using Windows 8 Picture viewer (right-click the picture and left-click on Preview).&nbsp; BUT, here also, when you click the centre button for "Play slide
 show" (or use F11), the Slideshow is OVER-zoomed and only the left hand corner is visible.<br />

            Hi Niyamath - were you able to find a solution to this problem?&nbsp; Again, it boils down to the desktop File Explorer "Slide Show" option (invoked from the Picture Tools / Manage" tab) only showing images at their 150% size, thus not fitting to the screen
 size during the slide show. Note: this behavior does not happen on the Modern UI Photos slideshow....

            I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; The pictures are zoomed and I can't see the entire picture when I use the slide show&nbsp;using the desktop File Explorer.&nbsp; I have Windows 8 and do not like to use the Windows 8 Picture&nbsp;app since this app limits WHERE I can take
 pictures from ... I have pictures on an external SD card and can't access them there, but can via the desktop version.&nbsp; But the pictures are zoomed and I can only see part of them.&nbsp; When I right-click, there is no option to change the size of the image.&nbsp; What's
 going on?

<h2>            Some programs will not open</h2>
                    I have a HP Pavillion HPE Elite desktop computer that has been running Windows 10 since the roll out. Lately some of the programs will not open from my desktop. One of them is the Edge browser. I can right click it and select open but nothing happens.
 If I try to open Task Manager I just get a black screen and everything locks up. If I re start the computer everything will work fine for awhile then the issues will start again. I have run Malwarebytes and Superantispyware scans as well as a Norton 360 scan
 and they all say the computer is clean. I also ran a sfc scan and no problems were detected.&nbsp; I am trying not to reinstall or refresh&nbsp;the OS. I have many files and programs that didn't come with Windows&nbsp;that I don't want to lose. I also have hundreds of bookmarks
 in Edge that I definitely do not want to lose. I have not added any hardware or any new software programs for months. &nbsp;I have almost 700GB of free space on my hard drive and&nbsp;8GB of&nbsp;RAM. A diagnost

<p>Here's the thing that really bothers me. A restart fixes your problem for awhile. Sounds like you have tried a lot of things. Have you tried a clean boot?</p>

            One of the things that was happening was Malwarebytes kept asking me to turn on real time protection. Since I have another program doing that task I always declined. The issues started right around the time I was getting those pop ups so on the off chance
 that was causing things I uninstalled the program. It's been 2 days since I did that and every thing is running smooth with no issues. This surprises me since so many people sing the praises of that program. I guess I will find out in the next few days if
 that solved the issue but as of now it sure looks like it.

            Hi Glad to hear you solved your problem. I have been running Malwarebytes in real time with a anti-virus for a long time. MBAM has never gave me a problem. I ran it with MSE and now with Windows Defender. MBAM has blocked a ton of malicious websites in-coming
 and some out-bound. I would never go on the internet with out my web protection on. I think most techs will agree that your problem is Norton 360, but if you trust and feel secure with Norton. that's what you should use. When I find a senior running Norton,
 I uninstall it and replace it. Seniors are amazed how much better their PC responds. IMHO Norton is a resource hog and causes problems. That's just my opinion. I have seen a ton of people complain about high CPU. Any way, those are my thoughts. Glad you got
 things figured out. Thanks for the update response.<br />

            I'm not sure exactly what happened but since uninstalling Malwarebytes it's been a week and none of the issues have happened again. All of my programs open with no issues at all. Unless it's a coincidence I am thinking Malwarebytes was conflicting somehow
 with other programs. The strange thing is Malwarebytes was on the computer for many months before any issues showed up. The issues just happened to start around the time Malwarebytes was prompting me to turn on the real time protection so on the outside chance
 it was the problem I uninstalled it not really thinking that would work. I can only say that as soon as I did that the problems were gone.

            <p>Hi! I never argue with success. If it works for you, that's the main thing. MBAB has been my friend for years. As I stated I'm not a Norton fan.&nbsp; I suppose there could have been a conflict between them.</p>
<p>I run Windows Defender and MBAM in real time.</p>

<h2>            Redeemed Code for wrong Gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>Alright so I was at a friends house and we were both signed into his Xbox One console with our gamertags. He had redeemable codes for Assassin's Creed which he hadn't used yet and we wanted to play. We redeemed the codes on his xbox but apparently they got
 linked to my gamertag instead of his as i guess my profile was the active one when we used the code. Now he can not play the games on his xbox with his gamertag and when he tries to play it tells him to buy them in the store. Is there any way to fix this so
 the games are linked to his account and not mine?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>4K bluray says it cant play disk&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> badwolf cdxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            4K bluray says it cant play disk&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just got an Xbox One S a couple days ago and everything has been working fine until i bought my first 4K Blu ray and it will not play. The first time i tried to play the 4k disc it hung on the blu ray splash screen for a few minutes then said it can not
 play this disk. I pressed eject on the console and the screen flashed and it went to the loading screen for the 4k blu ray but after 20 minutes it still was still trying to load the disk. I shut down, Gave it many reboots and it isn't erroring out anymore
 but it just hangs on the 4k disc.</p>
<p>The Disc i am trying to watch is Now you see me, The standard blu ray that came with it will load and play just fine, put the 4k disc in and it just gets stuck on the blu ray splash screen.</p>
<p>I noticed the blu ray app said update after i already updated it and after the update it would still say update. I updated the blu ray app over 20 times total and it wouldn't stick. The blu ray app read as about 85MB at this time, the update was like 286KB
 i believe every time it tried updating.</p>
<p>I moved all my games off of internal storage and left all apps thinking it may be caused by having all my old apps on an external drive from my old launch console on the preview dash and i reset my One S to factory. After the reset i downloaded all apps
 from the app store again.</p>
<p>This time the Blu ray app is under 30MB in size and will not say an update is available. Still plays standard blu rays just fine but will not play the 4k disk still.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked for system updates and there are none. Blu ray app will not show an available update and never has since the reset. I spent hours trying to get it working last night with no luck and this is a main reason i bought the One S. My Xbox One S
 connects to my Onkyo TX-NR656 in one of the 3 HDCP 2.2 ports, The receiver then connects to the 4K 60Hz HDMI port on my Tv, a Vizio M60-C3. Xbox is displaying dash etc. at 4k just fine.</p>
<p>This doesn't seem like a connection issue, seems like an issue with the blu ray app. Does anyone know what i need to do to get 4k blu rays working?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<p>The main 4k disc issue turned out to be the disc itself. I got Days of Future past and it plays fine on the 4k disc. Guess its off to best buy to return Now you see me and try a different one.</p>

<p>So i exchanged the Now you see me 4k disc and the new one does play fine. &nbsp;Seems like there are some poorly manufactured disks out there, Probably just because its a new format.
</p>
<p>Now you see me, X-Men Days of future past and Deadpool 4k disc's all work fine for me. Hopefully Now you see me 2 works also when i get it in 2 weeks.</p>

I have been trying to fix this error for the past few hours with no luck. Having this error with my ADATA UV150 32GB USB flash drive. The laptop I am using is Lenovo ideapad 100S (14). The things I have tried:<br />

<p>Hello Justine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for the quick response, as I have mentiond before, I have tried uninstalling the drivers for the USB flash drive, the only issue is, that I cannot uninstall the drivers while the flash is unplugged, as they do not appear in the device manager (I
 can see the drivers for the USB flash drive only when the USB is plugged in). Is there anything else that I could try? Or am I possibly doing something wrong?</p>

    <title>Xbox Live profile corrupted. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fos kuvol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live profile corrupted.</h2>
                    
<p>I've been having problems with my xbox live profile for the last several months. Basically what will happen is that the profile with completely reset, losing it's avatar, gamerscore, everything but the name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to fix this problem I generally recover the gamertag from xbox live, but now that is only helping for very brief periods of time. Once in a while I will recover an already corrupt profile, and usually it only serves to fix the problem until the
 next time I sign in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem started happening about 2-3 months after I started using a USB stick to store my profile, I do this because I have the new model xbox, which doesn't have memory card support (Bad idea Xbox...) and it is the easiest way to transport my profile
 and game saves to the 6 different Xboxes I could use at any point in time. 1 at home, 1 at my parents', and 4 at a cybercafe/gaming lounge. This problem ONLY affects my profile, no other profiles on the stick are ever affected. And all the game data loads
 and works as it should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reformatted the USB stick already, and that only resolved the issue for a couple of days, I am not about to repeat the process of moving all the data off the stick, reformatting it, then moving it all back every time I have this issue. But since the
 account-creation server is apparently down for xbox live, I can't recover my gamertag right now. Any tips/remedies?</p>

<p>Sorry to double post. Just wanted to update that today it did the same thing again. I'm also starting to have a problem where I am forced to delete my profile or it won't recover from Xbox Live. Deleting the profile today I accidentally hit the "Profile
 and Items" option, and because noone apparently had the sense to include a &nbsp;"WARNING! You are about to delete ALL YOUR GAME DATA. Continue?" popup to prevent miss-clicks like this I have lost approximately 200-250 hours worth of saved data from my memory stick.</p>
<p>So now I am nothing but frustrated.</p>

<p>This sounds like a problem I just had today, I put it in a separate post just a second ago. It's not an issue with the USB, I am using a 360s 200g, I recovered my account in January when I bought it(after my xbox red ringed for the fourth time) and I had
 no issues until today. I did recover my data from my old hard drive about a week ago(bought the cable for $25, kinda a rip after I had to fork out 300 for a new xbox, but whatever) and just today I sign in and achievements and avatar etc. won't load.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's exactly the problem I have. My gamerscore shows up as 0g, and my avatar tries to reset, and force me to pick a new one. When I hit Connect to Xbox Live it also has a habit of then bringing up a list of other profiles to sign in with despite
 already being signed in to mine.</p>

<p>When your profile got corrupted did you MOD it , because when I did that all of the same problems happened.And when i tried to recover it whent to another account.</p>

    <title>Fresh install of Windows XP won&#39;t boot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Fresh install of Windows XP won&#39;t boot</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
This has me stumped, any suggestions about where to start tracking gladly accepted!<br />
<br />
PC has had drives wiped and XP has been installed.&nbsp; The install CD is no-longer required and PC is ready for 1st boot.<br />
Splash screen loads, then partway through progress bar freezes, and PC re-starts.&nbsp; Left alone the machine would replete this cycle continuously.<br />
<br />
However on re-start crash menu is presented and PC will boot into Safe Mode.&nbsp; Intrestingly PC will not boot into Safe Mode With Networking.<br />
<br />
From within Safe Mode, using Device Manager, I can confirm that all device drivers appear to have loaded (ie no device is shown as unknown).<br />
Checking Logs no record of failed boots are shown.<br />
<br />
I have tried disabling NIC in Device Manager, and from within BIOS.&nbsp; But thses changed have had no effect on the failure.<br />
<br />
Install has been repeated with different XP source disc.<br />
<br />
System being installed is Windows XP Media Centre with SP3, all drivers are slip-streamed into install CD.<br />
<br />
Memory passed Memtest.&nbsp; Drives pass SMART tests. <br />
<br />
As I said above any suggestions gladly accepted, even if only as to how to start tracking down problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Thanks for all the reply's folks!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My final successful solution: use old source media, and slip-stream only the Intel SATA/RAID driver.
</p>
<p>This defiantly seems to be a case where “less is more”.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Successful source media: XP Media Centre version from 2004/2005 with SP2</p>
<p>Slipstream software: nlite</p>
<p>Intel drivers, current versions downloaded form Intel directly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The key points in this solution appeared to be the SP2 version of Media Centre, and
vital</span> to loading the O/S.&nbsp; Once booted, all other drivers, SP3, etc, loaded without issue.

<h2>            Missing csn CA for San Jose sharks hockey</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, &nbsp;huge hockey fan. &nbsp;Got the kinect set up and everything is working except I'm missing the one channel &nbsp;I watch the most. &nbsp;My zip is 95350 dish network and the channel is 438. It is csn CA HD or Comcast sports net California. &nbsp;I have tried show
 all SD HD channels and tried clearing the guide. &nbsp;It shows up on my dish network guide but it doesn't show up on the one guide. &nbsp;Also the channel is normally blacked out when there are no games on, &nbsp;it usually just plays music and says HD programming not available
 until the game starts but it's at least in the channel guide but no where to be found in the one guide.... &nbsp;Please help. &nbsp;Email
