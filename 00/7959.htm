<h2>            Outlook email accounts disappeared</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>My Outlook crashed and restarted this morning. Since restarting my email accounts that were synced with and displayed in Outlook have disappeared except for one. I can change the email account but Outlook is not displaying any more than one account. The
 accounts are all listed when I go to file- account settings. When I go to account settings - change- advance there is no option to add which , from what I understand in tutorials, there should be.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense.Any advice very much apprecaited</p>

<p>Hi Malik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for this prompt and informative answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the information, I was able to see I can share Yammer conversations within Yammer, but not outside, such as in Outlook. Is that right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also see that I can bookmark a conversation, which was one of my asks. Once I've done that, can you help me find my bookmarks?</p>
<p>

            Are Richard,
<br />
<br />Do you mean that your HTML e-mails are now in plain text? Do you have a POP account?  I hope I understood your problem correctly, otherwise, it would be best to provide a screenshot of your problem.
<br />
<br />The problem related to HTML becoming plain text is a known issue for POP accounts in Outlook. Currently, the way to fix it is to revert your Outlook to the previous update version.
<br />
<br />To do so, you can follow these instructions:
<br />
<br />1. Oppen the Command Prompt
<br />2. Copy and paste these commands, one at a time and press Enter after each command.
<br />cd %programfiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\ClickToRun
<br />officec2rclient.exe /update user updatetoversion=16.0.11629.20246
<br />
<br />
<br />Let us know if that fixes your problem.
<br />
<br />If you'd like to know more about reverting to an earlier version of office, you can learn more here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2770432/how-to-revert-to-an-earlier-version-of-office-2013-or-office-2016-clic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/277043...</a>

<p>Thank you for the suggestions. I tried Gabriel's update but the problem persists.</p>
<p>I'll try once gain to describe it in more descriptive terms:</p>
<p>None of the http links, included in my Outlook emails, open automatically. I can click on them individually and they'll open. Some emails have a great many of such http links and it's very inconvenient.</p>
<p>Those very same links open correctly when using Windows Live and ATT.</p>
<p>I would like to fix Outlook which was doing just fine until yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

<p>Gabriel,</p>
<p>There is not normally any option for opening the image/illustration. Some messages, with a great many images, are presented with dozens of lines of blue links/code, some of which are simply "spacers". Some images/lines could be individually clicked-on and
 opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the moment, the latest is that the images/illustrations are once again being opened automatically. This resulted from my deliberately changing and running the program, for a number of hours, with the "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Don't
</span>automatically download..." box checked; then later, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
unchecking</span> that box and restarting the program. Much to my surprise, the images/illustrations then properly appeared when opening new emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the program was possibly stuck? in the "Don't allow... " mode.</p>
<p>Your help was appreciated.</p>

<h2>            How can you write a macro for a list of customers that will take into consideration for changes&#63;</h2>
                    I need to download a report that lists our customers and their sales figures.&nbsp; I need to be able to put these customers into groups for some of these totals.&nbsp; My issue I'm having is that if a customer is added or changed either individually or to a group
 the macros won't perfom the sorting and totaling corectly the next time I need to use it.

            <p>It is difficult to say what you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume you have a hard-coded macro with absolute cell and range references or perhaps the names or number of names is changing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to be able to make these variable and want to know how.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, without knowing your exact issues, hard to start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many ways of determining the bounds of&nbsp;a variable&nbsp;range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you narrow it down at all to some sort of specifics?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you download the report is it from an Excel worksheet or other application like *.csv file or??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using Data&gt;Group and Outline?</p>

            <p>Yes to hard coding. I download it from SAP program as a text file.&nbsp; Once downloaded I sort it by customer name and customer number. (all part of the macro)&nbsp; This makes it easier to find the groups, then I basically cut and paste the customers in to thier
 respective groups.&nbsp; Some groups are the same customer name just different locations where as others are may contain several different names.</p>
<p>For example: ABC Raleigh, ABC Tampa, etc all same name part of the ABC Group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pacific Supply, Shelter and West End (with several locations each) are part of&nbsp;the Beacon Group.</p>
<p>I want the macro to sort and group all groups then total the columns for each customer.&nbsp; The maco does not work properly the folling month say, because we may add a new customer or customer group or even delte one alltogether.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>What would be the best way to go about this?</p>

            <p>Sounds like you should be filtering in some manner but only you can decide on that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps just importing the data then using a Pivot Table rather than a macro&nbsp;for the grouping and summing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will find quite a bit of help on Pivot Tables at Debra Dalgleish's site.</p>

            No, they should not prevent Office from automatically download updates.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />While automatic updates for Office 365 ProPlus are downloaded and installed automatically by default, there is a chance this may unintentionally get turned off at some point. To verify Office 365 ProPlus is set to receive the updates and security fixes correctly, open any Office 365 ProPlus application (e.g., Word, Excel, etc) and select File &gt; Account. Under Office Updates, you make sure you see the words “Updates are automatically downloaded and installed.” 
<br />
<br />red box around updates are automatically downloaded and installed.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If you do not see this text, select Update Options &gt; Enable Updates.

<h2>            Lumia 950 not charging or turning on. Vibrates when charger connected.</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had my Lumia 950 since February never had any issues with it charging.</p>
<p>This morning my phone had ran dead overnight. When I plugged it in the phone vibrated as if it could turn on. But the empty battery image appeared. The phone didn't manage to turn on after charging for a while. (I tried using the same wire on multiple pugs
 and in USB ports in laptops.)</p>
<p>I've left it plugged in most of the day and it keeps vibrating without moving as if the lead had just been plugged in. Vibrating every few seconds but still nothing on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seen a few posts that have said they've had similar things. I've tried both soft and hard resets and the phone vibrates as if it was&nbsp;</p>
<p>about to turn on, but never did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that either the connection is broken, the lead is broken or the battery is totally dead.</p>
<p>I've considered getting a wireless charger, but don't want to spend the money if I need a replacement battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas before I go to a shop to try and get them to look at it?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had charged for longer than 20 mins, plugged into the wall as mentioned above in my post. But it made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried reading up on how to solve this, using the link above, before I posted for help hence mentioning the hard/soft resets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that nowhere my case has happened. The phone vibrates when connected but doesn't hold any charge whatsoever. It also occasionally vibrates whilst plugged in but wouldn't turn on. Could you help me out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you recommend replacing the battery or that it could be a handset connection issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long is the warranty in the UK for either the Handset or the Battery?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if this issue ever got resolved for you, or if you had to to get a new battery. Or maybe even replaced the device all together. It seems not many people have this problem, but you described exactly whats going on with my Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to a Geek Squad Desk and embarrassingly he tried a different charger lead and it worked.</p>
<p>I was frustrated as it was a new expensive lead that I was using.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although the phone charged fully with a new lead, it turned off pretty regularly and never gave me a full day's use again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone got stolen so I never got the phone fixed/battery replaced in order to solve the issue in the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

<p>I had the same thing happen to my Lumia 950 last week.&nbsp; It won't take a charge either via USB-C cable or via wireless.&nbsp; I bought a new battery from Amazon.&nbsp; It came partially charged.&nbsp; The phone worked fine with that battery until it posted that it was low
 on power.&nbsp; Unfortunately the phone wouldn't charge that battery either.&nbsp; I took the phone to an AT&amp;T store and they were unable to diagnose the problem, only offering lame suggestions.&nbsp; I took it to a Batteries Plus store and the technician there tested both
 batteries and said they were good, that the fault is in the phone's inability to charge either via USB-C or wireless.&nbsp; He recommended getting a charger that charges the battery when it isn't installed in the&nbsp; phone.&nbsp; Neither of the ones that their store carried
 worked with the Lumia 950 battery, however I've found one on Amazon that claims to do the job.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; I like my Windows phone and don't want to give it up.&nbsp; I would like to know what is causing the problem and if it could be repaired.</p>

 possible? Any help would be much appreciated!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Without knowing which specific FixIt you tried, you can troubleshoot these problems manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. See if a browser add-on is causing the problem.<br />
Start Internet Explorer without add-ons by right-clicking the IE icon on the desktop. Choose Start without add-ons.<br />
or<br />
from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Accessories&gt; System tools&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />
If the problem goes away, an add-on is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
For troubleshooting information see:<br />
IEBlog&nbsp; Troubleshooting and Internet Explorer’s (No Add-ons) Mode:<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/07/25/678113.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/07/25/678113.aspx</a></p>
<p>2. With the warning that a reset will delete AutoComplete data, such as<br />
passwords and you will have to reinstall or re-enable browser add-ons, use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings button (Internet Options&gt; Advanced.)<br />
<br />
What a reset of IE settings will do:<br />
Reset Internet Explorer settings [Windows 7]: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings</a></p>
<p>3. There's troubleshooting information in this article:<br />
936215- How to troubleshoot Internet Explorer 7 issues in Windows Vista and Windows XP<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936215/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936215/en-us</a></p>
<p>4. These problems can also be caused by malware (malicious software- hijacker, trojan, spyware, etc.)&nbsp; There's good advice on malware removal in<strong>this thread</strong>and<strong>this
 one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important note: </strong>Some infections (or multiple infections) can't be removed completely and the only way to insure that the computer is clean is a clean reinstall of Windows.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br />
Don</p>

            <p>Using full iso created from esd file, mine got to 99% and froze.&nbsp; after waiting approx. 30 min with nothing happening, I did hard shutdown and then rebooted.&nbsp; After couple of minutes it finished updating and everything seems to be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only problem that I have is activation.&nbsp; This pc has been running windows 10 since the very first release and every release since with no problems in activating each release.&nbsp; I created a full iso from esd file created by windows update on another machine
 like I have done on all past versions, and did clean install on this second machine running local account. This copy will not activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will Microsoft account be required to activate?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How will we check features using local account if we cannot activate?</p>
<p>I have already determined that cannot use the personalization app with copy being activated.</p>

            <p>Windows 10 is now referred to as a Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that too many users are trying to download ISO or create ISO from ESD and do clean installs. This opens the door for piracy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has to be&nbsp;controlled as an update to licensed Windows 10, or Activated Insider Previews.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean installs are not viable unless you have a License Key for the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.... That's my best understanding of what is going on. There seems to be a lot of pirates on the forums complaining and blaming Microsoft... duhhh... Windows OS piracy has been a big problem... time to sink them.</p>

 now appear to be running normal so far.

<p>Had the same issue twice. First time at 97% and it reverted back to 10240.</p>
<p>Second time it did it at 99%, then I did what you did and it finished.</p>

            First thing is to do a hard reset&nbsp; remove the battery then hold the power button down until system shuts down, unplug the AC adapter from the unit now hold the power button down for 10-15 sec's, plug the AC adapter back in (with out the battery) turn system
 on and let it power up and run it may take a few min's this fixes most system, once it is back up and running reinstall the battery, let us know if still having problems

            To me, that looks like the bottom panel of the Notifications Pane. &nbsp;It ought to go away when the Notifications Pane goes away. &nbsp;It survives a screen refresh (F5)? &nbsp;How about a re-boot.

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the new Notifications app. The items at the bottom of the app are shortcuts to some of the most used locations.</p>

<p>I might be reading more into your initial picture than is warranted. &nbsp;Are those shortcuts ALWAYS on your Desktop or are they only when you've opened the Notification Pane? &nbsp;If they're always there (even when your Notification pane is closed) and even a re-boot
 doesn't clear it, then I'm stuck. &nbsp;If it's only there when you're looking at your Notification pane, then there's no way to get rid of them. &nbsp;AFAIK, Ronnie Vernon's suggestion to use the Hide option just hides notifications for a while. &nbsp;It doesn't get rid
 of those shortcuts.</p>

 *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to my android device, and my outlook in my windows laptop-then set alias in *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to show as the POP3 email. &nbsp;It all works amazingly well and almost instantly. My issue is that ALL inbound email from the POP3 goes into my Junk

            This does not resolve the problem. &nbsp;My inbound mail is forwarded from a POP3. &nbsp;The email shows the senders email in the from catagory. &nbsp;The email is then sent to junk UNLESS i have already set that email in outlook to be NOT JUNK. &nbsp;ALL......ALL!!!....new
 email addresses not already marked as not junk that pass through the pop3 are sent to JUNK. &nbsp;I dont see a way to set a rule to automatically send junk email to inbox, and i have already set my settings as low as possible. &nbsp;Ideas anybody?

<h2>            Send attachment via email directly to site document folder</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there, we use Sharepoint with Office 365 and we're starting to dig into functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal is to be able to have an external vendor send us a file as an attachment to an email, and have that attachment automatically save to a folder within the documents library.</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me if that is possible, and if so, walk me through the specific steps to make it happen?</p>
<p>I found this page, but it doesn't seem to appear to the Office 365 version of Sharepoint, or am I missing something?</p>

<p>hi partick,</p>
<p>the link above does not apply to sharepoint online. the feature that sending email attachments automatically to site document folder is not supported. we can only manually save the email attachments to our own onedrive for business library.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=79304dd4-de7b-404c-b776-538c1b3696d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d79304dd4-de7b-404c-b776-538c1b3696d5" /></a></p>
<p>additionally, we can manually send the email attachment to a sharepoint library in outlook client by right clicking the email/ email attachment &gt; save as &gt; paste the targeted site url to the address bar.<br />

                    Hello, I am using Windows 7 and IE8, and have developed a website using Serif Webplus X4, a Frontpage-type developing tool which publishes my site to HTML code that, until a few days ago, would be viewable as a website in IE8 or Firefox. For inexplicable
 reasons, now everytime I publish the website to my hardrive (as a test) and open it in IE8, only HTML code appears (instead of pictures, links, you know - what a website should look like). The site still appears fine in Firefox. The weirdest part is that,
 in IE8, while looking at the gobbledy-guk code, if I select View &gt; Encoding, it shows that "Unicode (UTF-8)" is already selected (ie. a little dot shows to the left of it). But then if I RECLICK on Unicode (UTF-8) - which in theory should do nothing since
 it was already selected - Presto! The website appears and looks great. My Windows 7 (and assumedly IE8) and Webplus are fully up-to-date. It does not make a difference if the "Auto-Select" feature under View &gt; Encoding is select

</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
I did a little more than that.&nbsp; And I'm glad I did:&nbsp; I discovered several issues that you will need to pay some attention to.<br />
<br />
Download the file readSDB.xlsm (<a href="https://www.box.com/s/s3qmrfu7vvxvuivpyvrk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here</a>) [1].&nbsp; It contains skeletal VBA code.<br />
<br />
The VBA code includes some debugging statements and MsgBox output that show the file offset [*] of the next set of data ("sequence entry").<br />
<br />
([*] Caveat:&nbsp; The file offset starts at zero, whereas the VBA Get statement "recnumber" parameter starts at one.)<br />
<br />
You can use those offsets to find the data for reference purposes in the formatted file dump in ARB.sdb.txt, which I included in the aforementioned winzip file [2].<br />
<br />
The following is a list of the file offsets for each "sequence entry":<br />
<br />
000000&nbsp; Parameters<br />
00005c&nbsp; NCARD input data<br />
0b29f8&nbsp; Number of nodes (NUMNOD) and nodes with springs (ISNODE)<br />
0b2b58&nbsp; Leg springs (ISLEG) and rigid body springs (ISBOD)<br />
0b2cb8&nbsp; Arc lengths<br />
0b36c8&nbsp; Rigid body coordinates<br />
0b3e58&nbsp; Frequencies and number of headings (NUMHED)<br />
0b43b8&nbsp; Wave amplitudes<br />
0b4670&nbsp; Wave headings<br />
0b4928&nbsp; Selection arrays (IRBSEL, ILGSEL, IFRSEL)<br />
0b55e4&nbsp; Header info<br />
0b55f4&nbsp; Rigid body displacements and rotations<br />
0b561c&nbsp; Rigid body forces and moments<br />
0b5644&nbsp; Leg forces and moments<br />
<br />
Issues....<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
1. The structure of the file is not exactly as you describe (and expect?).<br />
<br />
Each "record" (sequence entry) that you describe is preceded and followed by a 32-bit integer whose value is the number of octets comprising the data in between.<br />
<br />
In some cases, the "sequence entry" that you describe is composed of several "records",
<br />
If you are not writing those octet counts, it appears that FORTRAN is.<br />
<br />
I would be surprised, since you opened the file with the option FORM="UNFORMATTED".<br />
<br />
But I wonder if you are writing FORTRAN structured variables instead their individual fields, and FORTRAN is bracketing each structured data with its size in order to facilitate "random access"<br />
<br />
(FORTRAN did not contain structured data types, like struct in C, when I used it 40+ years ago.&nbsp; But it might have been enhanced since then, either the standard language or Intel Visual FORTRAN in particular.)<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
2. Type Single (VBA) v. type Double (Excel)<br />
<br />
You might notice that when your type Single data are written into Excel worksheets, they might not be exactly what you expect.&nbsp; For example, YSURF should be 108.80000000000; but Excel displays it as 108.800003051757.<br />
<br />
The reason has to do with the way that binary type Single is "converted" to binary type Double.&nbsp; The result is infinitesimal differences in the decimal representation.<br />
<br />
(I could explain this further, if you are interested.&nbsp; It gets a little technical.)<br />
<br />
If that is problematic for you, you can use the following paradigm to do the conversion more precisely:<br />
<br />
=--TEXT(A1,"0.000000E+0")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Excel<br />
<br />
Dim d As Double, s As Single&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'VBA<br />
d = Format(s, "0.000000E+0")<br />
<br />
where A1 contains the "converted" binary representation.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
3. In some cases, you describe the sequence of NW data as representing multiple sets of 3 data.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; "6 coordinates stored [... as ...] X, Y, Z of End1 and X, Y, Z of End2" for the "rigid body coordinates" sequence.&nbsp; Similarly for the "rigid body
 displacements" and "rigid body forces" sequences.<br />
<br />
It is unclear exactly how you want to disambiguate the NW data.&nbsp; More to the point:&nbsp; it is unclear if FORTRAN disambiguates the sets of triads in the way that you expect, if indeed you leave that up to FORTRAN to do.<br />
<br />
You will need to pay close attention to the order in which those data are stored, and retrieve them accordingly.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
4. The point in #3 is especially true if ILGSEL and IFRSEL are truly 2-dimensional arrays in FORTRAN.<br />
<br />
If you allow FORTRAN to determine the order in which the data are written to the file, I don't know (remember) whether that is in "row order" or "column order"; that is, whether FORTRAN increments the two indices in the order that you intended, if indeed you
 leave that up to FORTRAN to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
You will need to pay close attention to this detail.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
5. I did not understand the structure of the data for ILGSEL and IFRSEL in the "rigid body and leg selection arrays" sequence (readSelectionArrays).<br />
<br />
Or I do understand it, and it presents a significant difficulty to implement the input routine in VBA based on my design.<br />
<br />
In particular, your description indicates that the number of rows (first index) varies for each column (second index) based on NUMNOD(j) and NUMHED(j) respectively.<br />
<br />
(The index is "j", not "i".&nbsp; They are difficult to read in this font, especially when surrounded by parentheses.)<br />
<br />
The problem is:&nbsp; the size of NUMNOD and NUMHED are variables, namely NLEG and NFR respectively.<br />
<br />
Ordinarily, that requires a ReDim statement in VBA to declare NUMNOD and NUMHED.&nbsp; But ReDim is limited to procedure-local variables, whereas NUMNOD and NUMHED would need to be module-global variables in order to refer to them in multiple procedures.<br />
<br />
The ideal solution would be to declare NUMNOD and NUMHED globally using some reasonable maximum size.<span style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp; [EDIT]
</span>I chose this approach.<br />
<br />
An alternative solution would be to restructure the implementation so that both uses of NUMNOD and NUMHED are encapsulated in the same VBA procedure.<br />
<br />
But since the corresponding file data are separated by other unrelated data, that would require that we also encapsulate the calls to other VBA procedures within the same single VBA procedure that references NUMNOD and NUMHED.<br />
<br />
Not that difficult, really.&nbsp; Just a little less "structured" than I would like.<br />
<br />
Bottom line:&nbsp; you will need to pay close attention to my procedures readNodes and readFrequencies, as well as readSelectionArrays.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
6. I did not implement readLegForces because the description of the data seems to be different from what we see in the formatted file dump.<br />
<br />
The file dump shows that the corresponding data starting at offset 0b5644 are a sequence of structured data probably in the form:&nbsp; KEY, NW, and NW "real" values (type Single).<br />
<br />
The KEY seems to be incremented by one for each set of structured data.&nbsp; And each set of structured data is bracketed with the 32-bit integer octet count described in #1 above.<br />
<br />
That pattern seems to continue until the end of the file.&nbsp; There does not seem to be any indication in the file of how many such "records" of data there are.<br />
<br />
(Your pseudocode description suggests that it, too, might depend on NUMNOD.)<br />
<br />
Bottom line:&nbsp; you will need to pay close attention to this final algorithm.<br />
<br />
 description of the last sequence entry, but not exactly.&nbsp; See the output from readLegForces in the worksheet "Leg Forces".<br />

<blockquote>
<p>I was also wandering if by chance you know whether VBA expects binary data to be stored as bigendian or little endian, since the Fortran code uses the bigendian convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
According to online sources [1], "Intel Fortran" gives you the option to write data in big-endian or little-endian order.&nbsp; Is that the Fortran compiler that you refer to as "Intel Visual Fortran"?
<br />
<br />
For the reasons given below, I would be surprised if the default order is big-endian, especially for "Intel Fortran".<br />
<br />
If you are amenable, please upload an example binary file to which, using Fortran, you have written, just a 32-bit integer (Long?) followed by a 64-bit floating-point value (Double?).&nbsp; See the upload instructions in footnote [2].<br />
<br />
 let us know what 32-bit integer and 64-bit floating-point values that you do use.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Usually, the endianness of numerical data types in binary files is determined by the endianness of the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Exception:&nbsp; standardized files that are intended to be system-independent.)<br />
<br />
Since Intel-compatible computers write numerical data types to main memory in little-endian order, I would expect that numerical data types are usually written to binary files in little-endian order as well.<br />
<br />
And that is consistent with a wiki page [1] that states, under the title "Endianness in files":&nbsp; "most Windows programs use Little Endian format".<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Based on my experiments, Excel VBA does indeed write numerical data types to binary files in little-endian order.&nbsp; That is, the least-significant octet is written to the file first, at least on an Intel-compatible computer.<br />
<br />
The VBA procedure below can be used to ascertain the endianness of numerical data types written to and read from binary files.<br />
<br />
I confirmed the results of the VBA procedure using other tools that I have.<br />

    <title>Adding additional email addresses to a domain account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding additional email addresses to a domain account</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a domain, let's call it mydomain.com, that is listed under my "your domains" section of domains.live.com<br />
<br />
On this domain, I want to add a number of real users, so far so good.<br />
<br />
I also want to add addional @domain.com addresses to one of these users, to recieve email on, but don't what to have to create additoinal accounts with passwords, as they won't be logged into, so assume will expire.<br />
<br />
I just want to add an additional email *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to one of my users accounts, but I cant seem to do this, as if I log into the account I want this added to, and then clock on Account aliases &amp; add, it tells me "You need to verify you own *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
 To verify, click the link we emailed to this address" which I can't do, as it doesn't actually exist yet..<br />
<br />
Is there a way to do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            <p>Hi AlexBell_761,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </font><font>I apologize that it took us more time than usual to reply.
</font><font>I understand that you are trying to add an alias to your email account that you created on
<a href="https://domains.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://domains.live.com</a> and you want it to have the same domain name.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>In creating an alias for your Microsoft account, you have the option to create an alias with domains @Outlook.com, @Hotmail.com and @Live.com as long as the email address is not yet taken.
</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>If you want to add an alias with a different domain name, the following conditions will apply:</font></p>
<ul>
<li><font>It should be an existing email account for you to be able to verify ownership.</font></li><li><font>The email address that you are adding as an alias is not registered as a&nbsp;Microsoft account.</font></li></ul>
<p>This means that you will not be able to add an alias with the same domain name on your email address since the alias you are adding does not exist which you will not be able to verify.&nbsp;Also if it does exist, it will automatically be a Microsoft account because
 the domain is registered under Microsoft services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Let us know if you have further questions.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Thank you. </font></p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Once an account is closed for any reason the email address is placed in a security hold for at least 30 days. &nbsp;<br />
At the end of that time<strong> anyone</strong> may be able to create a new account or an alias using the same email address.<br />
<strong>The data is gone however.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Have you a Back up of all your important email data that you can access?
</p>
<div>If your data is important it is prudent to back it up, especially if it is in the cloud and not under your control.</div>
<div>
<p>When you signed up for the email account there was (in the fine print) the Terms of use which clearly said that the user is responsible for the data and not Microsoft.</p>

    <title>Activesync on IPAQ 6965 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Activesync on IPAQ 6965</h2>
                    My IPAQ 6965 worked fine on WINXP Pro and AS V4.5 until last week when I started getting sychronization errors. I have done: 1. Hard &amp; soft reset and restore from backup 2. Uninstalled AS4.5 went to AS4.2. 3. Repaired Outlook, Uninstalled Outlook, performed
 scanpst. 4. Tried on three different computers, same results (after hard resets). I can connect and sync if I only select Contacts, Tasks, emails and calendar. Once I've sync it will continue to sync until I add any other options. Before adding options,I check
 the options in AS on the PPC, Notes, Files Media etc are greyed out and cannot be selected on the PPC. If I select any of these from AS on the PC they remain greyed out on the PPC but a check mark does appears. There are no greyed out options in AS on the
 PC. As soon as I try to sync with any greyed out option, it starts up, about 15-20 seconds later I see AS on the PPC disconnect and then I get a synchronization error in AS on the PC. Click on the link and not much , "xxxx

<p>A very comprehensive outline of what you did Pete.&nbsp; Thank you for being so clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find your situation very interesting and I find it more interesting that I never noticed the greyed out options.&nbsp; I assume that because I set the options I like when I set up all my devices, I have had no need to change it once it is setup and working.&nbsp;
 The result is that I never go into the PPC to uncheck or check a new item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, so with your question I went in to all of my current running devices and low and behold, like you, I have greyed out options.&nbsp; Hmmm, not sure why it is like so I started playing with my devices and came to the conclusion that once a device is setup,
 the options that are greyed can ONLY be checked or unchecked&nbsp;from the PC.&nbsp; OK, I could accept that but there were a few that were not checked and I could not enable them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I clearly understand some of them and why I can't check them ... like Avantgo.&nbsp; It is not set up on my computer but I don't understand why I can't sync photos.&nbsp; So I am going to have to investigate this and see if I can find a solution.&nbsp; If I can, I will
 post it here.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, the Avantgo was only on one of my devices ... I'm assuming it was an HTC thing when they set up defaults that would appear.</p>
