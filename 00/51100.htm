    <title>Removing Credit Card Information - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Removing Credit Card Information</h2>
                    
<p>Before I dive into details I'm sure there are a ton of posts about this elsewhere as I have been reading a lot. However none really just state 100% of everything I'd like to know and I've been "researching" for the past few hours...very early hours I might
 add because I want to find out what is true and what is not true. Considering it's extremely early I'm pretty agitated at this point not only by my lack of findings but because of how disturbing what I did find out was.</p>
<p>So my sister and I got an Xbox 360 for Christmas and made two new accounts that had the month of free live. After hers ended she never renewed; I renewed mine recently and have had it like so for about a month and a half with no problems. Eventually I asked
 my sister if she would play Xbox again if I put Live back onto her account. Of course she said she would; so I thought it would be a simple buy her Live and then remove my information so it couldn't be used (not that I don't trust her but it's the principle
 of the matter).</p>
<p>I managed to buy her 1200 points as well so she could get at least one expansion for Black Ops. However after this was all said and done I went to delete my Credit Card and I found that I couldn't. After researching for a few hours I found that some people
 said you cannot delete your CC if it is tied to a paid Live account during it's duration of Live. So am I to understand now that my information is sitting there on an account I absolutely do not want it on even after it has already paid for something? In my
 mind there is no dilemma, I have emails stating confirmation that I have paid for the product(s) I wanted, why does my CC still need to be present? Why is it so hard to just delete my CC off of this account; everything has been paid for? Yes, I'm stating and
 re-stating what I already said because I'm seriously in bewilderment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll be honest, at this point I really want to wait another hour and ten minutes and tear some Microsoft CS employee a new one once their phone lines open up. I'm trying to remain civil though due to the extreme ridiculousness this situation seems to me.
 So can someone, if anyone, please enlighten me on what is true about this matter? Can I call them up and have them delete my &nbsp;information? Or will this void my sister's subscription and block her? Is there ANY way to get this off the account?&nbsp;</p>

<p>yes, your cc is locked to the account until it goes silver or you cancel it outright. it will not go silver unless you call cs to turn off auto renew. you have to call cs to cancel it outright and remove the cc. the reason your cc is locked to the account
 is because you have signed up for a subcription service with it. you agreed to allow ms to charge your cc when the subscription automatically renews, therefore, a valid cc has to be on file in order to apply that charge when appropriate.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you don't want your cc attached to your sister's account then you will need to call cs and ask them to remove your cc. they will have to cancel the subscription first and if you have more than a month remaining on the subscription then they will generate
 a code that you can redeem to replace the time you have already paid for. it can take 3-10 days for that code to be generated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>read the terms of use. learn to read contracts before you agree to them. you may have been able to avoid all of this.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. That's another confusing thing, I see very recent posts talking about calling to turn off Auto-Renew. So does that mean when I went into the account on this site and clicked the "On" where it said auto-renew and went through all the
 screens and had it turned off it didn't ACTUALLY turn it off? I still have to physically call them to get them to turn it off?</p>
<p>And as much as your last piece of advice makes sense to me and I feel somewhat dumb for not doing it. I feel less dumb because of how many different posts on various websites I've found with the exact same problem. I say this because the ToS didn't pop in
 front of my screen when Microsoft was willing to take in my CC information and my money out of my bank account. So yes, I'm guilty of not memorizing their ToS completely when inputing my payment information.</p>
<p>So would the easiest way to do this perhaps be to have my sister add her CC to the account? Have her turn off auto-renewal but just have it there so I can take mine off?</p>

<p>Okay I gave them a call and got the information I wanted. The representative I called said that they do not give 1 month cards/codes out for CC payments of a 1-month subscription. Only 3 months and 12 months. Other than that your post was fairly accurate
 according to what this guy said and I'll just wait it out until the sub ends and take everything off. Thanks again for the reply.</p>

<p>the tou appears and you agree to it when you create the account. once you've agreed to the terms, there is no reaason for it to pop up again. no one expects you to memorize anything. the terms of use are available to read anytime on the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is no way to turn off auto renew on the website. the only way to do that or to cancel the subscription is to call cs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i don't mean to imply stupidity on anyone's part and i don't think that the number of people failing to read the tou should be relevant to the degree of stupidity you feel over not reading the tou.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the easiest way to resolve this situation will be for you or your sister to call cs and tell them what the situation is so they can provide options on how to recitify it.</p>

<p>i believe i said that if you have more than a month remaining on the subscription that they would generate a token. obviously if you only have a monthly subscription then you will have less than a month by default. my post wasn't "fairly accurate" it was
 dead on. </p>

<p>Although I'm going to sound ungrateful when I'm really not I'm going to have to disagree on two parts. I thoroughly questioned the representative I was speaking to so that I wouldn't have to make a second call. He said there is absolutely no option for him
 to give me a 1-month card in replacement of me canceling the account entirely. Now I questioned him on this asking specifically about the time-limit and he said that I qualified for having a month still since I had bought the Live month today; the same day
 I called him; but that he could NOT give me a month card because they only do it now for 3 months and 12 months now that the 1-month cards are not for retail anymore (except the ones they give you special with a repair or for some other reason; he went into
 some kind of details about not being able to access your account) so on this part he put me on hold for several minutes to consult with the "higher management" I guess and I'll have to take his word over yours unless you're their employee or something.</p>
<p>Second there is absolutely a way to turn off automatic renewal on their account. Which confused me since I read so many times that you couldn't from recent posts. Under My Xbox and Accounts there is a link to Account Management or something rather and on
 the side it will have a green "on" next to automatic renewal, you click it and go through a few pages of them advertising new games/movies and at the end it asks if you want to turn it off; I did and it worked. I know it worked because 1. on the side it became
 "off" under account renewal and I had the representative verify it over the phone and he confirmed it had been canceled without him doing anything.</p>
<p>Anyway like I said, I did call, I did get the answers I wanted on top of some of the things you mentioned so this isn't an issue anymore.

<p>i will clarify. monthly subscriptions are not eligible for token replacements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>automatic renewal has to be turned off through cx support. i think there may be some countries where you can still turn it off online. i apologize for presuming you were in the u.s.. in most countries it is not possible. if you are in the u.s. then my guess
 is the agent was humoring you and he actually was the one who turned off the auto renew feature.</p>

<p>As much as I feel dumb for coming back to see if you disagreed just to prove you are right I am doing the same. As silly as it sounds to say that he would humor a customer by lying to them I can assure you I am right. I am in the United States and it does
 work to turn it off the way I described. It may say on these actual forums that you cannot but it is true that you can which is sort of funny since it's not listed as available here. I know this for a fact because a little over a month ago I disabled it on
 my own account via through the website when I started playing again on Xbox live. A month later I got a notice saying my live would be disabled

<p>"Dear Raise86 (my main gamertag),</p>
<p>Your subscription to Gold – 1 Month will expire on Thursday, June 16, 2011. To avoid a possible interruption of your subscription service, please renew your subscription by Thursday, June 16, 2011."</p>
<p>Just to see if it worked I waited until after the end of my sub and voila, I went down to silver; until I renewed manually.</p>

<p>Hmm after looking into it more it seems that some people can and some people can't. I read that MS took away the feature and yet it's still there to me. To prove it like I said a month ago I renewed and this is exactly what my screen looks like now. Same
 as it did the previous month when I reverted to silver automatically after one month had passed. and this is the account I had not called about nor spoke with the representative at all about. So I know that nobody but I had changed the status of my auto-renewal.
 However the option was there 6 days ago when I renewed. (Had to blur out my name and card # for obvious reasons)</p>

<p>
Hi,</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
The model is Canon&nbsp;PIXMA TS 3150.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
I bought the printer in and live in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
My computer is a Packard Bell one Two L5851. It uses Windows 7&nbsp; 64- bit.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
I can use my smart phone with the printer. The computer will not accept the printer software for some reason, either on disc or when downloaded from the link. The same message appears.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Regards,</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Brian Frost.</p>

<p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've seen, Canon seems to have more issues with installing software than most other printer manufacturers.&nbsp; Canon also makes finding the correct software more difficult by having slightly different model designations depending on the geographical
 area where its products are sold (which is why I asked you where you bought your printer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to double-check, the file you downloaded from Canon Ireland should have been named
<strong>win-ts3100-1_1-n_mcd.exe</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that wasn't the file you downloaded, go to <a href="https://www.canon.ie/support/consumer_products/products/fax__multifunctionals/inkjet/pixma_ts_series/pixma-ts3150.aspx?type=drivers&amp;language=&amp;os=WINDOWS%207%20(64-bit)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>You may have to end up asking Canon support for help, but perhaps the following suggestion will work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Canon recommends that you use its "TS3100 series Full Driver &amp; Software Package (Windows)" package.&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the stated size of this file (18 MB) and especially to the instructions to "be sure to connect your PC to the Internet" when running the file,
 I expect that this file really is just a "stub" that (a) detects your operating system details, (b) connects to Canon's download servers in Japan, and (c) downloads and installs the files that are appropriate to your system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Canon also offers what seems to be an "offline installer" package that doesn't require an active Internet connection while installing:&nbsp; "TS3100 series MP Drivers Ver.1.00 (Windows)."&nbsp; This is a larger file (89 MB vs 18 MB).&nbsp; The description of this file
 says that it "will provide full printing and scanning functionality for your product."&nbsp; What it most likely does
<strong>not </strong>include are Canon's various software packages that normally are bundled with the printer.&nbsp; These are downloadable separately at the Canon support site and include:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>IJ Printer Assistant Tool Ver.1.10.2 (changes the printer settings and performs maintenance)</li><li>Easy-WebPrint EX Ver.1.7.0 (plug-in for Windows Internet Explorer 7.0 or later that "enables easy printing of web pages")</li><li>Quick Menu Ver.2.8.5 (utility software to start the applications and manuals supplied with the printer, access online product information, or run a "slide show" if "My Image Garden" is installed)</li><li>IJ Network Device Setup Utility Ver.1.6.0 (helps with network setup)</li><li>Easy-PhotoPrint EX Ver.4.7.0</li><li>My Image Garden Ver.3.6.1 ((organise and print your photos)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thus:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the stand-alone driver package (TS3100 series MP Drivers Ver.1.00 (Windows)) from Canon Ireland at
<a href="https://www.canon.ie/support/consumer_products/products/fax__multifunctionals/inkjet/pixma_ts_series/pixma-ts3150.aspx?type=drivers&amp;language=&amp;os=WINDOWS%207%20(64-bit)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<em>1.[Windows 10]</em><br />
<em>Some of the settings (such as borderless printing) in the OS standard print settings screen are not valid. the settings in the Printer printing Preferences window are valid. Make settings in Printer printing Preferences when necessary.</em><br />
<br />
<em>2.[Windows 10]</em><br />
<em>Layout printing from the OS standard print settings screen may not be performed as expected in Some instances.</em><br />
<em>In such cases, open the Printer Printing Preferences window and change the paper size accordingly.</em><br />
<br />
<em>3.With Internet Explorer 11, a web site containing Japanese may not be printed properly. In Windows Update, update the OS and Internet Explorer to the latest version.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Scanner Driver:</em><br />
<em>1.If the OS is upgraded with the scanner driver remained installed, scanning by pressing the SCAN button on the Printer may not be performed After the upgrade. in such cases, re-install the scanner driver.</em><br />
<br />
<em>2.When MP Driver installation was stopped by the following acts with the screen awaiting connection, install it again. The installation is not completed even if plugged-in the USB cable again or turned-on the power supply again.</em><br />
<em>- To cancel the installation.</em><br />
<em>- To plugged-out the USB cable.</em><br />
<em>etc,</em><br />
<br />
<em>3.The scan from the scan button of the printer does not work when the connection is changed from the network connection to the USB connection. Install MP Driver again, and change the connection method.

<h2>            Windows Photo Gallery keeps hanging&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>It just started with me after some last updates couple weeks ago for my Vista Ultimate (x64) SP2. I am getting this hanging just after I try opening any picture - not always - but too many times, this will stuck the whole PC and hang every step in it, specially
 the explorer.exe. I tried to close it and reopen it&nbsp;from task manager but that was going worst and not help, and sometime even the mouse stuck moving.</p>
<p>The main solution I have for this problem is just by clicking on the small restart button from my PC case. THIS IS REALLY BAD, MOST TIME I LOSE MY OPENED FILES.<br />
So, what would be the solution for this. BTW, I have another PC running Win7 having the same issue. So IS THERE ANY FIX for this please !</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

=============================================<br />
No guarantees...but the following Microsoft 'Fix it' may be worth a try:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />

            Hi Chris
<br />
<br />If Andre's answer does not work for you, your Windows 10 may be in S Mode:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />In the Switch to Windows 10 Home or Switch to Windows 10 Pro section, select Go to the Store. (If you also see an "Upgrade your edition of Windows" section, be careful not to click the "Go to the Store" link that appears there.)
<br />
<br />On the Switch out of S mode (or similar) page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.
<br />
<br />After you see a confirmation message on the page, you'll be able to install apps from outside of the Microsoft Store.

<br />Sorry that is not possible, copied text is placed on what is known as the clipboard. 
<br />
<br />The clipboard is only a space in your RAM and when you shut down your PC all data is RAM is lost . ..

<br />I believe the only way to do this would be a program like "clipdiary" or other third party clipboard manager which you probably needed before you did the copy/paste.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the status of the speakers in playback devices. If it is disabled enable it. Follow the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Right click on the <strong>Volume </strong>icon in the system tray on the right corner on the desktop.</p>
<p>b) Select <strong>Playback devices </strong>and enable the speakers if it is disabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now,&nbsp;set speakers as default device and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Right click on the<strong> Volume </strong>icon in the system tray on the right corner on the desktop.</p>
<p>b) Select <strong>Playback devices</strong>, right click and <strong>S</strong><strong>et speakers as default device</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft APP store downloading 100GB game CONSTANTLY AND WONT STOP</h2>
                    <p>I DO NOT WANT THIS 100GB GAME INSTALLED ON MY COMPUTER</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BECAUSE IT IS 100GB AND KEEPS INSTALLING IT IN ON MY 256GB SSD.<br />
<br />
I DONT WANT IT, I HAVE TO KEEP FORMATTING MY SSD JUST TO GET RID OF IT BECAUSE THE FOLDER IT IS INSTALLED IN DOES NOT ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATOR TO ACCESS IT<br />
<br />
Why is there no option to not to have it download and install?<br />
Why is there no option to change the install location to maybe you know my 10TB SEAGATE IRONWOLF?!<br />
Why is Microsoft Store downloading and installing this game even though I haven't opened microsoft store?<br />
Why is there no way of removing apps from my microsoft store library?<br />
Why is there a "hide" button on the app in the library that does literally nothing because once you click "hide" the app is quiet clearly STILL THERE AND FULLY VISIBLE?<br />
Why is microsoft store completely evasive and entirely hostile towards the user?<br />
Why are moderators here so completely hostile and responding to users with pointless questions that have nothing to do with the subject it a poor attempt to make the user give up and accept all the bloatware and spyware that is flooding there system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>and more impotently WHY IS THERE NO OPTION TO UNINSTALL APPS IN THE MICROSOFT STORE?</p>

            Hi Naraus.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You don't uninstall apps in the Store which is itself an app.  You'd uninstall them in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features. 
<br />
<br />What is the app?  I've never heard of an app that size.  Please take a screenshot so we can see what you mean:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>
<br />
<br />You can redirect Apps to install elsewhere at Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; Change where content is saved. 
<br />
<br />In Store app, under Settings &gt; Downloads and My Library, click the three dots at right end to Hide any you don't want.  
<br />
<br />As long as you are cooperative and polite I will continue to help as much as you want.

<p>The Game is 98.6GB<br />
Microsoft Store keeps installing it on my 256GB SSD despite that under settings all APPs are to be installed on my C drive which is where I want all my APPs that I deem as "programs" and desire to have all my Games on a completely separate drive however my
 C drive does not have enough space for that game so it arbitrarily choose to install it on my 256GB SSD without asking for permission, now despite that I don't want this game installed at all, as you can clearly see in the picture I can choose my 10TB Ironwolf
 however when I proceed with installing, it will say "working..." next to the game in the app store and then shortly afterwards the "Install" button will reappear.&nbsp;<br />
Obviously there is no option to stop the microsoft store from installing this game but at the same time it wont let me just install the game in a much less inconvenient location such as my 10TB drive, and the only reason why it is not currently trying to install
 it on my 256GB SSD is because it has been disabled.<br />
There is just no winning, this would be the equivalent of Steam just automatically downloading and installing my entire catalogue of 500+ games onto my computer into any drive it chooses without any option to not have said games not installed, there should
 at least be an option when you right click on the app "DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP", but it shouldn't be installing the app without permission anyway.<br />

            And under downloads this is what is shown<br />
As you can clearly see Microsoft Store comes up with an error telling me to reconnect the drive but as you can clearly see everything is meant to be installed on my C drive and you can clearly see my C drive is connected, on top of that every few hours I will
 get an annoying notification (as well as when booting up my PC) saying that microsoft has failed in trying to fill my disconnected drive up with junk.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63d6aac7-bca1-46c9-9d8a-6ea5b6a51dd3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63d6aac7-bca1-46c9-9d8a-6ea5b6a51dd3?upload=true" /></a>

            This is the first I've heard about it installing unwanted 3rd party apps besides W10's own games.  I've been doing some research on this and found some possible solutions: 
<br />
<br />
<br />See if these help to turn off unwanted apps:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68217-turn-off-automatic-installation-suggested-apps-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68217-turn-...</a>

<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1. Turn off automatic app updates in Windows 10
<br />
<br />    Open Store &gt; Click three dots at the top right of the screen;
<br />    Click Settings and turn off Update apps automatically in App updates section.
<br />
<br />Step 2. Block  unwanted app in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Here you have two access to block app update from Registry tweak or block unwanted apps in Windows 10 update. You can either choose one method to block apps in Windows 10 now.
<br />
<br />A. Block app updates from Registry tweak
<br />
<br />Press Windows + R, type: regedit and hit Enter;
<br />Registry Editor file will show up in C:\Windows directory and you can navigate to the folder and run regedit.exe directly;
<br />Then open Registry Editor and go to: 
<br /> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsStore
<br />
<br />Create a new 32-bit DWORD value named AutoDownload and set it to 2 to disable app auto-update;
<br />After this, restart Windows 10.
<br />
<br />B. Block unwanted apps  from Windows 10 update
<br />
<br />    Press Win + R and open Run dialog;
<br />    Type: secpol.msc and hit Enter;
<br />    Local Security Policy app will appear and select Application Control Policies in the letf, then click Applocker;
<br />    Click Packaged app Rules, right click the right pane and select Create new rule;
<br />    Click Next when the Create new rule wizard shows up;
<br />    On the Permissions page, set Action to Deny, leave User or Group as Everyone;
<br />    Click Next, click Use an installed packaged app as reference &gt; Select;
<br />    Select Windows Spotlight(Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager) and click OK in the app list;
<br />    Move the slider to the Package Name option as shown below, then click Create.
<br />
<br />After these steps, your PC won’t install automatic updates or apps without permission anymore. If you want to install new updates or apps, you’ll need to manually download and install in your PC.  
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. I will also track the issue for you.

<h2>            Windows 10  requires password now on startup</h2>
                    A few weeks ago I temporarily set my computer to require entering my Microsoft password upon waking the computer up from sleep (in settings, accounts, sign-in options, when PC wakes up from sleep). After I later restored the settings to "never," my computer
 no longer requires a password to wake up from sleep, but on startup I receive a message that says "We are unable to connect right now. Please check your network and try again later." When I press the OK button I am forced to log in with my password. I have
 used t<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">he “netplwiz” command to ensure that the box requiring password on startup is unchecked.</span>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be caused by a corrupted system file. As an initial troubleshooting step, try booting your PC on safe mode and see if the same thing will happen. Refer to this article to know

 for a password.</p>

            Hi Anne. Sorry for the delay. When I booted my computer on safe mood I encountered this message: "Username or password is incorrect. Try again," (OK button. Logon window.) When it opened in safe mode a message said "This App Can't Open. Tips can't be opened
 using the Built-in Administrator account. Sign in with a different account and try again." I don't know what the app "Tips" is, but otherwise safe mode worked normally.

<p>When I first tried to create a new user account I was asked to type in an email. When I typed in my email I received this message: "Something went wrong. We can't add a user to the device right now. Its probably our fault. Please try again."I clicked OK
 and entered a new user name (without password).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I restarted my computer I encountered the familiar error message ("User name or password is incorrect. Try again."). I clicked OK and was confronted by THREE choices of user (Old username. Old username. New username.) I chose the new username and my
 computer opened without password. The screen was completely unfamiliar. It would take me weeks to change everything to my old specifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted and found that the computer always opens by default to my old username, and asks for a password, until I choose "new username."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the new account. I recall now that my computer always offered a choice of TWO identical old usernames after it asked me to type in my password. I tried both now separately. They both require a password. Why are there two identical old usernames?
 Do I have two accounts with identical names? (Both seem to have administrator privileges, though I could be mistaken.)</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. Upon researching, it seems that you've set your device to automatically sign in to your account from startup using netplwiz but have entered the wrong password or changed it that have caused the issue. We suggest deleting one of
 the account to resolve the issue. Follow the steps below on how to delete a user profile using advanced system properties:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>First, make sure that the account you want to delete is logout. </li><li>On the search bar, type run an select <strong>Run</strong> from the list. </li><li>Type <strong>SystemPropertiesAdvanced.exe </strong>on the Run dialog box then click
<strong>OK</strong> to open <strong>advanced System Properties.</strong></li><li>On the pop-up box that will appear, on the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, under
<strong>User Profiles</strong>, click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select the user account profile you want to delete then click <strong>Delete.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Yes </strong>to confirm deletion.</li><li>After the account was deleted, a new profile for the user account will be automatically created the next time the user signs in.</li><li>You can now close the settings. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After doing the above steps, login again and see if you will have the same issue.

            Under "User Profiles" there are three choices: 1. Default Profile (2.69 MB). 2. PC/Administrator (40.5 MB). 3. PC/myusername (137GB). Which profile should I delete? I am concerned that if I delete the wrong profile I will have to create a new one from
 scratch. The new user account I created yesterday (<span>Add someone
 else to this PC</span>) suggests that creating this new profile would be very time-consuming (new desktop background, Classic Shell settings, etc., etc., etc.).

<p>Thank you for the update. If you have important files saved in either of these three choices, make sure to make a back up so you can have a copy of all those files. Once you try to delete one of these profiles, a prompt will appear asking if you want to
 keep the files or delete them. As for your question, if you can remember the account you've used to login on your device, then choose the one account that was not used, as the one you've used contains all the setup you have on your device like desktop background,
 settings, etc. </p>

<p>Just one more question before I proceed: what is the location of the backed-up files for an account, and how can I use them to restore the account if I need to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two accounts (or two names of the same account"?) displayed under the login window on the startup screen both seem to be the same account (named myusername"). Does that mean I should try deleting "PC/Administrator" instead in User Profiles? (This choice
 does not show up under the login window) Also, PC/Administrator is only 40.5 MB big, Myusername is 137 GB.</p>

<p>Location of the backed up files depends on the location that you've chosen to save them. Check this article for more information about
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17143/windows-10-back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">backing up and restoring files</a></strong>. As for your question, if one of the user account is not showing on the login screen,
 that account might be the built-in administrator account that has access to all the files even without running it as an administrator. For deletion, just make sure to back up all the files of either the PC/Administrator or Myusername account before deleting
 it. </p>

<p>Thank you for being so patient. I have been researching articles about how to restore a deleted account from backup files (assuming the "Save files for deleted account" option is chosen) but have found nothing. Are these files stored in the C:/users/myusername
 folder (assuming I delete the Myusername account)? If so, how do I restore the account from this folder?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History backs up all my files hourly to an external hard drive. But I am unable to find any account files there, and I wouldn't know how to restore an account from these files anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What if I delete the PC/Administrator account instead of the Myusername account? Can both accounts be restored in the same way? If I delete the administrator account can I still operate the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

<p>Just started my legendary dig deep game, but am having some serious trouble going anywhere.&nbsp; I can not seem to find any coal in any of my caves.&nbsp; I found about five at the beginning but cant find anymore.&nbsp; Since I cant find any I cant go anywhere.&nbsp; I have
 to keep taking all my torches off the walls just to go a bit farther.&nbsp; Is it supposed to be this hard, or is it just unlucky caves?&nbsp; Also, it said there are more food sources, but I don't know what they are.&nbsp; Are they mushrooms, and if so do you have to cook
 them?&nbsp; Besides these things Im having a great time and can't wait for the new updates!&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You might want to try asking here. It is the official forums and the developers and admins are pretty active there. I haven't played much since the huge update, but I do know that coal is rather rare near the surface. It might be
 the exact opposite of what you think, that you're unlucky. It could be that you're extremely lucky for finding coal at such a low depth. Like I said, I haven't played much since the update, but prior to it I know that you cooked fish by putting it in the furnace
 so I am sure that is how other food items are cooked as well.</p>

<p>Well I finally found enough coal. &nbsp;Ended up just having to explore in the dark a bit before I placed my torches. &nbsp;Also, did they change where blueprints are located? &nbsp;Because on my first world a lot of the blueprints were on top and in the tunnels. &nbsp;Now
 that I have found all the ones on to, I have yet to find anymore.</p>

    <title>Audio Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kirsty n john  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Issues</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi all, we have just bought a new XBOX 360 250GB.&nbsp; It is hooked up to our Panasonic HDTV by a HDMI cable, and our Sony 5.1 Surrond Sound System by an optical cable.&nbsp; We are connected to the web by
 wireless signal and have done all updates when we first switched it on.</span></p>
<p><span>During the Dashboard operation (music / demos etc.) sound is both okay on the TV and 5.1 system.&nbsp; The problem starts during gameplay.</span></p>
<p><span>We only have 2 games for the console both from our original XBOX.&nbsp; They are Outrun 2 and Outrun 2006.&nbsp; At a random point duirng the games a sound will freeze and continue to play until you re-set
 the console, this sound can be anything from engine idle to cars passing.&nbsp; You can clearly hear game sound and music from actual play, but the sticking sound is always there, it seems be in a 1 or 2 second loop.&nbsp; This sound issue is sent though to both the
 TV and 5.1 (HDMI and Optical).</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried to find the answers myself, but no luck.&nbsp; From what I can tell the new updates have the backward compatibility in them.</span></p>
<p><span>From what I have read these games still seem very popular on 360, so I would have thought no-one else has this problem?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks all, hope someone has our answers.</span></p>
<p><span>John</span></p>

<p>I have the same problem when I hook my Xbox up to my SONY home theatre (bdv-e580). I've tried using optical and HDMI. The game I have been experiencing it with is Tiger Woods 13. I am going to try another game, but I think it has something to do with the
 Kinect. When I disconnect the Kinect, it works fine. &nbsp;When I use Kinect, sound dies after about one or two holes. I am stumped and have troubleshot it quite a bit. Sony says to contact Microsoft. What do you think I need to do microsoft?

<h2>            Bluetooth Speakers doesn&#39;t work after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: bluetooth problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi l need help, after making a update from windows 7 to windows 10 l have a problem with my Bluetooth, in windows 7. l could play films, YouTube, and music over a plug and play Bluetooth dongle that l use over my USB, to a Bluetooth speaker.
</p>
<p>Now in windows 10 the PC recognizes my dongle, also it finds and connects to my speaker but it will not play anything over the speaker, ie, music, internet, youtube, or my film programs they only play over the intern speakers and not over the Bluetooth speaker.
 I cannot find anything that l can adjust or turn on. </p>
<p>thanks barrie watson</p>

<p><span><span>I suggest you to install the latest Bluetooth driver from the computer manufacturer website.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the driver for Windows 10 is unavailable, you may install the latest driver in compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Right</span></strong><span>-<strong>click </strong>on the setup file of the driver and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Place a <strong>check mark </strong>next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select
</span><span>previous <span>the version of Windows (Windows 8) from the drop down list.</span></span></li><li><span>Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</li></ul>

            Hi&nbsp;petefamily1,<br />
<br />
<span>To help us investigate this issue, please provide the following information:</span><br />
<p><span>- What steps did you take that led to this error condition?
<br />
- Are you getting an error message? If you are, post the exact error message here.
<br />
- Does the issue happen when other Windows Live Hotmail accounts are accessed on the same computer?
<br />
- Do you encounter the issue when the account is accessed in another browser on the same computer?</span></p>
<p><span>I also suggest that you optimize your browser. This will serve, as initial troubleshooting that shouldn’t be overlooked. All bases should
 be covered, and browser efficiency should be ensured since Hotmail is a browser dependent service. Check this link out to know how to do this:</span></p>

I downloaded&nbsp; ljP1000_P1500-HB-pnp-win64-en.exe and changed in the properties to Windows 7 compatibility<br />

            I did all the steps.<br />
Finding where to download HP Print and Scan Doctor.&nbsp; I had to enter in Google Scan Doctor.<br />
I download this, Execute the program. My P1005 was found. I was redirected to the HP-site where at the end I received the same answer: there is now driver available.<br />
<br />
What now?<br />

            I tried this all out, but the end of the story is allways: a driver for the p1005 will be available early 2013.<br />
CAn´t I download another driver so that I can use my printer?<br />

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenge that you are experiencing with your printer can occur due to several reasons, such as, wireless capability compatibility issues, an operating system compatibility issue, etc. To better assist you, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any significant changes to your computer before the issue started?</li><li>What is the make and model of your printer?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages when the printing fails?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>

<p>The printer is a 4690 Lexmark, it works fine using USB cable but not with the wifi. I had used it on wifi in past but now the printer message I get is cannot communicate with printer only when trying to use via wifi. No recent changes. The only changes are
 Windows update but there were a lot of them when this failed.</p>
<p>The Laptop is Gateway NV53 windows 7 x64 and in device mngr under ports STMicroelectronics virtual com port is an error triangle. upon troubleshooting it says device failed to start. Try to update driver and get mssg driver is up to date</p>
<p>try to remove driver and reinstall and it goes back to same error. I talk to gateway&nbsp; and they say they will repair problem for 90.00 I may need to uninstall driver and install a non corrupt driver.</p>
<p>STMicroelectronics Virtual Com Port version 1.3.1.0</p>
<p>I cannot seem to find it from a site that I can trust</p>

<p>Although you may well have a problem with your virtual COM port, that shouldn't have anything to do with your printer.&nbsp; Virtual COM ports are used to connect a device that expects to use a serial port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your printer uses a normal USB connection (which is why "it works fine using USB cable").&nbsp; Note that almost all printers will not connect via wi-fi while also connected via USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The usual reason for having difficulty printing to a wi-fi printer is that the printer's IP address has changed subsequent to the printer's installation</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the color and status (on/off/blinking) of the wi-fi light on the printer?
<br />
</p>
<p>Click the button with a wrench symbol on the printer's control panel.&nbsp; Use the arrow buttons until you see "Network Setup" and then press OK.&nbsp; What is the printer's IP address and IP Gateway address?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your computer, go to Devices and Printers, right-click on the icon for your printer, select "Printer properties," and then select the "Ports" tab.&nbsp; What is shown in the "Port" column on the line that is checked and highlighted?&nbsp; You probably will have
 to click and drag on the faint vertical line in the header row between "Port" and "Description" in order to see the full width of the "Port" column.&nbsp; When done, "Cancel" out of that window and close Devices and Printers.</p>

<p>The "port" indicated in printer properties means that print jobs directed to this printer will go to the USB port and thence to the printer.&nbsp; If you disconnect the USB cable and thus enable the printer's wi-fi adapter, Windows will still send the print job
 to the now-disconnected USB port and nothing will print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to create a second instance of your printer.&nbsp; You can either retain the current instance if you sometimes want to use the USB connection or you can delete it.&nbsp; If you don't delete the first instance before you create the new one, Windows will append
 something like (copy) to the name.&nbsp; You can right-click on the icon and "Rename" to give it a more useful name, e.g., Lexmark 4690 USB or Lexmark 4690 wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following should get you connected to your printer by wifi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Disconnect the USB cable from the printer.&nbsp; The printer's wi-fi status light should be green.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Go to Devices and Printers and click Add a Printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Click "Add a network, wireless, or Bluetooth printer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Wait a few seconds and Windows should detect your Lexmark 4690.&nbsp; Select it and click Next</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; On the screen that says "Which version of the driver do you want to use" follow the recommendation to use the existing driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; Complete the wizard and print a test page</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have problems, please describe at which step you were unable to follow the directions and what happened.&nbsp; If you received an error message, please provide the complete text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above steps worked for you and you elected to keep two icons for the printer (one USB and one wifi), be sure to configure the one you will primarily use as the "Default printer" by right-clicking on the printer's icon in Devices and Printers.</p>

<p>Congrats and thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as your virtual com port is concerned, in your original question you mentioned that you had reinstalled a driver from a download.&nbsp; It wasn't clear whether you were referring to a printer driver or a driver for the STM virtual com port.&nbsp; The only "official"
 source for an STM virtual com port driver that I've been able to find is <a href="http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32102.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32102.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the "Problem with PNP devices" warning is associated with the STM virtual com port and you're not using that virtual com port, go to Device Manager, right-click on the STM virtual com port and select "Disable."&nbsp; You can always Enable it later if you need
 it, but disabling it should make the warning stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is connected to your computer's USB ports other than the printer?</p>

<p>LemP thanks for your help. I disabled the virtual com port in device manager and that cleared all the warnings including problem with PNP devices.</p>
<p>As for other USB devices I use mostly the printer but do have several thumb drives that I use once in a while and a portable hard drive but I have not used the hard drive for several months this problem started a month or 2 since.</p>
<p>I will plug it in tomorrow and see if it will run. I have been waiting to get this issue corrected before I do a backup.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the help</p>

<p>Nothing has changed after clean install. The issue still persist. This is a bug, not affected by installed programms or previous system settings. Normal user can't fix it by himself, there must be pushed a fix through Windows Update.</p>

            I have had exactly the same since the Anniversay update. The same workaround also works - turning off the network condition. That's fine for a short period of time but Microsoft - you broke it, you fix it.

            <p>I came up with a workaround that sort of accomplishes the original intent of the functionality. The workaround is to, from the Task Schedule task, call an intermediate .bat script which, in turn, calls the target task once the .bat script determines that
 the system is connected to the desired network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>REM Determine if connected to the network<br />
NETSH WLAN SHOW INTERFACE | FINDSTR /r SSID | FINDSTR /r NetworkName<br />
IF %ERRORLEVEL% == 0 (<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET "ConnectedToNetwork=True"<br />
) ELSE (<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET "ConnectedToNetwork=False"<br />
)<br />
<br />
REM Run tasks that require a connection to the server<br />
IF %ConnectedToNetwork% == True (<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Run original task requiring network connection]<br />
)</p>
<p>
</p><p>One advantage to this technique is that you can use it to check for multiple network names without having to create multiple Task Scheduler tasks. For example, if connecting to a wireless network and there are two or more network names that all start with
 "MyNetwork" such as "MyNetwork" and "MyNetwork 5G", then searching for "MyNetwork" will return an "ERRORLEVEL" of 0 in both cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The disadvantage is that we can't tell from the Task Scheduler logs when the target task was run and not run based on the status of the environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, Microsoft's testing department needs an interjection of some best practices such as incorporating better and more complete automated regression testing to ensure nothing gets broken when changes are made to the system.</p>

Clear the console cache one more time<br /></p><p>Regarding the 360 games be sure to check they are supported on the Xbox One at the moment, see this link for the current list (which will grow in time): <a href="http://www.xbox.com/nl-NL/xbox-one/backward-compatibility/available-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferr

    <title>Marantz SR7000&#58; One sends double power toggle during power off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dryii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Marantz SR7000&#58; One sends double power toggle during power off</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Marantz SR7000 and have the One configured to control power for my TV, cable box, and receiver. &nbsp;Every time I turn off the One it will send two power toggle signals to the receiver. &nbsp;So the TV and cable box shut off, but the SR7000 turns of, then
 immediately back on.</p>
<p>NOTE: if the receiver is off, the One power down will turn it on, then immediately back off. &nbsp;This is how I know it's a power toggle signal being sent, and two of them.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had this problem?</p>

<p>I have yet to find a fix. &nbsp;Tried Xbox support and after many hours the issue is still not resolved. &nbsp;I tried to get pushed through to level 2 or 3 support, but they wouldn't do it.</p>

<p>Is the power to the receiver controlled by the TV or Cable box at all? Before you had the one, did the receiver turn on/off when the other devices were turned on?</p>

<p>Nope, only controlled by the remote. &nbsp;I even removed all cables from the SR7000 just to be sure something wasn't messing with my head.</p>

<p>So, I found a solution that worked for me. &nbsp;I had hdmi control for everything to turn off and turn on. &nbsp;I was getting the double power off. &nbsp;It turns out that it was my tv that was sending the extra off. &nbsp;Essentially, xbox told the receiver to turn off,
 and then told the tv to turn off. &nbsp;then the tv (a Samsung) told the receiver to turn off again. &nbsp;so I told the tv to quit controlling things and it's worked since.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice, however I am guessing you don't have this model of receiver as the SR7000 doesn't have HDMI inputs.</p>
<p>Just for testing purposes I told the Xbox One NOT to turn off my TV (LG). &nbsp;The TV stayed on, and the receiver still powered off, then back on.</p>

            <p>Hi Erhan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Since when are you facing the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have the Windows XP installation CD?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the capacity, amount of data on your HDD and what
<b>chkdsk</b> finds to do, it could take a long time and appear to hang when it is working.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you have a HDD access indicator LED and it is flashing, it is most probably doing some work on the hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Chkdsk</b> runs when XP thinks it need to check the hard drive for any dirty sectors or if you have chosen to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to see what the
<b>chkdsk</b> report has to say after it runs automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to look there for the
<b>chkdsk</b> log and any problems after <b>chkdsk</b> has run.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see the
<b>Event Viewer logs</b>, click <b>Start</b>, <b>Settings</b>, Control Panel, Administrative Tools,
<b>Event Viewer</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>A shortcut to
<b>Event Viewer</b> is to click <b>Start</b>, <b>Run</b> and in the box
<b>enter</b>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Click
<b>OK</b> to launch the Event Viewer. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not able to boot the computer to normal mode, I would suggest you to do a hard reset. Press the power button for 5 to 10 seconds. The computer will shut
 down. Now press the power button to start the computer but press F8 as the computer is starting. Select safe mode from the advanced boot menu and click enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to boot to safe mode then click on start, click on run, type cmd. On the command prompt type
<b>chkdsk /r</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will check for any dirty sectors on the hard drive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once done restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, chkdsk tries to repair that sector and if any data is
 present on that sector it might get lost.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also refer:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to perform the chkdsk from safe mode, I would also suggest you to backup all the important data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</p>

<h2>            Need to change language on the Window calendar at the bottom right corner of the task bar</h2>
                    <p>My new computer has Windows 10 in English except for the calendar on the bottom right of the task bar. All my settings are in the Region of the United States and in English. Everything in Windows 10 is in English except for the calendar. Also, the time is
 set to 24 hour time and I am accustom to reading the time in AM PM 12 hour time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have chatted with 3 different Microsoft technicians and rebooted my computer 3 times with different solutions that did not work. Please help me to set the language in English on the calendar and also set the time to 12 hour time. At this point, Windows
 10 will not give me the option to change the time or language settings in that feature.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Rich,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround.<br />
<br />
Confirm the current build your Windows 10 is running, as this information is vital for us to proceed with the investigation. Type winver into the Cortana search box, then hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Also, please include the troubleshooting you've completed prior to posting your concern here in the Community. Were you able to remember what the technicians suggested?<br />
<br />
Based on the symptoms you've indicated in your post, it could be that the additional calendar feature in taskbar was enabled. To verify, follow the path I've listed below:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Start menu </strong>&gt; <strong>Windows Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Time &amp; Language</strong> &gt; under the
<strong>Date &amp; time</strong> tab, look for<strong> Show additional calendars in the taskbar</strong> option, then click on the drop-down button and select
<strong>Don't show additional calendars</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now to change the time format to 12 hours. Click on the <strong>Change date and time formats</strong> just under the
<em><strong>Formats </strong></em>section.<br />
<br />
Click on the drop-down option for <strong>Short time</strong>, select <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>h:mm tt</strong></span>. Then, do the same for the <strong>Long time</strong> option, select
<br />
Post back if you continue to get the same issue.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 - System restore dialog box hangs forever.  Issue with Microsoft Software Volume Shadow Copy Provider</h2>
                    For the past few weeks, my system has been unable to install new software. &nbsp;When i try to install, it gets stuck on the first part "preparing to install".
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After some looking around, i realized it was because it was trying to make a restore point, but was getting stuck.</div>
<div><br />
So, I went to computer--&gt;properties--&gt;system protection</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The dialog box comes up, but the box listing "available drives" just says "searching..." forever. &nbsp;All the other buttons are greyed out.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I read some posts that said that you should restart volume shadow copy, but when i try to stop it, i get an error "Volume Shadow Copy Service Warning: The Volume Shadow Copy Service is shutting down and is experiencing delay while waiting for in-progress
 calls to complete. " and it just says "stopping" as its status for hours (the computer is doing nothing else and is quite speedy to other tasks during this time, so it is not a CPU issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I disabled all anti-viruses (and also downloaded a few different malware checkers to make sure i did not have a virus), but still no luck</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I ran SFC and found no errors on the machine. &nbsp;ran chkdsk and found no errors.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did a clean boot (shutting off startup items and turning off non-microsoft services), and still had the issues</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried going to repair your computer after rebooting (hitting f8 and choosing repair), but it did not see any restore points and could do nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Errors in the event logs include:</div>
<div>================================</div>
<div>vss eventids - 11, 12292</div>
<div>
<div>Volume Shadow Copy Service information: The COM Server with CLSID {65ee1dba-8ff4-4a58-ac1c-3470ee2f376a} and name SW_PROV cannot be started. Most likely the CPU is under heavy load. [0x80080005, Server execution failed</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way to disable system restore WITHOUT using the dialog box (since the dialog box for me is stuck and does not work)? &nbsp;I don't care so much about system restore (though I would love ot fix it), but i *do* need to install other software on my
 box and i can't install basically anything at this point.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>[[EDIT - further info ]]]</div>
<div>
<div><span>In looking at more detail on the issue, it DEFINITELY seems to be an issue with the&nbsp;</span><span><b>Microsoft Software Volume Shadow Copy Provider.&nbsp;</b></span><span>If I disable this service, the system will immediately have an error when i try to

<div><br />
</div>
<div>For now, i have the service disabled. &nbsp;This causes the restore point to fail when i install software, BUT, the software installs/windows updates continue on and i can get new software installed.</div>

            <p>Try cleaning up your temporary files.</p>
<p>Take a look at CCleaner as a tool to remove Internet history info, <br />
cookies, temp files, auto complete and other junk.<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Notes:&nbsp; <br />
1) When CCleaner is first installed most if not all the options <br />
are checked which is far too aggressive. So I recommend unchecking <br />
all the items listed in ‘Applications’ tab and in the 'Windows' tab <br />
selectively place a check mark for only those options that are of some <br />
value in increasing the amount of free space on your PC.</p>
<p>2) DO NOT use the Registry Cleaner option, may cause potential problems. </p>
<p>3) The 'Analyze' button allows you preview (without actually deleting)<br />
what and how much hard drive space you will get back.</p>
<p>4) Also available is customization, see Options/Custom to add any <br />
other/additional folders you want files deleted from.</p>

            I am not sure what you mean by "System, Reserved (100MB)", but there is 20GB available on my C: drive and another 2GB on a secondary partition and a 3rd partition labeled SYSTEM_DRV with 514MB free out of 1.17GB (this third one has the status (System,
 Active, Primary Partition) in disk manager).
