                    Been trying to update my Acer Aspire V3 551-8439 for weeks now! I keep getting stuck at the same problem, doesn't matter if i try to update from the Win Store or my USB drive that has 8.1 on it. So, here's what happens. I get all the way through the install
 no problem. It's when the reboot process comes. I notice at this time, my laptop starts to run pretty hot, while setting up, it goes to about 20% and my laptop just shuts down! I turn it back on and it reverts back to Windows 8 with the error code I listed
 in the title. I've researched and have tried all the suggestion listed, turn off wifi, boot in clean mode, turn of firewall, not sure what else to do. I DO NOT want to take this to a computer store, cause I know this has to be something small. I have read
 people saying to manually take out the Wifi card but IDK. So anyone on here with this same problem or who has run into this problem before, can you help me out please!!! Oh, and I also ran the Win 8.1 compatibility test, and it ca

            Hi, thanks for response. I tried those steps but it didn't help anything! Once again! As I've stated before. When the reboot process comes and it gets ready or says setting up. It won't even get past 20% without just shutting everything down and then reverting
 back to windows 8. And my laptop is very hot at this point. Why is that? I really want windows 10!!! Why do we have to be on 8.1 to get it?? I can't even get to 8.1. Very frustrating! I don't want to have to take this to a shop and pay $!&nbsp;

            <p>In any case that what you are trying to claim was an Xbox 360 version kind of game and you were using an Xbox One console, I'm afraid this won't work. You'll need to claim the license of any Xbox 360 version game using an Xbox 360 console. Even if the said game is backward compatible with Xbox One, all Xbox 360 licenses can only be obtained by using an Xbox 360 console. Once you've done this, it would surely appear in your Ready to Install section in Xbox One.</p>

    <title>How to merge two unallocated spaces on hard drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dogpark96  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to merge two unallocated spaces on hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My PC originally came with Vista&nbsp; - after installing Win 7 I decided to delete the Vista Restore Partition (should have done it during Win 7&nbsp;install).&nbsp; So I created another partition Drive D: with the unallocated space thinking I would put something on it
 eventually but it is only 15 GB &amp; that's not enough to make it&nbsp;really usable.</p>
<p>Apparently I cannot extend it onto the C: drive unless C: is raw or formatted?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So I thought I will shrink C: drive by another 15 GB so that I could make a 30 GB partition &amp; put Win 8 preview there.</p>
<p>Well now I have two unallocated partitions separated by the C: drive &amp; do not know how to merge them.&nbsp; I see from other posts that, 1)&nbsp;third party software may do this or, 2) possibly convert&nbsp;my hard drive from basic disc to dynamic.&nbsp; I see some concerns
 that Third Party Software may&nbsp;cause serious problems that might prevent your computer from booting properly.&nbsp; Some of these posts are pretty old.&nbsp; Feel like I really gummed something up that should have been fairly straight forward.</p>
<p>Guess I'm hoping one of you will have a simple/quick fix other than 1 or 2 above?&nbsp; What does converting from basic to dynamic entail?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>sneedly</p>
<p>Well a little more research shows several tools for disk management (Bootit Bare Metal, EaseUS Partition Master, Paragon Partition Manager).&nbsp; Will one of these accomplish the merge? &nbsp; Which one is safe?</p>
<p>thanks again</p>

            <p>I've used Easeus Partition Manager&nbsp; <a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm</a> on I don't know how many hard drives over the years with a 100% success rate. It creates a boot disk, and everything is done from it. And it's free :-) You will be able to make the whole drive a single partition,
 or divide it up any way you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: It wasn't Easus I used all the time (although it's good), it was Partition Wizard
<a href="http://partitionwizard.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://partitionwizard.com/download.html</a>&nbsp;. I find it easier to use, although both are good for being free. On the PW page, scroll down to the bottom and download the bootable CD ISO for
 Home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit again: The Easus free version doesn't create a bootable CD, only in the paid for versions. Sorry I misled you; it had been so long since I used either that I was getting them confused with each other :-(</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>You cannot&nbsp;just buy a product key.</p>
<p>If this was purchased from a retailer, it must be accompanied by the boxed product that includes the installation DVD + the COA sticker with the product key.</p>
<p>You can only download Windows 7 from a Microsoft server, after you have purchased the product online using the download option. In this case, the product key is sent by email.</p>
<p>If you received a product key from any other source, it is very likely an illegal key.</p>

            I've tried running every Safe mode, but to no avail. Blue Screen showed up. It said that I should give this info to support person. Stop code: Critical Process died. All other methods to repair Windows (reset this PC, go back to previous build) &nbsp;don't
 work because of unknown error. I quess my only way out is reinstalling Windows. My laptop came in with Windows 10 all ready in it, is there any way that I can keep my Windows 10? I can't find any serial number on the bottom of my laptop.&nbsp;

<h2>            Diskpart requesting to make changes, after updates..&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On the last several updates, on both of my systems, after an update has been installed and the system boots back to the Desktop, I get a pop-up message from Diskpart asking for permission to make changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I allow it, a command window opens and Diskpart starts but I see no other commands being given.&nbsp; Does anyone know what might be going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not happen during normal restarts or cold boots.&nbsp; One system came with Windows 10 and the other was&nbsp;an 8.1 to 10 upgrade.</p>

<h3> algebe  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I make my Windows 10 taskbar light gray&#63; How can I get back colored title bars that show whether a program is selected&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've tried all the personalization options in Windows 10, but the taskbar remains stubbornly dark, with just a hint of my selected color. As a result, the icons appear extremely bright and dazzling by contrast.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've manually changed the "Special color" item in the registry, and I've installed and tried Winaerotweaker. All without success. This color scheme is hurting my eyes and giving me headaches.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I've been able to change program titlebars to a different color with Winaerotweaker, but there's no way to differentiate between selected and non-selected apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When is Microsoft going to fix these glaring bugs in the user interface? Are they aware that people have different eyesight and comfort preferences?

            <p>If you're already actively hacking the registry and using third party ... tweaking tools, I have no idea what state you're in, of course.&nbsp; Do you have "Show color on Start, taskbar..." toggled on in the Settings application under Personalization :: Colors?&nbsp;
 I'm using that right now to make my own taskbar a rich purple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using Windows 10 RTM / 10240?&nbsp; Sounds like you are.&nbsp; A toggle switch to use your selected color as your active title bar color is available in the current Insider builds: that sounds like&nbsp;what you're asking for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe Microsoft previously fixed those issues.&nbsp; The latter was first made available back in August to beta / Insider users:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* http://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/08/18/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-10525/</p>
<p>
</p><p>For fuller fledged tweakability, the High Contrast themes may provide a more powerful starting point.</p>

            <p>I don't know what build it is. It's a brand new desktop PC with Windows 10 64-bit installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before messing with the registry and third-party apps, I tried the standard personalization options. Under "Choose a color, I picked the light grey square near the bottom left of the color table. My taskbar did not even resemble that color. How can I actually
 make my taskbar the color that is shown in the color samples? What I get instead is black slightly tinted with my selected color. That's not what I want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. I've been able to change the program title bars to a different color. But what happened to the feature that changed unselected windows grey? On my Window 7 computer, the selected window is blue, any other open windows are grey. How do I get that in
 Windows 10? </p>

            <p>Do you have that toggle I mentioned turned on?&nbsp; Are you in tablet mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what methodology you're using to accomplish the title bar colorization.&nbsp; The only third party trick I know of here is pretty badly designed.&nbsp; One give-away that you're using that method is that there's a weird line around the Start menu when
 that's displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like - other than with the task bar-&nbsp;that you're familiar with the current set of bells and whistles.&nbsp; It sounds like you'll enjoy whenever the current Insider builds I mentioned finish their beta program and are released to the general public.</p>

            <p>It's a desktop, not a tablet. Yes. The "show color..." toggle is on. I've tried with it on and off, and with the "Automatically pick..." on and off, and my taskbar stays murky regardless. Are you saying that without a third-party app it's possible to change
 the title bar color AND have the title bar switch to grey when the window is unselected? Title bars aren't even mentioned in the Personalisation options. If the native interface setting system was a little better designed, there'd be no need for 3rd-party
 apps. And BTW, the only registry changes I've made are the special color and drop shadow options. And they get overwritten back to the defaults whenever I change the theme.

            I've found that a third-party app, Classic Shell, lets me change the taskbar to any desired color. Having done that, I now find that it's no longer possible to change display font colors. I've got black font on a light grey taskbar in Windows 7, and a
 white font on a light grey taskbar in Windows 10. Why does Microsoft insist on removing basic personalization functions that have been in Windows since the beginning? It's very frustrating.

            I just upgraded from W7 to W10 and I see the frustration about the taskbar which is solid black and its very true that the stark white over black is a major distraction. The taskbar by default should be subdued, not shouting.&nbsp;

            <p>I've since discovered, no thanks to Microsoft, that I could import my personalized theme from Windows 7. That's given me a light gray taskbar, which is much less distracting than the jet black+dazzling font and icons. It's also given me colored window title
 bars. I can't get the colors to change to gray when the window is not selected, as in previous Windows versions, but the close button ('X") in the top right corner turns red in the selected window and gray when deselected, which is a useful indicator. That
 doesn't work on the new Microsoft Office programs, however. They just have a faint aura of blue around them when selected. Of course, that's totally invisible unless your desktop is bleached white.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7 I also had black font for items on the task bar. Unfortunately Windows 10 insists on white fonts for icon labels and taskbar items, and there's no way of changing it. But the light gray background is a dramatic improvement over the Microbrain
 default. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't believe that anyone, even in Microsoft, thought this moronic GUI design was a good idea. Their response to user complaints is to suggest using third-party programs, like Classic Start Menu or Winaerotweaker, but they add the caveat that these programs
 might cause problems. And unfortunately the add-ons can't do anything about system font colors.

<h2>            I lost all my drivers when upgrading Windows 7 Home to Windows 7 Professional</h2>

<h2>            MIGWIZ &#40;WINDOWS EASY TRANSFER&#41; PROBLEM</h2>
                    Hi all.<br />
i have a problem with migwiz also known as windows easy transfer (WET).<br />
I was running a vista installation on my PC and decided to reinstall it. so i backed up my documents using WET on an external hard drive.<br />
then i formatted my PC and reinstalled vista. ran the WET by double clicking the .mig file generated by the WET/MIGWIZ in the previous installation. after "preparing" it failed and closed. the error logs said "cant create directory structure". i tired running
 the utility by copying the .mig file to hard drive, by running it with administrator permissions, etc. even contacted microsoft help. they were of no help.<br />
<br />
i need a workaround/solution. how to access my precious locked up files in the .mig file? i at the minimum need to extract the files for the .mig file.

            They didn't provide you with a link or phone number? (the email you received from Microsoft)...<br />
<br />
In your log file, there is a line that reads:<br />
2009-05-16 22:58:23, Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [0x08030a] MIG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MigDoMigration caught exception: class Mig::Win32ErrorException: Win32ErrorException: Error(5),
<strong>Error while creating directory structure</strong> <strong>for</strong> <strong>
C:\Users\Moiz\AppData\Local\MigWiz\WorkDir\srcworking\agentmgr</strong>.<br />
void __thiscall Mig::CFileDataStore::Create(class Mig::CDataUnit *)<br />
[gle=0x00000005]<br />
<br />
I am not clear on why it's failing to create that folder structure, you could try creating it manually but I do not know what, if any, other issues you will run into.<br />
<br />
Are you logged on with your username (Moiz) when you run the WET program?<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if you enable the built in Administrator account and log on with that account, if this will work then.<br />
I've never used WET, but it seems like it should be a straight forward thing to do.<br />
<br />
Below is how to enable the built in Administrator account<br />
<br />
<p><span>1. Go to your Start menu and in “Accessories” list, open “Command Prompt” by right-clicking on its icon and choosing “Run as Administrator”
</span></p>
<p><span>2. When the Command Prompt window appears, enter the command
<strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. When done, log out from your current account.
</span></p>
<p><span>4. The Administrator account should now be present on your log in screen.
<br />
<br />
Best of luck to ya..</span></p>

<p>Hi Jazztynn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to update your device driver in order to have the Designer Bluetooth mouse to work properly. Driver updates for Windows 10 and many devices should be automatically downloaded and installed through Windows Update.

<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 0"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If&nbsp;these steps don't work,&nbsp;try reinstalling the driver:&nbsp;Open&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>, right-click (or tap and hold)&nbsp;the name of the device, and select&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart your PC and
 Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span></p>

            Hi Tony, well done for being suspicious, you would be amazed how many users fall for this! 
<br />
<br />This is a well known Tech Support SCAM do not phone that number
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and end your browser task, then you can open that up and continue . . .
<br />
<br />All they are trying to do is get control of your PC, they will cause your PC to become corrupt and then require you to pay to have it fixed and even though you might pay them, they will not fix it!
<br />
<br />Do not give them Remote Access to your PC 
<br />Do not give them any personal details 
<br />Do not pay them       
        </p>

            Hey Tony.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That sounds like the Fake Virus scam which can emanate from a mistyped URL it occupies.  If you have a shortcut for Favorite/Bookmark of the site be sure to delete it.  It may have also set itself as your Home page or be lodged in your Browser Add-Ons or Extensions so you'll want to check there and run the scanners I give below.
<br />
<br />Close the Browser window using whichever method is necessary, as it cannot escape the browser unless you download something from the page.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot close the browser window, right click the Task Bar or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys to open the Task Manager, choose Show Less Details, highlight the browser and choose End Task. 
<br />
<br />If this fails hold the power button to Shut Down.  If you do this Edge may reload the page when it starts back up, but it will also give you an option to Start Fresh to avoid opening the previous tabs.  
<br />
<br />Also in Edge, if you try to X out of the browser WIndow, it may present a dialogue box to end the session.  The webpage is allowed to put text in the box but cannot stop it from closing the Windows when you choose OK, so that is safe to do.  
<br />
<br />If you called the scammers and they installed anything on your PC, open Settings&gt;Apps &amp; Features, choose Sort by Date, uninstall anything on that date you didn't install yourself. Then run a full scan with Malwarebytes.   In MB settings tell it to search for rootkits. You can turn off the trial version later in it's Account Settings.
<br /><a href="http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti_malware/tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found.  If you are seriously infected with Trojans or Rootkits that show up again when you re-run the scan after cleaning, post back for further instructions.   
<br />
<br />Then check System files for damage with System File Checker from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />
<br />If you paid them anything, notify your bank that you were scammed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<br />It's a scam.

<br />If that does not resolve the issue, follow the instructions here.
<br />
<br />
<br />For Edge:
<br />
<br />User Scott_Ki has provided this solution.
<br />
<br />************************************************
<br />
<br />When this happened to me, I closed Microsoft Edge using the Task Manager.
<br />
<br />
<br />Then in the search bar next to the Windows 10 logo on the bottom off the screen (I call it the "Cortana Search"), I typed in google.com and hit enter.
<br />
<br />
<br />Microsoft Edge opened up with a new tab for Google.  You can see the offending site still opens in a tab that doesn't have focus.  Click the "X" to close Edge. Do not click on the offending site tab or it will get focus again.
<br />
<br />
<br />When Edge closes nicely, it won't "Restore" the sessions and the offending site tab will be gone.
<br />

<p>It's not entirely clear what your problem is. Are you trying to delete messages in the Windows Live Mail store folder in Explorer? That's not a good idea, because the program's message database index will not be aware of the action. It may notice that a
 file is missing and attempt to recover it. All operations on stored messages should be conducted within the program itself, so that the action can be recorded by the database index.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a few exceptions, only messages that you move or copy from an account folder will appear in Storage folders. When you delete a message from your inbox or other folder - using the
<em>Delete</em> button on the ribbon, the <em>Delete</em> option on the right-click context menu, the
<em>Delete</em> key on your keyboard or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl-D -&nbsp;the message is simply moved to the
<em>Deleted items </em>folder whence it can be recovered if necessary. It's really a recycle bin. However, if you delete a message from the
<em>Deleted items </em>folder, it's gone permanently. You should see a warning before being allowed to complete the action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really want to delete a message permanently, bypassing the <em>Deleted items
</em>folder, select it in the message list and press <strong>Shift-Delete</strong> on the keyboard. You can use these common Windows shortcuts to select multiple files for deletion:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<span>Click on an item to select it, hold Ctrl down and click on another to select both;</span></li><li>
<span>Click on an item to select it, hold Shift down and click on another to select both and all in between;</span></li><li>
<span>Click on an item to select it, hold Ctrl down and press A to select All items.</span></li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
&nbsp;<br />
To delete all the messages in a <span style="font-style: italic">Deleted items</span> or

<p>Hi&nbsp; Ron,</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt response. I have checked the path you provided and the "compact on shutdown" box is checked for every 100 runs.</p>
<p>I have added a check to "Empty Messages from Deleted messages on shutdown". Will this stop deleted messages being archived in storage folders?</p>

<h2>            Can I view and save all Photos by date taken &#38; get rid of saving in folders by date&#63; Like Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 automatically saves photos 'in a folder' by date taken. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, I have <strong>hundreds&nbsp;of folders</strong> &amp; I&nbsp;have no idea what is in each folder unless I click them open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7, I was able to save &amp; view all of my photos by "date taken".&nbsp; I made my&nbsp;own folders.&nbsp; Even with my&nbsp;own folders, I was able to view all photos by date. Is this possible in windows 10?&nbsp; If it is how???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed instructions but I am still stuck with hundreds of folders. I can only&nbsp;search by date within each folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I want to STOP automatically&nbsp;saving my photos into folders by date taken.&nbsp; Can I do that, how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have wasted hours on this issue, are there&nbsp;instructional&nbsp;videos available that I can see &amp; follow that you can share with me?</p>
<p>

            Hi BCjr.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can use another PC to create the bootable media or download the ISO to transfer  back to the problem PC and open the media or click to mount the iSO file, right click Setup to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />If further problems then following these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These special steps lead up to if necessary choosing to save nothing when running the media which almost always works, and is close but not as good as a Clean Install which is also offered as an option.  Your files should always be backed up if you value them at all. 
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then immediately after it fails try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If it won't find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Almost everyone with major version upgrade problems who Clean Installs the same version does not have those problems.  This Clean Install should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Try updating to 1809 using Media Creation tool and if it fails let us know.
<br />
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.

            What was causing my problem was Autodesk Inventor 2014. From what I've heard 2013 has the same issues. To make it work again I had to go online and download Service Pack 1 for Inventor 2014 and then install it. This made it possible to use file explorer
 again from the taskbar. Although I still can't use the metro search function. The error message when using that is:
<div>
<p><br />
</p>
<div>Faulting application name: explorer.exe, version: 6.3.9600.16408, time stamp: 0x523d251b

<div>Exception code: 0xc000027b</div>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Later Windows updates seem to have fixed the problem altogether, though on occasion it still glitches for a minute or two.</p>
