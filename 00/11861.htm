<h2>            Outlook signing me into wrong account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to sign into my uni account (Outlook) but when I insert my credentials it's automatically logging me into my works email (also Outlook). I've tried signing out of that account and going through the same process but the problem is repeating. Not
 only is this annoying but it's a massive security threat using a shared computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping it's something simple that can be rectified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help or advice anyone can offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Shaun</p>

    <title>How to automatically replace the suggested word in MS Word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to automatically replace the suggested word in MS Word</h2>
                    Hi, when we write some wrong word, so its underlined with red line right. then we press right click of mouse on the said word or we press the keyboard button (adjacent to Windows Logo buton, I don't know its name) to open the menu and then select the suggested
 word. Right.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway that i press that particular shorcut, and the the suggested word is automatically replaced with my written word?<br />
<br />
Please Assist me.<br />

            If you often spell the same words incorrectly then for example you could use autocorrect to replace 'buton' with 'button',&nbsp; 'shorcut' with 'shortcut', 'anyway' with 'any way'&nbsp; and 'i' with 'I' (though the last may be set by default). It will not of course
 work in this forum ;)<br />

            Following up on Graham's suggestion, when you right-click on a misspelled word and get a suggested correction that is the one you want, instead of clicking on the word, instead click further down on the menu, on AutoCorrect. This will give you a flyout
 with the same suggestions. Click on the one you want, and the substitution will be added to your AutoCorrect entries. The next time you type that specific misspelling, it will be corrected automatically.

<p>Word 2010 works in "Compatibility" mode, dumbed down, when working with files created in 2007. I assume same is true with Access, but I don't know from experience.</p>
<p>You might be able to use that to your advantage. If you use Word&nbsp;2010 to edit a file originally created in 2007 you should be limited to the features available in 2007. There will be minor differences in the user interface, File tab vs Office button etc,
 but you should be able adapt.&nbsp; The only real reason you need to use 2007 rather than 2010&nbsp;is if your instructor(s) are using some sort of e-tool to grade your document files. Ask you instructor to help you with a small experiment. Re-do a homework assignment
 using a file created in 2007, but with the work done in 2010. Ask the instructor to use the e-tool to mark it. If you do get to do this experiment please post the results back here. I'm guessing that it won't work for all situations, but it will work for some.</p>
<p>Any school that requires&nbsp;you to buy an&nbsp;out-of-date&nbsp;&lt;grin&gt;, well out of production, product without selling it in the bookstore is&nbsp;unrealistic.&nbsp;MS no longer sells it so you will have to find someone with old stock, or an old license they are willing to sell
 after they upgraded to 2010.&nbsp; Or find someone, another student,&nbsp;who has a retail version (CD version) that is willing to let use (sell you) one of their installations.</p>
<div>
<span><span><span>I Need Installation files/CD for pre 2007 version of Office, What Can I Do</span></span></span>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Find
 a friend (new or old) who has 2003 Pro and is willing to lend you the CD. Unlike the very "old" DOS days when there was a signature file on the floppy, there is nothing unique on the CD to identify it. The uniqueness is provided via the Product key you use
 to activate it. So, you can borrow a CD without threatening their installation/activation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Ask at
 work if they have CD you can borrow</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Try to
 find a local "PC Computer Club". There is almost certainly a geek or three with disks you could borrow.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Find
 a small local computer store or repair business. They often have old versions of software because they are still supporting customers using them.</span></p>

<h2>            Do I get N97 &#40;or N97mini&#41; or drop Symbian based</h2>
                    
<p>I have to change my mobile provider as zero signal since they upgraded local cell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Always been a fan of Nokia ... my 6310i is still my best phone ever !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use phone for a lot of email, but speech/SMS/email is about it ...don't really use it for broswing often (too slow) - Need ability to make &amp; receive calls to be easy.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;currently have an&nbsp;E71 ... and this is not a good phone (for me) ... keys too small to use, screen too small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had thought about getting N97 but read a lot that it was unreliable, so started looking at N97mini.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of negative reports on this as well, especially about lockup &amp; resets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I forget the idea of getting an S60 &nbsp;Symbian phone, and move to a newer OS ?</p>
<p>Maemo is one option ... Android or Safari.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming the N900 is a non starter as it is not a phone, but a laptop replacement with phone functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I take it that full qwerty keyboard is a must have feature. I use N97 and wouldn't recommend it to anyone not even to my ex who cheated on me with my pal and I hate her like mad crazy. The mini, I have never used and have no desire to coz I see it as the
 same phone as &nbsp;the N97 therefore wouldn't&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;it either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>E series phones seem a lot better but am assuming you r after a touch screen phone. If you must stay with Nokia I think wait till symbian ^ 3 phones start to ship otherwise look elsewhere.</p>

<p>i got a N97 and i wouldn't recommend it either :/ the phone just sox, it has a slow and buggy firmware (i have v21.2, the newest) and it has a "not so good for the money" hardware, there are cheaper and much better phones than N97 out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you really want a N97 buy a 5530 or 5800, they are just the same thing, same processor, same RAM Memmory, same "made of jello" screen, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>N97 PROS: QWERTY Keyboard, 32GB and...nothing else :S</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>maybe you should try Samsung Omnia 2 or HTC Hero o.O</p>

<p>Considering all the issues surround both the N97 and mini I would steer clear of both and go for something else, not that I'm an expert with phones but I've learned the hard way and made a very expensive mistake. If you like the idea of restting your phone
 everytime you install an app or upgrade your software, and can cope with constant crashing and freezing then go ahead the N97 might just be your thing!</p>

<br />Yes, if you are installing from the Store, it will automatically default to that location. The Skype setup is not as customization as previous  releases.

<h3> jrcollins01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom parameters</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to use a custom parameter on its own for dynamic text replacement in an ad? In the examples I've seen, it's always used in combination with the {Keyword} parameter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if I have the keyword, "toilet training for toddlers" and I add "toilet training" as param1 for that keyword, can I use it in my ad title like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"{Param1:Potty Training} for Toddlers"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if the keyword,&nbsp;"toilet training for toddlers" is searched the ad title will be, "Toilet Training for Toddlers" but if any other keyword is searched the ad title will be, "Potty Training for Toddlers".</p>

</p><p><span>This issue could happen due to the presence of a previous version of Office or remnants of another version of Office on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>In order to resolve this issue f</span>ollow these steps to remove the remnants of Office and install Office 365:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to un-install Office remnants from your computer, you will have to install and run the Office 365 FIXIT tool. Please run the tool even if you do not have Office 365 showing in your list of programs at present – as there may be remnants of a previous
 installation of Office on your computer. </li><li>Download / Install and run the Office 365 FIXIT tool from the following link:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Save the FIXIT before running it if you’re working on a 64 bit Windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have completed running the FIXIT follow these steps to delete the
<strong>Office 15</strong> folders:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>From Windows Explorer please navigate to the following location: <strong>C:\Propgram Files\</strong> or
<strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\ </strong></li><li>Make sure to delete the <strong>Microsoft Office 15</strong> folder. </li><li>In case you are able to delete the folder then right-click on it and click on
<strong>Rename</strong>. Rename the folder as <strong>Microsoft Office 15 old. </strong>
Ignore these steps in case you are not able to find the Microsoft Office 15 folder in the above mentioned location.
</li><li>Once you have completed running the FIXIT and deleted/renamed the Office 15 folder be sure to restart your computer.
</li><li>Now try logging into the My Account page and install Office 365.<span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Check if you were able to download and install Office 365 successfully. Once this is completed check if Office 365 prompts you for activation. If yes, proceed with the steps on screen and activate Office 365.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please try the above steps and let us know if you need further assistance.

<h2>            Shouldn&#39;t be able to select &#34;Repeat as header row at the top of each page&#34; for the whole table</h2>
                    The option "Repeat as header row at the top of each page" seems to have no impact when the properties for the table are selected and this box is checked from the "Row" tab.&nbsp; When the top row in the table is selected, the feature works properly.&nbsp; When any
 other row is selected, or multiple rows are selected, the box is disabled.&nbsp; But when I select the entire table and go to properties, it's enabled and does nothing.&nbsp; It actually has a negative impact when pasted in to a rich text editor in a browser.&nbsp; All cells
 end up as bold and centered (&lt;th&gt;).

            <p>You may have an issue with your installation. This feature works as follows on my system:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I select the top row of a multipage table, then choose LAYOUT&gt;Properties&gt;Row and check Repeat as header row at the top of each page, the top row repeats and the Repeat Header Rows icon turns blue on the Ribbon.</li><li>If I select the top row plus any number of rows below it, I can still open row properties, check the box and all the selected rows repeat. This includes selecting all the rows in the table.</li><li>If the top row of the table is not part of the selection, the row properties option for repeating is greyed out and unselectable, as is the icon on the ribbon.</li></ul>

            <p>Thanks, you're right.&nbsp; However, if you select the entire table and check the box, the result is no header rows.&nbsp; If the feature was working properly, wouldn't all the rows be marked as headings in that case?&nbsp; At least that way, the issue I described with
 the HTML representation showing all rows as headings would be consistent with what the user sees in Word and this wouldn't be an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the real problem seems to be the fact that selecting the whole table and then enabling the properly results in no cells marked as headings, yet the HTML representation looks correct (all rows are marked as headings).</p>

 use. And at the same time, write down the product key on the DVD. You need both items for future installations, say after your computer crashes and you have re-installed windows. At that point you won’t be able to extract it from the registry and won’t remember
 where the online account is.</p>

<p>Giant online retailer
<a href="http://Amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Amazon.com</span></a>, for example, now lists what Microsoft called the "Full Packaged Product" (FFP) of Office Home &amp; Student 2010 at
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Office-Home-Student-2010/dp/B00337D8U6/ref=sr_1_1?s=software&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363830968&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=office+2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>$170</span></a>, $20 higher than the former list price, representing a 13 percent surcharge.</p>
<p>Another seller on the site pegged Home &amp; Student 2010 at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00867OFIM/ref=asc_df_B00867OFIM2437196?smid=A2MLOLPQBCOG87&amp;tag=shopzilla_mp_1365-20&amp;linkCode=asn&amp;creative=395105&amp;creativeASIN=B00867OFIM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>$250</span></a>, or 67 percent above list.</p>
<p>But Amazon also sells Office Home &amp; Business 2010 for $278 and Office Professional for $400, or 1 percent and 20 percent under list, respectively.</p>
<p>Before Microsoft discontinued Office 2010, the FFPs of Home &amp; Student listed for $150, Home &amp; Business for $280 and Professional for $500.</p>
<p>Not every vendor has followed Amazon's example. CDW, for instance, charges $140 for Home &amp; Student 2010, a 7 percent discount, $248 for Home &amp; Business 2010 (11 percent off list) and $489 for Professional 2010 (2 percent below list price).</p>
<p>in an online forum earlier this year, one commenter said he had received notice from one of his software distributors that Microsoft was calling EOL (end of life) for Office 2010 on Jan. 31, 2013. "This means Microsoft will no longer be producing it for
 resale," said the user, <a href="http://www.theforcefield.net/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=5lfm2719icd5r92vqur78dkjk6&amp;topic=7268.msg100577#msg100577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Enterprises with volume licensing agreements can continue to install and use Office 2010 by tapping the downgrade rights built into the volume SKUs of Office 2013.</p>

<h2>            Mailbox provisioned but shows as &#34;We are preparing a mailbox for this user..&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>customer is migrating to exchange online from a non-exchange environment (groupwise)</p>
<p>mailbox provisioned over a week ago.</p>
<p>mailbox is provisioned, user is able to access mailbox using mail.office365.com and has it working in outlook 2013 desktop client.</p>
<p>however, in the o365 portal (portal.office.com/home) they see this image (borrowed from

another thread).</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d50652731-cdf1-4c12-934b-40a90a023fce" /></p>

<p>and in the admin portal (excuse the new portal view) i see this:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7c949fa1-df65-4d59-85bc-2f9542cff199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7c949fa1-df65-4d59-85bc-2f9542cff199" /></a></p>
<p>this issue is limited to a small number of pilot users whose accounts were creating around 2/25/16 (within a day of then).</p>
<p>if you need any more information, please let me know.</p>

<p>we have not tried disabling the local archive because other users who are&nbsp;<em>not</em> having this problem also have local archives enabled.</p>
<p>removing the license and re-assigning it will result in downtime for the user which is something we are trying hard to avoid.</p>

<p>to head off maor bracha's response from a similar thread, this user is not in the deleted users area. i have checked the portal. if there is another place i need to check maor, let me know.

<p>Hi Charlie,</p>
<p>From the description, I understand the mailbox is provisioned and the user is able to use the email services via
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a> and Outlook client. The issue is the mailbox status in Office 365 portal is not showing correctly.</p>
<p>To look into the issue, I’d like to collect the following information:<br />
1. Capture the screenshot of all apps in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a>.<br />
2. The affected email address.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the email address.<br />
You can access the private message via https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            OneDrive Auto Save &#40;protect folders&#41; causes issue with c&#58;&#92;users&#92;&#60;user&#62;&#92;-path folders... all data gone</h2>
                    <p>OneDrive "Personal" (I don't know anymore...) for Business; Office 365. This is connected to my "<em>personal</em>" area (<strong>NOT sharepoint</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After connecting to OneDrive and enabling the promising Auto Save (protect folders) option, all my files in C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Documents and ...\Pictures and ...\Desktop are now gone! They have been forcefully moved to a new location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't mind that all files are in another folder, but I would like to be able to use these same logical paths to get to the file-area that I am used to!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I link C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\&lt;folder&gt;\ together with C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\OneDrive - Organizarion Name\&lt;folder&gt;\ so that I can access my files via the first mentioned path that I am used to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, when will a fix come out that doesn't&nbsp;<strong>move</strong> the contents from the trusted default location to the new "....\OneDrive - Organization Name\&lt;folder&gt;\" location... In fact, the opposite behavior of syncing within the default location
 would make a lot more sense for the user! Are there not more reports of this issue...? How do other regular people adjust to this very strange change and how do they work when their files aren't as easily accessible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 locks down the C:\ area so after the OneDrive integration I have no quick ways to access a file area I can store files in unless I want to type that incredibly long new path that I'm not used to.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Practical <em><strong>example</strong></em>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>While before I could do this both out of habit and quickly due to short path:</p>
<p><em>certutil -encode C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Documents\in.txt C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Documents\out.txt</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>but now I need to type this&nbsp;monstrosity... ?? :</p>
<p><em>certutil -encode C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\OneDrive - Organization Name\Documents\in.txt C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\OneDrive - Organization Name\Documents\out.txt</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p><span>Hi <del>ASmithOCM</del> MsgLosers,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you set up folder protection using <strong>Auto Save</strong> option in OneDrive sync client, this will change the location of the folder (such as Desktop, Pictures and Documents) to C:\Users\UserName\OneDrive-CompanyName\FolderName.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is normal because when the files finish syncing to OneDrive, they're protected, and you can access them from anywhere in Documents, Desktop, or Pictures.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For reference, see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-your-documents-pictures-and-desktop-folders-with-onedrive-d61a7930-a6fb-4b95-b28a-6552e77c3057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>

<p><span>Hi ASmithOCM,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you set up folder protection using <strong>Auto Save</strong> option in OneDrive sync client, this will change the location of the folder (such as Desktop, Pictures and Documents) to C:\Users\UserName\OneDrive-CompanyName\FolderName.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is normal because when the files finish syncing to OneDrive, they're protected, and you can access them from anywhere in Documents, Desktop, or Pictures.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For reference, see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-your-documents-pictures-and-desktop-folders-with-onedrive-d61a7930-a6fb-4b95-b28a-6552e77c3057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello Neha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My name is not "ASmithOCM". Not sure where you get this from... perhaps are you posting with a macro or template that is meant to describe the service. Fair,
<strong>if</strong> my question was "How does Auto Save work".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Thanks for confirming the behavior of Auto Save. It wasn't my question... but it's good to know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond that, it appears you did not take the time to read my post, nor answer what I asked for. My feedback reflects this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To avoid more confusion and In case anyone else cares to read, my questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Can I link the default "Documents", "Pictures" and "Desktop" locations to point to the new OneDrive Auto Save locations - so that when I navigate to the default location, I will end up in OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In my example I use CMD to navigate the logical paths using the command "cd". Browsing via explorer.exe is not an option in this case. I'm using this example to help visualize what I'm asking for: An actual solution on how to link two locations together.
 I believe good old Linux calls this a "symlink" or something similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Can I move the files back to their original location and still have online sync on the files? If no: Is this truly how OneDrive works, by moving all the files into -basically- an online shared folder? Like, uh, a basic file sharing service like MEGA,
 and not a backup service?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I just now also realize that the shortcut I use to enter Documents (etc) from the "Run" command (Win+R key) don't work anymore either.</p>
<p>I open Run and enter "Documents" and it hopens the old, empty folder... :/ Not a question but it ties up with why I want to link these folders together, definitely.. This is not a good experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi @CCraigLong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Don't go to C:\Users\{username}\Documents, Desktop or Pictures.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's funny how it works, indeed. What I'm seeing is that all my files are moved from default location, to a new location that is a subfolder of my userfolder. It is definitely not how I would like it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; So you don't want to go to "This PC"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid I don't quite understand what you mean by this. Do you mean "C:\"? I don't use the mouse very often and don't click many icons... This "This PC" option looks like something inside explorer.exe ? I'm not very familiar with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I feel it would be a lot smoother if I could tell OneDrive which of my already existing folders it should monitor and sync... But moving my data around just like it does now is kind of absurd to me. It causes so much confusion and problems with other applications
 and Windows itself; as shown by my examples. I'm repeating and actually slowly expanding on the list:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. CMD: Navigating paths becomes much more time consuming</p>
<p>2. explorer.exe: The "Quick access" menu is updated and works OK for this</p>
<p>3. Windows "Run" shortcut to enter "Desktop", "Documents", "Pictures" (etc) are not updated and don't work anymore! These Windows-presets/shortcuts are not updated and simply take you to the old, emptied folders... Default behavior.</p>
<p>4. Office: Another issue I see now is that Office itself doesn't understand this OneDrive thing either... Excep/Word, for example, have a "Desktop" location option under "Save As". This "Desktop" location is also the old, empty folder... Sigh... :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hopefully this mess will be fixed at some point. For now, "Auto Save" is more hassle than it's worth and I will disable it and look for a way to make OneDrive do the only sane thing and follow my default locations instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really like Microsoft and their products. I'd love to stick with OneDrive if these problems are fixed. This avoids a spaghetti of vendors too...</p>

<p>Yes, "This PC" is in Windows Explorer.&nbsp; It's where your can easily access these OneDrive protected folders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have files in Documents in the default location that aren't being protected even though I have set up Documents folder protection.&nbsp; So folder protection doesn't protect all my documents if I put them in the wrong location.&nbsp; And often programs put files
 in these unprotected locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish OneDrive could protect all our personal files in the default locations rather than having to move folders to OneDrive.&nbsp; But I guess people would complain about privacy if all personal files ended up in the cloud.&nbsp; If the cloud was as private as our

<p>@CraigLong Yes this makes sense and I agree that Microsoft cannot offer free cloud storage for all our files, however our paid Office 365 subscription offers OneDrive included with the Subscription alongside Skype for Business, SharePoint and Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For office 365 subscribers I would think I could freely store whichever files I wanted up to the offered storage limit. Do you agree?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My primary issue is that I either (1) cannot select folders for which OneDrive should sync. Instead OneDrive forcefully moves my files into a completely different directory, or (2) that Windows doesn't offer the option to link my older folders up directly
 to the new OneDrive file locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I could do either one of these things, my problem would be solved.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I use Resilio Sync which uses bittorrent protocol but it can only sync files on different devices.&nbsp; I use Resilio Sync to sync folders between my two PCs for files that I don't want to put in OneDrive.&nbsp; Works just like OneDrive because it uses bittorrent.&nbsp;
 So it can resume syncing from where it left off and can update changes to files.</p>

<h3> stymied2  say:</h3>
<h2>            TIP Vertical scroll bar in Word 2013 only partially visible&#63; Scroll bar there but not effectively there&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Halfway through composing a question for the Community, I found out what's causing the problem but as I couldn't find this advice anywhere else in my searches, I'll go ahead and describe it anyway, so it's in the ether just in case someone has this problem.&nbsp;
 And yes, I'm miffed with myself that I didn't get the solution sooner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By partially visible, I mean that I can just glimpse the left edge of the scroll bar, but there's not enough of it there for me to be able to locate the moving 'box' and to grip and move it. I can scroll using the wheel but sometimes you just need to see
 the bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd already taken the Options&gt;Advance&gt;Display route several times, on different days, double-checking that the scroll bar was well and truly ticked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've done that, and you still can't see the vertical scroll bar you've grown to love, take a look at the row of about five buttons that's at the very, very top right of your screen.&nbsp; They're above your username.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look at the Maximise button to the left of the cross that is the close button.&nbsp; If it looks like a single page and not two overlapping pages, then click on it.&nbsp; This should reveal your vertical scroll bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            If by this you mean that you can't seen the entire Word window when it is maximized, rather than in a Normal (restored down) window, then you need to adjust your monitor display. If you mean that you can see the whole window when it's maximized but not
 when it's Normal, then you need to use your mouse to adjust the width of the Normal window.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To add to dvk01's fine advice :<br />
<br />
What do the random windows say?<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER had on this<br />
machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause strange issues).<br />
<br />
If no joy something maybe blocking it.<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessories - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />
are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run - not all<br />
are bad however some can cause your issue (Toolbars are BHO's).<br />

<br />
<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. <br />

<br />
Try these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Run DiskCleanup - Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />

<p>That sounds like a trojan or virus<br />
<br />
first thing to do is run a scan with a good antimalwre program<br />
<br />
try <br />
Please download Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware to your desktop<br />
from&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/affiliates/thespykiller/page/download-mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/affiliates/thespykiller/page/download-mbam.php</a><br />
<br />
Double-click mbam-setup.exe and follow the prompts to install the program. At the end, be sure a checkmark is placed next to the following:</p>
<p>Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware. Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware. Then click Finish.</p>
<p>If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version. Press Update to make sure the latest database is loaded.
<br />
Once the program has loaded, select Perform quick scan, then click Scan. <br />
When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results.<br />
Be sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected.<br />
When completed, a log will open in Notepad. <br />
Please include this log in your next reply.</p>
<p>]It might ask you to reboot to finish cleaning. Please do so. ( Press YES on the alert)&nbsp;
<br />
If you receive an (Error Loading xxxxxxxxxx .dll) error on reboot please reboot a second time . It is normal for this error to occur once and does not need to be reported unless it continues on every boot&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Spam filter suddenly not working March 2018 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clio72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spam filter suddenly not working March 2018</h2>
                    My hotmail inbox suddenly started becoming full &nbsp;of spam yesterday despite my spam filters being on. I always have used the exclusive inbox setting with safe senders turned on. I have not had this problem in the past 18 years. I did contact Microsoft office
 and after 1 hour wait on thethey were unable to help. There is no phone support for hotmail or Outlook. The live chat personel said they were not able to help me. The email support reporting for outlook had an automated reply promising a response within 24
 hours but despite sending 3 messages I did not receive any reply from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Microsoft please take responsibility and fix this problem for your outlook/Hotmail users. Quite clearly from searching this issue on Google there are hundreds of users over the last few years with this problem and you must find a fix ASAP. I never have this
 issue on my gmail or Apple account and Microsoft outlook will lose so many people using their email product if they don’t get this sorted out . Surely with the thousands of people working for them they can find one of their technical specialists to correct
 this problem in a day !

<p>HI</p>
<p>i have the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Suddenly the spam filter stopped working&nbsp; a few months ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I upgraded to premium but that did not improve any thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the rules i make are not used by outlook at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check my account and whats wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plan to move to gmail an wish a refund for the Premium Subscription since that did not solve anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I've had hotmail since the 90s with no issues.&nbsp; Now all of a sudden I'm getting THOUSANDS of spams a day to both my Inbox, Junk Email box, and Spam box.&nbsp; I had to shut it down completely and build a ginormous white list just to pay my bills.&nbsp; Whatever microsoft
 did has cost me hundreds of dollars in late fees because I can't find my bills amongst the spam!</p>

<p>Marielle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you asked, I am using outlook <strong>version 2.86.0</strong> on my mac devices (iphone, macair, macpro, and ipad).</p>
<p>So you tell me please (in response to my original question posted in March 2018), does this information Microsoft/yourself requested finally enable you to fix the broken/flawed spam filter and safe sender rules somehow ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7 months on from my March 2018 post, the mail filters continue allowing junk mail to pour into mine and many other users outlook/hotmail inboxes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so please enlighten all of us on how you have been using our answers to your “repetitive deflection tactics” ..where you throw us all the same old questions ...in a blatant Microsoft attempt to not own the problem nor fix it, but try to confuse us. To
 even try to convince us that we as clients must be doing wrong, using filters wrongly, updating outlook wrongly, using products wrongly. These along with other freqently used microsoft lightsaber strength deflects ... “server conflicts, beta vs classic version
 conflicts” &nbsp;blah blah blah... Microsoft, please tell me you are going go stop torturing yoir clients like this and get on with the real job at hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite personally finding a slight fall in the junk mail bypassing rules and safe senders lists a couple of months ago, it is now back up to
<strong>20 or more unwanted senders junk mail and scams in my supposedly protected inbox</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Listen, this shouldnt be rocket science for your technical team. If it is, please start recruiting people who can do fhis job and fix your inbox “safe rules and junk filters” programming code &nbsp;so the features actially WORK again !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I first posted my concern March 2018, all I and others get back in reply from microsoft on here are randomly generated deflecting questions:</p>
<p>”have you changed this recently? have you changed that? is this beta or classic? did you leave your outlook unattended with your dog? Did this answer your question ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No no no no no !!!! to all &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn’t microsoft get it ? What your customers are all clearly saying on this thread is that they havent changed amything and yet one day thier safe sender and junk filters just catastrophically stop working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is now 7 months later and no fix from microsoft in sight. Nice work microsoft. You have managed to agggravate several more clients along the way with my initial post to you, and feel despondent reading they too are still as stuck with this problem as
 I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal ultimatum for micrsoft has finally come. Microsoft it pains me that you have not found a fix for the faulty junk filters, nonfunctioning safe lists.</p>
<p>So as an exasperated user who tried to be patient, by year end 2018, I will be quitting your services and products for good after 20 years using hotmail/outlook, and will begin the painstaking but clearly essential process of moving my email service over
 to gmail.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Issue transferring files in TeamViewer from OneDrive after recent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brdaof  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue transferring files in TeamViewer from OneDrive after recent update</h2>
                    <p>I am using TeamViewer 8.0.44109, which is 3 years old, so I don't believe it has anything to do with the issue that popped up recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regularly use the TeamViewer "Transfer Files" feature to send files from my OneDrive to other computers while I am connected to them. However, very recently when I attempt to do so, the files in my OneDrive show up as folders in the Transfer Files window.
 If I transfer one to another computer, it transfers as a folder instead of as a file.</p>
<p>If I move one of the files outside of OneDrive, it shows up correctly in Transfer Files. If I put it back into OneDrive, it shows up as a folder again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind this only happens in Transfer Files within TeamViewer. Inside my OneDrive folder on the computer everything shows up correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know OneDrive has updated recently and I would assume that is the reason for the sudden issue.</p>

<p>Hi Brdaof,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feedback. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned, the issue only occurs in the third-part app TeamViewer, OneDrive sync client itself works well without problems. We suggest you contact TeamViewer support and report the issue to them for further investigation. They could check further
 if the issue is related to OneDrive update and then decide if some updates need to be configured to TeamViewer app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tim</p>

<h2>            Strange &#34;missing names&#34; in search results for Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have an Outlook 2016 user who gets some odd viewing results when searching her mailbox.</p>
<p>What is even weirder, is that if I set the same mailbox up on a different PC, I get the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we search for someones name, in the results some of the emails don't show the senders name, as per attached screen shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0c65f30-d8ac-453a-901a-2756942ac35f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0c65f30-d8ac-453a-901a-2756942ac35f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if we change the search option from Current Mailbox to All Outlook Items it shows all correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/542e3f57-89ab-44ad-a828-d5a096409df8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/542e3f57-89ab-44ad-a828-d5a096409df8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't seem to have the issue in Webmail or Outlook 2010. &nbsp;It's just very odd that the "fault" seemed to follow the user when I set her profile up on a new machine.</p>
<p>If I give myself full access and add her mailbox to my profile, the search works fine.</p>

<p>
</p><div>Restoring service - 13 Nov 2016 19:13</div>
<div>Title: Can't see sender's name in the Outlook client </div>
<div>
User Impact: Users may be unable to see the sender's name when viewing messages in Outlook (desktop).
<div>
More info: While we're focused on remediation, users may be able to circumvent the issue by using Outlook on the web as an alternative method. This issue is isolated to mailboxes that are being migrated between specific software versions of Exchange Online
 and it affects a small subset of messages that are received while an impacted mailbox is being migrated. Please note that this is an incremental update to provide the latest status on the issue. For complete details on this event, please reference the Restoring
 service post from 7:57 PM UTC on November 11, 2016. </div>
<div>
Current status: The deployment of the fix is approximately 77.5 percent complete. Once the deployment is complete, messages will no longer enter this state and we'll implement a fix to restore the sender information to affected messages.

<h2>            how to save locally &#40;e.g., to desktop&#41;</h2>
                    <p>A previous poster asked this question so my apologies in advance, but I didn't understand the response so I'm re-asking. Can someone please tell me how to save documents locally (e.g., to folders on my desktop)? I've spent a few hours trying to figure it
 out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to this being supremely annoying, I cannot attach any OneDrive files to emails sent from my Gmail account, which is what I use for my business. My stop gap has been to convert my Office files into Google docs so I can share them with clients.
 I'd prefer not to do this for a number of reasons -- not the least of which is that my goal in purchasing MS Office was to use it, not be deterred from using it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the previous post, I understand that this feature is less bad than it was in beta, but it's absolutely ridiculous that users cannot easily/intuitively save to their desired location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arrgggh.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender won&#39;t install definitions</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to install the updated definitions for Windows defender on my computer which is running (Windows 10 64-bit) but every time I try to install the updated definitions I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 (Definition 1.251.409.0) - Error 0x80070643</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried restarting windows defender and changing my windows update settings to automatic from manual but still the same error message. I have also tried restarting the PC but nothing has worked so far. I also don't have any third party antivirus programs
 installed. The error message also says it is an internet or connectivity issue but I know the connection is working because I can use the internet on all of my devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on how to install these updates and get my windows defender back up and protecting my PC would be much appreciated.</p>
