<h2>            Outlook Mail has the most frustrating UI.</h2>
                    I don't have the time to figure out how to check an email. Why distort the user interface so much that it's a chore to simply FIND and CHECK an email? The interface is crowded, confusing and outright irritating. I miss emails all the time because of these
 unnecessary updates. Why fix something that isn't broken?<br />

<p>Not sure why you would find it frustrating, you go to the website, login, and you are right in your mailbox. Click on an unread item and it opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wasn't broken before, and it isn't broken now. Microsoft is constantly making improvements, it is unfortunately you don't care for them. To let Microsoft know your dissatisfaction, use the feedback mechanism in the ? menu when logged into Outlook.com.</p>

    <title>What is the latest N95 Firmware Version - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What is the latest N95 Firmware Version</h2>
                    I have recently purchased a UK N95 and am keen to update the Firmware from the manufacturers default install. When I try to update it using the Nokia site it tells me that there is no update available as the version I have is the current version, is this
 correct as I hear V12 is the latest Firmware? I have Firmware version: V10.0.018.

            Both your statements are correct - for the following reason.<br />
<br />
If you buy a SIM free version of a Nokia phone, then you are entitled (and able) to put any SIM card in it and it'll work - however you're looking at an up front cost of - for example - 500 GBP for the N95. The firmware for this type of phone is then readily
 accessible from Nokia and available for download from Nokia once released.<br />
<br />
However if you purchase or receive your phone as part of a deal from a network operator (e.g. Vodafone, Orange etc.) then chances are the phone will be locked to that particular network - so you will be unable to use any other SIM card in the phone without
 first purchasing an unlock code from the network operator). With these phones, the firmware that the phone runs will be customised to the particular requirements of the network operator. In this case any new versions of firmware have to be approved for release
 by the network operator before it can be downloaded, hence your phone is listed as still having the latest version of firmware, when technically it doesn't if you compare it to a SIM free phone.<br />
<br />
You won't be paying anywhere near as substantial up front cost, but instead it'll be like a continuous wasp sting - they'll take money from you every month instead to recoup the cost of the phone.<br />
<br />
If you follow this link, you'll find instructions on how to find out the latest version of firmware for your phone without having to plug your phone into your computer :<br />

            I was in the same boat as the original poster. Phone bought on an orange contract, locked to orange and running version 10.xx.xx whatever it is.<br />
<br />
I've had my phone little over a week and despite being thrilled with it's features and ability, the huge amount of bugs and crashes are infuriating and were becoming almost unbearable to the point I was about to send it back.<br />
<br />
I decided that as I'd be happy to get the phone sim free should the worst happen, I'd update the firmware myself.<br />
I'll take a guess that describing how to do this contravenes the rules here so I won't but if you want to know feel free to contact me.<br />
<br />
Further to the OP's problems I was getting;<br />
*Crashing mid call<br />
*Terrible battery life, particularly when GPS or WIFI searching was enabled<br />
*jerky menu navigation - lots of "moments of confusion" for the phone where it would lock up for a couple of seconds/<br />
*poor quality from the camera which I know shouldn't be the case having seen other pictures (I'm a good photographer)<br />
*complete lock ups when navigating the menu requiring a reset<br />
*various screen freezes<br />
<br />
All in all spoiling the performance of an otherwise great phone.<br />
<br />
So after backing the phone up in PC suite I took the relevant actions to unlock it so I could use the latest firmware. After doing so I restored my settings (once you flash them you're left with the awful standard stuff) which resintated all my contacts, themes,
 hell even my hi scores on snakes. :)<br />
So far it seems great, and very worthwhile, as orange said there was currently no plans for updates and I know how slow they can be from past experience in phone updates.<br />
<br />
I've not had the firmware updated long, but so far it's not crashed once despite my attempts to make it do so (quickly navigating through the various menu functions, and using as many features as possible like radio, gallery etc simultaneously generally made
 it crash), and the battery life seems much much better, I've had it sat by me for an hour connected to my WiFi and it's battery hasn't moved, where previously it gave me little more than an hour.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to encourange everyone out there to do the same as me, as I don't want to get into trouble here being a newbie especially, and I know there's potential for it to go wrong, but I'm not technically minded with phones and it's proven to be an utterly
 painless and easy 5 minute task, and thanks to backing up before and restoring afterwards, I've not lost any of my orange settings, contacts, or features provided by the service provider.<br />
Word on the grapevine is there's a new version of the firmware coming soon, so hopefully that'll iron out some of the bugs that still remain.<br />
<br />
n95blog.com/nokia-n95-firmware-update-120013<br />
<br />
I used this place as a guide, hope I'm not contravening any rules by sharing it, just bang http:// infront of the above and you'll get the right site, which has everything you need should you want to upgrade.<br />
Obviously not recommended by nokia or your network provider, but for me at least it was the difference between a phone I could use and a crashy rubbish phone that had potential to be decent.<br />
I've not used nokias for years, my last phones (still in service alongside my nokia) have been a K800i sony ericsson and a samsung d900, neither of which have crashed once in a year, or had ANY bugs whatsoever, so it was especially frustrating for me having
 to reboot a phone 5-10 times a day and crashing mid call requiring a reboot whilst in the middle of talking to business clients, so I'm not interested in what companies think about my flashing firmware or voiding warranties.<br />
<br />
Hope this is of some help, always good to share opinions and experiences, sadly ours are negative but it's good to know it's not just me that was getting trouble with the N95.<br />
Still, now I've got a new version of the firmware it seems MUCH better, so fingers crossed it's more stable!<br />
<br />

                    <p>I had entered the wrong password too many times and was locked out of my account (Outlook.com). I was able to reset my password through the "forgot password" button, but the system is not taking my new password. It is still just saying that I entered the
 incorrect password too many times. I went ahead and waited a week to see if it just needed time to reset itself, but it is still giving me the same message. How long am I going to be locked out for? I tried calling Microsoft, but the automated voice on the
 phone keeps directing me to a website link and hanging up and the website link just tells me to reset my password which has already been done. I really need to access my account, so if anyone can help me, that would be great.</p>

            So I have done the search over the last 10 days (trying to remember to do it everyday) and my results have been mixed but more often than not I get several pages returned.&nbsp; I think it was the way Bing was going out to get the results.&nbsp; For example, as

<h2>            error code -50</h2>
                    When I try to send an e-mail to a single person or a group of persons form my contact list, I get error code -50 (e-mail is not sent as result of not converted e-mailreceptant = rough translation).&nbsp;
<div>When I double click on the name of the person, the e-mail adress appairs, but still it is not sending. Even when I try to manually type in the e-mailadress, it automatically takes the contact person from my Contact Persons list (which is aparantly not
 converted in the right way).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Who can help me to solve this?&nbsp;</div>

<div>Thanks in advance, Wendy</div>

<h2>            Deleting message backups</h2>
                    How do I delete message backups? I have been using windows phones for 8 years and every time it downloads messages from years ago. Basically I don't want those messages to exist anywhere anymore. Not on my phone and not on a Microsoft server somewhere.
 I know how to turn off the feature but I want them permanently deleted from everywhere.

<p>this is wrong. Sms "sync"&nbsp;is not a part of device backups. To get rid of old sms messages, you just need to delete them on the phone.</p>

 it just like before where i can drag the call window to the edge and continue what i was doing on the screen, if possible also please add a mute button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- another issues if you cancel the call, the skype main window pops out, what for?, if i already cancel the call with someone, i don't want skype to popup everytime, if i receive several calls, it keeps on showing the main window, it is so annoying.</p>

<h2>            Excel - autofill from individual monthly tabs to summary tab</h2>
                    In Excel I am rying to compile data into one sheet fro various entities from individual monthly tabs.&nbsp; Each monthly tabe contains 101 entities of which I only want to review 27.&nbsp; Each of the 27 items is in the same cell number (i.e. D57) on each tab.&nbsp;
 How can i autofill the summary tab with the data from each month's tab without manually typing the tab name and cell number (i.e. Jan13!D57, Feb13!D57, etc)?

 address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also read that groups can be used to share folders, however this is turned off by our administrators:</p>

<p>Hi Kinger,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're right, we can't share file with distribution groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To share a folder with a group of people, we also suggest you use SharePoint document library.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your team site, click "Settings" &gt; "Add an app" &gt; "Document library".<br />
After you create the document library, you can upload your files to the library, click "Settings" &gt; "Library settings" &gt; "Permissions for this document library" &gt; "Grant Permissions" &gt; share the library with the users in that group.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
James&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to escalate to Microsoft management when a Microsoft Moderator is no longer following up or responding&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I first raised a serious problem on April 1.&nbsp;</div>
<div>( "&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/e2e92b3b-eb6f-4f78-aeaf-22fe12782332">Renamed Microsoft Hotmail account from @hotmail.com
 to @outlook.com now all Hotmail inbox emails, email within folders &amp; contacts don't appear in Outlook inbox??</a><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp; " )</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It took 4 weeks of multiple replies from different Microsoft moderators who were too quick to respond and did not pay attention to carefully read through the problem and the series of actions which created the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On May 3, Carlo_R stated he now fully understood the problem and what needs to be done and stated he would come back to me once he spoke to the Microsoft engineers with a resolution. It is now a further another 4 weeks (after May 3) and I have never heard
 back from Carlo_R or any Microsoft engineers (even after I sent 2 reminder emails to Carlo R, on May 8 and May 18 in the private messaging area??)...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Its been 8 weeks since the original escalation on April 1 and 4 weeks (from May 3) since someone recognised the problem and that we have the problem fixed but still nothing?? Since Microsoft has completed the Hotmail to Outlook migration they never what
 to hear from the customers again??</div>

<div>1. Does anyone know how to have another Microsoft Moderator and Microsoft Management follow up from my private message area since Carlo R is no longer responding to an outstanding issue (and this issue has a flag as "answered".?? next to thread heading)?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. If a moderator has flagged as 'answered' how do change this and escalate or report when the problem is still outstanding and not fixed?? Is this a way for Microsoft to show a high success rate to resolving problems when there is not audit done on the
 quality of the moderators resolution?? &nbsp;I assume other moderators would also ignore the thread if the thread heading has ' answered next to it??</div>

            Ron,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your message however I don't have the time to spend hours with you repeating everything again as I did for weeks . If you don't understand the original problem or you have not spent time analysing from the beginning why would you now offer
 a response suggesting the engineers can't fix it??</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again thank you for trying but this forum is not a social chat medium but a forum where people offer a constructive solution AFTER they have spent time understanding the exact problem BEFORE offering a solution. Otherwise there will be people posting 'did
 you try this and that' only to find out the suggestions have already been suggested or solution had nothing to do with the problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft moderators forget that Hotmail and Outlook users are also&nbsp;<span>consumers of personal and business&nbsp;</span><span>Microsoft products and this unprofessional approach from some Microsoft Moderators has
 a cascading impact to future Microsoft brand and purchases</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>Ron, I have asked for Microsoft Manager and supervisor who can read through the private message emails to escalate and respond, lets leave it at that. Thank you</div>

<p>1/ will it be automatically assumed that I wish my test machine (desktop PC) to be converted to a Windows 10 licence &nbsp;for life? = No. As an insider you will be offered the upgrade and you have to accept or refuse it.</p>

            <p>If I remain as an Insider, I would expect to receive various preview updates post 29 July before they are released to the general public - as I do now. So my question is if I continue in this manner would I be deemed as accepting the W10 upgrade and be unable
 to revert to W7 in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have assumed that if I left the Insider Program, I would have a year in which to decide to accept the free upgrade on offer to the general public. If I did accept that offer, does anyone know if I would be able to revert to the original W7, and if so would
 there be a time limit on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am asking these questions because, although I am content to upgrade the machine to W10, my wife who is likely to become the main user at sometime in the future, does not share my enthusiasm for W10.</p>

            <p>As an Insider you will given the choice to remain and Insider and continue to receive the updates before they are released to the general public OR opt out of the Insider program and revert your machine to the Official upgrade. To do this you need to have
 a Genuine License of a qualified version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe you have a year to make this decision. I could be wrong, but think you have to do it when you get the notice you can upgrade.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. The unofficial FAQ does not appear to answer my questions. I know that currently the Insider bulids can be rolled back. I did that on one occasion, and that the roll back facility only exists for 30 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the situation post 29 July that I was enquiring about. If I chose to remain with the Insider program for a while, would I still have an option to roll back to W7.</p>

            <p>I wish to remain as an Insider for the time being, but not forever. I am using a Genuine Windows 7SP1 installation which has been upgraded with the latest Build.
</p>
<p>I know that at this point in time I can opt out of the Insider Program and revert to W7, and then have a year in which to make up my mind about taking up the free upgrade on offer to the general public on 29 July.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However what is not clear to me is what happens if I remain on the Insider Program for a while post 29 July. Do I then have the option of reverting to W7 when I leave the Insider Program at some date in the future/</p>

            Rollback works only for the previous installation of windows, not all the way back to&nbsp;your original windows&nbsp;unless you never installed any of the win 10 preview builds. If you installed&nbsp;any preview builds, it rolls back to the last&nbsp;preview build&nbsp;installed.&nbsp;
 Windows 7 would have to be re-installed using win 7 installation disks.

            Yes indeed, the roll back which I did to W7 was only from a single Preview upgrade, to test the process. I have the original installation media and also a disc image.<br />

<p>UK TechNet Flash newsletter announcing Windows 10 yesterday. I followed various links and arrived at this page:</p>

<p>
</p><p>The section on "can I go back to my old operating system" appears to indicate that in instances where the "go&nbsp; back" option is not available it is still possible to revert to the original OS providing you have the original installation media and product
 key. This does not appear to be time limited.</p>

            When you leave insiders you will be using win10 10240 as&nbsp;the fully&nbsp;licensed free&nbsp; upgraded product... so perhaps some time limit starts then for you to&nbsp;destroy your win10 install &amp; install your old windows version.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; But perhaps they just don't care
 if you do continue using win10 as it probably will become a free product for everyone in the near future.&nbsp; Cant sell&nbsp; all that advertising &amp; tv/music etc.. if people don't use win10. People be thinking $100 to $200 for windows,,, or free Linux or mac or chrome
 op systems.

            In File, Options, Account what is the text following the version/build number? It definitely wont work with the app version.  
<br />
<br />There is no MSI version of Office for subscribers (only volume licenses), but many apps work with the Click to run version. If their addin does not work with click to run, you will not be able to use it. Sorry.

    <title>Lumia 925 SD card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gtiger---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 925 SD card</h2>
                    
<p>Lumia 925 is a positive step in the right direction for T-mobile. &nbsp;But nokia fails to understand that the dismal salesof the device on AT&amp;T and verizon are due to the fact that there is no removable battery and above all the most important is the expandable
 memory. &nbsp;Nokia products are a class above the rest but the decision to eliminate expandable memory places it in the likes of an iphone that happens to be a closed proprietary product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I own a Lumia 810 on T-mobile and am more than pleased with the phone. Expandable XDHC 64 gb card allows me to shoot and save high quality videos and pictures on the go. it defeats a purpose of a high quality camera when you dont have the storage capacity
 to utilize its full potential as in the case of 925. I'm not sure if i would want to upgrade to a flagship device.</p>

<p>I have been a Galaxy SII user for almost two years now. A couple of moths ago I bought a Nokia 521 as a spare phone for the house. I am impressed with it. I had decided to buy the Lumia 925 to replace my Galaxy SII. But learning that the MicroSD is not available
 in the&nbsp; Lumia 925 makes me rethink that decision!</p>

<p>It is exclusive to T-Mobile. The 810 is exclusive to T-Mobile. The reason the 810 does not have LTE is becuse TM specs the lowest possible hardware. In other markets the 925 will have 32GB of storage. TM only specs out 16GB for theirs. It is not the fault
 of Nokia, it is TM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People should have already been able to see that they only want to get the phones out of the door. Supporting them is another story. The 810 has no firmware updates because that would take extra effort on TM part and they lack the technical ability to keep
 up&nbsp;or just chose not to.</p>
<p>Watch, the 925 on TM will lag behind&nbsp;on updates if they get them at all.</p>
<p>Nokias fault in this is the fact that they are willing to supply a 16GB phone to TM</p>

            MicroSd support is essential to me. As is native Qi charging. I use a Lumia 810, and while it never was a high end phone, having the wireless charging shell, and expandable memory has ensured that all of my future phones will as well. I don't use a phone
 case, and never will. I work in remote areas without cell coverage, so expandable memory is essential for music off line. I don't understand why all Nokia phones don't have both of these seemingly inexpensive features. I will never plug a phone in to charge
 again. I love the look and feel of the Icon, but without expandable memory, its a non-starter.

            <p>Ahem. &nbsp;Updating to Sierra (and checking the Share Desktop and Documents - the default) does absolutely change the Path to the Microsoft User Data folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade (done this way which strikes me as the main reason for the upgrade) puts Documents into a subfolder in iCloud (so that Outlook cannot see it) but then doesn't upload it to iCloud (so you can't see it on any other Macs). &nbsp;This also stops Outlook
 seeing it so when you load Outlook after the upgrade it's just empty which is a little disconcerting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume this is Microsoft and Apple just being difficult with each other as usual. &nbsp;However there may be some pointy headed reason why this doesn't work - I don't care - I just want all my email in one place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...what's the solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did (and I am happy to stand corrected if there's a better way) was to copy my Main Identity out of the iCloud Folder onto my desktop and then reset the desktop copy as my default Identity using Microsoft Database Utility. &nbsp;It took forever for the
 Database Utility to rebuild the database after this but when I restarted Outlook after a successful rebuild Outlook and all the data was back. &nbsp;Crisis averted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice - take a full pst backup of Outlook BEFORE you upgrade to Sierra and put it on your desktop...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a MacBook Air that I travel with and an iMac on my desktop so the document sharing aspects of Sierra are a godsend. &nbsp;My "live" emails are easy to deal with since everything is online and synched and I can see them on my iMac and all my mobile
 iDevices - no problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is with my local "archive". &nbsp;What I have decided to do is to use my iMac as my "master" and simply take a dump of my archive to pst which I can keep on my desktop (and then see from my MacBook Air while on the road and upload to local Outlook if
 I need it) when I travel. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>See Apple, see Microsoft - I outwit you once again! Ha!</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if these guys would simply co-operate in the name of helping users who pay good money for these productivity tools wouldn't that be nice? Maybe an upgrade to Outlook to deal with this please Microsoft? Maybe some way of seeing an Outlook Archive
 across iCloud Apple? &nbsp;Anyway I'm sure they won't listen to li' ol' me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Save As PDF - Print area and page orientation is ignored when using &#34;Save As PDF&#34; option.</h2>
                    When saving a multiple-tab document that contains varied orientations (landscape/portrait), the Save as PDF / Publish as PDF commands seem to ignore the individual tab's page settings, including orientation and print area.

<p><span>This happens because one (or multiple) sheets in your workbook has a different dpi setting for printing</span></p>
<p><span>In order to have all the individual sheets printed within a single PDF file (not multiple PDFs) you need to set the same DPI printing
 value for all of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To set the same
<span>Page Setup</span> options for all individual Excel sheets:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open
</span><span>the Excel workbook
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the tab for any of the sheets you have in your workspace (by default they sheet tabs are named Sheet1, Sheet2, ...)
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose the
<span>Select all Sheets </span>option (which will select all the sheets in your workspace, you can tell they're selected if all the sheet tabs have a white background like an active sheet tab would have)
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In Microsoft Excel 2007 go to
<span>Page Layout</span> and click on the expand button for the <span>Page Setup</span> dialog (for Microsoft Excel 2003 or earlier go to
<span>File-&gt;Page Setup</span>). Set the <span>Print Quality</span> to the DPI value you want and press
<span>OK</span> </span></p>

<h3> tomli95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hacked email account.</h2>
                    <p>My alternative email account has been hacked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The username is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sent three requests each time saying I do not have enough information. &nbsp;Please can you do a ISP check, I live where the email was created and I HAVE ONLY EVER BEEN BASED IN THE UK, my account was hacked by some form of chinese program as my security
 questions are now in chinese and the new email it is linked to is rs****@?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you fix this, the email address has links to certain payment methods on sites, memberships on forums and many other things, it's completely unacceptable that it still hasn't been resolved, I have had that email for YEARS. &nbsp;I even own an email
 name similar to that which I'm sure I have had for over 10 years so please, get back to me and resolve this on a level where I can prove it is my account instead of the automated recovery system which is UTTER ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
