<p>Ideas:Every time I add new pictures to my camera, I want to upload them to Windows 7 photos. &nbsp;The problem is that when I plug the camera into the computer, this photo program uploads everything I've already uploaded, not just the new pictures. &nbsp;I don't want
 duplicates. &nbsp;How do I just add the new pictures and not everything?</p>

            Hi <span>joejoedancer</span> ,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.
<p>a. How are you trying to upload the pictures?<br />
<br />
If you are using Windows Live gallery, it will give an option to select the pictures&nbsp;you wants to import.<br />
For more information visit <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/nz/digitallife/media/transfer_photos_from_your_camera_to_the_computer.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/nz/digitallife/media/transfer_photos_from_your_camera_to_the_computer.mspx</a><br />
<br />
It is recommended that you review your imported pictures in Photo Gallery, where large previews make it easy to decide which newly imported pictures to delete from your computer.<br />

<br />
<br />
You may also use some third party software to remove duplicate pictures in your <span>
comptuter</span>.<br />

    <title>Cant play any of my Xbox One games offline - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cant play any of my Xbox One games offline</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>

<p>I use to live in the UK and moved to South Africa (2 weeks ago).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I plugged in my Xbox Today and trying to play a game. Once trying, I receive the error message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"For this game, you need to be online"</p>
<p>"If you are on this Xbox regularly, make it your home xbox to enable offline play for games you own. The next time you are online, go to settings &gt; My Home Xbox. (0x87de2727)".&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a problem. I just moved Country and I cannot go online for a while... a long while (I am sending this message from my phone which is 3G and does not have a lot of data). I purchased all of my games (Except for Destiny and Titanfall) on the Xbox Marketplace
 when I lived in the UK (22 games in total). None of them work, at all...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried turning off my xbox, removing the power cable and my external hard drive and nothing. Still the same error message.</p>
<p>Please tell me there is a way to fix this issue without being online?</p>

<p>I am from Canada and I have the same problem with Witcher 3, Lords of the fallen, and Wolfenstein the old blood. I thought they had gotten rid of the constantly connected to xbox live to play games? I can understand if the problem was with a certain game
 because it didn't have the newest update but I just played these games in the last 24 hours. Now when xbox live has a problem I have a big paperweight that I can turn off and on. So what games can I play offline?</p>

<p>Thanks for the comment. I imagine that the games from the Pass membership wouldn't be available for download, but the thing now is that I can't even sign in on my 360. So I can't see for myself what is available and what is not.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to the Community for info on this new subscription service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Signing up for Game Pass Ultimate should give the same rights as someone paying for Xbox Live Gold, but Game Pass is not available for the 360, so you wouldn't be able to access any of those games but you should still be able to sign in.</p>
<p>If you are having problems getting signed in, I would recommend redownloading your profile following the steps outlined in&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-profile-xbox-360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How
 to add or remove an Xbox profile on Xbox 360</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, give those steps a shot and let us know how that helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thanks!</p>

                    I have created a local account using the "settings" app,&nbsp; I named this account "Guest" .&nbsp; The password was real easy.&nbsp; Nevertheless, could not sign in: After clicking on "sign in" button, I saw the word "Welcome" on the screen, some process was going on
 for half a minute, then I saw a words "signing out", then the lock screen kicked in.&nbsp; After trying to sign in for a few more times, I removed this account and created a new one, which I called "User_1".&nbsp; Still cannot sign in.&nbsp; When I use command "net user"
 from elevated command prompt, I see this new account "User_1" as expected, but strangely enough, I still see a account "Guest",&nbsp; which I thought I deleted, and which is not visible at the "settings" app.&nbsp; Rebooting computer does not help.&nbsp; Any clues?

            Frederik, thanks for your involvement.&nbsp; I have removed account "User_1" and created "User_2" (also a&nbsp;local standard-user, non-administrator), and once again the same problem persists.&nbsp; Assuming something in the account management is damaged, is there a
 way to repair it?&nbsp; I&nbsp;do have&nbsp;a Windows recovery thumb drive, which I created&nbsp;shortly after purchasing the computer. I wonder, however, is there a way to repair just account management without re-installing the whole Windows system, because in my experience&nbsp;re-install
 of Windows from scratch would result in the loss of all the software and custom settings which I have on my machine?

            When I changed the "account type" of User_2 to "Administrator", then yes, User_2 can sign in without problem.&nbsp; However, User_2 can easily access my own files by browsing to C:\Users\&lt;my account name&gt; .&nbsp; There was a warning message "file not accessible",
 but there was a button in this message "gain permanent access", and double-clicking on this button, without the need to enter any additional passwords, just gave to User_2 access to my own files.&nbsp; I am not sure if this is normal behavior, but because the goal
 of creation of User_2 was to protect my private files from friends who want to use my laptop, still I do not have a solution. &nbsp;

<p>My suggestion to try an account with admin privileges was aimed at trouble-shooting your problem. It was not meant to be a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you type this phrase into a Google search box then you will see numerous references to your problem. The solutions usually involve modifying the registry or changing some file access permissions.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 shows as Not genuine - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 shows as Not genuine</h2>
                    Greetings,<br />
I have an ASUS laptop with Windows 7 that I purchased from Best Buy.&nbsp; The machine came with Windows 7 Home.&nbsp; I then purchased the 'Anytime Upgrade' for Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; Obtained the activation code by following the instructions on the card, entered
 the numbers in the appropriate fields on Windows 7 upgrade.&nbsp; The computer did its thing, re-booted and worked as Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; The next time I booted up the machine, it has a black background and a message in the lower right corner telling me my
 copy of Windows in not genuine.&nbsp; How can this be?&nbsp; Windows was installed on the PC by the manufacturer (ran since April fine with no issues), then once I upgraded to Windows 7 Professional using the Anytime Upgrade, I get a Windows is not genuine error message.&nbsp;
 Any ideas?&nbsp; Also, as an FYI - this computer has never seen the internet and will not be connected to the internet, so I know it has not received any viruses.&nbsp; Thanks<br />
                </div>

You might need to go online ( <a href="https://windows.getmicrosoftkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows.getmicrosoftkey.com/</a>) to retrieve your upgrade key<br />
using the PIN that's included in the package.</p>
<p>To start the upgrade process:<br />
Click Start/Search and enter the words:&nbsp;&nbsp; Anytime upgrade<br />
Next in the list of displayed results, click on 'Windows Anytime Upgrade'.<br />
Then follow the anytime upgrade screen prompts.<br />

<h2>            Touchpad Asus Smart gesture no double tap right click only</h2>
                    i am having problems with the touchpad on my ASUS notebook running W10 after the last update the double tap does not work to select something i have to right click then open its a pain in the $$$ &nbsp;. &nbsp;If i roll back the driver to the previous version it
 works fine then Update will reinstall the new driver next restart. The update was for Asus support devices. &nbsp;I also have ETD listed for the mouse in control panel but there are no details and no property s to change the settings . Also in the Smart Gesture
 settings there is a change at the bottom to select either Microsoft or Asus with check boxes. &nbsp;Its been driving me mad if anyone can shed some light on this problem i would appreciate it . &nbsp;I know that touch on loads of devices has given problems that MS just
 cant or wont fix.

<h2>            can&#39;t connect to the internet after upgrading from vista to windows 7</h2>
                    I upgraded from vista from windows 7 yesterday, someone from micrsoft did it remotely for me and now i have no internet connection on that computer. The other computer and tv work just fine...it's just mine. It's a desktop and connected directly to the
 router. My computer says i don't have the driver installed for network adapter which is weird because it all worked fine with vista. I need help big time.<br />

<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you would need to figure out what your network adapter is, your device manager should be very helpful here. Second, you would have to go to another PC and search up where you can download the driver for your broken PC. Once that is done, copy the
 file over to your Windows 7 machine and install it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not know where to look it up from, try the manufacturer of your PC and looking up the make and model of your machine. They should have a list of different drivers that are used for your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>After Microsoft upgraded your system did you not check your network connection to be sure it worked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you contacted Microsoft about the problem what did they suggest?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you should do is visit your hardware manufacturers WWW Support site and download/install the driver for the network adapter - and it is possible (unless you already checked) that they may not have a network adapter for Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Supplying more information will help find what you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your system make and model or is it something assembled from separately purchased components?<br />
<br />
If the system is a Dell what is the Service Tag Number?<br />
If the system is an HP what is the serial number?<br />
If the system is an Toshiba what is the serial number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes - Device Manager should be very helpful if you also know how to get the information about your network adapter from Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb and in the box enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Press the Enter key to open Device Manager, expand the Network adapter section, right click the adapter, Properties, and on the Details tab choose Hardware Ids:</p>

</p><p>We need to know what is in the first line - specifically the VENdor and DEVice information.</p>

<p>Edge is completely compatible with Norton: every site you visit will continue to be scanned by Norton as you visit them, &nbsp;just like always. &nbsp;There's no special toolbar built yet (Norton hasn't built it yet) but the protection still occurs because that's
 at the network level (to provide protection, your Norton scans your connections no matter what method is used, browser, apps, even background programs that communicate online).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Norton <strong>is welcome to build</strong>&nbsp;an extension, but that's up to them to decide and do: &nbsp; Microsoft can't go force another company to do something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously no one here can answer when that will happen, we don't work for Norton. &nbsp;You should ask them when they plan to do it, since they're the ones building it.<br />
</p>
<p>But you are not unsafe just because you are missing a short cut toolbar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notice that I am JimH, a different Jim</p>
<p>I also am unable to install KB4033342, but for a different reason. On a routine win7 update (previous update check a few weeks ago), KB4033342 was downloaded, but after about 4 hours, 95% was installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I needed to use the computer and stopped the installation.<span>&nbsp; </span>I tried win7 update later, and now I wait for hours with a 0% download.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The only choice win7 update offers is to download; how can I have it use a file in the downloads folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another question: Have I downloaded the correct file?<span>&nbsp; </span>The Update Catalog offers a number of KB4033342 choices.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The first choice seems to be easy, as one involves a server.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I’m a “normal” home user, so selected the choice that was not a server.<span>&nbsp; </span>
The next window offers three choice</p>
<p>In case the HTML is not processed; the top choice is<span>&nbsp; </span>ndp471 kb403341-x86-x64-enu (much hex).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Since –x64 is included, it seems to be the best choice for my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<p>Have I selected the correct file to download?</p>
<p>Once the file is downloaded and saved in the Downloads folder, how can I get “Check for Updates” to use it?</p>

<p>You didn't actually answer Jim's question. </p>
<p>You just quoted the Microsoft "party line" about updates in general and told him how to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We appreciate you for being part of Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You may run check disk command from command prompt to verify if there is any bad sector present in your hard disk drive.
</span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Windows</span></strong><span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;</span><strong><span>X
</span></strong><span>keys on the keyboard</span><span>, click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin).</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<span>You may be asked whether to schedule this volume to be checked next time when you restarts (Y/N).</span></p>

<span>Press <strong>Y</strong> key on the keyboard and press Enter key.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Restart the computer and check.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If the issue persist, follow the below method.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>I will suggest you to check if the issue occurs in Safe Mode. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To start Windows 10 in safe mode:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Search for Settings from the taskbar and&nbsp;select it from the search results.</span></li><li>
<span>Select <strong><span>Update&nbsp;&amp;</span></strong>
<strong><span>security</span></strong> and click on&nbsp;<strong><span>Recovery</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Go to <strong><span>Advanced&nbsp;startup</span></strong> and select
<strong><span>Restart now</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>After your PC restarts to the Choose an option&nbsp;screen, select <strong><span>Troubleshoot
</span></strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong><span>Advanced options
</span></strong>&gt; <strong><span>Startup Settings</span></strong> &gt;<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>After your PC restarts, select a startup&nbsp;setting as Safe Mode by pressing the corresponding number.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a Clean Boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating
 software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Put the computer in Clean Boot and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>By setting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>

<p><span>The steps applies to Windows 10 also.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Kiran,</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done Method 1 but alas it is still showing as an error in maintenance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not confident enough to do Method 2 ect: but I know a man who is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I was wondering if this is left over from windows 8.1 for I can only find the error when I go into Control Panel on my desktop.</p>
<p>If I go into settings on Windows 10 I can not find anything to do with it?</p>
<p>

                    My system is Windows 7 pro 32-bit with SP1. Yesterday I installed it as an in-place upgrade from Vista.

When I tried to use the corresponding stand-alone versions of the failed patches, I got the error “The update is not applicable to your computer”.
<br />
<br />
25 other updates failed with the same error, but installed successfully some hours later. Altogether 135 updates

            <p>Hello Jaleel,</p>
<p>The short answer is to download a new driver from a safe source. Go to this page:&nbsp;
<a href="http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/23684/section/troubleshoot/crid/405/lt_product_id/7794/tabs/1,3,2,4,5/cl/us,en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/23684/section/troubleshoot/crid/405/lt_product_id/7794/tabs/1,3,2,4,5/cl/us,en</a>. In order to download the right driver you need to know if you are running a 64 or 32 Bit depth version of Windows
 7. To do that go to Control Panel, select System, and when that window opens, go to the System type: line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download and install the right software for your camera. Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Why, as a Microsoft engaged "expert" do you continuously suggest ideas that will never work?<br />
<br />
Test your own "theory".<br />
<br />
Assuming XP is installed on your C drive, navigate here:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
Rename the ieframe.dll file to something you can remember, like ieframe.xxx.<br />
<br />
If Windows File Protection looked after and cared about that file (which is doesn't), it would quickly and silently replace the missing file.&nbsp; Since that does not happen, that should tell you (or somebody that knows how XP works) that the System File Checker
 doesn't care about it either.<br />
<br />
Attempt to launch Internet Explorer and it will not work.<br />
<br />
Now, with you ieframe.dll file "missing". follow your own advice to run SFC to completion.<br />
<br />
Did the missing file get replaced?<br />
<br />
No it did not, so you can see that SFC will not replace the missing file.<br />
<br />
Rename the ieframe.xxx back to ieframe.dll and test be sure things are back to normal and your Internet Explorer is working again.<br />
<br />
Now make a backup copy of the ieframe.dll file someplace you can find it later.<br />
<br />
Now "corrupt" the ieframe.dll file by copying some other file over the top of it like...&nbsp; copy taskmgr.exe over the top of ieframe.dll so not the file is "corrupted".&nbsp; Since the "corrupted" file did not automatically get replaced, that should tell you (or somebody
 that knows how XP works) that the System File Checker doesn't care about it either.<br />
<br />
Attempt to launch Internet Explorer and it will not work.<br />
<br />
Now, with you ieframe.dll file "corrupted". follow your own advice to run SFC to completion.<br />
<br />
Did the corrupted file get replaced?<br />
<br />
No it did not, so you can see that SFC will not replace the corrupted file.<br />
<br />
As a Microsoft engaged "expert" do you not know the files that Windows File Protection and the System File Checker look after and care about?&nbsp; Do you need a list?&nbsp; It is on my SkyDrive.<br />
<br />
Are you starting to see how SFC does not work the way the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" keep telling everybody it does work?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It may be how you think it works,it may be how you were told it works, it may be how you wish it works, it may be your misinterpetation of the documentation, but what you "experts" keep telling people is not the way it really works.&nbsp; Do you want to know how
 it does work?<br />
<br />
Perhaps in the future, when somebody has a DLL file problem, you Microsoft engaged "experts" will think twice about wasting their time with a useless post with a link to a KB article that will not work.&nbsp; You might even recreate the problem and try you own advice
 and then when it does not work, just not post anything that will waste the time and further frustrate users looking for help - just to get a credit for a reply with a link to a KB article.&nbsp; I have made thousands of posts (and real "Answers") and rarely link
 to a KB article.<br />
<br />
I know, I know...&nbsp; you are obligated to reply to every post and include a link to a KB article even if you have not tested it, even if it doesn't work, even if is will never work or even come close,&nbsp; but it is very tiring for us volunteers that have to come
 behind you and actually fix things.<br />
<br />
Maybe this exercise will help you understand more about how XP works and SFC works.<br />
<br />
Things are a little different for the 3498 files that WFP and SFC actually actually does care about, but your advice in this simplistic case is unfathomable since you obviosly have not tested any of it and are just quoting your standard: &nbsp; "DLL error - must
 post SFC scannow instructions.&nbsp; Somebody else will really fix it".<br />
<br />
The Microsoft "experts" are keen to suggest SFC when there is a DLL problem, but nobody in over 2 years has ever collected on the $1000 USD cash bounty I offered when you "experts" suggest it to correct a problem - and it doesn't.&nbsp; Does that tell you something?<br />
<br />
If being a Microsoft engaged "expert" is a salaried position, somebody please send me an application.<br />

            <div>&nbsp;I'm noticing this error on many XP systems with IE 8.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was able to fix it by importing LNK registry key .Install malwarebytes and when you receive class not registered &nbsp;error click ok .Do not update or try to run malwarebytes</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>Extract and launch the registry key and click YES to import.Restart the PC or restart explorer.exe &nbsp;alone.You should be able to run mbam.exe from C:\programFiles\malwarebytes folder now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Corrupted IEframe.dll has somehow corrupted the icon too.Another fix one can use is to just copy the mbam.exe from C:\programFiles\malwarebytes folder on any vista or windows7 systems and paste it in same location on XP PC with the issue.</div>

<div><b>Manually uninstalling IE 8 when normal uninstallation doesnt work</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Browse to C:\Programfiles\Internetexplorer .Delete all the files and folders in it.Go to C:\windows and delete IE 8 updates folder.Restart the PC and install IE 8.Ignore if deleted files regenerates or you receive access denied while deleting the files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>good luck</div>

            Stewy: I suggest that you try resetting the media library. First note that resetting the library will make you lose all current play counts, and possibly ratings too. Then, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
- Reboot the PC.<br />
- Go to Start, type <span style="font-weight: bold">services.msc</span> in the Search field, and press Enter. In Services, find the
- Go to Start, type <span style="font-weight: bold">%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</span> in the Search field, and press Enter. This folder will open up in Windows Explorer.<br />
- In this folder, delete the <span style="font-weight: bold">Media Player</span> folder. If you can't see the folder, then it's probably hidden. Set Explorer to show hidden files and folders, and to show protected system files.<br />
- Start WMP, your library will have been reset and will be rebuilt. Check if the issue still occurs.

            <p><span>Hi<strong> </strong>PTTimothy<strong><span>,</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Which operating system is installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you the administrator on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to check and provide us the information about the operating system installed -</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/which-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-am-i-running" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/which-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-am-i-running</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may login as an administrator and check if you can open Windows Easy Transfer correctly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may even check if you face the same issue </span><span>in different user account or new user account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may create a new user account on your computer and then check.</span></p>
<p><span>Create a new user account-<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>Perform a SFC scan and check&nbsp;-<br />
a. Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>All Programs</b>, click <b>Accessories</b>, right-click
<b>Command Prompt</b>, and then click <b>run&nbsp;as administrator</b>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<b>Allow<br />
</b><span>b. </span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
<b>sfc /scannow&nbsp; <br />
</b>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time.<b><br />
</b><span>c. </span>If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue.<b><br />
</b><span>d. </span>If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations".<b><br />
</b><span>e. </span>After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan -<br />
