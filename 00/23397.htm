<h2>            browser not displaying my buttons or other graphics</h2>
                    I have been a microsoft publisher user for ever ... a few years ago i started using it for a web site or two ... my current site is not showing any of the buttons or other graphics when i bring it up in my browser ... and yet, about 6-months ago a prior
 site was OK ... I have looked at the current site via my normal IE and Firefox and Google Chrome and none will show the buttons or other graphics ... any suggestions?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>compare the two sites.... you may have already added the x-ua meta tag to tell MSIE browsers that you want your site to be rendered like IE7...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7" /&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for a very technical over-view see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh781499(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh781499(v=vs.85).aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(you may need a MSDN account to view the above)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>web search for "Document Compatibility in IE"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VML is supported up until IE10, but new IE versions will still display it if you put the x-ua meta tag on the page (first meta after your content-encoding meta)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>mmm probably a more likely reason why some of your pages content isn't rendering is because it may contain markup errors.... the latest versions of all web browsers are more 'standards' compliant...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is an online tool you can use to find and correct your markup errors here -
<a href="http://validator.w3.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://validator.w3.org</a> (a high level of understanding of the (x)html markup language is required)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is a consumer forum....</p>

<p>for questions about html, css and scripting please post to the IE Web Development forum with a link to your website...</p>

<h2>            What is this &#39;re-connect Outlook 2013 with outlook.com&#39; thing all about&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just got an email from Microsoft urging me, for some reason that I don't understand, to 're-connect Outlook 2013 with outlook.com'.</p>
<p>I'm estremely hesitant to mess with my Outlook 2013 that is set up with only my outlook.com address using the Exchange ActiveSync setup since when a few months ago I went thru the process of letting outlook.com be moved to some new server, it completely
 wiped out ALL photos that I'd uploaded for any of my 1,000+ Contacts along with permanently deleting any website addresses that I'd assigned to any of those 1,000+ Contacts.</p>
<p>Luckily, even though I got no help from anyone on this site when I asked for help at my
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_win10/how-does-outlook-deal-with-moving-copies-of/30729646-9560-4447-9f0e-19bb590768e6">

 able to manually go thru and make copies of some of their photos and websites URLs. I
</p>
<p>Since I sure don't want to go thru another ordeal like that ever again in my life so I'm not too anxious to mess with anything that has to do with my computer's Outlook 2013 or outlook.com which I never use except for, I guess, on my Windows 8.1 Nokia Lumia
 635 phone.</p>
<p>This question just popped up after I'd only typed in my Question title&nbsp;that this site felt was somehow related but I don't think it is since not only have I not noticed any email weirdness going on anywhere but I also have never used Office 365.</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-oapps/action-required-re-connect-outlook-20162013-to/cfc1ffba-b08c-47be-a409-594c6176efda">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-oapps/action-required-re-connect-outlook-20162013-to/cfc1ffba-b08c-47be-a409-594c6176efda</a></p>
<p>So what is this deal all about? Again, I hate to say it but since I've been thru that last disaster, I simply don't trust any automated Microsoft since they've probably put it out there for us since it&nbsp;had&nbsp;what they considered to be an acceptably low failure
 rate which I was apparently one of last month.</p>
<p>Hopefully anyone that's gotten this far is familiar with the email that I'm saying that I just got. Here's a PrintScreen of the top of it:</p>

<p>
</p><p>On the Account Settings dialog you displayed above make the account listed as Microsoft Exchange the&nbsp;Default account and remove the account listed as ExchangeActiveSync.&nbsp; When you click on the account listed as Microsoft Exchange click the button "Set as
 Default".&nbsp; Then you can remove the account listed as ExchangeActiveSync.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The mail reason to update to Microsoft Exchange is that it gives you a lot more functionality and it is also more robust than ExchangeActiveSync.&nbsp;

<h2>            How do I Save Excel 2003 as Web Page</h2>
                    <p>I have excel 2003 and want to save A1:S22 as a webpage. I can add interactability and it works fine locally, but as soon as I upload it to my server it doesn't work and just comes up with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use this Web page interactively, you must have Microsoft® Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later and the Microsoft Office 2003 Web Components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have installed owc11.exe already and have also tried changing the web&nbsp;options to include download office web components.</p>

We cannot embed any video. The best application would rather be powerpoint.</p>
<p>If still you insist in using word only then open word&gt; embed an powerpoint file which has mp4 in it.</p>

    <title>Omnia refuses to connect in Windows 7 WMDC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lumpyyyyy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Omnia refuses to connect in Windows 7 WMDC</h2>
                    I have tried all the solutions I have found here and elsewhere on the internet to no avail.&nbsp; I am getting extremely frustrated as I have had nothing but problems with this phone since I got it (currently on 6th phone in 11 month period).&nbsp; My Omnia will
 not connect to WMDC in Windows 7 64 bit.<br />
<br />
I have:<br />
<br />
Uninstalled WMDC and rebooted, no luck<br />
Disabled the advanced network option in USB to PC settings on device, installs Samsung MITs driver, does not connect to WMDC<br />
Changed Activesync to connect via 'USB' rather than '`USB Default", no luck<br />
<br />
Has anyone come up with anything close to a solution for this?&nbsp; I feel like throwing my phone into traffic right now

            Ok, with the device connected to your PC, open device manager and find where it is listed again.&nbsp; Remove it from Device Manager, disconnect your device and soft reset.&nbsp; Reboot the PC and connect again.&nbsp; The drivers should download again and lets see if
 that does it for you

            Drivers "Samsung MITs USB Sync" install correctly, and on my device it says connect to "`USB Default" and also says "User Authenticated".&nbsp; However, WMDC still does not recognize the device as connected and no partnership is established.<br />

Your device should appear in two places:&nbsp; Portable Devices and under Network Adapters.

<br />
My device does appear in two different places, but not at the same time.&nbsp; If advanced network functionality is disabled, it appears under portable devices.&nbsp; If it is enable, it appears under network adapters, but never at the same time.<br />

            Well it should appear under two areas at the same time.&nbsp; Here is an example of what I see with my Touch Pro2<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffarm3.static.flickr.com%2f2608%2f4134203847_9b0ba31286.jpg" /><br />
<br />
I know you have tried a variety of things so it is difficult to ask you to try again what you already have done.&nbsp; If it were my device, with all that you have done to date, I would perform a Hard Reset&nbsp;and start fresh.&nbsp; If you choose to do that, before I did
 anything I would connect the device to the PC and make sure that it was removed from device manager, disconnect then uninstall WMDC from your PC.&nbsp; Reboot the PC and now Hard reset the device. After the device was all setup from the hard reset, I would connect
 BEFORE I did anything.&nbsp; It should detect the device and automatically download and install WMDC.<br />
<br />
I have done this on 6 PCs (2 desktops, 3 laptops and one Tablet) and it has worked each time.&nbsp; I have 6 different devices all sync'd with one laptop and then each syncs with a second PC so I can keep everything all in sync (a complicated process but it works
 well for me).<br />
<br />
I can't imagine why it won't setup and sync for you with what you have tried so possibly cleaning it up by removing ALL occurances from Device manage, uninstalling&nbsp;WMDC and then letting it do it fresh from a hard reset may do the trick (I sure hope it does).<br />

            I have tried the hard reset approach... I have even gone through the trouble of getting a new phone completely to try it and it still doesn't work.&nbsp; The install of WMDC fails when "Advanced Network Functionality" is enabled along with the drivers for the
 phone, but WMDC installs when it is disabled while the phone drivers continue to fail to install unless I install them manually.&nbsp; This leads me to believe its a setting on my computer or just inferior software/programming of the phone.&nbsp; And I'm hesitant to
 think that its just the computer because I have tried to sync it with a Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 machine and no luck on any of these.&nbsp; It's deleted my contacts on a number of occasions also (on a side note, is there a way to backup contacts,
 without being able to link to the computer, and be able to keep after hard reset?).<br />
<br />
I can access my phone as a Mass Storage device and put files and such onto my device via mass storage, but WMDC still fails to work.&nbsp; I'm losing hope fairly quickly with my WinMo device :(<br />
<br />
I went to the Verizon store to see if anybody there could help me, but they don't know anything about what they sell unfortunately

    <title>Computing average run time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevelilgreen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computing average run time</h2>
                    <p>So I think my mind is just burned out. Here at work we create CDs and DVDs. Right now I am concentrating on the CDs. We are looking at cost and man hours. What I am trying to calculate is on average how long does it take to burn a disc. Since we sometime
 burn up to 3000 discs it is important to know. I know the times are not as exact each time because some machines must be fast in others. So below is my table. I am looking for a rough average burn rate. then when I get the CD lengths I can just use that in
 my calculations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am going to continue to figure this out but thought maybe someone might be better at this</p>

<table>


<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span>Length of recording</span></td>
<td><span>Burn Time</span></td>
<td><span>file size(bytes)</span></td>

<h2>            Is it &#40;really&#41; possible to import a stock quote into Excel 2008 for Mac&#63;</h2>
                    I've read several assertions that it is possible to import stock quotes into Excel for Mac from sites such as MSN Money and Yahoo Finance. &nbsp;However, I've never seen a detailed example of the code that could be used to do so. &nbsp;I'm using Excel 2008 for Mac
 and OSX 10.9.1. &nbsp;If you know how to do this, can you provide the example? &nbsp;And does it require the installation of additional software such as an ODBC driver?

            Yes, it is most certainly possible. And, no it does not require the installation of any additional software. there are even some sample files automatically installed with Excel 2008.&nbsp; For more information look at this:<br />

            Thank you for the very useful information!
<div><br />
<div>I read the article and, while attempting to follow the instructions, I discovered that Microsoft had provided a sample stock quote query in the "Queries" folder. &nbsp;I used the "Data/Get External Data/Run Saved Query" menu option and was able to retrieve
 a block of information for Microsoft, ticker symbol MSFT. &nbsp;The sample query provided in the Queries folder uses the MSN Money web site - no real surprise, I guess.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is the Microsoft-supplied query that works:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div><b>WEB</b></div>
<div><b>1</b></div>
<div><b>http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/external/excel/quotes.asp?SYMBOL=["QUOTE","Enter stock, fund or other MSN MoneyCentral Investor symbols separated by commas."]</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>The quote I want is returned but so are dozens of other pieces of data: daily high price, daily low, 52-week high, 52-week low, etc., etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then tried creating my own query from scratch using the instructions in the linked article. &nbsp;This is the query I created:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div><b>WEB</b></div>
<div><b>1</b></div>
<div><b>http://www.weylandyutani.com/cgi-bin/client2.exe</b></div>
<div><b>quote1=wyut&amp;quote2=["stock2","Please enter a stock symbol:"]</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>I was prompted for a stock symbol, I entered MSFT, and I received the error message "Unable to open http://www.weylandyutani.com .... Cannot download the information you requested."</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, I see that the technique in general will work. &nbsp;However, I need a query that will return a single value - the current quote for a single stock symbol. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you please supply the body of a query that will supply a single stock quote? &nbsp;The source of the quote does not matter as long as it is free.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>

            Well, I do this all the time for many symbols. I bnever bothered to try to restrict the return to only one value. it is much easier to simply accept all the returned values and ignore everything except what you want. The easy way to do this is to return
 the query to a hidden sheet. Then us a formula on your main sheet to grab the data you want.<br />

            Bob,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for your advice. &nbsp;I was able to use the technique you suggested. &nbsp;I used the MSN web query (listed in my previous question), placed the "blob" of quote information on a new sheet, and referenced the closing price cell from the original sheet
 where I need the closing price. &nbsp;I'm using the closing stock price as input into a calculation for annualized rate of return for individual stocks.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I don't like is having to go to the new sheet every day to manually refresh the closing prices, especially if the sheet is normally hidden. &nbsp;And I can't get comfortable with the idea that the cell position of the closing price won't change in the
 future, especially since the query results are sprayed across 8 rows and 16 columns on the hidden sheet. &nbsp;Still, it's quite a neat trick and I appreciate the help. &nbsp;Sure would be nice, though, to find a web query that returns only the last closing price for
 a stock symbol.</div>

            You can have a web query automatically refresh when the workbook opens. In the External Data Range Properties dialog click the check box for Refresh Data on file Open as shown on this
<a href="http://www.agentjim.com/MVP/Excel/WebQueryHowTo.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>web query tips page</b></a>.
<div><br />
<div>Using VBA or AppleScript you can set a schedule for refreshing web queries.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you want to disable refreshing of the query uncheck Save Query Definition in the External Data Range Properties dialog. Only the results of the one-time query will display, and the query will never be able to be refreshed with this setting unchecked.</div>

    <title>Can&#39;t get Help to open in Home 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenreilly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get Help to open in Home 365</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Home 365 for about two months now and find it a bit confusing since I've had Office 2003 forever. So the Help feature should be a huge help but I can't get it to work and the two issues I've had that I used the Help Desk for hasn't been a
 great experience at all. I have installed Office 365 on my wife's computer which is Windows 7 Pro 32 bit and it appears to work fine. My office system is Windows 7 Pro 64 bit and has had its issues. The primary issue now is getting the Help section to work.
 In Word or Outlook, the main two programs I'm using right now, mouse clicking on the ? in the upper right corner of the screen is suppose to open Help. On my wife's computer it does, not on mine. It also indicates that F1 will open Help, mine no joy, wife's
 computer it immediately opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have no idea what is causing this but I would think the Help option might just keep me from looking in all the wrong places for answers&nbsp;<em>if</em> I can get it to work. The only other issue I've had that I'm aware of with this computer and MS is IE11.
 When I do a MS Update scan it reports that MS IE11 is ready for downloading and installing. IE11 is already installed as when opened about reports that it is version 11.0.9600.17207 and Update version is 11.0.10. Update fails and Help Desk couldn't resolve
 after a long session of remote control. They just "Hide" the update. I should mention that I also have MS EMET installed and when I went to un-install it a week after installing Office 365 Home it made running Office 365 impossible. Another long remote session
 with Help Desk and then re-installing EMET before Office would work again. I was under the impression that having EMET installed would enhance the computer security but the only real result I've seen is the very slow connection of IE opening a link. IE starts
 fast enough but there is a long pause before the pages load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I don't know if IE11 is used for the Office 365 Home &nbsp;help feature but I can't think of any other reason for this. Any suggestions would be very welcomed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

            <p>Nayana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to reply.</p>
<p>I spent some time after the posting looking&nbsp;a bit deeper into EMET and found that this application is far more complicated than I first thought and way more than I really care to get into. I thought from reading an article in a Windows Secrets newsletter
 about computer security that it would add a layer of extra security which I'm sure it does if you can figure out its complexity. After first installing EMET I soon downloaded and started using Office 365 Home. Not long afterwards I decided to disable EMET
 and found that it would not allow Office 365 to run. I'm not sure if I disabled or uninstalled EMET. At any rate, afterwards Office no longer would load. After a lengthy online remote session with Help Desk the technician finally re-enabled/reinstalled EMET
 and Office worked again. There had been several attempts to download and reinstall Office that failed. Evidently EMET blocked that from happening.
</p>
<p>Long story short, I opened EMET and set everything to normal/default and Office Help all of a sudden became active and starts by either mouse clicking on the ? or hitting F1 as expected. Now I almost feel like I either need to devote a lot of time trying
 to understand EMET or find a way to uninstall it without breaking programs on my computer. For security I have Greatis UnHackMe, Malwarebytes premium, and ESET Nod 32. UnHackMe checks for rootkits on boot up, Nod 32 is my fulltime AV, and Malwarebytes checks
 for malware and other issues. I don't think I need additional security solutions at this point. Of course I also have Windows Defender and the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool installed and always updated.</p>
<p>At this point I feel like EMET is more intrusive and complex for me but I'm not sure I can remove it without causing more problems. The real solution is probably just bite the bullet and do a clean install of everything like I usually do every few years.
</p>
<p>As for Windows IE11 not updating, I still think that's a problem but IE11 and my other browsers do work. It seems EMET just slows the initial connection, I'm guessing checking the security of the site maybe.</p>

    <title>Upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kp-1969  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Is anyone else experiencing issues with upgrading from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 on their Windows Phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason that I ask is that I previously had an unlocked&nbsp;Nokia Lumia 830 (International version-Made in Vietnam) that I was able to upgrade to Windows 10 without any issue, and truth is that I loved it.&nbsp; Windows 10 worked great on it and had a lot of features
 that I used frequently that aren't available on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, after it died (a hard drop) I bought another Nokia Lumia 830 (AT&amp;T version-Made in China) and after installing all of the updates and apps from backup, I still couldn't get it to upgrade to Windows 10, even though the Upgrade Advisor app states
 that it's eligible to upgrade to Windows 10 and is working with the carrier for the latest upgrade permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if the difference was due to the fact that my previous phone was an international version, or that I was on vacation in Japan and connected to Soft Bank at the time as the service provider.</p>

            <p>Good luck... i hope you get sorted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is somewhat similar - after doing the upgrade to Win 10 it drained my battery in no time at all and so I had to revert back to 8.1. The phone said the GENUINE charger was needed but the fact it , it is the genuine charger that came with the phone
 (LUMIA 535).</p>
<p>I am going to have to stick with 8.1 on my phone because upgrading is not an option and I so wanted all my devices to be on the same operating system. I could send it to Microsoft for repair but it is under warranty for another 5 months but the retailer
 says because it was sold with 8.1 on and it works that he isnt responsible for any errors whilst trying to upgrade to Win 10.</p>
<p>Microsoft said to register a return but I need my phone due to personal reasons.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            <p>OK everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the solution, at least one that worked for me and hopeful works for you as well</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; From <em>Store </em>app, download and install <em>Upgrade Advisor.</em>&nbsp; Running this app will just to verify that your phone is compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; From <em>Store </em>app, download and install <em>Windows Insider.&nbsp; </em>Running this application will download and install Windows 10 onto your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp; Make sure that you back up your apps and whatever else you want to save.</p>
<p>NOTE2:&nbsp; Make sure that your phone is fully charged for both the download and install.&nbsp; It is a time-consuming process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to add, that my phone seems as if it's running faster on Windows 10, than it did on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also got the unlock code from AT&amp;T, and unlocked the phone (testing it with another carrier's SIM card).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck</p>

            Thanks for the reply. I had followed the steps you mention and it still has an impact on the phone performance. Microsoft are not interested to help and the retailer says it is working as sold now with Win 8.1 on it so they have also washed their hands
 of the situation.

            <p>Is your phone up-to-date? Verify that and then follow these steps-</p>
<p>1.Is your charger genuine? Was the phone charging fine before upgrading to windows 10?</p>
<p>2.Perform a soft reset(vol.down+power for ~10 sec. until phone vibrates and reboots).</p>
<p>3.Does the phone charge normally despite the error message? If so, safely ignore it.</p>
<p>4.If not, perform a hard reset.</p>
<p>5.You can refer to these battery saving tips for windows 10 to get a better battery life for your device-</p>

            <p>Prior to installing Win10 on my phone, I was running the most recent software/firmware versions that were provided by AT&amp;T.&nbsp; In addition, and I don't know if this made a difference, I unlocked my phone using the 20-digit code that provided me, which I tested
 using another carrier's SIM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are my responses to your questions in the order in which they were presented:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I used a Nokia charger, but not the one that came with the phone nor the 830 I had previously, and&nbsp;charged without&nbsp;issue both prior and after installing Win10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. No issues performing soft resets prior nor after installing Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. No issues/errors with charging both prior nor after installing Win10 on both Nokia and other brand chargers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; I've had no need to perform a hard reset since installing Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; I plan to look into the battery saving tips at a later time, thank you.</p>

            <p>I haven't noticed much difference in battery drainage between Win8.1 and Win10.&nbsp; However, I will add that with both versions I went through all the settings, especially background-running apps, and turned off whatever I don't routinely use or what doesn't
 need to be running unless I actively go into that app.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I also went through my apps and uninstalled whatever apps I don't use regularly nor will use (Skype, anything related to banking or finance, etc.).&nbsp; Some apps are known battery killers and the others are just plain security concerns.</p>

<p>
</p><p>However, I have noticed an increase in performance (apps opening speed) since moving up to Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also add, that I save/run my apps from the phone, but store my photos, videos, and everything else on my Micro SD card.</p>

<h2>            Digital Phone Calls Recording</h2>
                    
<p><span><span><span>Hello ,&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>we are going to make a full OCS deployment including integration with VOIP gateways using Mediation servers , but we need to record&nbsp;all
<strong>digital phone&nbsp;calls</strong>&nbsp; , i serached about this and found that OCS 2007 R2 doesn't support this OOB , and in order to do this we&nbsp;should do one of the following two options:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1- &nbsp;using 3rd party application integrates with OCS that make digital phone calls&nbsp;&nbsp; recording</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2- using Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 2.0 Core SDK , but it
<strong>needs some coding</strong> to work </span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>for the first option ( 3rd parity app. ) , could you provide me with some applications that microsoft recommends
</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>for the 2nd option , am i right ? i mean using Unified Communications Managed API 2.0 Core SDK&nbsp; needs coding or it can work with OCS and record phone
 calls without coding ?</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>thanks for your expected support</span></span></p>

<h2>            Installation is just hung about half way through&#59; now what&#63;</h2>
                    I've tried to install office for home and student 2010 on my new laptop, but it just gets about half way through the installation (according to the progress bar) and then just hangs up.&nbsp; I used the&nbsp;uninstall program to take Microsoft Office off and then
 tried again - same result.&nbsp; What's the deal??? (!)

            Hi.&nbsp; I don't know if I have 32 or 64bit, but I tried the fixit tool suggestion (#1).&nbsp; It didn't work.&nbsp; Next I tried the #2 suggestion - made a copy to my desktop.&nbsp; But I also used #3 and booted in clean boot mode before running the installation from my
 desktop.&nbsp; The installation was hung in just about the same spot ( the progress bar was half way between "2010" of the progress bar title), but this time there was a new window open showing a tool symbol.&nbsp;<strong> I opened it to find an error message about
 my printer.&nbsp; So I addressed that issue and then the office 2010 program installation&nbsp;made some more progress</strong>.&nbsp; After a little while the progress bar was all green and it went into "Applying upgrade" (I think that was what it was called).&nbsp; I was afraid
 it was hung there, too, but then it came back (seriously, after almost 5 agonizing minutes) and said installation complete.&nbsp; Yippee Skippee!!!!&nbsp; I rebooted in normal mode, opened WORD, and printed a test page.&nbsp; Whew - it all worked.&nbsp; Thanks so much!

<h2>            &#34;You&#39;ve reached the limit for forwarding rules&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: can't &nbsp; access my contacts</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking for a support email address, but could only find this forum. I hope you may be able to help with my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had 2 rules set up concerning emails from gengo.com, one that forwarded them to my gmail account and one that deleted them from my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I noticed that I was no longer receiving the emails in my gmail account, so I checked the rules and found that only the "delete" rule was there. It seems the rules have changed since I had set them up to begin with, so I decided to get rid of the
 "delete" rule and start again from scratch, as it seems more convenient now that you can have more than one action in a single rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I try to create it, I get an error message that says "You've reached the limit for forwarding rules. To add a new forwarding rule, delete an existing one." Yet, if I return to the list of rules, there is nothing to delete, it simply says "You
 currently have no rules".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the previous "forwarding" rule I had set up was lost when the rule system changed, but is somehow still registered as an active rule even though it doesn't work. It's imperative that I have those emails forwarded to my gmail account, so I really
 hope someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

    <title>Why are contacts are showing in People, but not Address Book&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ititus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are contacts are showing in People, but not Address Book&#63;</h2>
                    The frustrations of Windows 8 are only compounded by the issues of Outlook 2013! I thought newer software was supposed to be easier to use and more intuitive!<br />
<br />
With that out of the way...<br />
<br />
The issue I'm running into is we imported this users contacts from a CSV file. Now I can see under the "People" tab of Outlook 2013 they are all there listed out. However when I go to the address book, there's no entries, both are listed as blank. I've tried
 my standby tricks, I opened a new message and pasted all the addresses into there and clicked "Check Names", which usually pulls the email address into the NK2 file, but no go. I've tried right clicking on the contacts folder, then going to Properties and
 ensuring that "Show this folder as an email Address Book" is selected, again, no go. I've been doing this for years, and I've
<b>never </b>had this kind of trouble with an address book!<br />
<br />
I'm open to suggestion, so do please advise.<br />

            I m having the same problem - all of my contacts are showing up in the useless "people" tab (for want of a better word), but not in my address book.&nbsp; I have 2 emails set up, so I do not see any use in setting up a third profile.&nbsp; Is this just another example
 of the uselessness of Windows 8 or what?&nbsp; How do I get the contact info from "People" into my address book (where they were before).?&nbsp; As I said, there is no reason to create a third "profile" when I already have 2 email addys set up.

            <p>If you're using Outlook (the desktop client) - the "People" tab will show all the contact folders contained in your current profile (this has absolutely nothing to do with Windows 8. If this is what you're using then the answer is

            The same thing happened to me -I exported my Contacts from Outlook 2003 to&nbsp; csv file, then I imported them to Outlook 2013.&nbsp; My People (Contacts) listed the names, but they do not show up in my Address Book when composing a new email.&nbsp; I found the answer
 on another web site which I can't find to give credit to the person.&nbsp; He found that when the Contacts were imported, all the Contact information was imported except the Email Address field was not passed across to Outlook 2013.&nbsp; When you import the Contacts
 into Outlook 2013, select "Map Custom Fields" and then drag the Email Address field on the left to Email Address field on the right (Outlook 2013).&nbsp; Then, complete the import.&nbsp; Now, your email addresses from your Contacts will show up in your Address Book.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Important - You should delete all your Contacts prior to re-importing your Contacts as described above, otherwise, you will have duplicate Contacts for each and every one of your Contacts.&nbsp; It will be more difficult to delete each duplicate one-by-one which
 I ended up having to do.<br />

<p>Just for future reference, if you need to delete old contacts - just need to add the CreateDate to any of the list views (i.e. Phone) and sort on it. That will enable you to eliminate all the contacts that weren't created from the last import instead of
 doing it one by one (based on eliminating all earlier contacts whether duplicated or not).</p>

<p>By "fake email address" I assume you mean a spoofed email address.<br />
<br />
A spoofed email address is a forgery of an email header so that it appears to have came from someone or somewhere else.
<br />
<br />
Email spoofing is a tactic used in phishing and spam campaigns because people are more likely to open an email when they think it has been sent by someone they know or a company or person of authority that they recognize.<br />
<br />
Knowing this, firstly you should&nbsp;<strong>never click any links or download any attachments
</strong>as the links may be phishing scams and the attachments may be some sort of ransomware/spyware/ or any other form of malware trying to do intentional damage to your data and/or device. Even if the attachment seems harmless, still never download or open
 it as sinister and damaging code can be hidden inside of other files that seem harmless such as a text file or a ms docx file or a pdf file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would advise you to contact the legitimate source for confirmation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you come to find that it is in fact illegitimate, then delete the message and/or mark as spam if you wish.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013&#47;Windows 10, Search still not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user running Office 2013, and they're still having trouble with the search. It looks like it keeps re-indexing after it finishes it starts over again. we did the most recent windows 10 update to KB4022716 but still having trouble, also I deleted
 the profile and PST but same thing still happens. I am rebuilding the index now but it seems to be taking a long time to finish (overnight only made it to about 50k items, out of at least 100k+), Is there anything else going on with this? Let me know if you
 need additional info.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add we are using Google Apps Sync for outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi Matt,<br />

There are several reasons why you're the search feature in your Outlook 2013 is still not working. This was actually part of the Outlook known issues the last June 2017 security updates. The good thing is, this was already fixed and the solution released through

</p><p>Thanks for the Reply Ariel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this have anything to do with outlook? as i said before the index status in outlook keeps restarting. Also when i go to File&gt;Office account, I don't see the update option it only says "About Outlook." I did check the update history in the settings in
 windows and I do notice the updates there, with the latest update being KB3172545. Please see below screenshot, of the current version.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>On an unrelated note I also have a couple users with outlook 2010 that have the same issue and it works by removing outlook from the index options.</p>

            Thank you for the information. It is possible that a corrupted file is causing your index status to keep restarting that's why you're getting this concern. In this case, we recommend that you
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">repair your Outlook</a></strong> to scan and repair the corrupted files. Once done, try to remove Outlook
 from the index option to see if that works.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your reply.
