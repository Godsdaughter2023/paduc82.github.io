<h2>            Printer Not Activated, Error Code -20 ... Arises When Attempting to Save QuickBooks PDF File</h2>
                    <p>A couple days ago, Microsoft updated by Windows 10 software on my laptop. &nbsp;Subsequently, I have lost the ability to save a PDF file from my QuickBooks software. &nbsp;When I attempt to save an invoice as a PDF, I now get this error message: Printer Not Activated,
 Error Code-20. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that prior to my Windows software update, I had no problems savings QuickBooks invoices in a PDF format. &nbsp;I would appreciate anyone's guidance on how to resolve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Pete</p>

            <p>A couple of things to try</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right click on the QuickBooks icon and Run as Administrator, if that works, you can set it to always open as Admin - right click Properties &gt; Compatibility &gt; tick Run this program as administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Print your QuickBooks stuff using the <em>Microsoft Print to PDF </em>printer</p>

<h2>            Constant ESENT database corruption errors every minute.</h2>
                    <p>(i think this is the right topic section but please correct me if i'm wrong)</p>
<p>So i don't really know what these corruption errors mean but i'm getting them every minute or so, i did some googling and apparently it has something to do with internet connections or updates? Before my computer did randomly disconnect from my internet
 and once reconnected blue screened but i mostly thought nothing of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway i decided to check the event viewer today and i'm getting an event ID mix of
<strong>447</strong> and <strong>467</strong>, Here are the description of said errors.</p>
<p>447: <em><strong>&nbsp;svchost (1832) SRUJet: A bad page link (error -327) has been detected in a B-Tree (ObjectId: 19, PgnoRoot: 107) of database C:\WINDOWS\system32\SRU\SRUDB.dat (1240 =&gt; 1241, 0).</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>467: &nbsp;<strong><em>svchost (1832) SRUJet: Database C:\WINDOWS\system32\SRU\SRUDB.dat: Index UserIdTimeStamp of table {973F5D5C-1D90-4944-BE8E-24B94231A174} is corrupted (0).</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>During the digging i found out that you can do a scan/repair by opening the CMD and entering sfc/ scannow. so that's what i did and it came up with
<strong><em>"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log. Note that logging is currently not supported in offline servicing scenarios."</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing you'd want the CBS log but seeing as its a bit lengthy i think ill just wait until somebody replies.</p>
<p>Any and <strong>all</strong> help is greatly appreciated ;]</p>

                    <p>Hi I just recently updated my Windows 8.1 computer a few days ago and when i went to shut it down it restarted instead and it wouldn't launch windows it just kept on restarting. so just to put it together if i turn on my computer it will not boot into windows
 it will just keep rebooting. I put in my Windows 8 installation disc to do a system recovery and and error message showed&nbsp;<strong>0x80070005.&nbsp;</strong>I called microsoft and they just told me to do a clean install, but i don't want to lose all of my stuff.
 I also booted into my older hard drive with an older version of windows 8.1 and tried system recovery there, but i also got an error message
<strong>0x80070057.&nbsp;</strong>I am out of ideas can someone help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The newer version of windows 8.1 is on a 320gb solid state drive and the older version is on a 1tb hard drive</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can access the recovery console/safe mode menu by:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depressing the Shift Key while clicking on Restart at the Login Screen (Bottom right corner), or if you can't get that far in to Windows, by manually shutting down (forcibly) three times in a row&nbsp;to bring you to the same advanced startup options screen.&nbsp;
 You will have a System Restore option in there via Advanced Troubleshooting and also via Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you get there try a System Restore to a point before any updates and see if you can recover Windows.&nbsp; If you do, then manually install the updates one at a time checking for problems after each update.&nbsp; Hide any update that is causing problems.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>If you are talking about Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 upgrade then it is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Most new machines come with a recovery partition allowing you to go back to the time of purchase, you will have to check your user guides (or the manufacturer's Web Site) for instructions.&nbsp; Choosing that path requires you to save all valuable data first.&nbsp;
 Unfortunately upgrading to Windows 8.1 may lose such Recovery Partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These options are built-in to Windows 8 also. </p>

<p>It appears as though you're having the exact same problem as me:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/windows-81-computer-no-longer-boots-up-after/cd3705bc-eafb-412b-a6b8-ced6ec611462 &nbsp;so I can at least help with what the
 Windows Recovery Environment is since I was expecting it to be something different then what I had already seen 100 times too and finally realized I was already looking at it. &nbsp;So that is just that blue screen that comes up where you are able to refresh, and
 troubleshoot. &nbsp;I'm sure its where you're doing the system recovery from. &nbsp;That's where you want to try to boot it into safe mode. &nbsp;I was unable to and I'd be curious to see if you can do it.</p>

<h2>            Porting Skype number requires a PIN&#63;</h2>
                    I am attempting to port my Skype number to Verizon. I have done this previously without a problem. However, on this attempt, the Verizon port center is saying that the company handling Skype's porting process is requiring a PIN to complete this. I can't
 find any PIN on my account but they have tried several times now and cannot proceed without a PIN. Anyone familiar with this?&nbsp; I have tried to contact Skype but they say they don't require a PIN.

    <title>How to change Windows Spotlight preferences&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> myshadowgamer3  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change Windows Spotlight preferences&#63;</h2>
                    Every time I turn on my system, I enjoy seeing the various scenes and landscapes, but the feedback options are extremely limited, and having to wait for an image to appear before i can say "Yes, I like it show me more!" gets annoying.&nbsp; I was hoping there
 was a way to be more specific.&nbsp; Something in settings maybe, or maybe even in my Microsoft profile to say "Show me images like: (Insert theme) and/or (Insert theme)"&nbsp; I realize that you could just set an image in settings and change it later, but I really
 like the pseudo-randomness of Windows Spotlight images, so you never know what you're gonna get; and I enjoy the quality of the images even more.&nbsp; If there is already something like this in place, can someone please tell me how to get to it?

<p>
</p><p>Sending feedback will help Microsoft, but doesn't provide and tips on how to fix your problem.&nbsp; It's stranges sense of the term feedback - the loop is only one sided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You train spotlight by clicking your likes and dislikes. AFAIK, there's no way to pick a different set of trained preferences.&nbsp; You can however start over, but the reset requires a manual regedit to
</p>
<p>&nbsp; HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lock Screen\Creative\CreativeJson.</p>
<p>Change feedbackProvided from "true" to "false".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Json string is very long, you'll need to copy it Notepad, edit and copy back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instructions here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/reset-windows-spotlight-preferences-windows-10/</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a bigger hammer approach to delete all the Spotlight contentDelivery localappdata settings, but this may have other side effects.&nbsp; Look here</p>
<p>https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset-re-register-windows-spotlight-windows-10-a.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm about to test the CreativeJson edit which looks promising and made the rounds in June 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tested the localappdata settings reset, but mentioned it, in case someone has comments.</p>

</p><p>DON'T get confused between the version of windows you want AND the machine you're downloading from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you're using a 64 bit machine run the Download tool Now 64 bit - then choose whatever version you want to download</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for a 32 bit machine download the 32 bit tool</p>

    <title>Microsoft vs Local Account on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whycanttheygetitright  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft vs Local Account on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>I used to have a nice secure system, not any more though!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My email (outlook.com) had a hard to guess password that is not shared with any other website. Of course, this made it impossible to remember and difficult to type, but I used password assistance software (via a browser plugin) to remember it for me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My laptop had an easy to type and easy to remember password (at least easy for me to remember), but that was ok because my laptop is hard to steal whereas every hacker in the world has a chance to guess my email password.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Or rather, it was nice and secure until I got a new PC with Windows 8 (which I have updated to 8.1).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Initially, I had the sense to only create a local account under my name, suspecting that a "Microsoft account" was a bad idea. However as you will know, they keep nagging you and eventually I gave in and did the "Connect to a Microsoft account", partly
 because various websites implied I could always go back to a local account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, it seems I cannot undo "Connect to a Microsoft account" - is that correct?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Am I right in assuming I now have three choices, all of them bad:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>a) change the password on my email so that it is easy to remember - I can then at least login to my laptop using this easy to remember password, but of course it will also be much easier for a hacker to hijack my email</div>
<div>b) write down the password on a little post-it note and then stick the post-it note on the laptop, hoping that the cleaner (et al) neither throw away what appears to be scrap paper nor decides to use it to login since the password is so obviously on display</div>
<div>c) create a new account under a different name, meaning I now have two accounts on the laptop when I only want one, and anyone one of which I can't use because I'll never be able to remember the password to login</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now what I would really like to do is revert to what I started with and just have a local account, and forget about a stupid microsoft account? Or, for that matter, I would be quite happy if "Connect to a Microsoft account" did what it said and actually
 connected to a microsoft account rather than replacing the local account with a microsoft account? Is that not possible at all? If anyone can tell me how to do this, they will be my hero!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What is it with Microsoft, ever since Uncle Bill left they have totally lost the plot!</div>
<div><br />

            <p>If I understand you correctly, you R now logging on with a Microsoft account which has a complex password which you do not went to have to type in when you log on to your laptop.&nbsp; You are led concerned about security of logging on to the laptop itself.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In that case I suggest you associate a PIN win your logon on the laptop.&nbsp; That will make your logon to the laptop quick and easy, but will not compromise the security of your Microsoft account (and Outlook.Com email).&nbsp; The PIN is purely local to your laptop.</p>

<h2>            Fix for Hibernation issues in Windows 7 ultimate.</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<div>Original title: WHO has ultimate HIBERNATE problem????<br />
<br />
alright, those who have problems hibernating their system, win7 to be exact, this is not a question, but a solution post..</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>if you don't have any problem regarding this, or are just not interested, i suggest you stop right here to save your time and attention.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>if you simply don't know about hibernation, or try it not even once, and wonder the necessity of making it work, i can tell you why this is a must for mobility..</div>
<div>1st, like shutting down, but you can start your system much faster than normal startup;&nbsp;</div>
<div>2nd, like a power-off pause, you can continue with what you were doing before hibernation, and return to your previous status;&nbsp;</div>
<div>3rd, almost 0 power consumption compared with sleep, and much safer to move around than sleep, esp long distance and bumpy way..</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i've encountered an ultimate problem for this long since i transfered my old sys to a new hdd, and it failed to hibernate everytime even after i tried everything i can possibly find in every forum where people with the same problem discuss this but cannot
 come up with a solution that does help and work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>here i'm not telling you to try any of the following, as you may have tried already before you google or search the answers here</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-update your display(monitors) drivers *not always to the latest!</div>
<div>-reset your BIOS to default</div>
<div>-elevated cmd: powercfg -h on *i was thinking why win7 does not have a GUI for turning on/off this! such a retrogress..</div>
<div>-switch power plan/disable the hybrid sleep (in power options)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>coz even starters who would think of these can help themselves out and the hibernate opt will show up (again), which is no more a problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>NOW IF YOU HAVE REAL PROBLEMS HIBERNATING YOUR SYSTEM(WIN7)</div>
<div>like</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-lock instead</div>
<div>-cannot resume</div>
<div>-keep hibernating but cannot turn off power</div>
<div>-some functions(like network connections/sound/usb etc.) do not work after resuming</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>the following shall be an ultimate solution for you and would keep updating.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-first of all, check if your mainboard support hibernation using elevated cmd: powercfg -a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;normally s1/s2/s3 means supporting deep/deeper/deepest sleep, s4 means supporting hibernation,</div>
<div>&nbsp;and most clients would see s3 supported.</div>
<div>&nbsp;if not, skip all these and waste no more time on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-set your win7 partition as an active one in disk management.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-update your power(batteries) drivers *not always to the latest!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-upgrade your BIOS *do it with extreme caution and under strict instruction, lest you cannot startup.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-try also elevated cmd： powercfg -h -size &lt;PercentSize&gt; if you expand your memory recently *not less than 50 (50% of your memory size), rec 75, 100 or up to be full.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-clean up your system drive also if you tried the previous but helps nothing, cos not adequate space will result in the failure of storing data thus cannot complete hibernation/resume.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-disable all the power management functions(esp. allow this device to wake the computer) of each possible device, like network adapters, sound, video and game controllers, usb hub etc. even try mouse, to clear the factors that hinder hibernation or its
 completion.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-try to sleep once and resume, then most functions shall come back and work again. if not, try to update the drivers for the specific functions.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>if none of these solve your problem, then congratulations! you've reach the ultimate level of this problem!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>to solve this, you can either</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-remount your system volume for system to relocate your hiberfil.sys if you transfered your system or change your sys hdd letter, using elevated cmd: diskpart(enter) automount(enter), if reported disabled, type automount enable(enter) then exit(enter),
 reboot your system and try hibernation.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-fix your computer using your win7 installation DVD</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-reinstall win7</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>or you can try this ultimate solution</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-edit your bootmgr/BCD file *shall be your last chance before reinstallation</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>if you have difficulty using cmd or fail to modify with cmd, i'll recommend visual bcd editor for you.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(remember to tick show all items, then) check if Hibernate resumers is there,</div>
<div>if not, you'll need to create one in order to truly enable hibernate function(this finally get me out of my headache)</div>
<div>applicationpath \Windows\system32\winresume.exe</div>
<div>hiberfiledevice \Device\Harddisk Volume 1(C:)</div>
<div>hiberfilepath \hiberfil.sys</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>for those whose such item has existed and those who have multi-system, try to relocate your hiberfil.sys of each winsys to a correct and valid path.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>this hopefully will do the work before you have to reinstall your system to enjoy the convenience of hibernation.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>if all these above helps nothing, just don't reprove me for c'sake, Mr. Ballmer/Gates will possibly be more than happy to help you out..</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>cordially,</div>
<div>Marcus S.</div>

<h2>            Windows 7 - PowerShell will not run SFC &#47;Scannow</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just decided to post to the community really with a query. I am working in IT Support, and we're looking at a clients Laptop who keeps getting Blue Screens down to the Kernel, and we opened up Windows PowerShell, and went to run "<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>"
 and it displayed the message straight afterwards "<strong>Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service.</strong>" So I presumed it was down to the Service Module Installer (I saw various things in the past where people would encounter "Error
 126", however that runs without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We attempted the command in Safe Mode and again no difference. None of us within office have encountered this in the past, and just hoping somebody can shed some light on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way the laptop runs Windows 7 SP1 - Home Premium (64 Bit)</p>
<p>

            Hi Clarence
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should reset your computer using Media Creation Tool. You will have to cut Media creation tool on another computer if you can't do this on your existing computer.
<br />
<br />Refer to the section"Use installation media to restore or reset your PC "
<br />
<br />Recovery options in Windows 10 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />Note - You will get the option to keep your files during reset. But it will remove third party apps including Microsoft Office which will need to be reinstalled. Default Windows 10 apps will be automatically installed. But non-defaults Windows 10 apps will need to be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Clarence
<br />
<br />If the Reset operation is not completing, your Recovery Image is corrupt, your best option is to backup your data and clean install Windows 10, that will also repair your Recovery Image . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />

<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

                    <p>I have had my surface pro 2 for several months now. I purchased a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008X6C4I4/ref=pe_385040_30332190_TE_M3T1_ST1_dp_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mini-DP to HDMI adapter</a>&nbsp;(approx $15) from Amazon rather than the official&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/accessories/browse#accessories5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mini
 DisplayPort to HD AV Adapter (Surface Pro)</a><span style="color: rgba(55, 58, 54, 1)">&nbsp;which costs $40.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had off and on success in getting the Mini-DP to HDMI adapter to connect to a new external ASUS monitor. My success typically comes by plugging and unplugging the connection several times until it recognizes it. What is interesting is that sometimes
 this quick in and out works and sometimes it does not. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Q's: </p>
<ol>
<li>How important is it to have the MS Mini-DP to HDMI adapter vs. my off brand; I would think all adapters have the same technical specs? I was hoping to get some reassurance that buying the factory adapter will solve my issue.
</li><li>Any thoughts on why my adapter sometimes works and at others does not?</li></ol>

</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The official Microsoft adapter for Surface Pro 2 is specifically shaped to properly fit the mini DisplayPort on the surface Pro devices, we can't guaranty that 3rd party adapters will fit properly with the Surface Pro devices.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth connected keyboard and mouse stopped working after the latest Microsoft updates</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: </strong>bluetooth stack</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question as to why my Bluetooth connected keyboard and mouse stopped working after the latest Microsoft updates. I did the system restore, and it worked for several minutes, then stopped. The driver did not install correctly the second time for some reason.
 Am I dealing with old equipment from 2005 that is no longer compatible with the newer operating systems, or is it something I need to resolve with 3rd party component and software providers?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

I tried this step, but "Bluetooth Devices" are not in the list. &nbsp;What's weird is, if I run services.msc, "Bluetooth Support" is installed and started though. &nbsp;Rick are you having same problem with this&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am on an Apple iMac, running Windows 7 OEM with bootcamp drivers, trying to get an Apple Wireless Keyboard and Apple Magic Mouse working again. They were working fine for the last year, and still work in Mac OSX, as well as any other device I try to
 pair them with. &nbsp;However, it seems Windows just doesn't recognize bluetooth devices anymore, and I can't find said "Bluetooth Devices" in control panel. &nbsp;Also, there hasn't been any recent Apple Updates. The issue started for me immediately after the last
 Windows Update my computer performed.

            <p>I went into the device manager, and tried to update driver, and said I have the latest driver.</p>
<p>I actually installed a Microsoft recommended Bluetooth software several months back, and knocked out my Bluetooth mouse, keyboard, and media pad. I was able to restore functionality then with system restore. However, this time, that is not the case.</p>
<p>I have a Logitech De Novo Razor&nbsp; bluetooth set. I have used it for years on other computers as well, but lately having issues with updates from Microsoft for some reason.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think the Bluetooth software stack is Widcom. And the customer support is not the best there. However the Logitech seems to be fine, but I do not know at this point if they have a fix.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your timely help.</p>

            No this most definitely is because of a Microsoft driver update. You can't blame Logitech, as they did not release the patch. I too was hosed by a computer that was using the Logitech BT Mini Receiver USB Dongle that came with my Logitech DiNovo Laser
 Mouse/Keyboard/Mediapad combo.
<div><br />
<div>Not cool when you have a computer that looses keyboard functioning. Crazy thing is the dumb thing works in the BIOS Post screens (via some low level drivers of some variety) before Windows 7 even boots. Once it boots, NOTHING. Not cool when you don't have
 a wired keyboard in the house (after a trip to Fry's NOW I do once again...). So this is totally a Microsoft Windows 7 update screw up. No passing the buck possible here guys. Nice try.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Somehow the updates THINKS those of us with this device have a different Bluetooth dongle device, and applies a software update to a device it was never designed to work with. Sure you can turn the driver updates off, but bottom line is MS should do a
 much better job testing such updates, and then own up to the fact, that oh, sorry if you had one of these devices on your system OUR SCREW UP turned your keyboard and mouse into a useless paperweight.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I find a solution that works for me I'll post it back here. So far all the suggestions have come up worthless.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This kind of stuff is pushing me towards the dark side (Apple products). Almost went there today on a laptop purchase...</div>

            Ok, finally I found something that worked. Am now typing on the Logitech DiNovo Laser Combo Keyboard/Mouse/Media Pad once again.
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>From the below website:</div>
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/broadcom-bluetooth-21-edr-usbe-device-the-device/3af0dfc6-3576-4717-bd23-a8ac6fe7708c">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/broadcom-bluetooth-21-edr-usbe-device-the-device/3af0dfc6-3576-4717-bd23-a8ac6fe7708c</a></div>
<div><br />

<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong></li><li>You may also try below steps to ensure drivers for the device has been removed from Device Manager:</li><li>a. Click Start -&gt; type ‘cmd’ without quotes in the search box.</li><li>b. Right-click Command Prompt, select ‘Run as administrator’. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.</li><li>c. At the command prompt, type the following commands (press ENTER after each):</li><li><strong>SET DEVMGR_SHOW_NONPRESENT_DEVICES=1</strong></li><li><strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></li><li>&nbsp;d. When in Device Manager, click View then Show hidden devices</li><li>&nbsp;e. Expand the category containing your device, and then double-click the name of your device.</li><li>&nbsp;f. Click the Driver tab, and then click Uninstall.</li><li>g. If there is a Delete the driver software for this device box, check it (make sure you have internet connectivity so that you may reacquire these drivers). Read and Confirm Noti
<p>The above actually worked for me 1019 PM 10/11/2013.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once I used Manasa's above trick to delete drivers for non-present devices, I then deleted the Broadcom Bluetooth USB 3.0 Multiple Entries (multiple entires, I believe once for each time I plugged the Bluetooth dongle into different physical USB ports desperately
 hoping that would work earlier). I then also deleted multiple entries for what I believe said something like "Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then I rebooted the machine, as usual the Bluetooth keyboard worked fine for the BIOS Post, allowing me to hit Escape to continue. Then once again at the Windows 7 log on screen, THIS time I could use the Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse, even without any drivers
 loaded (must be something to the low level drivers similar to what allows you to use the Bluetooth Keyboard in the BIOS Post process, and move around in the BIOS settings).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once logged on to windows (I had previously uninstalled the latest Setpoint drivers from Logitech, rolling them back to I think Setpoint 4.60, as that did not fix anything, and there were no tabs for Bluetooth settings, and I seem to recall a problem from
 years past when Logitech's Setpoint updates did not include the Bluetooth devices for support, but this could have simply been because the Bluetooth dongle driver was corrupted with this Broadcom Bluetooth USB 3.0 issue. If I was brave and not exhausted I'd
 try updating the Setpoint to the latest version listed on Logitech's website with the correct Bluetooth Radio Dongle driver installed to see if in fact it does work. Logitech's support page for this set of gear indicates it SHOULD as the actual support page
 links directly to it. I probably erroneously sent Logitech a message saying they had linked to the wrong drivers for the DiNovo Laser ), anyway once logged on to windows the mouse and keyboard continued to work, and then the Logitech Setpoint Bluetooth Connection
 Assistant Window came up. Then a Windows Device Driver came up and after a few seconds it said that a "Generic USB Hub" (no mention that it was a Bluetooth USB Hub, but I am sure that was what it was referring to) was found and successfully installed. Keyboard
 worked fine. Then the Setpoint Connection assistant went through searching for the Bluetooth Radio Dongle.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After a few minutes it found everything and then started to configure the keyboard and mouse, and then they stopped working again. It gave the instructions to press the "discovery" buttons on the bottom of the keyboard and mouse, but like this problem in
 the past with this set of gear, it does not work well in this mode, that is using the Logitech BT Mini dongle as a generic Bluetooth Hub to connect other devices to. This was a previously complained about issue, that most users just ignroed, and turned off
 the Bluetooth Hub option restoring the equipment to its Logitech native support such that just the keyboard, mouse and media pad worked, and not other generic Bluetooth 2.0 EDR devices would work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So after disabling the generic bluetooth hub in the Logitech SetPoint Bluetooth Connection assistant, I once again used the connection assistant to attempt to link up again the keyboard and mouse using the red discoverable buttons on the bottom. Sure enough
 this time it worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I've had this keyboard and mouse set since I think ~2007 in windows XP days. Really great set of gear really. Held up all these years, wore off the C and V labels on those keys and the keys actually have some "erosion" on the top surfaces. So all in all
 the hardware is quite excellent. Just all the software patches for the Bluetooth security stuff that rears its ugly head every few years makes this keyboard set a pain to use in times like this. Maybe all this is a ploy between Microsoft and Logitech to frustrate
 users and get them to go out and buy the latest and greatest wireless keyboards....me, it just makes me go buy wired ones, cheap ones at that...sick of wireless failing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyway I hope the above helps anyone else with the above issue.</p>

            Oh and to clarify, Bluetooth 3.0 USB, NOT Bluetooth USB 3.0. In other words the Bluetooth dongle that came with this kit is Bluetooth 2.0 EDR. A more modern Bluetooth revision I guess is Bluetooth 3.0.
<div><br />
<div>This is not referring to USB 3.0, but Bluetooth 3.0.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In reading some of the forums I was confused as it seemed to indicate that one might experience interference between a USB 3.0 device and a Bluetooth 2.0, when it was talking about a Bluetooth 3.0 USB Radio dongle, not a Bluetooth dongle plugged into a
 USB 3.0 Port, or a system using Bluetooth with USB 3.0 ports plugged in. At least I think that has to be right, as I don't see how you'd get wired to RF interference.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway that confused me a bit for a while, and thought that might be a stumbling block for a few other people trying to figure this out.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>That might just be the crux of the original problem. Windows update is identifying a Bluetooth 2.0 EDR Radio Dongle from Logitech (who they used to make it I don't know, perhaps Broadcom), as a Bluetooth 3.0 USB Radio Dongle, and it certainly is not that.&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
<div>Has the link to the Windows 7 64 Bit Setpoint software for the&nbsp;</div>

<div>If I get bored tomorrow I might try updating that and seeing if this setup still works.</div>

            All right, the bluetooth 3.0 thing made me un-hide the KB2862330 Windows update
<br />
Christopher seems to be right : this update detects the Logitech (Broadcom?) Bluetooth 2.0EDR dongle as a Bluetooth 3.0 device - and this Bluetooth 3.0 driver fails to install or start .<br />
<br />
So I uninstalled Logitech Setpoint, removed the dongle and deleted all Bluetooth radio driver in device manager<br />
then updated the KB2862330, restarted twice and <br />
reinstalled Logitech diNovo Bluetooth combo with latest SetPoint version <br />
<br />
Again, driver for Bluetooth failed to install/start<br />
<br />
so removed the broadcom 3.0 bluetooth driver and searched (in device manager) for Bluetooth driver:<br />
Two 3.0 driver and&nbsp; a MS generic USB driver were to choose from.<br />
and the latter&nbsp; worked just fine.<br />
<br />
So, I have the WinUpdate, latest SetPoint Software 6.2 and a generic USB Bluetooth driver.<br />
<br />

            Same problem here, killed my Bluetooth altogether. It seems to me that Microsoft needs to fix this problem since it was their update that broke it.&nbsp; I am not going to try a bunch of things that may or may not work.

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. We apologize for the inconvenience. This issue may occur due to conflict between third party software, due to virus infection
 or due to corrupted system files. No need to reinstall the computer, I would suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Boot the computer in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Safe mode</span></strong></a><strong> </strong>
and check if the issue persists. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode then perform a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">clean boot</span></strong></a> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.

 the computer to a <strong>Normal startup</strong> mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and run the
<strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Open
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/where-is-control-panel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Control panel</span></strong></a><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click on
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Click
<strong>View all</strong> on the left pane of the screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. In the list of options, click on
<strong>System Maintenance</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. Click
<strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Run virus scan using
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></span></a><span>, which would help us to get rid of virus, spyware, and other malicious
 software.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 4:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>This issue may occur if a particular system file is missing or corrupt. You may refer the Method -The System File Checker tool in the following KB article:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></p>

<h2>            VXI Bluetooth headset not recognized in Windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:Device</p>
<div>I have a new VXI Bluetooth headset that I planned on using for computer dictation&nbsp; i am unable to synch it with my PC.&nbsp; I have clicked on every window and followed the instructions as best as I can but still can't use it. &nbsp; When I synch it with my phone
 there is no problem.&nbsp; I have an HP PAVILION DV 3800.&nbsp;&nbsp; The VXI headset shows up as a device on my control panel but when I push the multifunction button on the headset to make it discoverable no window pops up on my PC, so I presume that it is not detecting
 it.&nbsp; Help!&nbsp; Thanks.</div>

<h2>            Epson WF 2650 IP Address issues</h2>
                    I had a laptop with Windows 7 and have been printing fine with my Epson. I got a new laptop with Windows 10 and having printer issues. I updated to the latest drivers and my printer is connected to the wireless network. When I run through the Epson set
 up, it gives me an error saying there is an IP conflict. I used the push buttons on the printer and printed out&nbsp; a connection status report and on that report, it shows the ip, subnet and gateway numbers and I clicked "Back" on the setup box on my PC and made
 sure those numbers were in there but it still wont finish setting up.&nbsp; I can start up my old laptop and it continues to print fine but I can't seem to get through the set up with the new laptop.

<p>Hi Debbie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to verify, have you tried pinging your printer's IP address, to see if it is being picked up by the network? Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>CMD</strong> on the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box to launch Command Prompt.</li><li>On the Command Prompt box, type ping &lt;printer's IP address&gt; and hit the Enter key.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what shows on the command prompt. We'll keep an eye out to your response.</p>
