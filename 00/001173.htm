    <title>Apple Pencil latency with OneNote &#43; iPad Pro 12.9&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Apple Pencil latency with OneNote &#43; iPad Pro 12.9&#34;</h2>
                    Has anyone else been frustrated by the latency with this combination when hand-writing notes? &nbsp;It's so much slower than using other note-taking apps like GoodNote and Notability that offer Apple Pencil support.<br />
<br />
This is stopping me from using OneNote since I want to be able to hand-write as quickly as I can with the other apps.

            <p>My name is not Vince. &nbsp;I'm not sure where you derived that from.<br />
<br />
The OneNote app is the latest version available on Apple's App Store. &nbsp;15.22.1 (160506 c1).<br />
<br />
I have deleted + reinstalled the app and it is still slower when handwriting that other apps are.</p>

Specifically, again, OneNote is noticeably slower when handwriting text using an Apple Pencil than other iOS apps.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is JK from OneNote Apple Engineering team. Sorry to hear that you are experiencing this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>OneNote is doing hard work behind the scenes to synchronize your data and keep them safe in the OneDrive cloud. Depending on your contents, editing, and collaboration state, this could be a complex job, and it may cause performance issues in general including
 inking and displaying pages. In order to figure out your synchronization issue, please check the following and let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Turn Off Network</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your iPad, turn on Airplane mode so that it doesn’t use the network. In doing so, we can check which area might be a root cause of performance issue.
<ol>
<li>Swipe up from the bottom of screen to open Control Center<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f65264af-ff9f-48fa-b7ff-97f9c1268b1b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f65264af-ff9f-48fa-b7ff-97f9c1268b1b" /></a></li><li>Turn on Airplane mode</li></ol>
</li><li>After turning on Airplane mode, please kill the app and relaunch.
<ol>
<li>To kill the app, double tap Home key, and swipe up OneNote</li></ol>
</li><li>If inking or opening other pages are working better after turning off network, we suggest to let OneNote complete synchronization at least one time.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong>Make sure OneNote completes initial synchronization</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In OneNote notebook menu, the last sync time is displayed.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea9853ca-6f2e-41b1-8939-c454f19415de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea9853ca-6f2e-41b1-8939-c454f19415de" /></a></li><li>If that says “Never” or more than one week ago, let OneNote complete its job once. For OneNote to complete this work, OneNote should be an active app (not in background) until it says the last sync time like above screenshot.</li></ol>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please let us know if this mitigates your issues, and let us know how it goes.</div>

<br />
I did as you suggested and turned on Airplane Mode, turn turned Bluetooth on (so that the Apple Pencil will work). &nbsp;That did not help.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
There is a small but noticeable among of lag when handwriting using the Apple Pencil. &nbsp;I can switch to another handwriting app (GoodNotes) and there is no lag.<br />
<br />
Please let me know what to try next.</span></p>

<h2>            4G LTE connection for Nokia Lumia 625 in USA</h2>
                    <p>Hai</p>
<p>I have a Nokia Lumia 625 mobile. I bought it in India. and I got "H+" connection for my mobile in India. Now i am in USA now I am unable to get the 4G LTE connection i.e., i am get an EDGE "E" signal which is too slow. When i use the sim provided by my Indian
 service provider (airtel) it has shown H+ signal in USA. But after taking T-Mobile SIM in USA it is showing only "E".</p>
<p>please Tell me how to get 4G LTE connection now......?</p>

            <p>Hi @udaykanigiri,</p>
<p>Different radio frequencies are used for mobile phones in different parts of the world, and your Lumia 625 appear not to be compatible with all of them, unfortunately = another phone is required for high-speed data to be available with T-Mobile in USA -
 and such a phone will not work for 4G LTE data in India.</p>
<p>The H+ connection is by the way not 4G LTE, it is high-speed 3G aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolved_HSPA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HSPA+</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HSPA+ may be available on your phone with another operator in USA, since your Airtel SIM is able to make a H+ connection? (Please be careful using that SIM in the US, the roaming costs may be very expensive!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a complicated puzzle. More reading is found on the Internet, i.e. the table on</p>

It's not a setting. You need to configure an email account for each email address at which point those will appear in the &lt;From&gt; dropdpwn allowing you to select a different email address.

Actually it is a setting and I finally found it.&nbsp; Account Settings/click the old email account/"reply to address".&nbsp; Just tried replying to an external gmail account and the reply address was already setup to reply to the new email account.

<h3> eschub  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t use ribbon in Excel 2013</h2>
                    I can't use certain tabs in the top ribbon in my excel workbook. &nbsp;Earlier today I couldn't press on anything in the data tab everything was greyed out and I could not do anything such as filter or sort my data in my excel workbook. &nbsp;Now the data tab is
 working but it will not let me use anything on the home tab of my excel workbook. &nbsp;This means I cannot reformat my cells, I can no longer click on the dollar sign to convert the format to currency. &nbsp;It is incredibly annoying and is drastically slowing down
 my work. &nbsp;Please help with this issue.

<p>Hello Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are navigating to the <a href="http://www.yammer.com/(domainname)/topics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.yammer.com/(domainname)/topics</a> URL and getting list of 48 topics so there are only 48 topics in your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if you are using Yammer enterprise network associated with office 365 and a verified admin on the network -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network admin -&gt; Export data -&gt; enter the start and end date -&gt; export.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the downloaded folder you will get the file as topic.csv in that you can check how many topics are there associated with your Yammer network.</p>

<p>Thanks Sushil, this has got me most of the way there. We have 161 topics on the network, so only seeing 48 on the link above is still a little odd. The download gives me virtually all of them but misses off about 9. It has got me 99% of the way there though,
 so I'll not lose sleep over the extra bit!</p>

    <title>Paragraph borders on iOS Word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Paragraph borders on iOS Word</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a bit of an annoying issue with iOS Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On desktop versions of Word, if you want to insert a dividing line, the easiest way is to type&nbsp;&nbsp;"----" + Enter. This creates a Paragraph Border under the current paragraph. If you want to remove this, you simply go to the Paragraph section and use the Borders
 button to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On iOS Worrd, doing the&nbsp;&nbsp;"----" + Enter also creates a paragraph border, but there is no Paragraph Borders option in order to remove it. So now I have a stupid dividing line stuck in my document and I can't get rid of it. It doesn't work to highlight text
 above and below it and delete it either, the line still remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            The first question you have to answer is "what has recently changed on the computer around the same time the problem was noticed?&nbsp; New programs installed, Windows updates installed, etc".<br />
<br />
ie A year ago, that problem would have been caused by installing Skype. But MS fixed that problem, if you have the most current version of skype installed.<br />
<br />
Other than that, here are some general trouble shooting techniques to help you identify the cause of your problem.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p><b>NOTE:
</b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie “send to Bluetooth”, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting process.
 Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.<br />
<br />
</p>
<b>Don’t Assume ANYTHING!</b>
<p>Don’t assume some part of the trouble shooting processes listed below doesn’t apply to you. Often there are things going on in the background that you just aren’t aware of. For example, when installing software it is all too easy to have
 an unwanted app installed if you don’t carefully read every screen. <br />

<b>Uninstall Recent Software</b>
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;

&lt;snip&gt;I found some posts on line about opening each product that was closing in safe mode and disabling the ABBYY Reader add-on.&nbsp; THis solved my problems.&nbsp; Not sure why but I disabled that add on in WORD, EXCEL, and OUTLOOK and they all work now.&nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; While I couldn't precisely say whether the problems from Office stemmed from the iCloud Panel software, I decided to uninstall the software as I don't use it anyway. After doing that, Office is now working perfectly fine. No more
 re-starting or crashing when I'm running IE at the back, nor trying to copy something in Word or Excel. It looks like the iCloud Panel software does have some compatibility issues with Office. &lt;/snip&gt;

<p>Starting in March 2012, "Skype click to Call" has been causing problems File Open problems, and Copy/Paste problems in Office Apps.
</p>
<p>The quick test for this problem is to close all open browsers. If the problem goes away it is probably Skype.</p>
<p>March 30 – MS has released an update to Skype that fixes the problem. Go to the Skype site, download and install the newest version ofc the program.<br />

<p>For anyone reading this, I figured out the problem after surfing the web for the past 3-4 weeks. Painful process. I have a paid version of Advanced SystemCare Pro, v5.2.0. 3-4 weeks ago, while scanning through it's vast offerings, I came
 across a feature I could activate called "Smart RAM". I turned it on and checked the 5 boxes it offers in the settings. The last of those 5 is "Clean Clipboard". I unchecked this box a few minutes ago and it fixed my issues. I now have no problems with copy/paste.
 Info only, it case it helps anyone.</p>

<p>&lt;snip&gt;<span>&nbsp; </span>Hi, I recently came across this problem in MS Word 2007 where after I type or hit any key on my keyboard while in the Word window, I can no longer highlight text with my mouse (by clicking once at the beginning
 of the text and dragging the mouse to the end of the text portion that I want to highlight). I have found that if I click out of the Word window and press any key on the keyboard, this seems to resolve the problem and I can finally highlight with my mouse.
 However, as soon as I type anything in the Word window again, highlighting with the mouse no longer works. Clicking on any key again within the Word window does not resolve the issue- I have to push a key outside the Word window in order to resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; Hi, I just figured out the problem. I had installed the Synergy program 1.5 weeks ago and by uninstalling it the problem appears to be resolved. Thank you both for your time and help. &nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; I had the same problem, i ran windword in safe mode successfully and disabled ABBYY FineReader 9.0 and the problem was solved as well, all is fine now and office is awesome!!&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; <span>
I ran my old Word 2010 and removed the ABBYY add-in. I didn't have to disable the whole program. I also did the "Quick Repair" and the "Online Repair" of Office 2013 Preview, but I'm pretty sure it was the add-in removal that made the difference.
</span>&lt;/snip</p>

<p>Thanks for all your help everyone.</p>
<p>As a recap:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>My Office 2010 was a Click-to-Run version</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Word suddenly giving me messages about "Downloading the Required Feature," freezing up, slowing down...</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Ultimately had to uninstall Office</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Reinstalled it from the Microsoft website with my product key, choosing the 64-bit version instead of the Click-to-Run version</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Installed all new updates from Windows Updates</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restarted computer</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Word working quickly with no messages, but became unresponsive when trying to open old files</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Went to File-&gt;Options-&gt;Add-Ins-&gt;Go-&gt; and unchecked Bluetooth.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Everything seems to be back to normal, if not better than before.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
<p>
My problem is if I copy text from a web site or from Excel, Access etc into Word all I get is a black spot.</p>
<p>
I have tried a repair install and checking all the settings against my laptop - where this function works properly.
</p>
<p>The problem is caused by a defective Bluetooth add-in for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, turn off the Com Addin.</p>
<p><b><span>Additional Notes:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The defective Bluetooth add-in is usually installed by a Bluetooth driver. (In my case - Intel Centrino Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed Adaptor (v1.1))</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Updating your Bluetooth driver (or reverting to an older version) may also resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Unfortunately simply disabling the add-in through the Word options may result in a 3 second freeze when loading Word 2007. (If this is a problem, changing to a different bluetooth driver version may be the better option)</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Oddly enough, this ended up being the cause of my problem. I had an older print driver installed on my Win7 machine and once I removed that driver, Word started working without any problems!</p>
<p>You can delete individual printer drivers by going into the registry. Note that simply going to Printers and Faxes and deleting a printer there does not delete the printer driver.</p>
<p>Follow <strong><span>Step 3</span></strong> in my previous post about a printer error to remove the printer drivers:</p>

<p>
<span>Here is a truely Off-the-wall solution that is in the same class as bad RAM and bad Video Cards</span></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; My problem turned out to be related to the WYSE thin clients we were using to connect to the Win 2008 R2 Terminal servers.&nbsp; The software that allows/enhances use of dual screens called WYSE TXC Multi-Display v1.2.1.7 was causing
 the applications to crash (including IE 9 32bit).&nbsp; Once this software was disabled - The errors stopped.</p>
<p>I have a feeling this software doesn't like Windows Server 2008 R2.&nbsp; It was being used successfully on Server 2003.&nbsp; I have seen a&nbsp; few other posts on Google for people searching for an updated version without success. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<p>
<i>Office 2013 instead.&nbsp; I am having problems with Excel, Word and Outlook printing to two separate HP laserjet printers, models 1522nf and model 3015.&nbsp; I can print one file from these applications.&nbsp; The second file locks up the Excel, Word or Outlook
 program and the only solution that I have found is to close out of the program.&nbsp; If I restart my computer, I can then print one file beofre it locks up again.&nbsp; This only happens with my HP Laserjet Printers.&nbsp; I have a HP Officejet 8600 printer that does not&nbsp;have
 any problems printing in Office 2013 Excel, Word or Outlook.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both of my Laserjet printers will print anything on Internet Exployer or non Office based programs without any issues.&nbsp; I have downloaded the latest drivers for these printers and looked for any
 latest updates to Office 2013 and made sure that I had the most recent.</i></p>
<p>I installed the printer driver Vista version for my HP Laserjet 1522 and that fixed the problem with the Spolling / Cache issue with Office 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Buy and HP via phone could not come up with this answer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks again!</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<b>Starting point when Word does something unexpected</b>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word, any version, go to Tools and then Options and study all the settings on all the tabs. You may even find some settings that
 you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If you're wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each time
 the answer was, "I'd use a Word table." By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>

<h3> todd pierzina  say:</h3>
<h2>            AT&#38;T Tilt &#40;HTC&#41; WM6, XP SP3, ActiveSync 4.5&#58; USB code 43</h2>
                    Been using Tilt with XP SP2 since 12/07, no ActiveSync problems.<br />
<br />
Had hard drive failure on Dell Latitude D820 last week, had to start from a blank XP install.&nbsp; Installed XP SP3 as part of that process.&nbsp; Downloaded ActiveSync 4.5 from Microsoft and installed.<br />
<br />
First time trying to connect, I set up a new partnership and synchronized, which proceeded to hang.&nbsp; Subsequent tries yielded no connection, as other people have been reporting.&nbsp; I turned off the Advanced Network Functionality and removed all traces of partnership
 from device and computer (if there even was one, I don't remember).&nbsp; Many soft-resets and boots.&nbsp; Uninstalled AS, re-installed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I can't even get Win XP to recognize the device at all now.&nbsp; The device shows a "Connect To `USB" dialog, Connecting to Host, until it powers off.&nbsp; In Device Manager under iIndows CE USB Devices, the HTC USB Sync entry has the yellow exclamation.&nbsp; Under Properties/General
 I see "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"; the Driver main tab shows HTC USB Sync, Microsoft 10/6/2004 4.0.3232.0; Driver Details says C:\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\wceusbsh.sys, provider Microsoft, version 4.5.5086.<br />
<br />
On My Computer I see an entry for Mobile Device, but drilling in yields nothing.&nbsp; Safely Remove Hardware shows no trace of the phone.<br />
<br />
If I toggle the Advanced net functionality, device manager shows a network driver (Windows Mobile Device #n) with the yellow exclamation, but no network connection shows up in Network Connections.<br />
<br />
Help!<br />

            I had tried this before too, but I did it again just now.&nbsp; Here's what I see:<br />
<ol>
<li>Uninstall works fine.&nbsp; During this time my phone still says "Connecting to Host".
</li><li>A run Add Hardware Wizard, it finds the HTC USB Sync. </li><li>The balloons on my tray say "Found new hardware: USB device" then "Found: HTC USB Sync" then "Found: Your device is ready to use". I'm paraphrasing, but the gist is "all is good".
</li><li>The Add Hardware Wizard shows the "Completing" page and lists the HTC USB Sync as a "device installed".&nbsp; But the icon for it includes the yellow exclamation point.
</li><li>I click Finish and everything is [not] working just like before.</li></ol>
Dangit!&nbsp; I should point out, I've made no changes on the phone during this time, and it was synchronizing just fine up until I got the new hard drive.<br />

<p>There are some updated HTC drivers that maybe you don't have. The problem is that you won't be offered them by Windows Update unless you have the device hooked to the computer when you run Windows Update. Try hooking
 up the Tilt by USB, go to Windows Update, find available updates, and see if any are HTC. If there are, delete the Tilt from Device Manager and redetect.

            Thanks for the suggestion, hadn't thought of that.&nbsp; But, no luck.<br />
<br />
I tried it two ways: from regular "Microsoft Update" and from within the Device Manager's Update Driver button on the device's properties page.&nbsp; The former found some printer and monitor drivers, the latter said "could not find any newer versions."<br />
<br />
While both were running, I made sure the phone stayed on and it showed the "Connecting to Host" dialog.<br />

            Not using a hub, no.<br />
<br />
Yes, I did try several different ports yesterday, although not today.&nbsp; Good point--I'll use the port my mouse is plugged into right now to ensure that it's good.&nbsp; Okay...just tried, no difference.&nbsp; Dangit.<br />
<br />
On that same tack, my cable has been sitting on my desk unmolested, so I don't think it could've gotten damaged (i.e., I didn't try jamming it into some strange receptacle or anything).&nbsp; Same with my phone--I've not used any new cables that might've damaged
 the plug.<br />

            I disabled my Symantec Endpoint Protection yeserday but did not do so today.&nbsp; I just did try disabling everything (Antivirus/Antispyware, Proactive Threat and Network Threat), and I retried the uninstall/add hardware sequence, and the behavior is still
 identical.&nbsp; Dangit.&nbsp; [With the advanced net functionality disabled, could Symantec be interfering?&nbsp; I didn't think it would care about USB devices.&nbsp; I based that on zero knowledge of anything, of course.]<br />
<br />
This is an excellent question though, as my AV is different than on my old build.&nbsp; Our IT guy asked me if I wanted to try out the new version and I said, sure, why not, it's a fresh XP build so what could possibly go wrong?<br />
<br />
I did look at Symantec's site for any known issues but didn't see anything.&nbsp; Of course I don't really know what to look for either.<br />
<br />
Tonight I will bring my cable home and try to connect to my desktop (XP, I think it's still SP2).&nbsp; I never connected it there before so it should be a good "clean" test.&nbsp; If it DOES work there but not on my laptop...well, I don't know what I'll do.&nbsp; If it DOES
 NOT work there, I'll try a different cable at the AT&amp;T store.&nbsp; Then I guess it's hardware, huh?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Security Installation Error 0x80070643 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yennie_t  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Security Installation Error 0x80070643</h2>
                    Hello! I have Windows 7. So I recently uninstalled MSE to download Kaspersky because the same trojans kept coming back after being removed with MSE (trojandownloader.rotten.tu or something like that). Kaspersky didn't do well so I uninstalled it. I decided
 to redownload MSE because it can alteast clear some of the bad stuff on my laptop, but the error 0x80070643 kept popping up. I've read some threads regarding this error. They mostly all said to go to your previous back up and or download a program in which
 uninstalls all the components of the program. I never really backed up my laptop to go to the previous back up and I already downloaded a program that uninstalls other programs. The removal program couldn't detect anything that needed to be removed. Restarting
 my laptop doesn't help with this error. Maybe I missed a thread that fixes this problem? If I did, the link would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!!

                    I have a database with multiple tables. I made a form which contains fields from multiple tables. I was changing something in the property sheet and I accidentally changed whatever was in the Form - Control Source.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can not find any tutorials or help articles anywhere that tell me how to fill that field in again. I found one totally useless MS help article that said if you need to have multiple sources click the query button and run a query. That's it. Doesn't say
 what to do from there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I created a new form as a test and grabbed fields from multiple tables and then looked at it's control source. It had every field referenced like so:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>SELECT [Competitive Books].[Book Title], [Competitive Books].[Wordcount], [Competitive Books].[Diagrams], [Online Purchasing].[Amazon US Price] FROM [Competitive Books] INNER JOIN [Online Purchasing] ON [Competitive Books].[Book ID] =[Online Purchasing].[Book
 ID];</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have 50+ fields on this form. Is there anyway to write that control source stuff up there so that it will allow all fields from the Competitive Books and the Online Purchasing tables (for example, I actually have 5 tables the fields are coming from).
 Or can I change individual fields? The majority come from Competitive Books, only about 10 come from the other tables, I could assign those individually but I've tried and it doesn't seem possible.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please please please someone help me.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <p>I think you are mixing your sources&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A form or report&nbsp;has a RECORD source that is either a table name, a query name or an SQL statement (which is a SELECT query).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Controls (text box, etc.) on a form or report have a CONTROL source that can be the name of a column (field) in the form/report's record source or an expression.&nbsp; You can type the name or expression directly into the control source property.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Just for completeness, combo and list box controls also have a ROW source that can be the name of a table, the name of a query or an SQL statement.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your form based on a query with multiple tables in its FROM clause is very likely to be read only and not useful for entering or editing data into the tables, which is fine in most reports.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For normal operations a form, you should have a separate form for each table.&nbsp;&nbsp;These forms can be used as subforms within other forms to display and edit data in related tables.&nbsp; I think this may be the crux of your problem and the first thing you need to
 do.&nbsp; Set the competitive books form's record source&nbsp;to&nbsp;a query (with sorting) based only on the CompetitiveBooks table.&nbsp; Create a purchasing form with its record source to a query based on the OnlinePurchasing table.&nbsp; Then Drag and Drop the purchasing form
 from the objects list onto the&nbsp;competitive books form and&nbsp;set the subform <em><strong>control</strong></em>'s LinkMaster/Child properties to the BookID fields.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you have just started to use Access and only&nbsp;beginning to learn&nbsp;how to use a wizard to create things, be warned that the wizards only go a little way to get things started.&nbsp; Your question kind of implies that you have already reached a limit in what they
 can do to make things easy.&nbsp; When you start to get confused or can't figure out how to do something in a wizard, get out of the wizard and work in the form's design view where you can specify and manipulate everything.</p>

            As Marshall has said, you need to understand your terms better. A Form has a Recordsource, not a Controlsource. Controls have Controlsources.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>A form's Recordsource can be either a table, query or a SQL SELECT statement. The help article actually was helpful to people with more knowledge than you. If you go to the property dialog, select Form in the combo at the top, then click the ellipses next
 to the Recordsource property, it will open Query Design mode. There you can use the query grid to construct a SQL statement that pulls in all the fields you want on your form. You will need to create the proper Joins in that SQL statement otherwise the form
 will not display data correctly. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As Marshall also noted, such a Recordsource will most likely render the form uneditable. That's fine if you just want to use the form for viewing data. But a better way to deal with multiple tables is via the use of subforms. Create a main form bound to
 one table and then embed subforms linked on your key fields. This is especially important if you have one to many relationships between your main table and the others. The subforms can display multiple matching records.&nbsp;</div>

            I'm having the worst computer luck today. My chrome just crashed and I lost the reply I had typed out here to you so I apologize if I miss something.
<div><br />
<div>First THANK YOU. I took a course and have this book and I don't recall any mention of subforms.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>2nd, in your last paragraph you mention about wizard vs design view. I am working in design view. In the form, in design view, in Property Sheet, under Selection type: Form, Data tab, Record Source: ________ this is where that code was that I accidentally
 deleted. That code I put in my original question post is what is in that field in the sample form I made so I imagine the code I deleted, had 50+ controls individually listed in it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not quite sure what you mean when you talk about the limits of the wizard vs design view. I mean obviously there are limits :) But I am working in design view so I'm not sure they apply to me.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So subforms, for sure from here on out. But, is there any way to fix the form I currently have or do I have to scrap it and start over? My original question still applies: Is there any way to populate that Record Source field in a way that it will allow
 controls from multiple tables without having to manually write out every single table field (as in that code I pasted in)?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the image I attached the controls with green triangles are not working but the controls without the triangles are because I set the Form Record Source as the most used table and those controls come from that table. Before, all of it worked.</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7ea9d29-d908-4d20-ba87-c4f486478b68" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>Start over? Or fix?</div>
<div><br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>It is usually easier to first create a query that retrieves the records and fields you need to see in a form.&nbsp; Then set the form's RecordSource&nbsp;<em><strong>property</strong></em> (not field) to the name of the query.&nbsp; If you are only going to view, not enter/edit
 existing data, then your original query as posted in your question can be used (Coy/Paste can be your friend).&nbsp; You can then use the form's design view to click on a text box and type the name of the query&nbsp;<strong><em>field</em></strong> in the text box's
 ControlSource <em><strong>property</strong></em>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once you have specified the form's RecordSource, there is also the Field List you can activate.&nbsp; Then you&nbsp; drag and drop a field from the list onto the form and automatically create the text box and its attached label.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>OTOH, you can take the next step and create a form for the purchases with the purchases table&nbsp;fields' text boxes and drop this form onto the books form.&nbsp; I think this will end up being far superior to rebuilding your original form, primarily because you
 can use it to both read and write data values.&nbsp; Another potentially big benefit is that you can set the purchases form to display as a continuous subform with multiple rows, one for each purchase.</p>

            <p>The Controls with the green triangles indicate that they are bound (have controlsources) not listed in the Recordsource.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As Marshall said, its better to create your query first, then use it as the Recordsource of your form. And I prefer using the Wizard to create the initial form, then move into Design view to adjust the layout.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Subforms are a major feature of Access and you really need to start using them to make effective forms.</p>

    <title>Bing Account Getting Suspended Without Specific Reason - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> howard w dawson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bing Account Getting Suspended Without Specific Reason</h2>
                    <p>I had created an account 3-4 days back ensuring that none of the information on the account is incorrect and made sure to provide the exact information mentioned on the payment method. My card got attached and I had created just 1 campaign and it got approved
 and everything was running smoothly on the account till the time just 1 campaign was running. The very next day I created 3 more campaigns in which the ads had gone under "Pending Editorial Review" and got approved within 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while when I was trying to login into the account, I got a message on the screen stating "Your account has been blocked or suspended and please contact support for further help". There was an appeal button which I immediately filled in and got a
 response within 20-25 minutes that my account has been closed permanently and this issue has been taken seriously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I immediately opened up the support page and started chatting with support executive and told him/her (not sure as displayed name was Cha) the whole story and also told that I had appealed through that form online and this is the message which I have received
 and I was told that let me check it and I was allowed to appeal again with the same information being shared with the support executive which was filled online as well. I told the support executive that the website which I am trying to promote has been running
 successful on Google as well and these are the keywords on which it can be checked and request the executive to mention this under "Additional Information" for the account specialist to check it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I got an email with the same response mentioning those 4 reasons which is sent to everyone who faces the same issue. My concern is:</p>
<p>1) The same website which is being advertised on my account is being advertised by other advertisers also and they have been running it successfully without any issues.</p>
<p>2) We being small advertisers are not allowed to advertise the same way other advertisers are doing it or are we under the category considered as "Low Grade" and are getting blocked.</p>
<p>3) We are being considered as people who can be ignored randomly as compared to the executives of those big companies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all know that Google has been generating more than 80% revenue from advertising and Microsoft has different verticals and this is not&nbsp; their main source of income. Is this the reason the advertisers are being treated in such a way and are being taken
 for granted or is it something else which support executives are reluctant to tell us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My service request no: SRX1470649220ID</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can request you guys and&nbsp; the management of Microsoft advertising to find out a way to improvise the system in such a way that instead of blocking the access to the account, a person should be given an opportunity to rectify the mistake(intentionally/unintentionally)
 which he has made on the account and get back to business with an assurance that if this gets reiterated, we will suspend the account again. Blocking or suspending the account without giving any attempt to rectify the mistake will only worsen the situation
 of the advertiser and also if we can get a more specific reason for the account getting blocked will only give the advertisers a glimmer of hope to successfully advertise on Microsoft bing as well.</p>

<h2>            How to scale user interface objects in Publisher 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't use publisher at all because user interface doesn't scale properly&nbsp;on my monitor. For example,&nbsp;&nbsp;when I try to "format auto shape" it opens up&nbsp;a box - but it is too large and I can not click buttons on the bottom of&nbsp;it and therefore I can't do anything
 for those objects. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So quick question: how can I scale the size of user interface objects in publisher?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the problem in windows 8.1&nbsp;or in Publisher 2013?&nbsp;&nbsp;My screen resolution is 2560 x 1440, could it be the reason behind this problem?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tuomas&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I found one solution:&nbsp; to be able to use publisher I had to decrease the size of&nbsp;all items&nbsp; from 200% to 150%&nbsp;. Now I can use publisher but the cost is the inconvenience of having too small desktop objects...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to have separate scaling for office programs - if someone knows how to do ii, I'd be glad to know.</p>

            I guess what you found could&nbsp;be the solution for now. Office display varies according your&nbsp;OS settings.<br />
<br />
You could probably send feedback to microsoft to have separate scaling for office programs.<br />

            <p>You do know that you can left click the header and drag a dialog box around the screen which may allow you to see the buttons?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is one of the negatives of super high resolution screens. It can result in objects and especially text being so small as to be hard to work with. My old eyes especially have problems with the small text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do have the option of zooming the actual Publisher work page to way more than 100% so at least you can see the design and layout details.</p>

            <p>Thanks DavidF2 and TeK Knight for your advices!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the dragging doesn't help - with +200 % scaling in windows the dialog box in publisher is larger than my screen and so I can't get those buttons on the bottom of the dialog box to fit on my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I sent feedback&nbsp;to Microsoft - hopefully they come up with some neat idea to fix this scaling issue some day. Separate scaling for office programs&nbsp;and windows would be nice. But for now, I can easily live with smaller scaling in windows.</p>
<p>

            I have this same issue with Windows 10 (3200 x 1800 resolution) and Publisher 2013. The Format Text Box is larger than the screen, and I am unable to drag it far enough up to see the OK/Save button. I tried other resolution settings, but could not solve
 this issue. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

            I was able to work around this by going to the Windows 10 Display Settings (right click on the desktop) and moving the slider in the first choice "Change the size of text apps and other items" In my case because of my HD screen it was set at the recommended
 250%. Moving it to 225% solved the problem. Depending on your screen, you might have to move to a smaller number.&nbsp; It does make the text in menus very small but it's easy enough to change back again for using other programs - although for it to take effect
 in some programs, you may need to restart the computer.<br />

            Hi Pverma,<br />
<br />
Here are the answers to your questions:<br />
<br />
1. <em>What are the usage report functionality for MS team ? What are the reporting capabilities that a manager/admin can use to query the usage of Teams users?</em><br />
The feature is not available.<br />
<br />
2. <em>possible to increasing the limit for number of members in a team/ private chat, etc</em><br />
It’s not feasible.<br />
<br />
3. <em>Possibility on customizing tools box (remove files icon, etc) -- Explanation: Is it possible to customize the toolbar on the left-hand-side of teams? For example, can they remove the "Files" icon?</em><br />
From my knowledge, it’s not doable.<br />
<br />
4. <em>Possibility to record live meetings within Teams?</em><br />
When you join a Skype for Business meeting from Microsoft Teams, you can choose to use Skype for Business Web App or desktop client. If you use Skype for Business Web App, it’s not feasible to record the meeting. If you use Skype for Business desktop client,
 you can normally record the meeting.<br />
<br />
5. <em>Ability for users to join/leave</em> <em>Teams</em> -- <em>Explanation: Is it possible for a user to "choose" to join a team, interact and later on remove himself from the team?</em><br />
Only the team owner can add a user as member of the team. However, if a user was added to a team, he can simply choose to leave the team by right-clicking the team and choosing Leave the team.<br />
<br />
6. <em>Archiving MSFT Teams</em> -- <em>Explanation: What kind of archiving options are available for a "team" in Microsoft Teams?</em><br />
Archiving is not available at this point.<br />
<br />
As what Vincent suggested, for those feature are not available, please kindly share your comments via:

    <title>I need a macro to create chart on separate sheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silvercoyote  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need a macro to create chart on separate sheet</h2>
                    <p>I can record a macro easily enough to place a chart on the same sheet as its source data, using a template. But how do I get the macro to place that chart on a different (specified) sheet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the macro that Excel records:</p>
<p>
<br />
Sub ChartMacroTest()<br />
'<br />
' ChartMacroTest Macro<br />
'<br />
<br />
'<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Range("N19:R124").Select<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveSheet.Shapes.AddChart.Select<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveChart.ApplyChartTemplate ( _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "/Users/me/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/Chart Templates/Stock chart.crtx" _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; )<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveChart.SetSourceData Source:=Range("SourceSheet!$N$19:$R$124")<br />
End Sub
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I presume I must replace the line &nbsp;ActiveSheet.Shapes.AddChart.Select &nbsp;with something that starts &nbsp;Sheets("NameofNewSheet").Select &nbsp;— but then I get into syntax issues beyond my limited knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>All you need to do is to tell Excel the name of the sheet you want near the beginning of your code. For example, right beofre you select the range you could put:</p>

            <p>Thanks for your suggestion, Jim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the &nbsp;Sheets("Sheet2").Select &nbsp;line the macro does indeed start to make a chart on the selected sheet. But it stops after making the chart's frame, blank in the middle, and gives me this run-time error message: "The specified dimension is not valid for
 the current chart type."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Odd, as the template works on its own, just not as part of the macro.&nbsp;<span>o have a workaround, an old macro that builds most features of my chart, step by step, on the intended sheet. I've been using that
 and then manually applying my template to the resulting chart, giving me the finished versio</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's not the end of the world, as I have an old macro that builds most of the chart's features, step by step. It's then a matter of manually applying my template after running the macro. It's just ungainly, as the template can do most of what the macro is
 doing — short of putting the chart on the right sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a further idea naturally I would appreciate it, but I can live with running the old macro and then applying the template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, many thanks for your help..</p>

<p>
</p><p><em>"The problem occurs whenever the default chart type is set to other chart types than the ones you are trying to create. For an example, if you try to create line chart and if the default chart in Excel is OHLC (Candlestick Stock Chart) then Excel will
 be fast to complain "The specified dimension is not valid for the current chart type". The same occurs even if you try to create charts from .NET. Hence, first of all change the default chart type to some basic chart types like Line charts. The problem will
 be solved."</em></p>

            Thanks, Jim. I'll have to delve further. It looks as if I'll be re-recording/writing my macro. The existing macro creates the same kind of chart as the template but with fewer features. There must be an incompatibility though.

<h2>            Malware Asked me to Call a Number</h2>
                    <p>Purchased a used MS Surface Pro.&nbsp; My wife brought it to me with a message that it was being locked out by MS because of a threat.&nbsp; The URL for the message appeared to be MS Support so I called the number.&nbsp; Ended up with a company called Adeeba E. Service
 and Cloud 7 Services.&nbsp; I watched as the technician ran Net User which showed about a dozen network connections, some active and some idle.&nbsp; Paid the fee for clean up - which he did.&nbsp; When I run Net User now myself there are no additional connections.&nbsp; I have
 done a complete scan with Defender and it does not show any threats.&nbsp; Is this company legitimate and/or do I need to take some additional actions?</p>

I'm waiting too, too much.<br />

Beginning to think that your decision is one in order not to contrast the carriers mobile, but not forgotten your customers that they could it are not satisfied .<br />
