<h2>            Don&#39;t get options to compress or uncompress files</h2>
                    The instructions to compress a file say to right click on a zipped file and choose "extract all" and to compress a file to right click and choosed "send to" then choose compressed folder".&nbsp; I don't get those options.

<p>If that doesn't work, then there may be something wrong with your system files and we'll need to do a full troubleshooting of your system - and that could take some time.</p>
<p><span><span>If you can't get Vista compression/decompression to work properly despite these instructions, you might want to just try downloading and installing 7-Zip
<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.7-zip.org/</a>&nbsp;</span><span>which provides essentially the same functionality in a free, easy-to-use program (expecially if you aren't concerned with NTFS compression and just want
 to open or create a zip file now and then).&nbsp; Many people use this program (or others like it) instead of Vista's program for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; I use 7-Zip myself (though I also use Vista's programs - it depends on the situation).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you decide you want to try the full troubleshooting, here are some of the steps (the initial ones):</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning compression (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools
 / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>25-30 Day wait after account info change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vsf bionarchy  say:</h3>
<h2>            25-30 Day wait after account info change</h2>
                    <p>So recently i went through a hardship and was forced to change the phone number on my account. I only discovered that after changing my phone number and&nbsp; trying to make a purchase on the xbox store(Web site from PC). I needed the security code Microsoft texts to the&nbsp;cell phone. Since i changed phone number on the account the store and every other Microsoft based store will not let me purchase for the next 30 days. However i can still access my account and play my existing games so not all is lost. Being concerned by this overly long wait time i called and found out that there is no way for Microsoft to speed up this process.<br /><br />I understand that Microsoft is trying to prevent account theft,&nbsp;But there has to be&nbsp;a much better way of going about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>30 days seems a bit much to wait, 7 days would be more realistic and lets face it with every one owning smart phones and the many&nbsp;of mail apps you can use for outlook. You would think some one

            <p>Personally I've never had to change anything so&nbsp;I haven't had to go through the wait, but it's ridiculous. I'm with you that I understand it's a security thing, but 30 days is way too long. I don't know of any other service that makes you wait that long after making account changes.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for the support, A fact to be pointed out here.
</p>
<p>If some one hacks a account and charges some ones credit card for game purchases Microsoft has the ability to refund the entire transaction in real time.
</p>
<p>Also to be pointed out iv had games in the past refunded because they were&nbsp;botched or i didn't like them days even weeks went by and still no issue. At no&nbsp;point in time has Microsoft challenged the request or even question it
</p>
<p>for that matter. They just did it and said have a nice day, So if this is the case why 30 days to wait for some basic info to be changed like my phone number.
</p>
<p>There is no point to such a long wait and then say oh&nbsp;yeah BTW we are a business but we wont let you spend money its for your safety.&nbsp; Altho you can prove who you are in many different ways including &nbsp;registered serial numbers&nbsp;
or how about my Bank transaction numbers in my bank account from purchasing games from Microsoft. But for your safety this automated system is going to make you wait 25-30 days because that will prove who you are...<br /></p>

            <p>I understand your frustration of having to wait that long, but you can prevent that from happening in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, add several pieces of security information to your account. For example a secondary email, another phone number etc.&nbsp;</p><p>That way, if you lose access to your phone number, you can fall back to the secondary email or a landline phone number.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, a very good method is to add Two Step Verification to your security proofs at <a href="https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage</a></p><p>After adding Two Step Verification, set up a free Authenticator App on your smartphone.&nbsp;</p><p>With that authenticator app, you can verify ownership of your account, even if you don't have access to your email, or your smartphone has no reception.&nbsp;</p><p>The more security proofs you add to your account, the more fallbacks you have if you lose access to any given other security

            <p>According to the Supervisor and the Agent on second call back that there is nothing i could have done to safeguard against this. The only reason being is because i changed my phone number, And as stated last time the representatives on the phone&nbsp;were very professional so i do not doubt their word. "That this is a automated system that every one is subject to when you change your phone number." @ArminatorX&nbsp;</p><p>Im truly shocked that a company as big as this has such a questionable system.</p>
<p>Microsoft is doing a very good job with their games and systems, However there is allot to improve on and im sure in time that these&nbsp;problems will be&nbsp;fixed.</p>

Like ArminatorX said in a previous post you can have multiple security proofs and as long as you have access to at least ONE of these you do not have to wait the 30 days but because you did not have access to the ONE security proof that you had on the account but had access to the email and password there is the 30 day waiting period.</p><p><br /></p><p>Be glad that you had access to the email and password because if you forgot your password and didnt have access to the security proof there would be a lot more hurdles that you would have to go through to try and reset your password.</p

    <title>Remote desktop and mapped network drive within home network - - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remote desktop and mapped network drive within home network - sometimes doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all on my home network - both PCs are local to each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Win 8.1 PC which hosts all my media and documents, which I connect to via remote desktop and share a drive on the network. It has no monitor, so remote desktop is my main method of access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very occasionally, I will turn it on and be unable to connect to it or the mapped drive. In fact my main PC (Win 7) cannot find it on the network anywhere. But it IS on the network - I can connect via my mobile using Splashtop and I can also connect via
 TeamViewer from the main PC. This is not a solution though as I need to be able to access the shared drive on my main PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both PCs use Bitdefender. Makes no difference with the BD firewall temporarily turned off. As I mentioned, sometimes it connects fine with no issues and sometimes it can't find it. In these situations, I can't even ping the Media PC's IP address (timeout),
 nor can the Media PC ping the main PC. It can, obviously, ping the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually a restart of the Media PC fixes this (although, that's annoying) - but today it isn't. The error that I get is 'The network path was not found' and for remote desktop 'Remote Desktop can't find the computer 'MediaServer". This might mean it does
 not belong to the specified network ..." etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also thought it work mentioning that this is what comes up when using the net use command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Status &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Local &nbsp; &nbsp; Remote &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Network<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Unavailable &nbsp;X: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\MediaServer\D &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft Windows Network<br />
The command completed successfully.<br />
</p>
<p>If I then muck around with deleting the share and reconnecting, it will sometimes reconnect. Today - no, can't find the network path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>
</p><p>That was a without a separate firewall. Myself I think it's a windows bug that has never been fixed.

<h2>            &#61;KoG&#61; Recruiting&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I'm SAINT JAMEZ911 and I'm the leader of =KoG=. I'm here because we are recruiting and need some more community members. We aren't MLG, we are just a group of friendly players from across the world looking to grow and find more players like us.
 First things first, we are a Multi-platform clan, not just Xbox so there is room for everyone! =KoG= Stands for Kingdom of Gamers, and in our little Kingdom we believe in respect and fairness, We play to have fun but that doesn't mean we aren't good. Hopefully
 after we grow we may have a MLG team, but for now we are just a bunch of buddy's playing for fun. =KoG= has an Xbox 360 branch leader, meaning this one person is in charge of =KoG='s Xbox Live community and represents it. This person is Pesci Monster (that
 is his Gamer Tag). So feel free to message him and friend request him, or you can message me as well. We play all kinds of games, so anyone is welcome!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few things about =KoG= you should know is that we are doing are best to grow, so anyone can invite new members to the site. All members need to apply for the clan though. We will most likely accept all applications though, after it is voted on anyways.
 Really the only time your application may not meet our requirements is if you have cheated. We don't take to kindly to that. We do have a clan website through another company that website is http://kingdomofgamers.freeforums.org/portal.php
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check us out, join the forum and get to know us! Also just a side note, when registering to our forum please avoid the adds. Sense we are going through Freeforums.org we have to pay to get rid of them and we have yet to make the money to do so. Just a heads
 up! Also after your register there with be a cell phone number conformation code, Ignore it and scroll to the bottom. Anyways Thanks for giving this a look over, hope to see you on the forums!</p>

<p>There's no Enable/Disable button when I right click on Plug and Play services, I could only find Restart, Stop, Resume etc. Tried Restart and Stop options, both didn't work.</p>

<p>Win 10 does not recognise it at all - there is nothing at device manager or administrative tools. Tryed to uninstal usb drivers - did not help. Win USB troubleshooter says usb controller is in failed state or is not currently installed at one of the PC,
 at another one it does not find any issues, but PC still did not see my flash device.</p>
<p>Both of the win10 PC see other usb 2.0 and 3.0 storage devices.</p>

<p>Do the two Win10 PCs have only USB 3.0 ports, or have you tried the drive with USB 2.0 ports on them too? Can you check whether the BIOS/UEFI settings on the two PCs displays the drive at least?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked the manufacturer's site for both PCs for BIOS and driver updates? Is Windows updated on both too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you format the drive on the Win7 PC as NTFS then does it show up on any of the PCs by any chance?</p>

            <p>hello! thank you for an answer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two have got usb 3.0 only, there is nothing I could find in the bios/uefi. BIOS and windows are both up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried to format to NTFS - no changes, an indicator flashes once and that's it - nothing more, could not discover it anywhere.</p>
<p>I purchased it yesterday and it did work only once at win10 I've inserted it at first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contacted sandisk as well, waiting for an answer from their side too.</p>

            <p>What types of PCs are these two? Does the manufacturer have any USB 3.0 drivers available on their site? If so do install those (and any chipset drivers too) to replace MS' generic driver that may not be working properly on the two systems.</p>

            Strange how it was working with the Win7 PC then. Anyway, let's see how the replacement fares.

            Hi Ahmad, my name is Max and I'm an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />It is impossible that the PIN will work if blocked. You have to get in touch with the Mobile operator to get the PIN unblocking key (PUK code). Please refer to the article Cellular and SIM settings in Windows 10 Mobile, Unblock SIM PIN

<p>I just burned a CD with absolutely no problems at all.&nbsp; Using the same type of CD, brand new, I attempted to burn another CD and got this error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Media Player cannot burn the files. If the burner is busy, wait for the current task to finish. If necessary, verify that the burner is connected properly and that you have installed the latest device driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've shut down all programs running, restarted my computer, changed the burn speed under the devices tab...everything I knew to do and all the things I've read through these forums, no such luck...still getting the exact same message.&nbsp; Any clue why my CD
 burner has decided to just stop working for me?</p>

<p>Hello, thanks for the follow up.</p>
<p>The system resolved itself.&nbsp; Here's how:&nbsp;&nbsp; after dealing with the issue for several hours I finally turned off the computer in frustration&nbsp;to go to bed for the evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; The updates would download but refused to install.&nbsp; Five minutes later I looked at
 the screen and the updates were installing!&nbsp; Issue resolved.</p>

            <p>You can continue to use it, even when you graduate. But if you were to format and need to reinstall the software and don't have the product key, you will not be able to use it anymore or recover the key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Have a backup copy of the installation files.</p>
<p>- Most important, have a backup copy of the product key which you can use to reinstall the software and reactivate by telephone if necessary.</p>

</div>
<div>I have Windows 8 32 bit that came with my laptop.</div>
<div>The problem is that when ever i plug in a pendrive into my laptop all the files in the drive turn into shortcut files.</div>
<div>The target is command prompt that initiates the opening of the folders(in a new window) and files.</div>
<div>When i directly type the path EX: " F:\folder\ " the folder opens normally.</div>
<div>This problem is not just with my pendrive.</div>
<div>It happens with all the pendrives i insert.</div>
<div>This is making taking copies of my data difficult.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What is the cause of this problem and how to rectify it????</div>
<div>Is this a malware or virus??</div>
<div>I have windows defender in my laptop and avast in my desktop.</div>
<div>Both don't detect any problems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Pls help.</div>

<h2>            enable keyboard to wake computer from sleep</h2>
                    <p>This was only an error following Windows 10 Anniversary Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;laptop is a&nbsp;Compaq Presario C500, upgraded successively from Vista (with only one minor sound driver bug experienced on the way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error - the keyboard does not work following&nbsp;waking the laptop from sleep mode (a reboot is required to&nbsp;reset the keyboard).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching the Web the solution[1] is to enable the following flag (a tick box):</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Device Manager &gt; Keyboards &gt; Standard 101/102-Key or Microsoft Natural PS/2 Keyboard with HP QLB &gt; Properties &gt; Power Management &gt; Allow this device to&nbsp;wake the computer</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">The problem is that once the driver properties dialogue is closed the setting reverts to its default setting of unticked.</p>

    <title>win10 clean installation fail. Just a moment. Can&#39;t finish - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> per christian lokke  say:</h3>
<h2>            win10 clean installation fail. Just a moment. Can&#39;t finish installation. Defaultuser0. Reboot loop.</h2>
                    <p>Hi from Norway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technical specifications. Acer Switch 10E SW3-016 10.1-inch Laptop (Atom x5-Z8300/2GB/62GB/Windows 10 Home/Integrated Graphics)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After about a year it slowed down to be nearly not useful. so i decided too rollback windows. no noticeable difference.<br />
I did a reinstall with saving files. i did a reinstall deleting files using the preinstalled Windows. No difference.<br />
So i downloaded Media creation tool on another computer, with the usb media option. (I have also tried the download iso file.)<br />
<br />
I have done much reading and tried a lot of fixes. Don't work for me. and no, I have no USB hardware such as keyboard<br />
connected, no wifi obviously... I have tried to take out the battery. <br />
<br />
Have tried shift+F10 ; Open dos window .&nbsp; oobe/msoobe. MGR,&nbsp; no system tool, users in the<br />
Norwegian windows. I have tried repair from USB disk. All the options. Yes, I know how to set correct boot order. Have disabled
<br />
secureboot. I have played around with the Bios. (should not be necessary since windows worked on the PC, just slow.<br />
No error to my SSD HD (checked). I have read the srt file logg of failures. All but first &lt;0&gt;.<br />
<br />
I have tried repair from boot. (Turn the pc off twice and it will boot to system repair with some more options. Tested.<br />
I have tried deleting default user from dos, inactivate him/ her. Started admin. (net user administrator etc) Tried to
<br />
make new user ( net user "name" password etc..). And some more obscure dos editing.<br />
<br />
problem 1: ""Windows could not finish configuring the system"."<br />
<br />
problem 2: "Wait a moment". To be sure I let the pc overnight. no result. <br />
<br />
Problem 3: "welcome " Reboot loop"<br />
<br />
Problem 4: "Deafaltuser0" (20 year old bug even MS dont know how too fix... pops up now and then).<br />
<br />
Problem 5: If you ask some from support (MS/ resellers/ <span>
<span>manufacturer</span></span>) you get cut and paste answers and questions.<br />
<span>manufacturer</span></span>) you get cut and paste answers and questions.<br />
<br />
Problem 6: Inconsistency. If a fix works one time, another time it don't work. So you can't eliminate what dos'ent work and what does.<br />
<br />
Problem 7. If your windows are up and running, ms might make an upgrade witch crashes your computer. remember the anniversary update ?<br />
<br />
<br />
All the above problems have existed for many years. Do a search and you will find a lot of OLD threads.<br />
<br />
Since I have tried myself to do a clean install the warranty don't count anymore.<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Pls advice.</p>

<p>Hello. I know very little about dos. I don't know any reason why you can't install Windows with the USB stick. You might try to wipe the drive. Also you might want to create another USB to make sure you have a good media install. You can find free programs
 on the internet to wipe your drive.</p>

<h2>            Surface pro 4 keeps freezing.</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a long standing problem with my surface pro 4. It freezes for no reason. There is no pattern to it. I have researched it online and it seem few people had this issue. I have troubledshooted every step. First thing I do is check for new updates when
 I start my surface pro4. I have made sure it got all the latest update releases. However as the days go by the problem is getting worse. It is crashing every 5-10 mintues. My surface pro 4 is a useless peices of machine that I can only use for 5-10 mintues.
</p>
<p>Any other advice other then your usual trouble shoot link and install latest updates?
</p>
<p>This feels like a waste of money. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Vikram</p>

<p>Hi Libby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible cause of the missing bookmarks may be due to an update or change of settings. For us to help you retrieve your bookmarks, we'd like to know more. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Are you using Google Chrome as your browser? If not, can you please tell us what browser are you using?</li></ul>

<p>I don't recall making any updates or changes to my settings. I don't use the desktop daily, maybe a couple of times a week, so unless there was some kind of automatic update, I don't know. I shut my computer down in the early AM and everything was as I expected
 it to be. Later that day when I restarted the computer google looked different and my bookmarks were gone and only one tab, which was this new look google with bright highlighter yellow boxes, opened instead of the usual three. I believe it was google chrome
 I was using. I Have used google for long time and it was my preferred browser although two other browser tabs used to open with it. One was delta and I'm not sure what the other was as I used to click them off. The only thing I noticed recently was that when
 I switched my VPN on I could not connect to the internet on google or delta or the other browser. I have loaded FireFox as my default browser now after losing my bookmarks. VPN now connects to internet without any trouble.

<p>It seemed to be like an updated chrome, since the interface is new, there is a possibility that it did an automatic update that created a fresh version or more like cleaned up everything and started a new chrome.</p>
<p>See if these helps:</p>

<h2>            Win 10 doesn&#39;t recognize my Panasonic HC-V250 Camcorder.</h2>
                    Upgraded from Win 7 to 10. Now my Panasonic HC-V250 isn't even "seen" when attached via USB. Doesn't show in Device Manager as an image device or in any of the USB ports. So far all my other USB devices work. Have Movie Maker but it doesn't show in the
 pop up window for import. Panasonic says it's a Win 10 problem.

            <p>Does Panasonic support that camcorder on Windows 10? If Panasonic doesn't support that camcorder on Windows 10, it won't work properly (or at all) and there's nothing that you or Microsoft can do about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft doesn't have the proprietary knowledge to write a driver for your camcorder. And even if they did have that proprietary knowledge, that's Panasonic's intellectual property that Microsoft has no legal right to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can be sure that if it were up to Microsoft, every hardware device in the world would work with Windows 10. But it's not up to Microsoft. Only the hardware manufacturer can make their product work with Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Asked that same question of the Panasonic Rep. and of course there is no specific driver for Win10 even though the OS has been out now for 10 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I find odd is that Win10 doesn't even acknowledge that a device has been plugged into the USB port. When I plug in any other device I get an audio tone. With this Camera I get nothing. Not even a pop up saying this device did not load or is not supported.
 Without a driver the camera won't function but shouldn't the Device Manager at least show something is plugged into that USB port?</p>

<h3> melissaoronos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi issues with nextbook flexx 11</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I bought my nextbook on thanksgiving &nbsp;2015. I upgraded it to windows 10 and had zero issues with it. In May 2016 my wifi randomly stopped working. The option to turn it on or off disappeared. Only the Bluetooth and airplane mode was a available. A little
 computer with an x was displayed on the bottom right. I tried to Google and youtube similar problems. I tried all the advice that was given. &nbsp;I had pressed with windows and x, clicked device manager but no wifi options anywhere! I tried troubleshooting...
 nothing... it's as if wifi had never existed on my nextbook. I even considered wiping my laptop clean. I just about gave up. Then abut a month later.. I gave it another try. And to my surprise the wifi option appeared! Everything was fine again. Until two
 days ago, now in july, I was watching hulu when my wifi had stopped again. The computer with the &nbsp;x had appeared again. This time using the same attempt as before, under network adapters, some options had appeared. &nbsp;To keep this from getting any longer than
 it already is my issue now is that where the computer with an x was is now the wifi bars but with an x. When I click on it it says no wifi networks found. we have wifi in the house so I know there is wifi available. I have tried tethering my phone and my phone
 or laptop will not recognize eachother. Please help!?</p>

<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When exactly are you getting the pop-up message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Are you trying to install any driver software on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Have you successfully installed Adobe flash player on your computer?</span></p>

<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>This pop-up message is generally displayed when the driver you are using with your device is not Windows driver signed. For Microsoft® Windows® operating systems, Microsoft promotes driver signing for designated device classes. Windows 2000 and later
 versions of the operating system perform signature detection whenever an INF file is used to install hardware from a designated device class. Please click Continue Anyway to complete the installation of the software. At this point you should open Windows Device
 Manager and verify that the driver is associated with the hardware. If your card is not working and missing from this list, check to see if there is an entry with a yellow exclamation mark labeled "Multifunction Adapter", or something similar. If so, you can
 choose to update the driver and choose to select the appropriate driver from a list. After choosing the appropriate driver, this will now associate the card and driver together.
</span></p>
<p><span>To set file signature verification options:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open System in Control Panel.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the Hardware tab, click Driver Signing.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Under File Signature Verification, click one of the following:
</span></p>
<p><span>i)Click Ignore to allow all device drivers to be installed on this computer, regardless of whether they have a digital signature.
</span></p>
<p><span>ii) Click Warn to display a warning message whenever an installation program attempts to install a device driver without a digital signature.
</span></p>
<p><span>iii) Click Block to prevent an installation program from installing device drivers without a digital signature.

    <title>Xbox 360 freeze after 15 minutes of Skyrim - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stealthysaurus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 freeze after 15 minutes of Skyrim</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">I've played my Xbox since last Xmas, I never had an issue until 5 weeks ago.&nbsp; Every time I play Skyrim, the console freezes about 15 minutes into the game.&nbsp; I tried all the troubleshooting recommended online.&nbsp;
 I even sent it in for a service request to Xbox.&nbsp; They sent it back unfixed, and I lost 3 weeks of good playing time.&nbsp; They didn't even bother to tell me it was unfixed -&nbsp;the shipping paperwork had no useful info.&nbsp; On top of all that, I send it back in my
 original X box packaging, and they didn't send it back to me.&nbsp; Oh, did I mention I paid for expediting, and it took one and a half weeks to ship it back????&nbsp; C'mon Xbox, you can do better than this.&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If someone has a good idea (remember I did all the normal steps - cache cleaning, reloading of the game, etc), please let me know.</span>&nbsp; And, Xbox support,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">please tell me why the repair service was totally useless?</span></span></p>

<p>How old is your Xbox? Older Xbox's have a tendency to overheat and freeze the console. Also, try checking the disc itself. I purchased Max Payne 3 the day it came out and it ended up freezing every time I played it. You may just have a bad disc. If you downloaded
 Skyrim, delete it completely and download it again. Does this happen to every game or just Skyrim?</p>

<p>hi. it might not be your Xbox and might just be Skyrim itself since Skyrim is such a large game it will freeze your xbox, it happens to a lot of people. try download Skyrim to your hard drive that might help it but like I said it happens a lot of people,
 download it to your hard drive it should clean up to freezing but occasionally &nbsp;it will freeze every now and then but it will rarely freeze. or just stop playing Skyrim it seems like Its is really the cause to your freezing on your xbox.</p>

<p>Only Skyrim causes the issue - I have tons of other games, too. I have tried reloading the game, and it's always been on the hard drive. &nbsp;It worries me since it's always worked fine in the past under the same circumstances, but now it's an issue. &nbsp;Could
 it be the hard drive is getting full? &nbsp;Will games freeze when the hard drive is getting maxed out?</p>

<p>I have had the same problem with Skyrim and it wasn't my hardware because I tested on different GPU demanding games and went through the troubleshooting but what I tried was starting a new save and it seem to be fine, It might be a bug with in the Skyrim.
 another thing you could tried is ask a friend if they have a copy of the game and test it with theirs to try and isolate the problem, I hope I helped &nbsp;</p>
