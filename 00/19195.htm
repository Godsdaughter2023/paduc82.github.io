<h2>            O365 group calendar shows only Free&#47;Busy&#47;Out of Office in Outlook PC app but full titles in Outlook web app</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>in our organization we have a 0365 group for shared events. Members of our organization can see the full titles of the events in the Outlook web application but only&nbsp;Free/Busy/Out of Office in the Outlook PC application. Is there a way to get the full titles
 shown in the PC application as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Simo</p>

<p>Hi Simo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, if you are the member if a group, you can see the group calendar without sharing. For different Office 365 groups, you should share the calendars to members in another group so that they can see the calendar in this group. To share calendar, you
 can share calendar as following link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-an-outlook-calendar-with-other-people-353ed2c1-3ec5-449d-8c73-6931a0adab88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-an-outlook-calendar-with-other-people-353ed2c1-3ec5-449d-8c73-6931a0adab88</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set "can view when I'm busy" or "can view all details" when you share calendar. (If your members of your organization cannot view details of other organization's calendars, you should check if they gave your members full details permission to view
 their calendars).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, please note that, if all of you can see the details of shared calendars in OWA, the permission should be correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<h3> kimwennerberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel leading zero .csv import</h2>
                    <p>How can I format a .csv file so that when it is opened in Excel leading zeroes are retained?&nbsp;No end user intervention, please.&nbsp;(We cannot expect them to select the format for the certain columns from the&nbsp;Text Import Wizard.)</p>
<p>I am creating the file in SQL, so I have great control there.&nbsp; The requirement is to give a .csv file to end users for them to do with as they wish.&nbsp; Problem is that we need a simple and reliable way of handling the leading zeroes problem for them.</p>
<p>I tried concatenating a single apostrophe to the vales-- yes, the leading zeroes were retained, but the apostrophe also appeared in Excel.</p>
<p>Excel 2007.</p>
<p>TIA</p>

            <p>Are you looking for a VBA solution to this (this is a programming forum)?&nbsp; A macro to import the file?&nbsp; Or are you looking for a solution that allows the user to simply double-click the file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former is easy, the latter is hard, if not impossible.&nbsp; I tried a bunch of different combinations - single quotes, double quotes, single quote outside of double quote, etc and none of the options got what you want when you double-click the file.&nbsp; Excel
 is sometimes too smart for its own good!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is straigtforward to have a VBA macro that imports the file and retains the leading zeros, it that's what you want.</p>

                    <p>I need to copy the value in Column A from one sheet to another sheet if the value in Column P is "YES". &nbsp;This is the formula that I currently have, but it is only pulling the values in Column A up to a YES instead of only pulling when there is a YES. &nbsp;I
 also want it to skip blanks when pasting to the new sheet. &nbsp;Any thoughts on what I did wrong?</p>

            <p>The code looks consistent with your intention.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One&nbsp;reason why it might not copy from all rows with "YES" in column P would be that there is not an exact match with "YES".<br />
If P contained "Yes" or "YES " then the copy would not be done (VB text comparison is case-sensitive by default).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cater for such anomalies in the data you could use</p>
<p>&nbsp; If Trim(UCase(Delta)) = "YES" Then</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other reason I can think of for early termination of the loop would be if you have a Worksheet_Change procedure in Sheet2 that executes an End statement.</p>

    <title>Momentary bug where folders show empty - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rgb66rgb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Momentary bug where folders show empty</h2>
                    <p>I am running Outlook 365 (32 bit) on a Win10 (64 bit) box.&nbsp; All my email accounts (15 total) under outlook are pop3, with the exception of one exchange account connecting to outlook.com for the calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since using Outlook 365 (vs the old Outlook provided with Office on DVD when ... 2012? ) I find, that every so often, perhaps once or twice a day, I will click on the Inbox, or&nbsp;subfolder or other folder in&nbsp;the PST and Outlook will say there&nbsp;is "nothing to
 show".&nbsp; This can occur&nbsp;regardless&nbsp;of whether the folder has new mail (unread) items in it or not.&nbsp; If I click away from that folder into another one, then back again, the contents of that so-called previously empty folder once again presents all its contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scanpst'd all my psts,&nbsp; and compacted them.&nbsp; There seems to be no pattern (that I can discern) that could lead me to anticipate when a newly-selected/re-selected folder might decide to not show its contents.&nbsp; I cannot duplicate the error at will so
 there are no "steps to reproduce".&nbsp; I might be looking in Inbox, then move to Sent, then move to Inbox, then&nbsp;move to a subfolder under inbox -- all of which show emails correctly -- then I move to another folder and it shows no contents, until I click away
 from that folder and back again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't an issue of missing or disappearing folders or mail as I've read from other complaints here.&nbsp; It is simply visual - something I suspect to do with the activation of a folder under some circumstance not causing the proper sequence in code to repopulate
 the Table View (rctrl_renwnd32) with the folder's contents, until it is revisited.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any fix for this?&nbsp; Its just an annoyance more than anything else, but an annoyance nonetheless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that I believe it matters, but I can provide the size of the PSTs if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Love to hear suggestions. </p>

<p>Hi Kristine ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 Pro v1709 Build 16299.125</p>
<p>MS Office 365 v1711 Build 8730.2127 Click-to-Run, 'monthly channel'</p>
<p>
</p><p>More info:<br />
- I have 14 pop3 accounts + 1 exchange account set up</p>
<p>
</p><p>- emails are delivered to specific PST folders by both the setting in accounts and by rules.<br />
- I have four PSTs open as normal, and a further dozen I may open once in a while (storage for old emails)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Nominal size of day-to-day psts is about 100-200K.&nbsp; I move things often, but store everything (I have mail back to 1996, a testament to how well the Outlook app handles mail, IMO)&nbsp; Two or three storage PSTs are around 1.5gig.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The issue can occur regardless of the pst I am currently in, or navigate to.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- It can occur when moving between folders in different psts, or within the same pst<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I never use safe mode but have no add-ins loaded beyond the default items installed w office.<br />
&nbsp;-- ACTIVE: ms exchange add-in, SharePoint server colleague import add-in, OneNote notes about outlook items, outlook social connector 2016<br />
&nbsp;-- INACTIVE: access outlook add-in, vba outlook add-in<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I can try safe mode for a day or so to see if the issue occurs then, but I can't see it being related to an add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has occurred for well over a year, during all manner of using Outlook and navigating folders, and as I said, is sporadic and an unreproducible-on-demand bug.&nbsp; I can click around ad-nausea with no issues, then boom, one folder might show empty
 when its not.&nbsp; No rhyme nor reason to the bug that I can tell.&nbsp; Click away then back and the contents appear.&nbsp; It can happen with folders having one item or a hundred or a thousand.&nbsp; And every so often - much less frequently than the bug of empty display -
 I'll get a buggered up display with whacky grouping headings, as the attached shows.&nbsp; Again, clicking away then back shows the contents properly. Never lost an email through all this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started to think this may be a video driver problem. It is pretty old tech (circa 2007 Nvidia GeForce 8800 GTX in a HP Blackbird 002).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OffCAT Results: </p>
<p>4 issues:</p>
<p>- autodiscover - possible problems due to non-default values under \RedirestServers</p>
<p>- calendar - incorrect week number shown in the date navigator</p>
<p>- email message display - path for 'cache' under shell folders not default value</p>
<p>- images - ditto re cache path</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fixed calendar and cache (it was pointing to my K: drive which is a 128gb SSD I use for windows swap files, photoshop swap, and internet cache.)&nbsp; The autodiscover is a different beast ... attached is a photo of the settings.&nbsp; Not
 sure what should be changed from the help provided. </p>

                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm attempting to set up a public contact list that is accessible from mobile devices via the outlook app.&nbsp; I had added about 150 contacts initially into a created public list and this did appear initially in the mobile outlook app, but when more were added,&nbsp;the
 new ones&nbsp;not visible.&nbsp; We are using a mixture of iOS and Android, and iOS is definitely having more trouble.&nbsp; Once the iOS had been restarted, all contacts disappeared.&nbsp; Has anyone found a straight forward way to do this without using a 3rd party app?</p>

            I have about 50G still free on my phone, so that's not the issue. &nbsp;The issue appears to be that it's "public contacts" as opposed to private, or personal contacts.

<p>
</p><p>This worked to resync the personal contacts, but the public contacts which I am trying to set up to sync to all device linking to outlook is still not working.&nbsp; I'm not sure that it's possible to even manage.&nbsp; Is it possible to access public contacts from
 devices or would these have to be copied into private/personal contacts first&nbsp;- which would not be of use.</p>

<p>Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read all the thread on this issue. I have had this problem for months. Just this week I updated my OS to Sierra 10.12.5 and my Outlook 2011 to 14.7.4. &nbsp;I used to never have this problem but since last year I finally took time to change software updates.
 My att support people say it is not their issue. &nbsp;Mail comes in fine to att.com &nbsp;or yahoo.com, just Outlook has problems and I want to continue using it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mac support &nbsp;said it must be a Microsoft server issue. &nbsp;I have two other accounts, one business on Exchange, and another old one on mindspring. &nbsp;Mail sent out never has t problem with emails sent and requiring to add passwords.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have tried like the other person to change my setting to name and password and that did not work. Why does the password in my Outlook Preferences keep getting deleted? &nbsp;This sets up the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very annoying. What works? &nbsp;I am happy with 2011 and have no confidence that 2016 will fix this and it costs $200 I'm told.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just two of us Mac people can't be the only ones with this issue, right? &nbsp; Joe</p>

<p>I am having problems with my Microsoft Outlook 2007.&nbsp; It does not want to sign into my email all of the time.&nbsp; Sometimes it will, sometimes not.&nbsp; Most of the time not.&nbsp; I start the program and down in the bottom right corner it will try to sign in, but 9

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hello MrCapra
<br />
<br />Would strongly suggest uniinstalling '2016 before installing '2019 just to keep things clean. Reality is that '2019 installs in the same folder as '2016 so there is no such thing as a side-by-side install of the two versions.
<br />
<br />Can you install '2019 without installing '2016? Yes, will just get replaced but as noted in the previous sentence, would be advisable to keep things clean.

    <title>Word 2016 still crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianl_au  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 still crashing</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Office 2016 during the preview I have never been able to use it for any significant length of time without crashing. &nbsp;I have posted in response to others having similar issues, but this problem just seems to go on. &nbsp;I pay a yearly subscription
 for office and frankly I'm not getting much value for it. &nbsp;I continue to use 2011 or even Windows versions under VM. The trigger events for crashing are varied (i.e. I don't think there is any specific - just scrolling will usually do it). I have completely
 uninstalled and re-installed (according to the posted instructions) numerous times, including under a new user profile. &nbsp;I was hoping the upgrade to El Capitan might have some benefit, but sadly not. &nbsp;I have again completely uninstalled and re-installed again
 today, and Word crashed within a minute of just scrolling through a document I was reading. &nbsp;I note that despite having only just rebooted the macbook and starting Word, it was using 1.89Gb, for a file that is only 4Mb. &nbsp;This doesn't look right! &nbsp;Word 2011
 with the same document uses 160Mb. &nbsp;Most of the documents I use open in compatibility mode, but even if I save them in the latest format the crashes still occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still see evidence in forums that others are still having problems. &nbsp;Does *anyone* have a solution for this - it's been going on for months and not getting any better with each update. &nbsp;What concerns me now is that updates are becoming less frequent, which
 I'm hoping doesn't indicate that the dev team think that all of the problems are solved. &nbsp;I still send error reports occasionally, but I don't have the time to deal with the crashing, and I'm sure others may have given up altogether.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details: OSX 10.11, Office 15.14, MB Air (13 inch, early 2014), i7</p>

            <p>Have you tried running the Font Book.app to see if the problem you are having is Font related?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Font Book is located in your Applications folder and after opening it make sure all of your Fonts are selected. Then use File &gt; Validate Fonts and it will provide a listing of everything it finds. If problems are found you must resolve all of them, which
 usually means deleting any duplicates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are done you must shutdown your computer, not just a warm start restart... a cold start from a full power down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - Updates are not coming less frequently, they are happening at least once a month. Very soon now there should be one for Office 2016 released.</p>

            Thanks for the response. &nbsp;I did find some duplicate fonts and have removed them. &nbsp;I'm not sure what you mean by a full power down since the macbook of course has a battery. &nbsp;It seems to me that a shutdown followed by a restart will effectively be the same
 as a warm restart, but I'll try it for now until I see any alternate suggestion. &nbsp;Thanks again.

            After sorting out the duplicate fonts and rebooting, it does on the surface seem to be more stable. &nbsp;Previously, I could illicit a crash just by scrolling in pretty much any large document. &nbsp;I haven't seen that behaviour for the most part since the reboot.
 &nbsp;I have one document that will crash it without question - often even just while it's loading. &nbsp;The file is &gt;30Mb with a large number of figures. &nbsp;The only way I can edit this document with any degree of confidence is with Word 2007. &nbsp;2011 (Mac) and 2013 (Windows)
 will work for a while but will crash after a time. &nbsp;For now, I will open all documents in 2016 and see how it goes. &nbsp;I will report back here once any pattern has become clear.

<p>83 'dubious' fonts removed later, and even without a cold start, Word hasn't crashed for almost 14 hours now.</p>

uninstalling Office 2011</a> (which was still on my laptop) and I haven't had a crash since. Obviously, something else might have changed, and you'd need to reinstall if you are relying on Word 2011, but it might be worth a try.&nbsp;

            I agree - problems with fonts should&nbsp;<em>not</em> cause Word to crash. &nbsp;That said, since fixing the font issues, the number of crashes has dropped, but it still happens. &nbsp;I'm trying to use 2016 version for most work now as I want to send as many crash
 reports as possible - frustrating as that may be.

            The MS support guys remotely logged in to my Macbook and completely uninstalled 2011 and 2016, prior to re-installing 2016. &nbsp;Constant crashing forced me to re-install 2011 for use when not running a VM. &nbsp;I also can run 2013 and 2007 under VMs, and the
 most reliable version is 2007. &nbsp;

</p><p>I've sent crash logs to Microsoft for several weeks now, so they should have plenty to go on! &nbsp;The crash logs systematically indicate a problem with OpenGL graphics rendering. &nbsp;Since my MacBook Pro 13" doesn't have dual graphics I cannot select the dedicated

            I'm sure there must be many others having this problem - can anyone from MS comment on whether there is indeed a recognised problem? &nbsp; The product has been essentially useless to many serious users for a long time now and it would be nice to at least know
 that something is happening. &nbsp;As for the crashing, I hadn't noticed any difference running on battery or otherwise. &nbsp;The OpenGL link is interesting and hopefully might mean something to any team looking at this...

<h2>            Cant register and validate Office for Mac 2011</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't validate my installation of Office for Mac 2011. &nbsp; I've entered in the Product Key and it wouldn't activate online. &nbsp;I called and gave the activation line my activation code and entered in the validation code as given to me. &nbsp;I verified it 3 times,
 that I had the correct information typed in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It keeps saying that it can't be validated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to get this software registered. &nbsp;Please advise.</p>
<p>Thanksm,</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I take it this is a license you used previously and that you either reformatted or replaced your hard drive. To Office, that looks like a new machine, and your license is not valid for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use Time Machine to restore your old install on your new hardware:</p>

</p><p>I entered in the key from the CD to which the software failed to register automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do the manual validation, it pops up a screen with a phone number and a registration ID.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to enter&nbsp; the registration id into the phone and then it recited
 back a large code which I entered in.&nbsp; I verified this code and tried to register several times, but it wouldn't validate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person at the Microsoft support phone number said I had to come here for help, since it's a 2011 product.</p>

<h3> beolein  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Do You Install Office 2003 Upgrade on New Computer When Only Your Old Computer Has It&#63;</h2>
                    I had an XP 32-bit computer with Office 2003. &nbsp;I have the Office 2003 Upgrade Disc and Product Key. &nbsp;I do not have any other discs.
<div>I bought a new Windows 7 64-bit computer. &nbsp;I want to continue using Office -- which I own -- on the new computer.</div>
<div>The Office 2003 Upgrade installer says my old version of Office must be on the computer or I must insert the old Office disc.</div>
<div>How can I get Office on my new computer without the old disc?</div>
<div>(Unless there is an easier solution, how about hooking up my old computer to the new one [what kind of cable?] and pointing the installer to it, yet somehow getting all the files on the new one so I don't have the old computer hooked up forever?)</div>

            The Upgrade license requires a qualifying "upgrade from". It does not even have to be installed on your current computer as long as you have the installation file.<br />
<br />
I am going to assume you are telling the truth, so you can try one of these downloads. I am not sure if these files qualify, so give them a try. Make sure you keep a copy of the one that works for future use.<br />

Attaching the old drive to your new computer is a technique I have not seen tried before. It is worth a try.

            Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;It didn't work.
<div>I tried all three versions of Works Rohn007 showed. &nbsp;Note that the first one, Works 8, wouldn't install, saying it was only an upgrade and I didn't have an older version of Works on the computer. &nbsp;the other two installed and worked fine, but I couldn't
 upgrade to Office 2003.</div>
<div>My specific error message when trying to install Office 2003 on my new computer says I must have Office 97, 2000, or XP already on the computer.</div>
<div>So I'm almost back to square one.</div>
<div>I am willing to buy a cable to connect the old computer. &nbsp;What kind of cable?</div>
<div>I am not willing to give this up easily. &nbsp;I bought Office. &nbsp;I then bought an upgrade. &nbsp;I own it. &nbsp;I don't see why buying a new computer precludes me from continuing to use Office. &nbsp;I don't recall the license agreement saying I must save my CDs. &nbsp;What if
 I had bought it via download and didn't have CDs in the first place (if it was available that way back then)?</div>

            The first sentence of my reply said that you do NOT have to install the upgrade from. During your install of your upgrade version you will be prompted for the "upgrade from" application. At that point you point to the downloaded installer file.<br />
<br />
OK, if 2003 requires Office 97, 2000 or 2002 then the three Works links won't be adequate. Sorry, I don't have any links for the required versions.<br />
<br />
You will have to try alternate sources, such as:<br />
<div><b><span>I Need Installation files/CD for an earlier version of Office, What Can I Do?</span></b>
<br />
Once you get the installation file, make sure you burn a copy for yourself before returning the disk if it is borrowed.
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Find a friend (new or old) who has the right CD and is willing to lend you the CD. Unlike the very "old" DOS days when there was a signature file on the floppy, there is nothing unique on the CD to identify it. The uniqueness is provided
 via the Product key you use to activate it. So, you can borrow a CD without threatening their installation/activation.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ask at work if they have an installation CD you can borrow. There are often old disks "hiding" in dark corners of storage rooms<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Try to find a local "PC Computer Club". There is almost certainly a geek or three with disks you could borrow.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Find a small local computer store or repair business. They often have new unsold copies of “old” versions of software because they are still supporting customers using them.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the small repair business they may have old computers that customers had upgraded from that you could now use (buy and transfer to your machine)<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You could buy it “new” online from a reputable online store. Be very careful who you give your money to<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Try websites like Kijiji or Craig’s List to see if you can borrow or buy it from an individual<br />
<br />

<br />We can try with the ordering of contacts, through this option we can verify that all my contacts are registered in the tool, additional we can order them for a more easy and simple search, in case you do not find all your contacts, we can recover them, I add two links, one for each proposed option. You can check here:

            I really appreciate your offer of assistance. I tried reordering the contacts but that didn't solve the problem. The second article pertains to Outlook.com, which I don't use. (I've never understood why I can't sync between Outook 2016 and Outlook.com.)
 One factor in this might possibly be that I sync my Outlook contacts with iCloud with an add-in named CodeTwo Sync for iCloud, so I have two drop-down lists. One problem contact is named Betsy Knop. Betsy Knop appears in both my Outlook and iCloud contacts,
 and she appears in my iCloud drop-down list. But she does not appear in my Outlook drop-down list. I'm hoping this might give you a clue as to what the problem is.

<h2>            Error&#58; OneNote Couldn&#39;t Setup your First Notebook</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I am able to login and access my onenote account using a webpage, however, I'm having difficulties using the app on my macbook pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the app, I click on the 'sign in' button and enter my email and password. After that it states that it is loading my notebook for approximately 5 seconds. Then after that it pops up with 'OneNote Couldn't Setup Your First Notebook. Sign in with
 a Microsoft account or the account assigned to you by your work or school'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if I am doing something wrong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completely updated my mac and the onenote app. I have even tried completely deleting the app, restarting my mac and then re-downloading the app and this hasn't helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on how I can fix this would be greatly appreciated! I really like using the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Caitlin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your message in this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;According to the error message you provided, it may be related to login. So we’d suggest you follow the steps below to reset keychain to check if the same problem will occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Quit from all Mac Office Applications, except for OneNote </li><li>
In OneNote, sign out. This only logs you out, and all the notebooks will still be there.
</li><li>
Quit OneNote. </li><li>
Launch "Keychain Access" and search for all items that contain "Office15". There should be only a couple items, one for each account you have logged into. (The name will be a long alpha-numeric code and the kind will start with "MicrosoftOffice15…")</li><li>
Delete these items. It is only deleting the authentication credentials, no data. Once you sign in again, they will be re-created.
</li><li>
After removing Office credentials, press Command + Shift + G (while Finder is opened)&gt; enter ~/Library/Group Containers</li><li>
&nbsp;Move these folders to trash:</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UBF8T346G9.ms&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UBF8T346G9.Office&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UBF8T346G9.OfficeOsfWebHost</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span> <strong>Note: Before you delete or remove the folder, make sure that Outlook data backed up because the Outlook data will be removed when you move the folders to the trash.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
Launch OneNote and sign into your accounts. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists, in order to help you further, I want to confirm the information below with you:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Could you provide the screenshot of error message?</li><li>
Could you provide the version of your OneNote? You can go to OneNote &gt; About OneNote and provide the screenshot of it.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Sukie</p>

</p><p>I tried your above recommendations and it has not fixed the problem. The only difference was that my laptop did not have a '<span>UBF8T346G9.OfficeOsfWebHost' folder to delete? Not sure if that makes a difference?</span></p>

<br />
Excel is brilliant at handling dates—as long as they aren’t dates earlier than the base date used by the program. If you need to use earlier dates, then you’ll want to be aware of the information in this tip.

<br />
</span><span>In Excel, the date before 1/1/1900 cannot be entered and calculated correctly. If you want to calculate the age of a person who was born and died before 1/1/1900, that would not get the correct calculation in Excel generally. But here
 in this article, a trick can help you to calculate the age before 1/1/1900 in Excel.

Excel enters dates prior to 01/01/1900 as plain text. This <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/245104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft KB article</a> provides a macro for a function that calculates the age of someone or something created before 1900. It works with dates entered as text beginning with 01/01/0001, normal dates, and can handle dates when the starting date is before
 1900 and ending date is after 1900. <br />

Although Microsoft Excel date formulas can only use dates entered between 1/1/1900 and 12/31/9999, you can use a custom Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications function to calculate the age (in years) of someone or something that was first created before January
 1, 1900. </span></p>

<p>Hi Craig,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, this feature can't be manually disabled in Outlook client. And from my test in the lab, when you use
<strong>Alt+Tab </strong>to switch between programs, it won't trigger the Research pane. Only when you press Alt and left-click the text in message body, the research pane will appear. So to avoid this situation, please do not click anything in message body
 when you switch between programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While if you prefer to disable this feature in Outlook, you can share your ideas and user experience in
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows/search?filter=hot&amp;oauth_consumer_key=mZUyUjsGInIPk9fwULg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook UserVoice</a> website. Microsoft attaches great importance to the user experience and feedback. Your time and understanding are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<h2>            Try Two - Employee Point Tracker Deductions, May Need VBA&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted about this a while back, but I didn't give sufficient information in my original post which made answering my question difficult for the community. I've also since simplified the problem (I hope) so I'm really hoping I get the help I need here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HR has asked me to help make a point tracking system. I'm using Excel's Employee Attendance Tracker template and I'm heavily modifying it so it takes into account all sorts of different things. Everything's working great for me except for this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The employee's have voted and they want their point deduction system to work in such a way that, if they have no point related offenses in a full 30 day period, a half point is deducted from their total. I have a table dedicated to point related offenses
 entries, so I really just need something that says </p>
<p>
</p><p>"If the date difference between today's start date and the end date of this employee's last entry is greater than or equal to 30 days and less than 60 days, deduction = 0.5.
</p>
<p>If the date difference between today's start date and the end date of this employee's last entry is greater than or equal to 60 days and less than 90 days, deduction = 1.</p>
<p>If the date difference between today's start date and the end date of this employee's last entry is greater than or equal to 90 days and less than 120 days, deduction = 1.5.</p>
<p>If the date difference between today's start date and the end date of this employee's last entry is greater than or equal to 120 days and less than 150 days, deduction = 2.</p>
<p>If the date difference between today's start date and the end date of this employee's last entry is greater than or equal to 150 days and less than 180 days, deduction = 2.5.</p>
<p>If the date difference between today's start date and the end date of this employee's last entry is greater than or equal to 180 days and less than 210 days, deduction = 3.</p>
<p>If the date difference between today's start date and the end date of this employee's last entry is greater than or equal to 210 days and less than 240 days, deduction = 3.5.</p>
<p>If the date difference between today's start date and the end date of this employee's last entry is greater than or equal to 240 days and less than 270 days, deduction = 4.</p>
<p>If the date difference between today's start date and the end date of this employee's last entry is greater than or equal to 270 days and less than 300 days, deduction = 4.5.</p>
<p>If the date difference between today's start date and the end date of this employee's last entry is greater than or equal to 300 days and less than 330 days, deduction = 5.</p>
<p>If the date difference between today's start date and the end date of this employee's last entry is greater than or equal to 330 days and less than 360 days, deduction = 5.5.</p>
<p>If the date difference between today's start date and the end date of this employee's last entry is less than 30 days, deduction = 0.</p>
<p>If there is no previous entry for this employee, deduction = 0."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This way I can simply subtract the deductions from the point sum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The table looks like this, and I need a formula or VBA code for filling in the Deductions column:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Employee Name</td>
<td>Start Date</td>
<td>End Date</td>
<td>Type of Leave</td>
<td>Points</td>
<td>Deductions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chris&nbsp;</td>
<td>6/15/2016</td>
<td>6/15/2016</td>
<td>Paid Call In</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Camille</td>
<td>6/19/2016</td>
<td>6/20/2016</td>
<td>Unpaid Call In</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roy</td>
<td>6/25/2016</td>
<td>6/25/2016</td>
<td>Early Leave - Sick</td>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chris</td>
<td>6/30/2016</td>
<td>6/30/2016</td>
<td>Tardy</td>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chris</td>
<td>7/10/2016</td>
<td>7/11/2016</td>
<td>Paid Call In</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Camille</td>
<td>7/20/2016</td>
<td>7/20/2016</td>
<td>Tardy</td>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>0.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Camille</td>
<td>7/30/2016</td>
<td>7/30/2016</td>
<td>Early Leave - Sick</td>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chris</td>
<td>8/11/2016</td>
<td>8/11/2016</td>
<td>Tardy</td>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>0.5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Roy</td>
<td>9/01/2016</td>
<td>9/01/2016</td>
<td>Tardy</td>
<td>0.5</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So, in the end Chris will have 2.5 points - 1 from his first call in, 0.5 from his first tardy, 1 from his second call in, and 0.5 from his second tardy, with a half point deduction from his only 30+ day gap (7/10/2016 to 8/11/2016).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Camille will have 1.5 points - one from her call in, 0.5 from her tardy, and 0.5 from her early leave, with a half point deduction from her only 30 day gap (6/19/2016 to 7/20/2016).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Roy will have no points - 0.5 from his early leave, 0.5 from his tardy, and a 1 point deduction from having two full 30 day gaps between those events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<p>

<p>The tricky part is to get the date of the last entry, means we have to search from the bottom to top.</p>
<p>I use a helper column for that:</p>
<p>G2:&nbsp; =IFERROR(LOOKUP(2,1/($A$1:A1=A2),$C$1:C1),C2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The deduction calculation is now simple:<br />
F2:&nbsp; =INT((C2-G2)/30)*0.5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drag the formulas down to the end of the data. </p>
<p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
Were there any changes( hardware or software) made to the computer prior to the issue?
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong>Clear the Temporary Internet Files folder manually.<br />
<strong>a</strong>. Click on <strong>Start</strong> and type <strong>%temp% </strong>
in the search field. <br />
<strong>b.</strong> Open the <strong>Temporary Internet Files </strong>folder and delete all the files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2</strong> : Reset the Internet explorer settings and check if the issue persists.<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Resetting the Internet Explorer settings will result in passwords that are stored in websites to be lost.</div>

<h2>            I am not able to add an Outlook.com Account to Outlook</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble adding an Outlook.com Account to Outlook 2016. When I add an Account with the email adress, Outlook says it finds the settings for the account, then orders me to restart Outlook that changes can apply. After restarting and clicking on
 the Account it says "cannot open set of folders, the File xxxx.ost is not an Outlook data file and in the File Explorer, the file is 0kB big. Outlook can also not connect using active sync since it cant connect to eas.outlook.com and I cant add the Account
 using IMAP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help, I really need the Account running. I deleted the .ost file, repaired Outlook within the "Programs and Features". Using Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately your Office Account will not indicate which Office 2013 is on which Computer.&nbsp; It will give you the date Office 2013 was purchased.&nbsp; Please also note that the Product Key shown at your Office Account is NOT the Product Key/Redemption Key that
 you used to install your Office 2013.&nbsp; You can obtain the last 5 digits of the Redemption Key by installing the free version of
<a href="https://www.belarc.com/products_belarc_advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Belarc Advisor</a>&nbsp; Please also note that you cannot use the Redemption Key to reinstall your Office 2013 you need to reinstall it from your Office Account at:&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.office.com/Myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.office.com/Myaccount</span></a></span>
 where you will see an INSTALL link.&nbsp; Please note you can safely click on this link it will NOT install anything.&nbsp; It will open another dialogue box with helpful links as well as the INSTALL Button which if pressed will start installing Office 2013.<br />

 Then uninstall Office 2013 from the computer you are using you should be able to sign into your Office Account again (after reboot?) and be able to see which Office 2013 was/is on your computer.&nbsp; It is not clear how you have two installations of Office 2013?&nbsp;

            That is the question. I have not seen a clear unequivocal answer from MS. My interpretation is that yes you will be able to continue to use up<br />
<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Is the 2010 to 2013 “Pre-launch Offer” an “upgrade” license that replaces the 2010 license, or is it a “free, additional” license you can run in parallel with the 2010 license you used to redeem the 2013 offer?</b>
<p><br />
What I've based my personal interpretation on is all of the articles I've read and the specific terms of the offer
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;snip <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/offer/pre-launch-offer-details-and-terms-FX102902434.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/offer/pre-launch-offer-details-and-terms-FX102902434.aspx</a>&nbsp; &gt;</p>
<p><br />
Get the next version of Office free, when available: When you receive your e-mail from Microsoft, follow the instructions and redeem the Offer at
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/offer/redir/FX102901464.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office.com/offer</a>. <span>&nbsp;</span>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>You get the next version, 2013, free. No mention of replacing existing license.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This image of an MS screen: <a href="http://img3.picload.org/image/arcdpwg/e_you_have_no_ch.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://img3.picload.org/image/arcdpwg/e_you_have_no_ch.png</a> shows that it explicitly says you can keep 2010 Home and Student when you take Office 365 Home Premium (2013).</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><br />
Offer limitations include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Offer cannot be redeemed after the <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/offer/pre-launch-offer-details-and-terms-FX102902434.aspx#Period" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
redemption end date</a> has passed.</li><li>Limited to one (1) Office product for each corresponding qualifying Office 2010 or Office for Mac 2011 product purchased, up to the maximum allowed.</li><li>Limited to twenty-five (25) Offer redemptions per person or organization. Please note that each Microsoft account e-mail address and password (formerly Windows Live ID) may only redeem a total of five (5) Office 365 Home Premium
 subscriptions. If you would like to purchase more than five (5) qualifying Office products, and redeem more than five (5) Office 365 Home Premium subscriptions, you will need to use additional Microsoft accounts during the redemption process.</li><li>No returns on software downloaded through the site.</li><li>This offer is non-transferable.</li><li>Microsoft reserves the right to reject any redemption request deemed in Microsoft's sole discretion to be false or fraudulent, submission of multiple requests and/or providing false information or redemption requests that are
 otherwise ineligible.</li></ul>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
<b>No mention of not being able to continue using the old version ...</b><br />
<br />
Previously, when you bought an "upgrade" version or were given the "free upgrade" in the equivalent offer it was made clear that the "upgrade" version required proof of a "qualifying" (aka older) version and the terms explicitly said that the new license replaced
 the old one. You could have one or the other installed.<br />
<br />
This "upgrade" point is not made in the Pre-launch Offer terms and conditions nor did I see it in the 2013 RTM MS License Terms document.<br />
<br />
For example, in the 2007 MSLT it explicitly said this:<br />
<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
13.&nbsp; <b>UPGRADE OR CONVERSION.</b>&nbsp; To upgrade or convert software, you must <br />
first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade or <br />
conversion.&nbsp; Upon upgrade or conversion, this agreement takes the place <br />
of the agreement for the software you upgraded or converted from.&nbsp; <b>After <br />
you upgrade or convert, you may no longer use the earlier version of the <br />
software you upgraded or converted from. </b><br />
&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
&lt;snip 2013 MSLT&gt;<br />
<i>What about upgrading or converting the software? If you install the software covered by this agreement as an upgrade or conversion to your existing software, then the upgrade or conversion replaces the original software that you are upgrading or
 converting from. <b>&nbsp;You do not retain any rights to the original software after you have upgraded and you may not continue to use it or transfer it in any way. This agreement governs your rights to use the upgrade software and replaces the agreement for the
 software from which you upgraded.</b><br />
</i>&lt;snip&gt;<br />
<br />
That is a restatement of the terms from the 2007 license. BUT !!! I don't recall seeing the use of the term "Upgrade" anywhere in the "Pre-Launch Offer".&nbsp; In 2007 and earlier "upgrade versions" the product was explicitly and clearly labeled as an upgrade. It
 simply would not install without the qualifying version present.&nbsp; That is not true with 2013, or even 2010.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So my interpretation is that the copy of 2013 you get using the "Pre-launch Offer" is just that, a FREE, ADDITIONAL copy of Office, independent of the 2010 license you used to redeem the offer.&nbsp; I haven't yet seen references from MS to contradict that interpretation.
<br />
<br />
Yes, I agree that changing the "Retail License" terms the way they did was a&nbsp; ********** marketing trick, since the offer is NOT equivalent to the original purchased copy. But since the offer is a "free" copy, they can do what they want.<br />
<br />
Personally, I understand the desire to milk all of the money they can out of the Office brand, but they could have very simply avoided this criticism by not using the label "retail" on this type of license.&nbsp; They already had several other labels for the new
 license terms, or they could have made a new one. I'm talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>OEM - Original Equipment Manufacturer,&nbsp; </li><li>MLK - Medialess Kit, 2007 and earlier)&nbsp; </li><li>PKC - Product Key Card, introduced in 2010</li><li>POSA - Point of Sale Activated</li><li>ESD - Electronic Software Download</li><li>1-computer online download</li></ul>
<p>With all of those options, instead they decided to hide the severely downgraded license terms by reusing the "retail" label.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>"Poor show old bean"</i></p>
<p>Here is partial confirmation from a MS Support call</p>
<p>&lt;snip <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/bcfcf7a8-cadd-4601-a2dd-b74a7ef445a8">
Microsoft Office 2010 -&gt; 2013 upgrade offer</a> &gt;</p>
<p>I was having problems with the upgrade and was on the phone with Microsoft today(Feb 14,2013).&nbsp; They assured me that the other two licenses are still valid and legal.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
