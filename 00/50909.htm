            Hi,<br />
<br />
If Clean Boot works then you need to use a process of elimination to see what<br />
program(s) is causing the issue. When you find that leave it unchecked.<br />
<br />
How to perform a clean boot in Windows&nbsp;- Windows 10 is essentially the same <strong>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Dell Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, diagnostics, and ask<br />
in their forums about any known issues. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and<br />
the major on-board and separate device drivers. Especially the network drivers - WiFi/<br />
Wireless and NIC/Wired. Also check the actual device makers' sites for even newer<br />
versions.<br />

<br />
Netio.sys issues are almost always 3rd party antivirus/security programs and/or the network<br />
drivers. Uninstall any 3rd party antivirus/security and use Windows Defender which is Win 8<br />
is a full featured antivirus. Update the network drivers in use. Check with Dell Support and<br />
Forums for any known issues.<br />
<br />
The Bug_Check were D1 CAUSE NETIO.sys which is a Windows component which means <br />
something else drove it into Fault.<br />

<br />
BiosVendor = Dell Inc.<br />

<br />
</strong>Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic

bluescreen troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers and <br />
antivirus/antispyway/security programs can also cause this.&nbsp;<br />

<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0xD1: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL <br />
<br />
</strong>The DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x000000D1. This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code</strong> </p>
<p><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p><strong>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Parameters</strong> </p>
<p><br />
The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Cause</strong> </p>
<p><br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p><br />
This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p><br />
If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for the
 page fault include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><br />
To begin debugging, use a kernel debugger to get a stack trace.</p>
<p><br />
If the problem is caused by the driver that you are developing, make sure that the function that was executing at the time of the bug check is not marked as pageable or does not call any other inline functions that could be paged out.
<br />
<br />

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<br />
You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a><br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
What are you scanning with? What is the error? That probably is indicating where the<br />
problem is.<br />
<br />
Remember I can't see the scans or results so you have to provide the information on<br />
what you did and see.<br />
<br />

<p><span>Hi ccso301,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you getting the error message when starting AOL browser or messenger?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 was the last time it was working fine?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you able to use other programs on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using Mcafee security software provided by AOL on the computer I would suggest that you uninstall Mcafee completely from the computer
 using the below uninstaller and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS100507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS100507</a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help
 protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected
 to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>If you still face issue with AOL product I would suggest that you contact AOL for more information.</span></p>

 over.<br />
<br />
To get the achievement legitimately you need to speak with Calendar Man on 12 seperate holidays and techically would take you a year or so to get.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Now let's look at the Terms of Use regarding Gamerscore Correction:<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Gamerscore resets </em></strong><br />
<br />
<em>A gamerscore correction occurs on a player’s Xbox LIVE account when they gain achievements through avoiding gameplay and using external tools. Xbox LIVE is committed to keeping the service free of this type of behavior as it violates the Xbox LIVE Terms
 of Use. When abnormal achievement or gamerscore activity is found, Xbox LIVE modifies the gamerscore of players who meet specific and automated criteria.
</em><br />
<br />
<em>An Xbox LIVE player who obtains their gamerscore in this abnormal way will: </em>
<br />
<br />
<em>•Find their gamerscore reset to zero. </em><br />
<em>•Be unable to regain all previously earned achievements. </em><br />
<em>•Be labeled as a "cheater" for the community to view. </em><br />
<em>Although players who are identified by these criteria will start from a zero gamerscore, they will still be able to gain achievements for future games. In other words, we give them another chance to earn future achievements by earning them as other "fair"
 players do. The original gamerscore correction remains permanent without any way to appeal</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In my opinion, this definitely falls under "avoiding gameplay".&nbsp; I haven't gotten any official clarification on this yet, but there is NO WAY I'm going to do it.&nbsp; It's certainly a grey area, but I'm pretty sure this is totally against the ToU.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?&nbsp; Let's keep it civil please.</p>

<p>Well.... I already got this achievement by going offline... &nbsp;I was very curious as to what calanderman was going to do or say come Halloween and after someone else posted about this in the forum, my curiosity peaked... had to do it..</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>As far as them resetting my achievements to zero for all games that I have completed because of ONE achievement that I didn't get the legit way ? That sounds a bit harsh, but I really don't care.. I never really look at my score or anyone else's... People
 with a much higher score than me I would assume have played way more games than me, uses gamefly or whatever.. so what... I only have 17155 / 37550 anyway. only 7 games 100% ..
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>BUT if they do reset my score to zero while I am in the middle of playing this Batman game and not allow me to get the achievements that I already have in it, I am very likely to not even bother trying to get the remaining achievements making the game end
 up on the shelf much sooner than it will likely since I will be trying to get 100% on it.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It will also reinforce me original idea of getting all my single player games on my PS3 such as I did with Arkham Asylum and only getting my multiplayer games on Xbox... I could have bought this game on either system and I went out of my normal routine and
 bought this on my x-box only because I have 2 X-boxes in different rooms and only one PS3.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If my gamerscore resets, I will let you know... as I said.. I really don't care about it or my past games, but if it happens in the middle of this game, I will be less likely to bother trying for 100% making the game lose some value to me.</p>

<p>i may be wrong but im sure i read somewhere that the official guide for the game recommends to get that achievement use the offline method so surely it will be ok and waiting a year for 1 achievement is this away to try to stop people trading the game in

<p>im kinda conflicted on it. &nbsp;i personally am not going to do it, i will wait and do them on the specific days although i do think thats a stupid way to program an achievement. &nbsp;that said i can't necessarily blame or be upset with people who do do it offline
 and i think a reset of their score is a bit harsh. &nbsp; your punishing people who PAY to be on xbox live but if someone didn't have XBL and bought the game, there would be no issue or punishment. &nbsp;additionally, its a single player game and really effects no one.
 &nbsp;but obviously, MS has language written on how they want achievements to be done.</p>
<p>people *should* be buying and playing games for the gameplay, not to hear a "ding" and see a box pop up (granted many people do get games for this reason).</p>
<p>i agree. &nbsp;its a grey area and i can see both sides.</p>

<p>In Halo Reach, people were cheating by going offline &amp; back on to reset the daily challanges to gain cR.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>They reset people's Rank and banned them from getting cR for a week or so, which is a game specific thing. AND BUNGIE did that, not Microsoft.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>No one's gamerscore or even their Reach achievements were reset.... Just rank. and a cR ban. &nbsp; &nbsp;Some people I played with were reset.. Not that special really.. I wish my rank were reset. I'm a big target when I enter a lobby if my rank is higher than other

    <title>Should players with gamerscore resets ever get a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hkk finesse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should players with gamerscore resets ever get a &#38;quot&#59;real&#38;quot&#59; second chance&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>(If you don't want to read some of what I said and discuss it, and are only here to say "you got what was coming", click the arrow in the corner :P)</p>
<p>Before I start, I'm just going to say I'm not requesting an appeal, expect an appeal, or even believe anyone who will tell me I will get an appeal on my gamerscore reset(no one is going to say that because from what I've seen people on these forums actually
 know what they're talking about). I got an Xbox 360 when I was around 11, I'd played Halo on the original Xbox back on the OXM disc with my brother and Halo has remained my favorite franchise since then. I didn't have Live on my 360 for about a year, then
 when I finally got it I spent God knows how much time playing Halo 3 and CoD 4 matchmaking. Shortly thereafter, I used a flash drive to mod my gamerscore when a friend told me how to do it and told me I wouldn't get banned. What went through my head at the
 time, I'm not too sure, but the funniest part is how naive I was and how exactly everything went down.</p>
<p>To make things simple and sweet, the program I used had a function to "unlock all offline", or you just double click achievement by achievement. I literally read "unlock all offline" and believed when I was logged on offline I'd have the achievements to
 admire and look at, and when I was online, poof, I couldn't get banned because they wouldn't be there. Stupid, yet in my head it made sense and I wanted to look at a big number when my Ethernet wasn't plugged in.</p>
<p>I get online and there's my gamerscore, so I freaked out and called Microsoft support; I talked to a guy and told him my friend modded my gamerscore and I can't change it and don't want to get banned(partially true, but still a stupid lie in hopes of not
 getting in trouble). I wish I was making this up but this is sadly what happened, 2 years later, I'd earned maybe 15-20k worth of achievements on top of the 50k or so I had modded, plus the 9k I orginally had without being reset. So I didn't have a whole lot
 of achievements(legit) compared to many of you, but when I was reset back when Halo:Reach came out it sucked to see that my Halo 3 armors all said "locked" besides Recon(everything on there was legitimate, I promise you). The same goes for Gears of War and
 ultimately, I haven't modded a game since.</p>
<p>This means Microsoft's system for gamerscore resets work, sort of. If I wasn't reset, I would've eventually modded some games or added some achievement I couldn't earn and time-stamped them, but I haven't because I learned from that reset, and I never want
 to see that 0 again. I got what was coming and now my gamerscore will never show what I've really earned, and I can only blame myself for that. My only question is, why is it that I can't go back and earn those achievements I had really earned legitimately,
 and the ones I "earned" illegitimately?</p>
<p>Like I said, I &nbsp;don't expect an appeal, but is there anyone else that actually learned from their reset and is reminded of it every time they see that low number? My Cheater zone is now gone, it's back to recreational or pro but I can never go play Halo
 3, Assassin's Creed I, or Oblivion and admire what I did do or get those numbers up to 1k or 1750. I can only think of the stupid thing I did back when I was in middle-school. The reason I'm just now wanting to say something about this is because I've been
 playing Destiny a lot, and I'm 1 away from having all the achievements thus far. It reminded me of when I played games for achievements and to compete with friends.</p>
<p>So, do you think it would be fair to reset ALL achievements, even ones earned legitimately? Then allow that player to legitimately earn any achievements they previously had and future achievements. or...</p>
<p>Is it better to reset ALL achievements, and never let those players who learned from their mistakes legitimately earn achievements from games they've already played, and only future achievements?</p>
<p>The last option I could come up with, which a lot of you would pick, is insta-ban everyone who cheats or mods like this. Which is most fair of the 3, and which is the most realistic to you?</p>
<p>One last thing though, I still had the ability to just make a new account and ditch the old one, but I didn't because I wanted to keep my game ranks and unlocks of course. If the same person can just go and make a new account and cancel their old subscription,
 why not just make it so they get a "real" second chance to play fair with the rest of the Xbox community? That seems like fair punishment to me, people will still lose what they earned legitimately because of their decision to mod, and that alone is punishment
 enough... and hey, just leave that Cheater zone permanently so no matter what, people know that you have had an issue with playing fair and if it really is a big deal to them, they can avoid you.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for hearing me out if you really did read all of that, and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>I think all accounts with modded gamerscore should be permanently banned.</p>
<p>It falls into the same section of the code of conduct as modding avatars and games, both of which results in permanent bans, or at least it did at one point.</p>
<p>I don`t get why modding your GS is any less a "crime" than any other form, yet doesn`t even get you a &nbsp;temporary suspension, most of the time.</p>

<p>I enjoy how straight to the point - no bull - about how you did it and accept the fact that the damage has been done.
</p>
<p>But the fact is, still, you cheated to get a better gamerscore and you have been punished by having all your existing achievements stripped from you. Your punishment for cheating was losing all the achievements you had legitimately earned alongside the modded
 ones meaning even if you did it legit, you can't go back and unlock them again to boost your score back up.</p>
<p>But, tbh, you have more respect from me for moving on from it and keeping the same account.</p>

<p>I think it's fine. If someone wants to rebuild their gamerscore, they have to do it the fair and honest way and not by cheating like they once did.
</p>
<p>I think people should get one big time warning if they mod their gamer score, than if done again, a ban should be in order. For more serious offenses, a ban would be a good idea.

<p>The thing with gamerscore cheating is its only the cheaters who are wasting time.</p>
<p>Now if someone found a way to make a program that can unlock achievements without earning them, to an extent you can appreciate there talent. None the less though its against the rules, just as it is for someone who gains entrance to a building by fiddling
 with the lock instead of using a key.</p>
<p>The reason gamerscore cheating is a waste of time though is because of what it is... cheating. Maybe someone in the world is making profit from it, but on a mass scale all people are doing is denying themselves the ability to develop a certain skill, which
 in this case is getting better at a particular video game section.</p>
<p>No one likes cheaters. They're in the same league as liars, rats and selfish people. There purpose is pointless and no one wants to relate to them if they're found out.</p>
<p>Is doing the wrong thing tempting? Course it is because its so much easier and a weakness of human nature. But its just not worth it in the end.
</p>
<p>This is why I'm always the good guy in gaming. Good guys get all the best and challenging missions, where as your bad character gets the quick and easy method with a little extra coin. Then as the bad character you get to the end and found out how much you
 missed out on when others talk about the good character playthrough. </p>

<h2>            &#34;Getting Windows Ready..&#34; for 12 hours now. Has been happening for the 3rd time now.</h2>
                    Hello. I have this constant problem that hinders with my schoolwork/Gaming. Whenever I'm playing a game, or playing music while I'm studying or doing work, the sound just glitches out and sometimes screeches. I would restart my computer to get rid of that
 issue, but I run into another issue.<span> "GETTING WINDOWS READY. DON'T TURN OFF THE COMPUTER." This lasted about and hour the first time, but the second and third time it lasted even longer. What's going on with my computer , and why I can't do
 basic things such as listening to music while typing up a document?</span>

            You should try running SFC / DISM. System file check (SFC) is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption. The sfc /scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.  When it cannot repair the damage, DISM should be run to fix as many errors as possible.

            Hi Sam.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.   
<br />
<br />Please run the Sound Playback troubleshooter at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If no Updates listed this could also be the latest Windows 10 Version 1709 Update which you can check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About and if necessary roll back at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery, then hide with the tool given above to wait for it to mature.  
<br />
<br />Or if this is what's hanging you can try the most stable method to update to the latest version (which you need anyway) by installing  Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try performing a repair upgrade:

<p><span>Thank you for visiting Windows Vista Community. Your post is out of scope for the Windows Vista Community forum as well as out of
 our expertise. </span></p>
<p><span>There is not an avenue to see or get your Product Key from a computer. There are 3rd party applications available that would allow
 an end user to do this. We are unable to recommend any of them since it would be against our policy. A well phrased search in your favorite search engine should provide you the appropriate means. We may also suggest you contacting Toshiba the maker of your
 new laptop.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I am trying to resolve a boot issue with my neighbor's LENOVO G580 laptop.<br />
It came pre-installed with Windows 8.<br />
It crashed with the following error:<br />
<br />
~~~~<br />
Your PC needs to be repaired<br />
<br />
<em>The operating system couldn't be loaded because the kernel is missing or contains errors.</em><br />
<br />
File:\windows\system32\ntoskrnl.exe<br />
Error code:0xc00185<br />
<br />
You'll need to use the recovery tools on your installation media.<br />
If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your system administrator or PC manufacturer.<br />
~~~~<br />
<br />
1. Laptop will not boot to desktop.<br />
2. I do not have any installation media nor the Windows product key.<br />
3. I have tried the Lenovo OneKey Rescue Button to no avail.<br />
&nbsp; a. Normal Startup<br />
&nbsp; b. BIOS Setup<br />
&nbsp; c. Boot Menu<br />
-&gt;d. System Recovery<br />
<br />
After selecting Option D. as directed by Lenovo Support, then it displays:<br />
-Loading files....<br />
-Lenovo logo<br />
then blank, Blue screen, and does not go beyond that.<br />
<br />
How do I resolve this Windows 8 error?<br />
My neighbor does not want to pay for the Windows 8 product key offered from Lenovo Support.

</p><p>RE: Question 1.<br />
<br />
The Lenovo Novo Button Menu offers the following options:<br />
&nbsp; a. Normal Startup<br />
&nbsp; b. BIOS Setup<br />
&nbsp; c. Boot Menu<br />
&nbsp; d. System Recovery<br />
<br />
I chose Option D.<br />
<br />
It then displays:<br />
-Loading files....<br />
-Lenovo logo<br />
then a blank, Blue screen, and does not go beyond that, regardless of how long I may wait.<br />
<br />
RE: Question 2.<br />
There are no external devices connected to the laptop.<br />
There was a USB receiver for the wireless mouse. I removed it, but the same issue remains.<br />
<br />
RE: Method 1.<br />
My neighbor does not have a Windows 8 product key, and is unwilling to pay for it.<br />
However, I am in agreement...it should have come with the purchase of the laptop...as my did Windows 7 laptop.<br />
<br />
RE: Method 2.<br />
Unable to accomplish due to stated error message.<br />
<br />
RE: Method 3.<br />
Unable to accomplish due to stated error message.<br />
<br />
---<br />
Here is something I forgot to mention...<br />
At the bottom of the error message window, there are several other options:<br />
<br />
Press Enter to try again<br />
Press F8 for Startup Settings<br />
Press Esc for UEFI Firmware Settings<br />
<br />
If I select F8, I am offered the following options:<br />
<br />
1) Enable debugging<br />
2) Enable boot logging<br />
3) Enable low-resolution<br />
4) Enable Safe Mode<br />
5) Enable Safe Mode with Networking<br />
6) Enable Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
7) Disable driver signature enforcement<br />
8) Disable early launch anti-malware protection<br />
9) Disable automatic restart after failure<br />
<br />
I tried each option without success.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply, appreciate the time taken by you in keeping us updated on the status of the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have already tried all the advanced boot options without success, we're left with only option to try other Windows recovery options through Windows installation disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As your neighbor bought this computer with Windows 8 preinstalled, he must be under license agreement and should get his/her product key from the computer manufacturer for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the product key you can create a new Windows 8 installation media and proceed with the recovery process.

            I called Lenovo Support this past Friday, 05 Dec, and they told me the following in reference to acquiring the product key:<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
- They do not/did not keep the product keys for their laptops (I think they do this based upon time since laptop was purchased. It has been 2-3 years since my neighbor bought the laptop).<br />
- The product key is coded into the motherboard (I guess via ROM, NVRAM, etc.).<br />
- They offer a Windows Recovery Disc for $69 that will bypass the product key.<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
As I mentioned, my neighbor does not want to pay for the Recovery Disc offered by Lenovo.<br />
At this point, are we out of options for resolving this issue?<br />
Am I at a point of installing LINUX on the laptop?

            <p>Hello Jc, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since none of the boot menu or recovery options work and also considering the fact that you do not have a recovery disc, cant even create an installation media in the absence of your product key, we're left with no choice than&nbsp;performing a fresh install

            I am quite appreciative of your assistance! Since the laptop is not mine, I will not try any 3rd party software to pull the product key without my neighbor's approval. However, my neighbor is contemplating the purchase of the recovery disc. So, I guess
 there might be a resolution after all.<br />
<br />
I do have a few more questions if the recovery disc does not work:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1) Is it possible to resolve the ntoskrnl.exe file issue by pulling the ntoskrnl.exe file from my Windows 7 laptop and creating a boot device?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2) I recently purchased Windows 8.1 for a desktop I plan to build. Would it be possible to do the same thing noted in Ques. 1, except pull it from that desktop?

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your reply. It’s very nice of you that you are helping your neighbor in getting his issue resolved, I really appreciate this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Looks like there are major system files corruptions and even recovery partition is damaged and hence it’s not even able to initiate the recovery process. Since, we’ve already tried almost all the possible ways of recovering Windows without success,
 I’m not very hopeful if we’ll be able to recover it even if your neighbor buys the recovery disc.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To answer your questions.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>It’s not possible to pull a particular file (ntoskernal.exe) from one operating System and insert in another to get the computer working. Windows can be recovered with the complete operating system setup file or recovery files.</span></li><li><span>Windows 8 cannot be recovered with a Windows 8.1 media and product key, however, if you have a Windows 8 product key, you can create an installation media and use your product key to recover Windows. Note: One product key can be used on only one computer
 at a time.</span></li></ol>

<h3> clement70  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot enable audio device</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a laptop Toshiba Tecra M11 with W7 64 pro.<br />
After a windows update I do not have any more sound.<br />
I cannot enable the audio device.</p>
<p>- I do not have a restore point to use<br />
- I have tried to disable/enable the sound card<br />
- I have tried to de-install and re-install the sound card<br />
- I have tried both drivers, 1 from the Toshiba support website, one from the sound card manufacturer, REaltek. Both not working<br />
- Windows device manager tells that the sound card is working properly even if there is a cross (white cross inside a red circle) telling 'No speakers or headphones are plugged in".<br />
- After running the Troubleshooter, I am told the audio device is disable. I cannot enable it.</p>
<p>I would like some sound...</p>
<p>Any help ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Clement</p>

<p><span>Hi Clement70,</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry to know the issue still persists. Usually reinstalling the right drivers should fix this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the devices are listed in the control panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 start &gt;&gt; Control Panel &gt;&gt; Sound</span></p>
<p><span><span>B.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>See
 if the devices are listed.</span></p>
<p><span><span>C.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 the devices are listed then select a device and click on properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>D.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>See
 which option is selected next to device usage.</span></p>
<p><span><span>E.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>It
 should show as “Use this device (enable). If you do not see this option, try changing and check if you get sound on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not help you may try to uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers once again.<span>&nbsp;</span>Download the latest drivers from
 Realtek and install it on your computer</span></p>

<h2>            Web sites report wrong loction in internet explorer 10 and Firefox</h2>
                    <p>When I go into the Staples.com web sire, and ask to see the week's ad, it report them for a store that is about 60 miles north of where I live. Similarly, when I go to Redlobster.com, and ask to see a menu, it shows a list of restaurants from the same area
 as Staples. Both of these businesses have locations with 2 miles of my house. I am connecting to the internet via a FIOS Wi-Fi connection on my laptop, and an Ethernet connection on my desktop. B oth are using the same erroneous location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens with both IE 10 (desktop and app), and in Firefox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I launch the Windows 8 Map app, it correctly identifies my location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea why this behavior is present?</p>

<h2>            I don&#39;t have a safety remove hardware icon and I have tried running commands and everything but it is nowhere.</h2>
                    I have a windows 10 acer laptop, with a removable keyboard. Every time I remove my keyboard and put it back on again, I get a notification telling me to use the safety hardware function. I have no idea where this is or how to find it. I searched my problem
 up on the internet, and it told me to open run, then write a command, then choose what piece I was ejecting and so on, but my removable keyboard never came up. This is my school laptop and I'm worried I'll lose work if I can't find the safety remove hardware
 function.

            <p>Sorry, I may have done something wrong, but when I click on the shortcut, it takes me to the box saying at the top, "safely remove hardware"</p>
<p>Then it says:</p>
<p>"Select the device you want to unplug or eject, and then click Stop. When windows notifies you that it is safe to do so unplug the device from your computer"</p>
<p>Then it has a list of devices to unplug, but none of them are my removable keyboard.

<h2>            Windows App, Windows 8.1, Sorry, there was a problem. Please try again later.</h2>
                    <p><span>When I open Photo App on Windows 8.1 I get this error when looking under “Pictures library” and under “OneDrive”,
<strong>“Sorry, there was a problem. Please try again later.”</strong> Those are the only options from the drop down at the top. I have referred to numerous help documents and attempted many different ways to fix this. The different fixes I have attempted are;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>Make sure your PC is up to date</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Make sure the latest updates are installed on your PC and that your antivirus program isn't preventing the app from running. For more info on installing updates for your PC, see Windows Update: Frequently
 asked questions.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Make sure the app isn't blocked by Windows Firewall</span></strong></p>

<p><span>By default, some apps are blocked by Windows Firewall to help make your PC more secure. To work properly, you might need to allow an app to receive info through the firewall. For more info, see the
 "Allow an app to receive info through the firewall" section of Windows Firewall from start to finish.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Make sure your apps are up to date</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Keeping your app up to date is one way to help keep them working. You can do this by making sure that automatic app updates are turned on in the Windows Store. For more info, see Turn on automatic
 app updates.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Sync app licenses</span></strong></p>

<p><span>If a license for an app is out of sync with the license installed on your PC, the app might stop working.</span></p>

<p><span>To sync your app licenses, follow these steps:</span></p>

<p><span>1. On the Start screen, tap or click Store to open the Windows Store.
</span></p>

<p><span>2. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Settings.</span></p>

<p><span>(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click Settings.)
</span></p>

<p><span>3.Tap or click App updates.
</span></p>

<p><span>4.Tap or click Sync licenses.</span></p>

<p><span>Reinstall the app</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>If your apps are up to date and the licenses are synced, you can reinstall the app to try to fix the problem.</span></strong></p>

<p><span>To reinstall an app, follow these steps:</span></p>

<p><span>1.On the Start screen, swipe down on or right-click the app you want to uninstall, tap or click Uninstall, and then tap or click Uninstall.</span></p>

<p><span>2.Tap or click Store to open the Windows Store.</span></p>

<p><span>3.Tap or click Account, and then tap or click My apps.</span></p>

<p><span>4.Swipe down on or right-click the app you want to install, and then tap or click Install.
</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Restoring the default libraries.</span></strong></p>

<p><span>1.Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search.</span></p>

<p><span>(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click Search.)</span></p>

<p><span>2. Enter File Explorer in the search box, and then tap or click File Explorer in the results.
</span></p>

<p><span>3. Tap or click the View tab.
</span></p>

<p><span>4. Tap or click Navigation pane and make sure that Show libraries is checked.
</span></p>

<p><span>5. In the left pane, tap or right-click the Libraries folder, and then tap or click Properties.
</span></p>

<p><span>6. Tap or click Restore defaults.
</span></p>

<p><span>7. Tap or click OK. </span>
</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.In Windows 8.1 Photos App, turn off “Shuffle Photos” from the Charms, Settings, Options</span></p>

<p><span>2.Delete the jpg and dat files from AppData\Local\Packages\FileManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState</span></p>

<p><span>and AppData\Local\Packages\FileManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\Settings</span></p>

<p><span>3.Enable Library Options in any Explorer File Folder</span></p>

<p><span>4.Move all pictures out of the Pictures Library folder to a different folder, but then copy that new folder back to it</span></p>

<p><span>5.Enable Thumbnails by unchecking “Always show icons, never thumbnails” in Folder Options</span></p>

</p><p>You might have found that the same problem occurs with all apps when you try to browse files (e.g. try the OneDrive App).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox one power brick not showing any lights after lightning storm</h2>
                    <p>We experienced a heavy lightning storm in my area last night, and a couple lightning strikes occurred nearby. all the electronics in the house seem to have survived except for the Xbox and DSTV decoder. I'm unsure whether the Xbox itself is fried or the power brick is the issue, because the power brick won't show any orange or white light when plugged in. I've followed the reset process of disconnecting the power cables from the wall socket and Xbox and the reconnecting them after a few minutes but still there is no change.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Do I get the power brick replaced only or send in the entire Xbox in case the power brick wasn't able to protect it from a power&nbsp;surge?&nbsp;</p>

<h3> epic_geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Stereo Mix in Windows 7 Please Help&#33; </h2>
                    I've read all over on the internet but none of the solutions help me. I use Stereo Mix to send sounds over MSN using the record button as well as using the mic. The mic works fine in 7 and stereo mix used to work in windowsxp and vista but now in windows
 7 on the same machine (Acer 4420 notebook) there is no stereo mix. I go into the sound control panel then right click and say<br />
<br />
Show disabled devices<br />
Show disconnected devices<br />
<br />
and all that shows up is the monitor microphone, the microphone sound card jack and line-in. I need Stereo Mix to work in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I've written for help on the microsoft answers board twice now and they ignored me, I've asked on yahoo answers, they ignored me. I even wrote to realtek and they have ignored me as well twice now, I will be contacting the better business bureau to complain
 about customer service if I cannot reach a solution. I have been trying to find a solution for a month now!

<h2>            Windows 10 version 1803 and stuttering horrible audio.</h2>
                    Why didn't microsoft make sure the April update worked properly before releasing it? Why do I need to use an outdated system to be able to have audio? Why did my blue tooth quit working after I let someone at microsoft do a remote session? Why does microsoft
 keep telling everyone that automatic updates should always be turned on, but then when the update comes out, they tell you to revert to an outdated version to get the stuff to work?<br />

            MS does make an effort to ensure that new updates work.  The simple reality is that the variety of hardware that Windows runs on is huge. They can't (afford, money and time) to test it on all combinations.  So in a (hopefully) small percent of cases their changes won't work on specific hardware.  They try to deal with it "on the run" as problems are identified.
<br />
<br />As well, in the "new &amp; improved" world of "Software as a Service" where new features are rolled out every 6 months rather than every 2 or 3 years,  **it happens. Every time you make a change to the program code there is a chance of introducing an error. The more changes, the more chances of error, the harder it is to find them all.

            What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />

<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />

<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />If its Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows

            Well, I have a dell (one of the most popular brands of pc's), and it has one of the most popular brands of audio drivers called realtek. I can also get the dell audio driver too, which is another pretty popular driver too. Neither one worked. I used to
 have bluetooth on my pc that worked flawlessly until i let someone from microsoft do a remote session to try and fix the audio problem. Not only did they break my bluetooth, they also never solved the problem. After I had microsoft repeatedly tell me that
 I needed to revert back to an outdated operating system, I refused to do so because I'm not an idiot, and then I wiped the entire pc clean, and started over. This fixed the problem, and I am using build 1803. This is something they told me could not be done.
 It will probably only work until the next update, but I don't really care anymore.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Between them telling me that I needed to accept a security risk in order to have audio that worked properly, and this shady pos that wanted to do a remote session but could not generate the 6 digit number in order for him to be allowed to connect to my pc and
 would not put me through to anyone who could, I am going with a linux based operating system. I used the one I am going to start using again for almost 15 years without any major issues. I'll bet microsoft can't do that. I mean they can't even make sure that
 their updates will work with the most popular software that is currently being used. I'd understand if I had some little known pc with some weird kind of software that nobody has heard of, but this is some of the most widely used software out there, and is
 the most up to date versions of that software. If you can't get that right before you release the updates, then you should not be in the business of making operating systems. If you tell someone that is having issues with your product after the latest update
 that they need to revert back to an outdated version creating a big security issue,&nbsp; and the only other alternative you can come up with is to tell them to accept the fact that their audio does not work properly, and to wait for the company that makes the
 driver to do an update, then maybe tech related jobs are a little beyond your grasp. These are things they actually told me to do. I said no thanks because I want sound that works properly, without any more of a security risk. Is that really too much to ask?&nbsp;
