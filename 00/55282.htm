    <title>Xbox one controller not responding while connected and on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox one controller not responding while connected and on</h2>
                    So this is a bit of a weird issue that I have been experiencing for a couple days now, the two xbox one controllers I have are in good condition and for a long while had no problems well now they connect fine to the xbox one from what it seems but after
 playing for a short time the controller does not respond to any inputs but it still "connected" so to say. I did some research and found that power cycling did help but after it would continue to do this after about 10 minutes the problem would persist. I
 have a feeling it has something to do with the xbox one itself as both controllers would experience the same issue even though one would be off and i would switch to the other. I feel like I shouldnt have to power cycle my xbox every 10-20 minutes to fix an
 issue that keeps happening. So i need some solution to this and hopefully find a way to fix this once and for all.

            Unfortunately this is not the case, I do not tamper with the mapping settings and both controllers are up to date with their firmware. I do not know the cause of this as the controller at one point just stops taking in inputs and turning the controller
 off and on do not do anything. I have to reset my xbox for it to work and i feel i shouldnt have to be doing that for it to work.

            I just checked today with the controller updates and both controllers i have are up to date. I wish this was the case but I made sure to check that and even made sure to check but unfortunately I do not know where else to look but here.

<p>There are a few other things you could try:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>How far away are you from your console?</strong> You can try to move closer to your console and try to eliminate as many obstructions (other computers, shelves, take it out of an entertainment center, etc) between the controller and console.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Do you have any accessories attached?</strong> If so, remove these and test your results.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Do you have a micro-USB?</strong> If so, connect it to your console and controller and see if you still are receiving disruptions when trying to play.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Do you have other blue-tooth enabled devices turned on?</strong>&nbsp;Try turning these off one by one. I know it seems silly, but sometimes other devices can actually be running on the same frequency and cause periodic disruptions in signal.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>If all else fails, you can can always send your device in to get <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">repaired</a>&nbsp;</strong><br />

            I thought there was something wrong with my controllers as well but I don't think that is the case, when it happened to the first controller I was using I then thought to just switch over to my other one but I then noticed it was having the same issue
 as the one before. It would connect but no inputs were going through. I then turned both on and see if anything would happen and odd enough both experienced the same issue at the same exact time. I knew it went wrong because the light on the home button goes
 a bit brighter when the inputs stop going through. <br />

            Distance wise in my usual spot maybe 8-9 feet and there is no obstructions in the way of the xbox, I also did try usb connection with both and they experienced the same issue at the same exact time. It be weird to assume both controllers are bad when one
 is just barely a year old and the other is the original i got when i got the xbox one. As for bluetooth there are no devices that are connected in that way near the xbox or connected to the xbox via bluetooth nor any accessories.<br />

            The first question is did you move, rename or delete any of the source pictures?&nbsp; WLMM doesn't store a second copy of any of the source files (that would be inefficient and unnecessary); it just stores a list of the file names and locations. But if you
 have changed the file that was pointed to, WLMM will show you a yellow triangle with exclamation point instead.<br />
<br />
If you moved or renamed them, navigate to the new location or find the new file name.&nbsp; If you deleted them, go to your recycle bin and restore them.<br />
<br />
If you did none of these things, please provide more details on what else might have happened since you were last working on the project.

            Thanks for your reply.<br />
This 1st time I copied pictures I took them from a thrumb drive without storing them on my computer.<br />
So I figured that was why they didn't save <br />
So then I copied all of them to my picture library.<br />
BUT maybe ........<br />
I did&nbsp;some moving and rearranging&nbsp;in my attempt to better organaize my pictures!&nbsp;&nbsp; Boy - I've created lots of work for myself.
<br />
So you're&nbsp;saying that when I create a movie in WLMM that it doesn't copy the picture into the movie but whenever I open the project&nbsp;<br />
the WLMM looks for the picture where it is stored?&nbsp; <br />
But I'll be able to save this movie to a DVD to play elsewhere - won't I?<br />
Thanks much!

            Hi <span>Bouchelle,<br />
<br />
[quote user=Bouchelle]This 1st time I copied pictures I took them from a thrumb drive without storing them on my computer.<br />
So I figured that was why they didn't save <br />
So then I copied all of them to my picture library[/quote]<br />
<br />
After copying them on your computer and still you are seeing&nbsp;the yellow exclamation marks on the storyboard, what you could do is double-click them and find the new location of the pictures you have added on your project.

<br />
Yes, that is right. Windows Live Movie Maker does not copy the picture into the movie. So it depends on where you have stored the image that you have added on your project, that is the reason why you see a yellow exclamation point on the project file that you
 have created.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes you can. As long as you have done editing the movie project without any error messages, you can save your movie to a DVD. You could download and install Windows DVD Maker and use it to create a DVD. Please go to this

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Think of your project like a recipe.&nbsp; It might contain the words "eggs," "flour," and "sugar" as some of the ingredients, but the printed recipe doesn't contain the actual ingredients, just the instructions for putting things together.&nbsp; (It would be silly
 for a cookbook to come with a copy of every single ingredient within the pages of the book.&nbsp; It would make for a really big book, and possibly multiple copies of the same ingredients.)<br />
<br />
Similarly, your WLMM project just contains a list of ingredients (photos, videos, music), but it expects you to tell it where to find them on your computer.&nbsp; If you move any of those things around, WLMM is unable to find those things anymore.&nbsp; It's like you
 decided to take the sugar, eggs and flour from your kitchen and decided to put them all in the garage.&nbsp; Now when it comes time to try and bake your cake, WLMM can't find the ingredients.&nbsp; You can either put everything back where WLMM expects to find them,
 or you can click the 'Fix' button and tell Movie Maker that you moved them to the garage to go look for them there instead.<br />
<br />
Along the same lines, your final movie is the result of following all the instructions in the recipe (project) to bake your cake.&nbsp; Once everything is in the cake you can share that with your family and friends.&nbsp; Happy baking!&nbsp; (I mean movie making!)

<p>
</p><p><span>The issue appears to happen with both the desktop shortcut and when you try to access them using web-browser?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it is confined to the desktop shortcut then you re-create the shortcut icons.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You have to stretch the window manually probably because&nbsp;in Windows 7 any window that is opened&nbsp;will have the same size and location of whatever window was last opened. It does not retain its own size and position characteristics. If you have closed&nbsp;the
 last&nbsp;window which was open with half screen then when you re-open any application it will remember the settings&nbsp;and will open the window in a half screen.</span></p>

<h2>            Task Scheduler &#38; Idle Settings, Annoyances That Hopefully Can be Changed</h2>
                    <p>Task Scheduler and Idle Mode are always running on&nbsp;&amp; off and I can't find their settings. Meaning, when my computer is idle for 4 minutes the control center icon shows a clock indicating a schedule task is taking place. When I'm reading a lengthy article
 I have to remember to move my mouse around&nbsp;within 4 minutes to prevent tasks from starting, if I don't&nbsp;1-2 minutes&nbsp;after it starts I need to scroll down the screen to continue reading and it stops anyway. I don't know if that constantly happening can cause&nbsp;errors
 of other problems&nbsp;in my computer, but it's annoying especially when I'm running a scan, I have to&nbsp;babysit my computer and move the mouse because I don't know&nbsp;what task is being run or if that task&nbsp;will conflict with&nbsp;the scan I started. Or if&nbsp;their combined
 resource pulling will crash my computer since just one running by itself raise resources high.&nbsp;Especially the task scheduler,&nbsp;when computer goes to sleep&nbsp;and task scheduler&nbsp;starts, when I wake up my computer the app I had open will crash, it takes a long time
 for cpu and/or disk to come out of the red back down to normal, and from there I&nbsp;sometimes I to restart my computer because it becomes slow and games like Microsoft Solitaire start having&nbsp;issues&nbsp;of lagging graphics.
</p>
<p>But I'm mainly worried that all of the above is due to malware. I've been having a very difficult time removing malware/adware from my computer because I can't find the rootkit. None of Microsoft's scans can remove it (including Windows Defender Offline).
 Adcleaner, Junkware Cleaner, Malwarebytes free anti-malware, TDS Killer, RKill, can't find and remove this threat. Hitman Pro found 8 tracking cookies but no more after that, Super Anti-Spyware free edition found 388 tracking cookies&nbsp;it's first scan, the second
 time 54 &amp; 13 in the same day, 146 the next day,&nbsp;and 13 today after&nbsp;I did a scan with ESET online scanner which found a&nbsp;PUP, Win32/Bundled.Toolbar.Google.D. I don't know if it's gone because the scan did not give confirmation and I clicked&nbsp;delete it, I only
 got a screen to buy&nbsp;or try one of their products. And the tracking cookies are the same ones every time, as soon as I get rid of them the come right back because I can't find the rootkit and installer. Either way I still need to change the idle time limit
 and task schedulers time, how please?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. My anti-virus is Windows Defender, I believe I've ran every Microsoft scan which is Microsoft Saftey Scanner, Malicious Software Removal Tool, and Windows Defender Offline. None of them have found anything except once the Malicious
 Software Removal Tool while scanning detected one file but I don't know what it was because towards the end of the scan&nbsp;I had task manager open watching for any unknown processes popping up and 2 console window hosts popped up and suddenly the progress bar
 zipped across the screen and the scan finished with nothing found.&nbsp;The reason I had the task manager open was because I suspected something was shutting down the Windows Defender scan when I ran it. But after that happened with the malicious software scan
 I reran it again but nothing was found it didn't even detect that file infected file again. So I ran Windows Defender Offline that came up empty too.&nbsp;And your question about uninstalling programs,&nbsp;I did get rid of a few that I wasn't using. But the ones that
 are left I don't know exactly what they are&nbsp;or&nbsp;do but I trust their publisher names&nbsp;which are Microsoft, HP, Cyber Link, Real Tek, Apple Inc., Igor Pavlov, and Skype.&nbsp;I just noticed maybe I can get rid of more. I have&nbsp;21 programs that date back to 2013. In
 programs it looks like there are some old versions of Microsoft Visual C ++ dated 2013 and some dated 2015, there are 15 in total. After I check to see if all of the 2013s and 2015s are the same, is it safe to uninstall the 2013 versions?&nbsp;Should 'Microsoft
 SQL Server&nbsp;2005 Compact Edition [ENU] version 3.1.0000 installed 7/24/2013', be updated if so how do I update it? I'm also having a problem with action center giving me this message 'Verify Your Identity On This PC' I don't trust it so I signed into my account
 at Microsoft website but that message won't go away. Last, every time I close Internet Explorer in task manager it drops from listed Apps to Background Processes where after a minute of it sitting there 3-4 unknown&nbsp;Rundll32 host processes pop up&nbsp;then IE and
 Rundll disappear at the same time.&nbsp;There are also 2 COM Surrogate processes that behave weird too, they always disappear after when I open task manager along with the CPU&nbsp;being&nbsp;80-90% but then drops quickly down to 0 when COM Surrogate disappear. I think that
 stuff is malware related because I did take steps to try and solve those problems along my computer being slow. I did a reset, followed the guide for trouble shooting performance issues, updating, maintenance tasks, freeing disk space, ran app troubleshooter
 and updater, synced licenses, ran maintenance troubleshooter, SFC scan, and DISM scan&nbsp;to fix corrupted AMD 64 files that Sfc scan couldn't. None of that has had any effect on those processes or the 13 svc hosts that are always running.&nbsp;No offense but I don't
 care how many people tell me that 13 of those things running at the same time is normal. I think 13 is over&nbsp;kill for a computer that is&nbsp;only used for Microsoft Casual Games, Streaming music, and quickie social moments on Facebook. I would love to hear your
 opinon on all of that and I'll report back and let you know about&nbsp;those programs. Thank you helping me.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>MS Surface Pro 3 USB and keyboard issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dfidler  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Surface Pro 3 USB and keyboard issues</h2>
                    <p>I have two/several problems with my SP3 that i'm trying to get to the bottom of which all seem to have to do with connected devices. &nbsp;I'll list them both just in case they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Keyboard Issue</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When "mobile" with just my SP3 + keyboard, the keyboard will suddenly stop working. &nbsp;The net says "power button plus volume up" but if I did that every time my keyb stopped working I'd never get more than about 2 mins work done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What seems to be unique about my problem is that the issue occurs seems to occur under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I keep typing and don't allow any "breaks" when I type, the keyboard will not shut off. &nbsp;However, if I stop using the keyboard for a short period to use the touchscreen (like if I am using the touchscreen to scroll through web pages), it stops responding.</li><li>Sometimes the issue happens for weeks on end, making the system basically unusable with the SP keyboard</li><li>Pressing the "power button" twice, quickly to turn off the screen and then back on again makes the keyboard work again</li><li>Sometimes, the keyboard will magically just start working again after 20-30 mins</li><li>Re-seating the keyboard doesn't work</li><li>The backlight on the keyboard stays on</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So what appears to be happening is that windows just decides to stop responding to keyboard events from my SP keyboard and giving the power button a kick seems to make it work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have a USB keyboard also attached at the time, the keyboard works, but my SP3 keyboard doesn't. &nbsp;So I'm guessing that the SP3 keyboard is not a USB device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>USB Issues on the surface dock</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I spend most of my day with my SP3 connected to the new version of the surface dock (and I have a fan blowing over it to control heat). &nbsp;Several times throughout my workday (I'd say about 2-3 times per hour) all USB peripherals shut off and the SP3 seems
 to lose comms with the dock. &nbsp;Any putty sessions that I have open disconnect and power is lost to my USB devices. &nbsp;I might have thought that this was an issue with the dock but I had exactly the same issue with the old SP3 docking station (the standup one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this one - all USB devices just shut off and lose power and then come back on 2s later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that I don't know if these two are related (I'm suspecting not, but you never know).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier this evening, when this happened again, i checked the system events and found the following warning:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"The description for Event ID 263 from source Win32k cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on the local computer.</em></p>
<p><em>If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.</em></p>
<p><em>The following information was included with the event:&nbsp;</em><br />
</p>
<p><em>The specified resource type cannot be found in the image file"</em><br />
</p>
<p>I do see the following errors appear repeatedly in the event logs several times per day:</p>
<ul>
<li>The server {37998346-3765-45B1-8C66-AA88CA6B20B8} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.</li><li>The Connected Devices Platform Service service terminated with the following error: &nbsp;Unspecified error</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The event errors above appear elsewhere on the net but I haven't seen anyone come to a successful resolution on them. &nbsp;And my keyboard issue appears to be completely unique (or I'm using the wrong search terms). &nbsp;Any help or guidance on where to look would
 be appreciated.</p>

dfidler</a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's try and fix these inconsistencies by starting on the basic troubleshooting. Make sure that all
<strong>Surface Updates</strong> are installed by going to <strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows updates &gt; Check for updates</strong>. It is advised that you do this with all the peripherals attached to the device (Dock, Mouse, Keyboard).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the keyboard concern, follow the steps we provided on this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-surface-keyboards?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.
 You can also reinstall the Keyboard driver using <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/005a1acb-776e-4320-b9f2-3a2302a320da/open-device-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Manager</a></strong>. Take not that after
 uninstalling the keyboard driver, all you need to do is restart the device and the driver should automatically be reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you use the <strong>Surface Dock updater</strong> tool found on this
<strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/surface/surface-dock-updater" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to ensure that all firmware updates are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>How do I change or set file associations when not an adminstrator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laksa  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change or set file associations when not an adminstrator</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have two logons for my work machine one with administrator rights and one without. For day to day work I
<b>have</b> to use the one without administrator rights. If I want to install software I have to run the installation as an administrator.<br />
<br />
The program I have just installed is UltraEdit and would like to associate .txt, .properties, .log etc files with UltraEdit.<br />
<br />
Using Start ! Default Programs ! Associate a file type or protocol with a program" does not work. i.e. I select the extension I want to associate browse to where I have UltraEdit, select Open and the resulting "Open with" window does not display UltraEdit as
 a option under other programs.<br />
<br />
Suggestions please.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
-&nbsp;&nbsp; what exactly happens when you try to browse for the program?<br />
<br />
You do not need administrator rights to set the default association.<br />
<br />
<br />
As long as you can run the program normally, you will be able to browse to the program and select it as the default.<br />

            It sounds like there's a problem with your profile. Try creating a new standard account and check if the same thing occurs using that account or if you are able to successfully set your defaults. Assuming it works, see the corrupt profile link below.<br />

    <title>Xbox 360 S Will Not Load Dashboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tumidtarsier700  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 S Will Not Load Dashboard</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox 360 slim worked one day, the next day I turn it on and It will not load the dashboard, it just shows the two circles spinning forever. When I try to use the button in the controller to bring the pop-up menu, it freezes the whole system once i click
 any option! So I cannot clear the system cache like recommended! I do not have a hard drive, it is internal, so i cant remove it to turn on without it. I tried holding the sync button and turning the console on, but that didn't work, it doesn't even make it
 to the spinning circles, it freezes on the logo screen! Please help, I don't want to send it to be repaired and them say there is nothing wrong with it when there obviously is.</p>
<p>P.S. I have not downloaded any updates recently.</p>

I know you don't want to send it in for a repair, but it sounds like you need to.

<p>I've been having the same problem. It takes like 15 minutes to even get to the dashboard, I've cleared the cache, removed the hard drive, and still the same thing. It will not connect to Xbox Live and when I go to play any game it takes 10 minutes to load
 it. When I'm finally in a game (not online) it lags like crazy and doesn't stop. Can we get any help with this problem?</p>

<p>You could try a factory reset to see if that brings the 4gb internal back, remove your HDD (if you have one) and all portable USB drives and then do the following which works with the recent dash.</p>

<h3> durahl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost and Found&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings Everyone!<br />
<br />
I just received my Surface Book i7 with Performance Base and while setting it up I was reminded of the recent story of the daughter of my mothers friend loosing her MacBook when she ran for the bus leaving it behind on the Bench never to be seen again *such
 tragedy* *many sad* * just wow*</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... Glancing over it's surface ( heh ) and the various settings I wasn't able to find any feature that would aid a finder of the Surface Book to know who to contact in order to return it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only <em>viable</em> solution ( no Stickers, Engravings, Lasering ) I could come up so far was by replacing the Sign-In Background Image with a custom one containing some contact information but then I'd loose the Windows Spotlight Feature which I still
 found kind of neat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there maybe a more elegant solution to this available like a built in or 3rd Party App that can be tied to the Sign-In Screen similar to the Weather/Calendar/Mail App to be populated with contact information of the owners choice and be able read by anyone
 without Login credentials?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance =)</p>

<p>I wish that I thought others were as honest as you apparently do. It may depend on where you live. Sadly, the bulk of folks that lose a device like this never see it again. If you are really concerned, you can purchase something like
<a href="http://www.lojack.com/Laptops" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.lojack.com/Laptops</a> -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Putting contact info on the signin screen is an invitation for identity theft if it is an unscrupulous person that finds a device and in my opinion, it is the last thing you'd want to do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Above is obviously MY opinion..</p>

<p>The thought was more along the line that even if someone <em>wanted </em>to return it they couldn't as, by default, there is no information available to them to do so.<br />
<br />
Living in Switzerland this <strong>LoJack </strong>thing doesn't exactly appear to be a viable solution to me =)<br />
<br />
A variation to the contact information idea would be to buy a Tag from the local Post Office ( normally used for Lost Keys to be anonymously returned to their owners ) and
<em>duplicate</em> it's information to the Sign-In Screen with some instructions on how to use it.<br />
<br />
Who ever finds it would only have to drop it off at the next Post Office with the rest then being taken care of by the Post Office who would either ship it to me or ( most likely ) call for Pick-Up as they would have the information necessary to contact me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gonna have to investigate a little deeper into this.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 keeps deleting my Microsoft Office - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps deleting my Microsoft Office</h2>
                    <p>For some strange reason Windows 10 keeps getting rid of my Microsoft Office every time I reset or turn off my computer. I've had to install it now 3 times, and every time it keeps getting rid of it, or it disappears. The strange thing is when I go to programs
 under control panel, my Microsoft office 365 Pro Plus is there and I have to do a repair on it. It will install them again, but then they will disappear again after starting up my laptop.</p>
<p>my tiles in the start menu had disappeared too, and I've had to add the ones I had before, and some of my apps, such as msn News and my photos won't let me pin them to the start menu. Another strange thing is when I search for those apps on the search bar,
 it will only give me web results and when I put apps only it will show me the app but tell me to install it, I will click on it and it will take me to the store, and it will then say open, meaning I do have the app, but it won't show up in my "all apps" tab.
 I've also gone to my settings and gone to the apps And features and it will show those apps. I'm very confused about all these strange things that are happening, and it has become a true hassle. Any help would be greatly appreciated! apps</p>

            <p>If you did not activate Windows 7 during your Windows 7 installation, you can start activating Windows 7 manually.<br />
You can see for Windows 7 activation you have limited time to complete activating Windows 7 installation.<br />
You can see how much time remaining for you to activate Windows7 for different Windows 7 Build numbers when you open the System control panel screen at the bottom of the panel view.<br />
</p>
<p>To open the below System Control Panel screen, you can open the Control Panel, then select System and Security menu item and select the System control panel view.<br />
</p>
<p>If you have not activated Windows 7 Ultimate Edition after you have installed your Windows 7 operating system, you will see the Windows activation section at the bottom of the Control Panel screen.<br />
When you have an online internet connection, you can start activating Windows process manually by clicking the "Activate Windows now" link.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kodyaz.com%2fimages%2fwindows-7-activation%2factivate-windows7.jpg" /></p>
<p>On the Windows Activation screen in order to activate Windows 7 Build 7000 for instance, you are reminded how many days are there still for activating Windows 7 Ultimate RC operating system.<br />
Activating Windows 7 will enable you to use all Windows features after the activation period is ended.<br />
So to make sure, if you have an active online internet connection, go on for next steps by selecting the option "Activate Windows online now".<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kodyaz.com/images/windows-7-activation/activate-windows-online.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kodyaz.com%2fimages%2fwindows-7-activation%2factivate-windows-online-windows7.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This screen displays the message to the user about the product key that is being verified. So if the activation can connect to Microsoft via internet connection and manages to validate the product key without any problem you will be redirected to the last
 screen of the Windows Activation wizard.<br />
This is the activation step the question of "How to register Windows 7" is answered.<br />
If the system cannot reach to the internet due to network errors or a valid internet connection, you will be prompted to define and build an internet connection.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kodyaz.com/images/windows-7-activation/windows7-activation.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kodyaz.com%2fimages%2fwindows-7-activation%2fwindows7-activation-manual.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>In the below screen Windows 7 users can see the result of a successful Windows activation.<br />
It is stated that your copy of Windows is verified and with a valid copy of Windows 7, you are eligible to receive all available updates and product support from Microsoft.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.kodyaz.com%2fimages%2fwindows-7-activation%2fwindows7-activation-successful.jpg" /></p>
<p>As you can see in the above explained steps <b>Windows 7 activation</b> is simple and straight-forward unless you have a valid copy of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Generally you will not face a problem during Windows 7 activation of your Windows copy.<br />
If you experience a problem while trying to register Windows 7 via activation, then you can call the Microsoft Support phones or start activation using phone procedure and talk to a support engineer to help you with your Windows 7 activation problem.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<br />
