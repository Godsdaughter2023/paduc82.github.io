<h2>            I keep receiving error code Ox81000203</h2>
                    I followed HP's instructions and deleted my Recovery partition. This was only after burning an 8 disc recovery set. I wanted to make sure my restore point was setup and I can't get it to work at all. I have followed the gpedit thing in the search box but
 it didn't pull anythng up. As well as scan disk, sfc&nbsp;and am getting nowhere. Thanks in advance for your help. I am not having any problems except this issue.

<h2>            Problem with dual Microsoft accounts</h2>
                    I now have two Microsoft accounts, one utilising a business domain email and the other a live.com address which replaced my set up for hotmail address when Windows Live came along which was replaced by Outlook. &nbsp;Somewhere along the line the latter became
 my main account, so long ago that I had no idea that I had two until recently. Before I added the Outlook App on my iPhone, my sent from on Outlook was that of my business address even though I was logged into the live.com account on all devices. Now, none
 of the email applications can send out using the domain address. I went to add it as an alias to the live.com account but it won't accept it, saying that an account with that email already exists. It took me a while to work out that that email was attached
 to another Microsoft account. I opened that one and opened Outlook and there's no emails in it. I sent one and it worked but it does not receive. My problem is that all of my business email files are sitting in Outlook on the o

<div>Desculpe ouvir isso. É lamentável que seus consoles tenham sido roubados. A primeira coisa que você deve fazer é entrar em contato com a agência de segurança local e denunciar o roubo. Certifique-se de fornecer os números de série dos consoles. O Xbox
 só pode liberar as informações de rastreamento para a polícia por meio de uma intimação.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Após denunciar o roubo, você deve fazer login imediatamente em <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.microsoft.com</a> e alterar seu e-mail e / ou senha para que ninguém possa acessar sua conta.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Se você tiver um cartão de crédito ou paypal anexado à sua conta, você deve relatar o roubo a eles para que eles possam interromper todos os pagamentos até que um novo cartão seja emitido.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Translation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; It's unfortunate that your consoles were stolen.&nbsp; The first thing you should do is contact your local law enforcement agency and report the theft.&nbsp; Be sure to give them the serial numbers of the consoles.&nbsp; Xbox can only release the tracking
 info to the police via a subpoena.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After reporting the theft you should immediately log in to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.microsoft.com</a> and change your email and/or password so no one can access your account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you have a credit card or paypal attached to your account you should report the theft to them so they can stop all payments until a new card is issued.</p>

<h2>            mouse down in HTML object stops CSS&#47;events in Edge</h2>
                    <p class="contentCodeblock" style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
There is an inconsistency in how Edge handles mouse drag events inside objects that I'm finding problematic to work around.
</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I have an application that uses a mouse drag paradigm to create a SVG path between two HTML objects by mousedown on an element in one of the objects and dragging the mouse to the other object and releasing the mouse which should fire a mouseup event in the
 second object. In IE and Firefox, this works as expected and the event fires on the second object. In Chrome it only works if you cancel the mouse event bubbling. However in Edge when you mousedown when on the object and drag you won't get any events (CSS
 or mouse) on anything when you drag the mouse out of the first object. </p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I have turned off all the CSS selection options (so that the browser doesn't think the dragging is selecting text), HTML5 drag options are disabled plus all the various ways to stop event bubbling but nothing works. I suspect this is an Edge bug as I have spent
 a long time investigating different options.</p>

Unfortunately I can't work out how to load object files in codepen/jsfiddle to show this working but I have setup a temporary web site that demonstrates this problem at&nbsp;<a href="http://52.237.199.79/test.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">temporary server</a></p>

<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Move your mouse over the pins in the green triangle and you can see the CSS change the cursor. Mousedown on the top object pin and drag the mouse to the pin on the second object triangle, you won't get a reaction. Try with the DIVs lower down on the screen,
 you can drag the mouse from the DIV pins to another div pin as well as the object pins, and you get an alert from the mouseup event (or the cursor changes over the pin at the edge of the triangle).</p>

<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
If anyone knows about this problem and has a workaround, do let me know. I suspect Edge is trying to select text because the CSS hover changes aren't working.</p>

<h3> seanchan1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Store Won&#39;t Reinstall Gears Of War 4</h2>
                    <p>So I'm trying to reinstall gears 4 on my PC.&nbsp; I've had it installed on my computer when it was new but uninstalled it when I finished it.&nbsp; Now I'm trying to download it again but the store wouldn't start the download.&nbsp; I've tried basically all the troubleshooting
 methods like wsreset, powershell commands etc.&nbsp; Just as a note I have two drives in my computer, my ssd with windows 10 on it (and without the space to install the game) and my hard drive which I've been trying to install the game on.&nbsp; Whenever I click install
 nothing happens, no progress bar or anything.&nbsp; I'm not sure what to do next here, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I can download other apps like gears 1 ultimate edition and minecraft, this is making no sense to me.</p>

<p>1. There is a major change I've made to my computer since the last time I had gears installed.&nbsp; I've basically built a new computer, cpu motherboard new gpu and all.&nbsp; The only thing that I took from my previous build were the ssd and hdd I mentioned.&nbsp; It
 is however still the same install of windows, I didn't do a fresh install.</p>
<p>2. All windows updates have been installed correctly</p>
<p>3-5. I've tried all of those</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

</p><p>The infamous QuickTime Error 46, been around since.... well a long time!! The latest fix in the Community that I could find was in 2010.&nbsp;The link is (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/error-46-activex-message-when-attempting-to-open/be345db1-4468-4077-b379-321aa2adf6d4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/error-46-activex-message-when-attempting-to-open/be345db1-4468-4077-b379-321aa2adf6d4</a>.)
 I didn't try it because it refers to Windows Vista. I'm running Windows 7. Anyway, I&nbsp;downloaded&nbsp;the&nbsp;QuickTime Player and&nbsp;installed it with no problem but when I try to run it I get an error box that says "Error 46: Could not load or find the QuickTime ActiveX
 control." I get the feeling surfing the web that this would help a lot of people. Can someone figure this out?

<p><b>Zombie Game Modes</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Tranzit</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;'Tranzit' adds scale to the original gametype, and acts as the primary mode for zombie players. Rather than be stuck in one location, players are free to explore a "big, giant, expansive world." Calling it "significantly bigger than anything [Treyarch has]
 ever created," Lamia promises players (playing solo or up to four-players co-op) can traverse on foot or via the bus featured in the zombies world premiere trailer above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Because it's open and because there are multiple locations in this world where you can play and where the infestation is, there are different strategies about how you can approach it," he adds. "It's a much bigger world with much more going on." Moving
 through the world in the bus has tactical advantages, such as speed; however, it isolates players and can become very difficult to escape from. Going it on foot "into the fog" – which players can do by themselves or as part of the group – also has its perks,
 but puts players in the middle of danger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;To aid in their survival, players can collection pieces of items from throughout the world, putting them together to create "buildables"; including weapons, tools and things to help open new areas of the world.</p>
<p>'Survival' has the "more classic zombies vibe," where zombie aggressors attack the player within a single area from the "expansive" Tranzit world. From its description, things work relatively the same as they have in the past: hole up, fortify your location
 and venture out to grab bonuses scattered throughout the environment when you find the right moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Survival</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Survival areas are "carved out" of the Tranzit world and customized by Treyarch to act much like dedicated maps. Though Lamia wouldn't give an exact number, he promised players will have access to "multiple areas" in Survival that are designed to be played
 as a standalone section (solo or as a 4-player co-op experience). These areas feature the same gameplay zombie fans are used to, including magic items and 'Pack-a-Punch' machines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Grief</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Grief' is a new mode, available for up to 8 players that takes the concept of Survival and adds a competitive twist. In this mode, two teams of four players are dropped within the zombie-infested Tranzit world and must outlive the opposing team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;"This is what I've called in the past '4v4,'" Lamia says, detailing a mode that breaks down to a simple descriptor of Humans vs. Humans vs. Zombies. "It's really humans versus zombies, because the zombies don't care what team you're on. They just want human
 flesh and brains."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this mode, human players cannot kill each other; however, they can play with the world to put the opposing team in precarious situations – hence the name 'Grief.' The last human team standing wins the match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standard elements like blocking passages seem to be on the docket to make the other team's life harder, but Lamia says there are "new mechanics exclusive to this mode" that players can employ to grief the other team with. When pressed for details, Lamia
 wouldn't budge on what those elements are.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Basic Information</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Keeping Crawlers Updated -</b> Crawlers are not as good at keeping now in Tranzit, because they updated the way they work, if a zombie gets so far away from everyone or anyone, they will die out, and usually not spawn back in, so if you keep 1 crawler
 that is slow, and take the bus to another location without zombie on the bus with you, it will die out, and start the next&nbsp; round.&nbsp; I recommend either having a person that may not need anything at end of round to watch the zombie while everyone else does what
 they need, or follow this strategy which works for solo.&nbsp; Keep either a crawler or a runner close to the bus, and loop them until bus is ready to leave, right before run them to bus, get on and time just right to shut the bus doors in the face of the zombie.&nbsp;
 This will make the zombie jump on the window closest to the door, and if the bus starts moving it will just rip down the boards on window.&nbsp; If you do it too early, sometimes it will rip the boards down, but usually it will hop up to the roof of the bus and
 jump down into box from the emergency exit hatch or bust through it if not equipped.&nbsp; You can always keep zombie in the bus, but it gets tricky keeping him from trapping you or swiping you down if you do not have Juggernog.&nbsp; If zombie is on the window, just
 simply keep repairing as you ride and zombie will stay on, just repeat at each area if you wish to keep moving from area to area, this of course is time consuming, but is a guaranteed way of staying safe, and preparing for next rounds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Box Locations</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Bus Station - Just outside the first room </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Diner - In the Garage (door is 750 points), always first box appearance </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Farm - In the right house, top floor </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Power Station - Just after exiting the reactor place, still in the brightness
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Town - In the bar on top floor, behind the structure in the center of the room and Outside behind the fence, across the door you can power with a turbine.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Music Easter Egg</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Teddy 1 - Bus Station - Outside on a bench waiting for bus </li><li>Teddy 2 - Farm - Up the stairs on the floor in house </li><li>Teddy 3 - Town - In Bar, bottom floor on a seat </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Turning Power On - </b>Three parts for the power switch device (Lever, Zombie Hand and the Panel). You can build it at the easy-to-find workbench. And there you go, your power switch is ready to flip. Power enables with a little delay. Also you can toggle
 the power off and on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Storage Fridge in Farmhouse in Farm Area -</b> Lets you put a weapon in storage and carries over across games, allows all weapons but un-upgraded M1911 and Ray Gun.&nbsp; All other weapons including your Mustang &amp; Sally, the ammo that you have in the weapon
 carries over also, so if you put an empty weapon in, it will stay empty when you get it until you buy ammo or get max ammo while having it out of the storage.&nbsp; Max ammo drops do not fill weapons that are stored in the fridge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Tombstone Perk -</b> When you have it and go down, tombstone power up drops.&nbsp; Only will stay if you die out and have to come back next round, if you get revived the tombstone disappears.&nbsp; If you die out and pick your tombstone back up, you get all perks
 and weapons you had, except for the tombstone perk.&nbsp; So you are paying 2,000 points to acquire the perk to save you up to roughly 20,000 points if you have 3 other perks, such as the combo of Juggernog, Speed Cola, and Stamin Up, which alone costs 7,500 points,
 then whatever weapons you may have, in which if you have 2 box weapons that are upgraded and perhaps monkey bombs or EMP grenades, also the cost of if you have gaulvaknuckles or bowie knife.&nbsp; This perk is a must have after your arm yourself with full equipment,
 or even worth it if you even only have Juggernog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Bank Vault -</b> In the town area when you first arrive on the bus, opening the door into the bank will grant you access to the rest or the town area, in the bank there is a vault door for the bank.&nbsp; If you through a grenade at the door it will blow the
 door off of its hinges and will grant you access into the vault area.&nbsp; The vault area lets you deposit up to 250,000 points total into the bank, which carries over across all your matches for Tranzit.&nbsp; You can only deposit 1,000 points at a time, and when
 you end up withdrawing the points, it takes 100 points fee to withdraw 1 ,000 points.&nbsp; So if you have a full 250,000 points in your bank and pull it all out at once, the most you will end up with from your bank is 225,000 points after all of the 100 point
 withdraw fees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Bank Wire Transfer -</b> In the bank main room, there are a set up keys at the bottom of one of the center pieces that is pretty hidden close to ground.&nbsp; When you knife it, it allows you to deposit 1,000 points, if done so, it will pop up a point power
 up worth 1,000 points, but for these deposits there is a 100 point fee also.&nbsp; This deposit and power up option allows you to give your teammates points if they need them, and you have some to share.&nbsp; So it costs 1,100 to give one of your teammates 1,000 points.&nbsp;
 Anyone can pick up the power up though so hopefully you are not playing with random players that are uncooperative and take the point power up you mean to have someone else pick up.&nbsp; You can only deposit 1,000 at a time, but it adds to the power up each time
 if you keep doing it, so you do not require depositing, picking up, depositing pick up.&nbsp; The power up does start to disappear though after a period of time, so make sure the person gets the points in time, or the points will be lost.&nbsp; I am currently not sure
 if the power up timer starts to disappear from the instant it shows up or after you are done adding points to give up.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Pack A Punch -</b> Located behind the bank vault door in the bank, there is a second bank vault door.&nbsp; Throwing another grenade at this door will blow it open, revealing a power door with a green power symbol.&nbsp; You must have a turbine to open this door,
 but you must place the turbine at the power door in the power station, when dropping down into the power room, look right behind you and the power door is right there.&nbsp; Throwing down a turbine at that location will power the door at the bank vault and open
 up the area where the pack a punch will be located.&nbsp; For solo you can drop the turbine at the power room and go to the bank without problems, but in multiplayer, you must have someone stay at the power location or the turbine will simply disappear.&nbsp; After
 entering the pack a punch area, you must find the 3 parts to build the machine and take each to the workbench at the end of the haul, in which the pack a punch will be built right beside the workbench.&nbsp; After being built, you are free to use the machine at
 any time, but the door to the pack a punch location will shut if the turbine is destroyed or disappears from the power room door location.&nbsp; To access this area, you must use the turbine each time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fog Monsters (Denizens) - </b>Denizens are small, zombie-like creatures found only on the Green Run maps. They are found in the foggy parts of the map when you walk through. They attack by jumping on your face and scratching you until you knife them off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Teleports - </b>Power turbine under green light posts to power the teleports or when a denizen jumps on you, be close to the light and knife the denizen, if you don't knife it and it gets 3 hits on you in a row, it will down you so be fast.&nbsp; Teleports
 you to other light posts but as to which it teleports you to is completely random.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Corn Field Location - </b>Along route between farm and power station</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Radio Tower Location -</b> In corn maze on left side of road between farm and power station</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Nacht der Untoten Location - </b>In corn maze on right side of road between farm and power station</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Hunter Cabin Location - </b>Past the corn field, towards the right, will have fire on the ground
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>"HIM" - </b>Once the power is turned on, "HIM" will appear in the center piece of the power and will disappear and will randomly show up at random rounds, easiest way to defeat him is to throw an EMP at him, if not available, use gaulvaknuckles and it
 will take a couple of punches to make him disappear.&nbsp; He will come back at other random times, he will not just be defeated for the entire match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Pack A Punch Multiple Times - </b>Only new weapons can be pack a punched multiple times, not old weapons or wall weapons.&nbsp; Cost 2,000 after first pack a punch, and only adds attachments to your weapon, by either switching sights, or rarely adding under
 barrel grenade launcher.&nbsp; Ammo is not replenished when doing this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Permanent Perks (Tranzit only)</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Quick Revive </b></p>
<p>Pick up a team mate many times in a row or in a certain amount in a match will unlock this permanent effect for person.&nbsp; Best with using crawlers, grenades, or lava and fire to down yourself easily, a green flash, like one from a power up will appear over
 person being revived, unlocking the permanent effect for the person reviving team mate.&nbsp; It will be faster when reviving team mates now and when reviving will show the letters in purple.&nbsp; This crosses over into other games and matches, if you buy quick revive
 on top of this effect, your reviving is almost instantaneous.&nbsp; It takes about 9 to 15 revives to unlock this effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Deadshot Daiquiri </b></p>
<p>Unlocks after getting a double headshot, as opposed to a certain accumulation of headshots in a single game or overall. This gives you to shoot a zombie in any body part and their head will explode</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Upgraded Barricades</b></p>
<p>You need to build 50+ barricades in one game. This slows down zombies taking barricades down</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Stamin-Up </b></p>
<p>You Need to sprint 15-25 miles in one game to unlock Stamin-up</p>
<p><b>Juggernog </b></p>
<p>The way I and a few others got permanent juggernog is to get downed at each stop and survive 100 zombie hits at each stop in a single game</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>4 Player Strategy -</b> The bus will not start the timer to start leaving until either the door is opened or the turbines are used to open power doors to get outside.&nbsp; So I recommend getting to round 7 in bus station without opening doors, 4 windows,
 everyone buys M14's and covers a window.&nbsp; Allow zombies in first 3 rounds to get power ups, after that I recommend keeping windows boarded up as much as possible.&nbsp; If need ammo buy in between the rounds or if in between needing ammo, switch windows with people
 closest to the M14 ammo.&nbsp; Make sure you make use of your M1911 when you have piled zombies at your windows and max ammos, especially with double points.&nbsp; By round end of round 7, leave a couple zombies left alive, and everyone should at least have 4,000 points,
 but I have had close to 10,000 points after milking zombies with M1911 and a lot of double points.&nbsp; After this you are free to travel the map in this round and get where you need if you have enough points.&nbsp; I recommend keeping M1911 to upgrade for Mustang
 &amp; Sally, and in the diner location, everyone gets a roll at the mystery box to get rid of their M14, depending on what they get in there 1 roll on the box, after everyone gets a roll, whoever is unpleased with their roll can go again until box spins out and
 moves. Next area is the farm, in which is really not too important at this point, and would just wait for bus to go to next area, which is the power station, in which you should build the switch and turn the power on, so everyone can go to the next area, town,
 to buy Juggernog after opening 2 doors.&nbsp; If you work together and everyone has at least 4,000 at end up this round, you should be able to have everyone buy Juggernog, which makes you so much further ahead in the game already.&nbsp; Finding a spot to hold down together.&nbsp;
 I recommend till about round 10, for everyone to stay in 1 location and hold off together to build points and be available to revive teammates if they go down.&nbsp; After this, I suggest each person find an area they are comfortable running on their own, in which
 they can loop and train zombies and not go down, to keep doing this for rest of game.&nbsp; It is up to the team to decide where they are most comfortable.&nbsp; Having multiple people running same loop is a very bad idea, for it is hard to stay coordinated in moving
 together and not splitting up and running into each other, which usually traps the players and they go down.&nbsp; If each person is in their own area and they go down, it is not too complicated for person close to their area to get to them in time.&nbsp; Each area
 has 2 areas that are beside them, while 1 area will be furthest away from each area.&nbsp; So coordinating who is where and who they need to revive depending on the location they are and the person they need to revive are.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Maxis Easter Egg - Tower of Babble</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 1 - </b>Build the Turbine. Note that Maxis is giving you instructions: "Complete the device."
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 2 - </b>Turn on the power. After it's on, Maxis says that you have to turn the power off again to keep up the communication. So turn it off again once you want to do the EE.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 3 - </b>Go to the cornfield tower. Wait there. At some time, the sky will be thundering like hell and the Avogadro Zombie spawns. Place two portable power devices underneath the tower. Maxis will tell you, if it needs "more power" or if you're good
 and can continue to the next step. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 4 - </b>Once Maxis says "You did it, now kill the electric zombie", do so right under the tower. Remember that you have no perk power on, so you are not able to make use of your perks. Therefore, it might be risky to kill him with knives. You may
 want to make sure, that you have an EMP grenade in your team. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 5 - </b>Place a portable power device under the 'green' light next to the diner, close the truck. Note that the light is actually not green, but flickering in white. Place another portable device under the green light in the town next to that truck.
 The two turbines under the tower must still be active or activated again. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Richtofen Easter Egg - Tower of Babble<br />
<br />
</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 1 - </b>Turn on the power and ignore Maxis words. Leave power on. Once outside near the bus, Samuel will hear Richtofen talking about overheating the tower with the Jet Gun.
</li></ul>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 2 - </b>Build the Jet Gun and get the Navcard Reader. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 3 - </b>Go underneath the pylon. Shoot the Navcard Reader until your gun explodes. That way you heat up the tower. Now Richtofen tells you to collect 115 from the zombies with 'boom'.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 4 - </b>Now you have to kill zombies underneath the tower with explosives. You can run an easy train there. At least one player should have one of the following: RPG, Pack A Punched Warmachine, Mustang and Sally, or grenade launcher attachment.
 Samuel will get called by Richtofen once you have enough 115. Richtofen will tell that you need to decrease the power by a factor of 4.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 5 - </b>Everybody needs to get EMP grenades now. Of course you can also obtain them earlier.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Step 6 - </b>Your 4 people team has to throw 4 EMP's simultaneously underneath the green, powered street lights. Each person throws his EMP on a different light. Richtofen will confirm when it worked.
</li></ul>

<p>OMG!3 of us were so close to getting Tower of Babble!We got EMP's in round 1!2 of us had Galva Knuckles!We turned the power on and off again,Round 8 or 9 under the pylon and Avacado dude turned up but he would'nt come under the fricken pylon so we put Turbines
 down to try and lure him but no luck!Then our Turbines got all smashed up and i ran off to get more but our crawler died then i got killed,My friend got back to the bus depo so we could get more Turbines but i'd lost my Galva's when i spawned back!Then it
 all went down hill from there. :-(</p>

<p>^^^ I dont think this can be right as I have seen no option to drop an item when you are holding one.</p>
<p>You probably know this already but you can only hold 1 part at a time but you can swap it to pick up another, and you drop when you are downed....</p>

    <title>Xbox Live &#43; DRM games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dj critty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live &#43; DRM games</h2>
                    
<p>While it's pretty sucky to not be able to get online when XBL is down, what's actually bigger BS is not being able to play games I've downloaded from their own store in single player.&nbsp; Considering when you try logging in and it tells you that your connection
 is fine and it's on their end, then there should be a way during that time that the DRM is disabled.</p>
<p>I have no idea how difficult that would be to implement but I'm sure there's a way.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I bought &amp; downloaded the games it didn't even cross my mind that I wouldn't be able to play them when the service was down.&nbsp; Oh well, live &amp; learn, I'll just stick
 to buying the discs from now on...</p>

<p>You've done most of the work. All you'll need to do is skip to the part where you set the content you want to use offline (or make available to other accounts) to download again.</p>
<p>Since it will already be on the hard drive all that will be downloaded is the new license.</p>

<p>Hey Vaynel - I'm actually a little confused by this... So this is for the XB1 that I purchased (not 360 in case that matters). &nbsp;I purchased BF4 Premium last week but wasn't able to play it even in single player Friday night since it couldn't connect to servers.
 &nbsp;There's a way to enable it so it can be played even offline?</p>

<p>Ok so just looked into this and it looks like you're right! &nbsp;I have to set my XB1 as my "home" system or something? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't share my account or systems or anything with other people so there's no issues there. &nbsp;From the looks of it, there's a lot of people who have no idea about this and thought the same thing as me. &nbsp;They should really communicate this more clearly,
 or have it as an option during the initial set up. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have your One set as the Home system, all accounts on the console will have access to your games and DLC.</p>
<p>Also as you are a Gold member, any Silver accounts on the One will also be able to play online.</p>
<p>I didn't set-up the One in my house, so I'm not sure if it is there during the set-up or not. However if it isn't then the Home option definitely should be.</p>

    <title>Files disappear after renaming folder in USB - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Files disappear after renaming folder in USB</h2>
                    This is something I have never experienced before or never even heard of before. In my Dad's USB, whenever he renames a folder, the files that are contained in it disappear. I ran a file recovery application on the USB and none of the files (even the ones
 I tested), showed up. Only files from last year showed up in recovered files. I'm not even sure if the files are deleted or are being hidden. I tried changing the settings to show hidden files (even hidden OS files) and nothing shows up. Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand facing issues with dual monitor performance.</p>
<p>This issue could be due to settings problems or driver might not be compatible.</p>
<p>1. Have you installed the latest video drivers? </p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>3. Are you able move your mouse perfectly when you use only Envision G19LWk as the PC monitor?</p>
<p>Refer to the methods to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to run the hardware troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press<strong> Windows Key + W Key</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” without the quotes and click on <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click on <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Then click on <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click on <strong>Next.</strong></p>
<p>If the issue still persist, refer to the below method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Try the step in the following Microsoft Help article.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/get-best-display-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/get-best-display-monitor</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have done with both the methods, try the steps in the following Microsoft Help article and check if the second monitor is setup properly or not.</p>

<h2>            HDMI sound no longer works.</h2>
                    Have my gaming PC hooked from my graphics card, nvidia Titan, to my Sony TV through HDMI. Never had problems. Recently with windows 10, the sound doesn't work. HDMI is not even an option in the control panel sound devices. If I go to NVIDIA control panel
 and "set up digital audio" then I see Sony TV as hooked in HDMI, but then once I click to open windows sound settings, my tv or HDMI is not even and option. I have unplugged and re plugged the HDMI, restarted etc. none of those help. It's weird that nvidia
 recognizes the TV hooked in HDMI, but windows can't seem to see I have HDMI.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HDMI cables do support audio signals, but not all HDMI-enabled video cards support audio. If your HDTV has an audio input, you might
 be able to connect a separate audio cable from your computer's sound card directly to the TV. Otherwise, you'll need to connect the audio signal to a different output device, such as external computer speakers or your home stereo system. Follow these methods
 and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">By default Windows does not route sound over the HDMI output. To change this we need to change the settings in control panel.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> This will turn off sound
 from the speakers or normal audio output on the laptop. To get that back you will have to reverse this process.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a) Press
<strong>Windows key + X</strong> <br />
b) Click on "<strong>Control Panel</strong>"<br />
c) With the Control Panel in "<strong>Control Panel Home</strong>" view please click on "<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>"<br />
d) Where it says "<strong>Sound</strong>" in green letters there are three options below that are in blue click on "<strong>Manage Audio Devices</strong>"<br />
e) This will bring up a window labeled "<strong>Sound</strong>"<br />
f) On the "<strong>Playbac</strong>k" tab there is listed the sound options available to you. One should read "<strong>Digital Output Device (HDMI)</strong>" Click on that.<br />
g) There should now be a check mark on that option, make HDMI sound output as default .<br />
h) The Sound should then play through your HDMI hookups to the TV.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Update the Sound driver.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please follow the steps given here.

    <title>Function Keys with Dual Functions - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Function Keys with Dual Functions</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I am trying to play various downloaded online games, and the problem I keep running into is that my function keys have two functions, and the "main functions" are not the ones I want (such as adjusting screen brightness, etc). &nbsp;I need the original functions
 that pertain to the programs I'm using, and it's very inconvenient to have to repeatedly press the Fn key to get them to work. &nbsp;Worst of all is the F2 key, which shuts off my wifi, disconnecting the games and forcing me back to the login screen.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community. I will certainly assist you with the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Provide the following information:</div>
<div>
<p>1. What is the make and model of your computer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Have you checked the issue&nbsp;in safe mode?</p>
<div>
<p>3. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
4. Do you have all updates installed?</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Is Caps lock key turned on or even though its turned off keyboard still stuck on Caps?</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to install any pending updates on the pc and check. Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps below and check if it helps.</div>
<div>1. Press Windows + X keys and click Control panel. </div>
<div>
<p>2. Open “Languages” and select “Advanced Settings”.<br />
3. Click on “Change language bar hot keys” option under “Switching input methods”<br />
4. Select “Advanced key settings” options from “Text services and input languages” window.<br />
5. Here you will find the settings to release/disable the CAPS lock option by pressing shift keys.</p>
<p>
</p><div>I also suggest op to uninstall and reinstall keyboard drivers and check if issue persist.
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Get back to us for further assistance.</p>

Adobe Reader is not the correct app for opening PowerPoint .PPS files. <br />
<br />
Do you have Microsoft PowerPoint or the PowerPoint Viewer installed on your system?<br />
<br />
If_Yes_change the Open With association for .PPS files to PowerPoint.

            <p><span>Hi frame buffer,</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to install the chipset and storage controller driver from the manufacturer’s website, or change the controller compatibility
 in the BIOS (Basic input/output system) to IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics). Refer to the manual for assistance.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings
 incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
