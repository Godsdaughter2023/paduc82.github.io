<h2>            Excel Printing - default settings</h2>
                    <p>Having a seemingly random problem with Excel documents printing. Wonder if anyone can offer a suggestion...</p>
<p>We have occasional issues with Excel documents (doesn't seem to happen with Word or other Office documents) where we have a user who opens a file on our shared network storage. They try to print it, but rather than use the default printer settings on their
 computer which should send it to their mailbox on our copier, it appears to have print settings carried over in the document from a previous user, and it prints to someone else's mailbox. If we go in and manually change the settings and select that user's
 mailbox before printing, it correctly prints to the current user's mailbox. Most Excel docs print normally, automatically going to the current user's mailbox, but occasionally, an Excel file seems to retain the print settings from the previous user and print
 to that user's mailbox rather than the current user. Is there a way to prevent that or to get all Excel files to automatically use the default printer settings on the local machine?</p>

<h2>            Unable to view the next button to read next page of email.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: How can I see all the pages of my email ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
In the Hotmail version at the bottom of the inbox there was the number of pages of email you have and there was arrows to click and go back to see the other pages. For example, my email now says I have 41 pages , it says 1 page of 41 , next to that it says
 Go to but I don't see arrows to switch from one page to another, all that I see is a calendar that opens up for me to look email by dates which it is impossible as I don't remember every single date I received email.
<br />
<br />
I believe might be some kind of visibility on my page, configuration or size of rows or columns, maybe font. Anyway I cant go back to the other pages and it is driving me insane.
<br />
<br />
Please help... thank you!<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why you are experiencing challenges opening the table of figures in the PDF file is the default program set to open the file. We would like to confirm if you have a program that can read the PDF file set a<span>s</span> default.
 If not, follow the steps below if you're using Windows 10 version 1607:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings.</strong></li><li>Choose <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Default apps</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Choose default apps by file type</strong> link.</li><li><span>Under Name, scroll</span> down to <strong>PDF file</strong> and click the application icon beside it.</li><li>Choose the application you would like to set as the default program. Please take note that
<strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> is the recommended program for Windows 10.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using Windows 10 version 1703, follow these steps instead:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings.</strong></li><li>Choose <strong>Apps</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Default apps</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Choose default apps by file type</strong> link.</li><li><span>Under Name, scroll</span> down to <strong>PDF file</strong> and click the application icon beside it.</li><li>Choose the application you would like to set as the default program.

<h2>            My name is Kenneth Deigal, I was perhaps the first person not of microsoft to have tested windows 10 please help</h2>
                    <p>Hello my name is Kenneth Deigal:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Around 6 months before you folks released windows 10 to the public I had a problem with my window 7 64bit program.&nbsp; I wasn't really knowledgeable about remote help, but I decided since I didn't have an install disk I would take a chance that I could figure
 it out and contacted tech support.&nbsp; See I am disabled and my computer was kinda my life line.&nbsp; And boy was I in for an education that day and a better education since.&nbsp; I suppose I am of a moderate understanding of windows and not much more else, since I was
 always a DOS tech, and software specialist specializing on getting program to talk to one another, remember how Office wouldn't always&nbsp; get along with Wordperfect, I was good at helping them along plus I was pretty good with spread sheets and programing Access.&nbsp;
 So I really didn't understand everything there was to know about Windows 7 much less 8 and I was learning hardware as well, even went as far designing my own gaming PC&nbsp; a Windows 7 based&nbsp; Server tower&nbsp; with an Intel I7 processor with liquid cooling, terra
 byte hard drive with a 150 GB backup drive, a Gigabyte X58 USB 3.0 board and an NVidia Geforce 650 graphic board and interior WIFI dual channel&nbsp; receiver.&nbsp; See I live a little off the beaten path, an my only choices for internet was dial up or WiFi. which
 made what happened next hard.&nbsp; When the tech answered she asked how she could help, told her about my windows 7 update not being able to install updates like it should, and she said by typing " No problem I believe I can help" and next thing I noticed was
 suddenly my windows was being dismantled right before my eyes, and me with out the install disk to fix it.&nbsp; So being of sound mind, I completely lost all composer and freaked........&nbsp; Not knowing the laptops camera and mic were active and because I messed
 up in the remote call she wasn't able to talk to me or I see her, I began the weirdest most wonder time of my life.&nbsp; I heard a ping come from my speakers and looked down and she was typing again, : calm down" she told me " I have a surprise for you" she continued
 she then typed "talk normally, I can hear you and please relax"&nbsp; well of course I tried, she then said, "you look like you just woke up, go take care of yourself, and come back in about half an hour" a little in shock and hurting really bad from the shock
 I did as I was told and returned feeling better and a little puzzled and sat as still as could watching she put something on my laptop, she mentioned her tech number and proceeded with the build. A few minutes later she pinged and I leaned forward and she
 typed, "let me introduce you to Windows 10 with HoloLens ever hear of it Ken?" I said no, it was like nothing I had ever seen pretty really.&nbsp; I think she could tell I was studying the screen and pleased with what I saw, that was understating it a bit I really
 wanted to drive it bad. With the cursor she began to show me around, that was&nbsp; our first trouble started, there began a problem with my IPV6, but I don't know how she save us and the strangest thing was going on, the Icon next to the start button began to
 act strangely, moving she typed "That's me" and as I starred I could almost make out her eyes, nose and mouth, had to laugh a little, it had been a long time since a lady graced my presence and I told her as much.&nbsp; Like I said, disabled, spine is deteriorating
 both in my neck and low spine so even car travel was more than I could take.&nbsp; But here she was, showing me some thing I never saw before, what a treat! she told me it was mine now and she and her cubical mates wanted me to take it for a spin with them watching
 and taking notes and sure enough, up popped 4 more icons smaller than she, and much more quiet then it happened we lost contact with the wifi signal which saddened me no end, but little did I know I wasn't even close to done with this wonderful "Angel" who
 saved me from agonizing boredom and hum drum life.&nbsp;Not to mention the pain, I must have been pumping all kinds of adrenaline for&nbsp;I felt&nbsp;better&nbsp;than I had&nbsp;since my last shot&nbsp;after my neck operation.&nbsp;But look at this I thought, bet no has heard of this one I
 told myself, when I heard that ping again and&nbsp;I hadn't noticed that the wifi was back and so was my Angel, that's what I called her since she told me only her number, and so was her team of icons as they soon were to be called, and the second one nodded...
 I then thought to myself no one is going to&nbsp;believe this even my best friend who&nbsp;knew me well enough to know I wouldn't make this up was going to think I dreamed all this, but&nbsp;I knew he wouldn't argue the fact I had software on my laptop, she then typed a
 strange thing,&nbsp;"Did you go&nbsp;to East Union High?" wow, what????? Asked her how she&nbsp;knew that, she said someone at Microsoft had the old |T|RS-80 I&nbsp;cut my teeth on in&nbsp;my senior year, see I wrote two programs one was&nbsp;Star Trek based and was nothing more than a
 data base, and the second was a game, a very interesting game that we have all played from time to time 20 Questions take turns playing first you would think of animal, plant or mineral and the machine would ask you questions and try and guess what you had
 been thinking of, then it would think of something and you would ask the machine yes or no questions using descrptions listed on screen if I remember right, it was a long time ago so my memory is a little funny after my car accident.&nbsp; But for the most part
 it remembered what you had asked of it and more than likely you wouldn't get it but if you did, the screen would flash "Winner" I explain it to the team and they all nodded Angel smiled and said she wanted to meet me, and I was really taken aback, see for
 most of my life I had been a cook and chef who in there right mind wanted to meet me, so I figured she was just putting me on she then start us off by taking me to there new creation, HoloLens, it was only a youngster but even without a 3D app it was the most
 beautiful thing I ever saw, You know the bridge picture that sometimes comes up as wall paper, the suspension bridge.&nbsp; Well that's the one, I think I starred at it till my eyes watered, and I told&nbsp; the team, I have always been wanting to see the world in a
 new way and they all seemed pleased with my admiration she then explained that this wasn't were they going with HoloLens and that she couldn't go into more, "but keep remembering it, for it will be important...." little did I know where it finally go and it
 would be atleast a year till I got my invite to New York for a weekend with it, which I was so sad to miss, but I didn't know this day had home work attached, and then it happened again lost one channels on the wifi, she told me I would have to fix it for
 her, huh, lord I was feeling out of place with these techs and couldn't keep my mouth shut told the team as much like total idiot I was at the time, it was like the icons faded out of view for me, she was my total focus I didn't want to lose her now. And she
 typed "Can you follow instructions?" no way was I saying no at this point, Yeah I blurted she began to explain what to press and off to the wifi status screen we rushed where I was to begin learning windows for the first time really copy and paste into WordPad.
 So I had a working copy where all I had do was copy and paste in to the proper place in wifi properties.&nbsp; This was done with haste since she and didn't know when or if I would lost the team.&nbsp; I had just finished with IPV4 first page where you put in the connect
 properties by hand when total silence.......</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Frug, I lost her and the team it seemed to me slight hysterics were called for so that's what I did since this was totally alien to me, and I don't do alien usually!&nbsp; But these people really were interested in me and this program, so what the hey,
 I had nothing better to do and then there was Angel she made this old beat up carcus feel more alive than its been in years.&nbsp; She was truly interested in me having this for some reason, didn't know why, but isn't that the fun part of the easter egg hunt the
 finding out what you found? So I popped another Pepsi and settled in with my computer moving it to what had been the best place in the house for a WiFi signal and read everything I could get my hands on in the help screen about the WiFi software.&nbsp; There I
 go doing alien again.&nbsp; About half an hour later she popped up again, didn't know how she was doing that, but didn['t really care, she and most of her team were back, something was very wrong this time.&nbsp; No Typing, but low and behold, she used my cursor and
 a knock replaced the ping, I figured out what she was doing, one knock for yes, two for no, and she would point me were to go, and off we went my heart nearly beating out of my chest.&nbsp; Rather slowly we began the Blind and mute leading the stupid and inept.&nbsp;
 I knew I wasn't the best student she ever had, but I think she could tell my heart was into it, by now it was more than 6 hours we had spent together again she lead and I followed and was going ok to my knowledge, but what did this old cook know....&nbsp; well
 we finished the IPV 4 section without major incident, then came the IPV6 section, should've known nothing is ever easy in my life when it came to cutting and pasting, I copied the complete string of numbers and letters but the middle box stayed empty, I had
 no way of knowing had cut it wrong including the special characters I didn't undersand this stuff and that the cut off of the info was where the special characters start, and that was keep the software so the program can put in the 64 it reads from both lines
 of code....Plus she looked frazzled, I&nbsp; getting tired and was starting to really hurt, and I didn't want to leave till got this finished but like now, I was getting tired&nbsp; from all the strain and a nap was looking good.&nbsp; But not to me totally, this lady had
 captured my heart, and nothing was going to stop me from showing her I never give up on my friends, and I redoubled&nbsp; my efforts, Here's the rub, two times nothing is still nothing we finished the first page then the second slowed us down even more for there
 was chopping to do then the DNS add together, I'm still not sure how I came to get the last page fell into the right spots and I&nbsp; picked out the right DNS sufficeswhen all fields were complete we restarted the wifi adapter, and "Presto",&nbsp; Hi ken, no typing,
 no ping, then bam no internet, and it was close to half an hour later, we were back to me talking Angel and here Icons were typing&nbsp; and soon we had our repor back.&nbsp; We finish the looking at the installed programans installed there, not much really except under
 it, you will first find windows 10 edge, or a wanna be, I am such a she got me to lock down her web address were to locate her, then she typed,"I am sorry about the connection but you did well for a first timer", huh, I did? and she looked down at the Icons
 and they all looked at one another and nodded, one guy looked like he was clapping and I got the biggest smile from her, and I think I blushed and she asked if I had fun, and if really like the program, I told her I did, and especially HoloLens, I had always
 been looking for a new way to see the world, and I wasn't fibbing either, it and this whole adventure was very special to me and she typed if I would like to do her a&nbsp; favor?&nbsp; Well how could I refuse to do an Angel a favor, so I said sure.&nbsp; Boy I didn't realize
 how much a favor it was, when she answered, " would you be willing to test windows 10 builds that would be comeing out that year?"&nbsp; Lets see, more operating systems like this and in variety, sure I said.&nbsp;"I can't promise you anything more than software, and
 you will have to write a report on what you find, plus you have to keep it quiet what&nbsp; you are doing.....least till the end just do what you can by yourself and get back to us".&nbsp; Sounded a little cloak and dagger to me. but for what she gave me today, Why
 Not!!!!&nbsp; Sounds fun I said, and theres that smile again, I wanted so much to see that face of hers for real I felt like I was going to explode, I wanted to tell her what she had given me was a new lease on life see I am also immune surpressed, and prognosis
 was rather bleak to my way of thinking, and had worn on me for years now, and I didn't feel so good.&nbsp; I was over weight and just down on myself but here was someone who made me feel like I was still worth something, I would do as she requested, and I knew
 I had to see her again to let her know what she did for me excuse my tears. No one had treated me human what seem like a life time, other than those who have adopted me lke Shannon and Grant my next door neighbors who I love dearly, and the cat the gave me,
 Casper,&nbsp; plus a few others I can count on one hand. I guess I was smiling so&nbsp; much somehow I had a little hint she might have known.&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave more words of encouragement and I noticed the resolution of the Icon lke getting clearer and the rest of the team
 could be seen smiling too and the one by one got up left us just smiling at one another so I would have some idea what she looked like when I returned and gave her my report little did I realize just what I signed on for,&nbsp;&nbsp; First came the issue of finding
 them, no easy feat&nbsp; for atleast 6 months&nbsp; then I found a sight that specialized in letting try software before you buy.&nbsp; First hurdle made.&nbsp; Then came the down loading from wifi that wasn't very good so I ordered some antenna and a hot spot from NetZero, which
 were slow and one build would cost me a day to download, but even as I downloaded, I came daily to Microsoft reading anything and everything about wifi till months later I could configure one in my sleep and the down loads got better and better till the day
 about three months down the road after the release of windows 10 home to the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;By which time Microsoft new me well I was one of there quiet regulars or perhaps they found me to be a black hole for I seemed to suck up a lot of drivers and other software
 I felt would help me along the way till I had a couple hundred&nbsp; backup copies of software&nbsp;I liked to have around in an emergency,&nbsp; I was a good scout once, always be prepared.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is my question:&nbsp; Here are the details of that fateful day and I am now completed the quest, will someone please help me find my Angel or her group, it is very important to me as many of you can probably see and I wish I had room for the whole&nbsp; story,
 full of hard work, ups and downs, even a close call in the health category but the ending is what really matters to me, I have a lot to say her, and to the team and I promise to finish it, but somebody there at MS must know her and the team, ty so much for
 listening.&nbsp; Take care all--Ken and by the way you need to add one for me--"All of the above" I am a over achiever</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t insert inline image or drag n drop into GMail compose box in Internet Explorer or IE11</h2>
                    <p>When composing a GMail e-mail, our users&nbsp;need to be able to insert an inline image or drag n drop something from the Snipping Tool directly into the Compose Window in GMail while using Internet Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;When they switch to Google Chrome Browser, they can
 insert inline images and drag n drop items directly into the Compose Window.&nbsp; This is such an important part of the user experience and productivity in our processes that we have installed Chrome on all 500 computers in our company.&nbsp; If IE had this one feature,
 we would not have a need to install Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please add the ability to drag n drop inline images into the compose window when composing a GMail using Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Additionally, Internet Explorer WILL allow you to drag and drop images, if you use the Desktop split screen.&nbsp; Just open&nbsp;Gmail from the Desktop, open Compose, and drag GMail onto the right half of the screen.&nbsp; Then open your pictures library and drag it to
 the left side.&nbsp; Find the image you want in the pictures library and drag it into the Gmail compose box.</p>

            Thank you Scott for your kind replies. Yeh I have checked it already and it is ticked. Some body told me that this problem may be due the fact that I run proxy sites on my computer in order to see blocked web contents. But cant figure out how can these
 sites cause this problem and how to resolve it. Please give me your opinion in this too, and any other solution that you suggest. Thanks again.

<p>
</p><p>Well, its true that many viruses and other malware get into your computer through email attachments (pictures, videos, etc,.) and using a proxy server vs a DNS will certainly minimize the likelihood of that happening, But, you may be blocking out everything,
 so that not even your Gmail is functioning correctly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you disable the proxy server as a test,&nbsp;and instead&nbsp;use "automatically detect settings"&nbsp;to see if anything changes ....... restart your computer after making the change. ( &nbsp;Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;</p>
<p>Connections&gt;LAN settings).</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If this isn't the answer, suggest you start another thread of your own with the proxy issue.&nbsp; I am not that well versed in proxy settings and might just give you misleading info.&nbsp; There are several MS engineers on this forum who are pretty savvy when it
 comes to LAN/proxy issues.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community. As I understand you have issues saving the Office files. Let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before troubleshooting on the issue, I need more information:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does this issue occur with all Office files, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.?</span>
</li><li><span>Which edition of Office 2007 is installed on the computer?</span> </li><li><span>Did you make any changes to the computer?</span> </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure the Office 2007 is installed with all the latest updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to check what’s causing this issue let’s try the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start the computer in Windows clean boot mode and then try to save the files to verify if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the link below to know on how to start computer in clean boot:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: Ensure to restart the computer in normal mode once troubleshooting is completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean boot is performed to disable all startup programs and 3rd party services on the machine and check if they are conflicting with the Office program.</p>
<p>If so, you may disable the unwanted software those conflict with the suite or get them updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above steps helps. Reply with the result and we will be glad to further assist you.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

    <title>Ctrl C &#47; Ctrl V freeze OneNote, Word, and Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennyjc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ctrl C &#47; Ctrl V freeze OneNote, Word, and Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This starting happening over the past 2 weeks. Sometimes when I copy and paste (just a line or two, not even paragraphs or long sections) using the keyboard shortcut, the program I'm using would freeze. So far it's just limited to Word, OneNote, and Excel.
 I would check on the task manager, and according to the task manager, the program is still running fine (the program wouldn't show up as "not responding" or anything similar), but the entire program would not respond (nothing happens when I click on the exit
 or one of the buttons in the menu, or even press ctrl s to save it). To exit/stop the program, I would have to end the process via the task manager.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is extremely annoying and I hope that somebody can help me out!</p>
<p>PS. I'm running Windows 7 on a Lenovo Ideapad. <br />
</p>
<p>Jenny</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This starting happening over the past 2 weeks. Sometimes when I copy and paste (just a line or two, not even paragraphs or long sections) using the keyboard shortcut, the program I'm using would freeze. So far it's just limited to Word, OneNote, and Excel.
 I would check on the task manager, and according to the task manager, the program is still running fine (the program wouldn't show up as "not responding" or anything similar), but the entire program would not respond (nothing happens when I click on the exit
 or one of the buttons in the menu, or even press ctrl s to save it). To exit/stop the program, I would have to end the process via the task manager.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is extremely annoying and I hope that somebody can help me out!</p>
<p>PS. I'm running Windows 7 on a Lenovo Ideapad. <br />
</p>

            <p>It's the correct answer in terms of manually creating an "All Mail Items" folder but the focus may be&nbsp;incorrect in terms of the intended original question.</p>
<p>However - if you are referring to the "All Mail Items" that appeared in the Navigation pane when clicking on the Mail tab which in turn resulted in the search window&nbsp;appearing if you double clicked on "All Mail Items" - it is different in O'2010.</p>
<p>To get that same functionality in O'2010 - go to <br />
File --&gt; Options --&gt; Search --&gt; Results --&gt; Check "All Folders" instead of "Current Folder"</p>
<p>Once that's done - your search will now be applied to "All Mail Items" (or All Contacts Items or whateve tab you click in the Nav pane) and will appear on the right side but not within the Nav Pane (at least that how it works on the O'2007 &amp; O'2010 systems
 I tried it on). Identical capability - just done differently between O'2007 and O'2010.</p>

</p><p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Community Forum and we’re glad to help you on this issue. Based on your descriptions, you can’t print a document whenever there’s bullet in it. As far as I known, there should be no related settings to affect this. And I can’t reproduce this
 same issue by my side, it may be an issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please first ensure to keep the latest update version. To do that, please go to File &gt; Account &gt; Product Information &gt; Update Options &gt; Update now to check whether there’s any new update version released. The latest version can always have the latest new
 features, bug or security updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then try steps below in different scenarios:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If the issue happens to only a specific document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please create a new document, copy and paste all content to the new created one. This is the most efficient way to get rid of such issue only happening to a specific document.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If the issue happens to all documents even a new created one. You can refer to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/word/print-failures-in-word" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot print failures in Word</a>. To summary, try the steps 1 by 1 below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Update print driver to the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Re-install print driver</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Hold CTRL key and run Word in safe mode to check whether any Office in-app add-ins is affecting this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a> to check whether there’s any 3<sup>rd</sup> parties affecting this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To check whether there’s something wrong with the Office client itself,

<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please provide us more information below for further investigation:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Please provide us a screenshot about the version information via File &gt; Account &gt; Product Information pane. To protect your privacy, please help us mask the email address. This can help us check whether the issue can happen only in a specific
 client version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Dose the issue happen all documents even a new created one? If so, does the issue affect other applications such as PowerPoint or OneNote?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you only have 1 printer? Try other printers if you have the environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Whether there’s any error messages? If so, please provide us screenshot about it. Or does the printer just give no response?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Was there anything changed before the issue occurred? For example, any app installed or updated? Or any custom font installed or updated?</p>

<p>In addition, make sure that you only have the current version of Java installed. Remove all older versions.</p>

<h2>            NOKIA N95 CORRUPT MEMORY &#40;MINI SD&#41; CARD</h2>
                    HI all,<br />
I bought a new 4gb mini sd card for my nokia n95 and it worked fine for a day or so but then i accidentally removed it from my slot whilst the phone was still switched on. Now it keeps coming up as memory card corrupted. I go into options and try to format
 it but keep getting the message 'Memory card in use by other application. Continue anyway?' I click 'Yes' but nothing seems to happen, it just returns to the original screen saying Memory Card Corrupted. Can anyone please help me fix this? :-(

            If you have an N95 that takes miniSD cards then it's a counterfeit phone. There's no knowing what goes into these cheap knock-offs nor how well their O/S manages brutal unmounting of the card.<br />
<br />
I suggest you get hold of an SDHC card reader that plugs into a USB port and you format the card on your computer.

            microSDHC cards needs a different card reader... some sandisk microSDHC cards will come with a SDHC USB card reader, if your does not have one, better buy one and use that to format it... the normal card readers on laptop will not be able to properly read
 and format it, you need a reader with SDHC capability...

            im having this problem too.<br />
i have tried two different memory cards (microSD and microSDHC) but they both get the same error message and cannot be formatted. I have tried all the advice given in this forum and also i have tried a reset of the phone (the one where you type in numbers and
 stars and hashes)<br />
but i am still having this problem.<br />
does anyone have any other ideas what can be done to fix this problem as i am assuming it is a problem with the phone and not the memory cards.

            I had the same issue with the microSD card that came with my N95. Placed card in another phone and deleted corrupted files, but still received same message when re-inserted into N95. Placed card in SD adapter and did the same, but on computer and still
 received same error message. I was able to format using N95 after I stopped using files (ringtones, themes, etc). Hope this helps.

<h2>            Creating a form field to be filled out by a user and populate through out the document</h2>
                    <p><span>I know this is simple but I cannot figure it out.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Working in </span></p>
<p>|Office 2013<br />
&nbsp;|Microsoft Office Word<br />
&nbsp;|Office for Windows 8.1<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please don't reference Greg Massey, I can't understand anything there and his tutorials seem completely out of whack with Word 2013.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am building a contract where field are repeated several times, (FirstName, LastName, Address, etc.)</span></p>
<p><span>I want to create a field in the contract that populated throughout the document with these variable from the first field I population:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>I want to enter the information each time from a template directly on the template.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When a user would get to the template the first page might have something like this.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There they would fill in the variables in italics</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>This contract is for <em><span>FirstName</span></em> <em><span>LastName</span></em> at
<em><span>ThisAddress</span></em>, <em><span>ThisCity</span></em>, <em><span>ThisZipCode</span></em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Static content continues here.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Then one of the variable above is needed again.<span>&nbsp; </span>If it was entered above, it would automatically populate the fields filled in above.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><em>FirstName LastName</em> promises to pay $1 for services.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All Service are performed in <em>ZipCode</em></span></span></p>
<p><span>I know you can do this with bookmarks, but when I did that, and then wanted to CHANGE the variable to make a contract with another person, I had to recreate the bookmark and all referenced fields on the whole thing from an original bookmark again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I want to make this once, and the use just enters the basic information one time and it autopopulates the rest of the doc.</span></p>

            <p>It is NOT to the default text that you create the cross reference, but to the bookmark that is assigned to the FormField.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a good idea to assign a meaningful bookmark name to the formfield and in the example below, I have used TenantName as the bookmark as well as setting that as the default text.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that I have also checked the Calculate on Exit box</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc2bc407-75ae-40f0-8583-03199a99ed70" /></p>
<p>Then, after setting cross references to the Text of the Bookmark and Protecting the document for Filling in Forms, when I enter "Bill Smith" into the FormField</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9df03b6-1a0c-4dbb-8085-85884edd9b2f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>and then press the tab key, this will be the result</p>

    <title>Cortana only listens once on Build 14905 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cortana only listens once on Build 14905</h2>
                    <p>Tried using Cortana after the latest preview build 14905. &nbsp;It seems to work fine the first time but after that it responds to "CORTANA" but then doesn't hear what I am saying. I tried the mic setup once and it says everything is working fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>

            Since they announced Cortana issues when they announced this build release, I would not expect any resolution until some other build is released.
