    <title>After Windows 10 Update, when in Remote Desktop task bar does not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jessenbk  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Windows 10 Update, when in Remote Desktop task bar does not autohide</h2>
                    <p>I don't want to have my task bar set to auto-hide when in desktop mode. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to the latest Windows Update that was released in September 2016, whenever I was using Remote Desktop to connect to client environments, the task bar from my physical PC would disappear if I was &nbsp;using Remote Desktop in full screen mode, thereby allowing
 me to see the task bar in the client machine I am connecting to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, after the update, the taskbar from my physical machine is always at the fore whenever I connect to a client machine, thereby HIDING the taskbar/start button from the machine I am connecting to. &nbsp;So unless I set my machine to auto-hide the taskbar ALL
 the time, which I absolutely hate doing, then I will not see the task bar from the client machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone come across this issue or knows how to fix since the September 2016 update? &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Explorer keeps crashing in Vista Home Premium 64 bit.</h2>
                    This is a fairly new computer, June 2009, from a *brand name* dealer.&nbsp; From day one, Windows Explorer kept crashing.&nbsp; (appcrash), I would just click on restart and it would run till I loaded a new program.&nbsp; This is a fairly constant thing.&nbsp; I contacted
 *brand name* tech support the very first week and they stated that I had a virus.&nbsp; (I knew I didn't but they insisted and tried to sell me a software service agreement.)&nbsp; Now, four months after delivery of the system, things are slowing down and even my Live
 Mail is having random crashes.&nbsp; I ran the sfc / scannow and it shows errors that can not be fixed.&nbsp; I can't see the errors in the log file and am relying on the sfc to tell me this.

<p><span>Hi Henrie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Windows Vista Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>This could be happening is some background program is conflicting with the smooth running of your system. To check that you can
 boot in Safe Mode and see if that is the case.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To boot is Safe Mode follow the below given steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Do one of the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to
 start in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER.
 For more information about options, see Advanced startup options (including safe mode).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart
 your computer and let Windows start normally.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information on Safe Mode follow the link below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Once you boot to the desktop see if you still face the same issue. If not then one of the background program is creating the
 issue. To find out which is the program conflicting perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup
 programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The steps to be performed in clean boot are given below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini
 check box is unavailable.)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> Following this step lets Microsoft services
 continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility
 together with existing restore points</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To find the problem creating program use divide and conquer method. Follow the steps in the given link to do so.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further information on clean boot please follow the below given link:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If in Safe Mode you encounter the same issue then it might be the case of user account corruption. To solve that issue you will
 have to create a new user and then transfer all the data and settings to it and check if the problem persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety (or clicking User Accounts, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking User Accounts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click Manage another account.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click Create a new account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create Account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To copy files to the new user profile</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>After you create the profile, you can copy the files from the existing profile. You must have at least
 three user accounts on the computer to complete these steps, including the new account you just created.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Log on as a user other than the new user you just created or the user that you want to copy files from.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Open Documents by clicking the Start button , and then clicking Documents.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click the Tools menu, and then click Folder Options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you don't see the Tools menu, press ALT.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click the View tab, click Show hidden files and folders, clear the Hide protected operating system files check box, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Locate the C:\Users\Old_Username folder, where C is the drive that Windows is installed, and Old_Username is the name of the profile you want to copy files from.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Select all of the files and folders in this folder, except the following files:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Ntuser.dat</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Ntuser.dat.log</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Ntuser.ini
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click the Edit menu, and then click Copy.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you don't see the Edit menu, press ALT.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Locate the C:\Users\New_Username folder, where C is the drive that Windows is installed, and New_Username is the name of the new user profile you created.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click the Edit menu, and then click Paste.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you don't see the Edit menu, press ALT.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>10. Log off, and then log back on as the new user.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have e-mail messages in an e-mail program, such as Windows Mail, you must import your e-mail messages and addresses to
 the new user profile before you delete the old profile. If everything is working properly, you can delete the old profile.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the steps above do not fix the problem, you should contact your customer support provider for assistance. To find additional
 information about customer support options that apply to this computer, click the Start button, click Help and Support, and then click the Ask someone or expand your search link at the bottom of the Help window.</span></span></p>

    <title>Cannot set default programs and set program associations completely - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vanessa wei  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot set default programs and set program associations completely empty</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I've recently switched from Chrome to Firefox and realized I couldn't set a standard browser or any application for that matter anymore. I don't know when that exactly took place, but it's worth noting that I recently had to roll back the Creator's update
 due to display driver errors and long startups occuring. Currently, I'm using 1607 again and it works fine, so I'm not sure if the rollback had anything to do with it.</p>
<p>Either way, after switching browsers I noticed that no matter what I do, I've been unable to set Firefox as a standard. I've uninstalled Chrome and Windows would revert to using Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>When I enter the Windows 10 settings to set default applications I can select the programs I want but nothing happens, for example the default browser selection just stays blank. If I attempt to select anything else, like a new music player for example or
 revert to windows defaults it will just outright crash with "window not responding" and close itself with no changes made.</p>
<p>When I attempt to set Firefox as a default browser in Firefox' setting itself it will open up a separate system window called "set program a ssociations" which I'd assume is a list of programs I can select as defaults, but this list is completely blank.
 Is this supposed to be this way?</p>

            Hi Vanessa.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />I would go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of the other steps work you can download from this link V.1607 media to download and run over the present install as a Repair Install which fixes most problems.  <a href="https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-and-office-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-scienc...</a>
<br />
<br />But what I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.  If it causes any problems or doesn't solve the problem it can be rolled back in Recovery Settings.
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>  But any program or settings that's causing this conflict will be gone, then you can reinstall your programs and settings slowly over time to see how they affect performance.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>I keep getting this message since Patch Tuesday. I was searching MSComm for KB4038788 and this page was one of the results. Any ideas please?</p>
<p>

<p><br />
FWIW It's one of three new warnings since Patch Tuesday &amp; I've created a separate thread for each. Is anyone else seeing these messages?</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
The warning you encountered is the Enhanced Protected Mode feature of Internet Explorer. Its purpose is to deny or restrict any potential attackers access to sensitive or personal information.&nbsp; By default, this feature is turned off in Internet Explorer but
 when enabled, Enhanced Protected Mode limits how much access malware, spyware, or other potentially harmful code has to your system. As of the moment, we haven't received additional known issues related to the update aside from those listed in
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4038788/windows-10-update-kb4038788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Should you choose to continue the update, you can temporarily disable the feature by following the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start Internet Explorer for the desktop.</li><li>Tap or click<strong> Tools,</strong> and then tap or click <strong>Internet options</strong>.</li><li>On the<strong> Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab, click to clear the<strong>&nbsp;Enable Enhanced Protected Mode</strong> check box under
<strong>Security</strong>.</li><li>Tap or click <strong>OK</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>Please make sure to restart your browser for the settings to take effect.</p>

            Thanks for a very quick reply but I'm confused.
<p>
</p><p>To to get this clear in my mind, I used Search in MSComm to find something (as I've dobe before without problems) but this time I was told that the web page wanted to run MUCatalogWebControl Class. I was warned that it's not compatible with IE's enhanced
 security features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You then&nbsp;told me that the warning was sent by IE's Enhanced Protected Mode and that this is turned off by default. Mine is turned on so an expert here at some time must have told me to turn it on:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e62f82f-80da-4fa0-8264-e45a41434000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e62f82f-80da-4fa0-8264-e45a41434000" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As regards "if you want to continue the update": &nbsp;it's installed already - I've no choice in such matters -and that's why I asked if the Update has caused this change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've presented me with a workaround which you then say you do not recommend as it could make my PC more vulnerable. Should you really be recommending this? Did the WU create this issue?</p>

<p>If you trust microsoft.com not to host malicious ActiveX controls on their site - the largest in the world - then all you have to do is to allow the control to run. IE's Enhanced Protection Mode blocks
<em>all</em> such controls in an attempt to keep you safe. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<p><em>"Had you uninstalled Norton Security and then&nbsp;run the Norton Removal Tool (followed by a reboot) by the time you started this thread?"</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes &amp; Yes</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Is WinPatrol Plus and/or Adblock Plus still enabled or installed?"</em> Not at the time but they both are now.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Have you started using registry cleaners again?" </em>It's been many years since I had a registry cleaner installed and that was bad advice given me at the time. Good advice here was to remove them. Should I search for a list to check they were properly
 uninstalled?</p>
<p>Re CCleaner Free - as you know it has several separate sections: Cleaner, Registry, Tools (Uninstall, StartUp Disk Analyzer &amp; others).</p>
<p>I only use the Cleaner in a very limited way, removing recently typed URLS and emptying the Recycle Bin.</p>
<p>I've never used the Registry tool - this needs a separate command which I steer clear of.</p>
<p>PS In my 'defence' the limited functions I do use have been as advised in MSComm. I haven't the technical nous to select others. But I'm now wondering if I actually need CCleaner at all.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer will normally be running in protected mode in the Internet zone, and this is enough to keep you safe in normal circumstances. If you make a habit of visiting dubious websites, you have the option of erecting an even higher wall around your
 computer, EPM. This will block even more stuff than before, which may of course interfere with your browsing. The support agent was merely drawing your attention to the fact that by turning EPM off, you become more vulnerable to attack. When you're wearing
 belt and braces, your trousers are more likely to fall down if you remove the belt. As it is, in this particular situation there is no need to disable EPM altogether; you can still load the catalogue page simply by allowing the control to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find that EPM is just too restrictive and haven't enabled it on Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Sound is static and fuzzy after wireless adapter plugged in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sound is static and fuzzy after wireless adapter plugged in</h2>
                    I recently got a wireless xbox 360 controller adapter for my pc so that I was able to play a few games. The installation was a success as everything was working so far and the drivers installed with ease. Until I wanted to play a song I discovered that
 the sound came out very static-like and fuzzy. Even when I launch a game the sound all over is static and unintelligible. So I unplugged the adapter and re-booted, the sound was fine again. The after plugging the adapter back the sound disappears altogether.
 If it helps, I use a Microsoft Lifechat LX-3000 headset (that uses USB as well) for my main speakers of sound. I am really at a standstill here, any troubleshooting that can be done here? Or rather a solution or clue?

            It is not that my sound is breaking up, it is that when this wireless controller adapter is plugged in that my sound coming from the usb headset is all static and unintelligible and sounds like a radio not tuned properly. I will try your suggestions but
 like I said, my sound is fine whenever the adapter is not plugged in. Also there is something, else, when I open a song or mp3, windows media player open it but it does not play. In other words, it works, just no playback.<br />

 I got no sound whatsoever that way.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong? How can I get sound out of the surround speakers?</p>

<p>The two things are unrelated. Signing in or not signing in has no influence at all on the ability to send and receive messages. If there is a problem with signing in, authentication is failing for one reason or another. This authentication failure
<em>may</em> also affect sending and receiving mail for the same account, but not for others.</p>

<p>That camera is a 0.3 megapixel video camera that is over a decade old&nbsp; (2005-2006) and its product life cycle more than likely ended in about half that amount of time.&nbsp; For this reason, the latest and last drivers available are Windows 7 drivers (LifeCam
 3.2 suite).&nbsp; Most people have had luck utilizing those drivers in Windows 10 with the Skype for Windows 10 Desktop application.&nbsp; Due to the age of the drivers, people have been unable to get the camera detected in any Windows App like the Camera App or the
 Skype for Windows 10 App.&nbsp; In those instances, the solution would be to utilize Windows 10 compatible drivers.&nbsp; While there are no drivers explicitly available for this camera, you can try the generic USB Video device drivers that come with the OS, to see
 if they will work.&nbsp; If they do not, your option is to use Skype for Windows Desktop, Skype for Web or obtain a fully Windows 10 compatible camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try updating your drivers to the generic "USB Video Device" drivers that come with the OS (as seen below) and see if that resolves the issue.</p>

<h2>            &#40;Halo&#41; Join the Dropshock Brigade, A mature, structured, active and competitive clan</h2>
                    
<p><b>Hello I am <i>Specialist</i> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ODST Venomous</span> of Charlie Company in the Dropshock Brigade, I'd like to offer you a chance to be in one of the most mature, active and structured clan around. Currently we have
 36 members who are from different parts of the world, whether its the U.S., U.K., Canada, or Australia. We have three companies, basically three sections of the clan that you can be put into depending on your location. Our clan is filled with great members
 who like to have fun and be competitive, sometimes at the same time <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.haloreachforum.eu%2fimages%2fsmilies%2ficon_tongue.png" />. If this clan interests you, please read on:</b><br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>I. Basics</b></span><br />
<b>Introduction:</b> We are the <a href="http://dropshock.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Dropshock Brigade</a>. We are the best the UNSC has to offer. We are the protectors of earth and all of her colonies. We are the fastest, strongest, and craziest in the universe.
 We are an all volunteer outfit.<br />
<br />
<b>Motto:</b> <i>"I am an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper. Those words may be used often but we are unique. We are the best trained, best equipped, and craziest outfit in this collection of colonies we call the UNSC. I will defend her to my last breath and give
 my enemies the death that can only be provided under the tread of my black combat boots. I am no normal marine. I push my mind, body, and soul further than most human beings ever will. I instill fear in my enemies as I drop from the heavens like the wrathful
 gods of Greek lore. I show no mercy. I show no fear. I am a UNSC Helljumper and I go feet first."<br />
<br />
"Feet First Into Hell"</i>.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>II. Enlistment</b></span><br />
<br />
<b>Enlisting:</b> There are 3 easy steps into getting into the Brigade.<br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> <a href="http://dropshock.net/register.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Register</a> on the site. Please use your gamertag or something similar to it as your username.<br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> After registering on the site, please fill out the <a href="http://dropshock.net/enlistment.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Enlistment Form</a> and then click submit. Make sure to fill everything out and read the page following the form. Also put ODST Venomous as your recruiter.<br />
<br />
<b>3.</b> Attain the minimum merit requirement(varies by age). The merit system is a type of points system in which you are rewarded for posting in our forums. You must attain 100 merit before taking boot camp.<br />
<br />
<b>Merit Earnings</b><br />
<br />
+3 merit per new thread<br />
+2 merit per reply<br />
+1 merit per shoutbox post<br />
<br />
Failure to heed to a warning will result in loss of merit or overall denial of your enlistment request.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>III. What We Have To Offer</b></span><br />
<b>Ribbons</b>- In the Brigade, a ribbon signifies a soldier who has achieved a certain requirement and has been rewarded a ribbon for it. These ribbons are shown on your site profile. You may see yours and other ODST's ribbons on the side of each post. To
 receive these awards is a very great honor.<br />
<br />
<b>Promotions</b>- Promotions in the <a href="http://dropshock.net/news.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dropshock Brigade</a> are given upon either the completion of a training, or the achievement of a quota. Be active, loyal, show leadership, achieve merit, etc and you may just receive a promotion. Do NOT ask for a promotion. Doing so will most likely result
 in a demotion or loss of merit.<br />
<br />
<b>Organization</b>- We are a well organized clan with a <a href="http://dropshock.net/zwar.php?page=members" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Roster</a>. Personnel are organized into divisions based upon where they live, and what timezone they are in. We have a wide variety of forums to discuss different things with other members.<br />
<br />
<b>Gaming</b>- Unlike a lot of clans, we do actually play games with members. We play Matchmaking a lot, the playlist varying on how many members are on. If we begin to get 7-8 or more we switch over to custom games and have fun. We have game nights usually
 around weekends at nights(EST time) and play whatever.<br />

<h2>            Program Failed to Initialize Microsoft XML</h2>
                    I have this program installed on a laptop running 32bit Vista and a desktop with 64bit Windows 7. It runs fine on the laptop but gives me the "failed to initialize Microsoft XML" whenever I try to use it on 64bit Windows. Any suggestions? I thought maybe
 if I tried to run it in compatibility mode with Windows 7 32bit it might work, but I don't seem to have the leeway to choose compatibility options that I remember from earlier Windows OSs. Thanks.

<p>What Compatibility options do you feel are missing? How are you trying to access Compatibility mode? What program are using to access XML files? Have you tried Compatibility mode on it? For my system XML files open with IE, which may be the problem, there
 is no 32 or 64 Bit program, but a universal Bit depth. Have you tried that yet?</p>

                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>Had the auto repair loop fault on my PC. Eventually found a way to turn it off now i can get on the PC again. &nbsp;Trouble is... &nbsp;my AVG anti virus isn't working any more?? It may have to do with the process below. &nbsp;I have also tried to turn the auto repair

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases, this error may occur when the boot configuration data has the same format as a Windows Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We found a thread that can help resolve the issue. We suggest following the troubleshooting steps provided by Divya R on this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/error-the-boot-configuration-data-store-could-not/9e995bc8-141c-4ed0-9b17-2dbe92369202">thread</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>            sketchbook pro pen misalignment</h2>
                    after I download Windows 10, all was fine until I discovered that the pen is badly misaligned in sketchbook pro. Is there a solution or do I need to revert to 8.1?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have recently purchased Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010 version however this does not include a pdf creator.</p>
<p>How can we download a pdf creator for free? We are simply after the typical application where you have a "pdf creator" as one of your printers.</p>
<p>Also, can adobe pdf creator be downloaded for free or only the windows one?</p>

<h2>            Problem with Major Update &#40;downloaded somewhere around 24 - 29 Sep 2016&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My two&nbsp;identical laptops (if you can provide me the steps to retrieve the infosheet, I can show you the spec) downloaded a major update recently which did the following:</p>
<p>1) Wanted me to click "Update &amp; Shut down", which I did.</p>
<p>2) Took quite some time to get to 100% update &amp; shut down.</p>
<p>3) The next startup shows the same update screen as item 2), but with smaller font size. This time a much slower process.</p>
<p>4) The % went up to ~27% before it restarts by itself (there's a message saying it will auto restart several times)</p>
<p>5) At 32% (after one restart only), the whole screen froze (the other laptop froze at 33%). The white dots stopped moving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue A) I waited about 3 hours: Nothing changed. So I tried all the keys and buttons, but only the power button/force shutdown worked. Obviously we went into System Restore after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B) I do not know how to get a log file for this. I know it may help you to help me.... If anyone can tell me how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>C) Now scared, I turn windows update to minimum + Defer update, and will only click "Shut down" or "Hibernate". Dare not to try "Update &amp; Shut down" again until I get a firm solution from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need any more info, please let me know. Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Luke</p>

<h2>            XBOX live freezing&#47;stuck on loading after I enter password</h2>
                    
<p>This is REALLY annoying now. XBOX starts up and loads fine, lets me enter my password and then after that there is a loading screen for 5 seconds until it comes onto the screen wher it says ''Remember Password/Sign in'' and before you can click sign in,
 the loading part on the right hand side has to come up, well it doesn't its just stuck on that stupid fricking circle going round and round. Have tried resetting everything, have left xbox off and tried again later and still isn't working, what the hell is
 going on?!?!?! I can provide a picture of loading screen if people can give me an email.</p>

            <p>I went to HP Support.&nbsp; They suggested, that my hard drive could be failing.&nbsp; I went to my computer geek and he confirmed my hard drive was failing.&nbsp; HP suggested that I try clone my old hard drive to a new hard drive (assuming it was failing) before it got
 so bad that it could not be cloned.&nbsp; It could not be cloned.&nbsp; I was able to save all my documents and pictures from the old hard drive.&nbsp; I have a new hard drive now which is up and running in Windows 10 with all my same programs and documents and pictures.&nbsp;

13. How do I remove Desktop weather from my desktop? <br />
<a href="http://www.weather.com/services/desktop_install_faq.html#13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.weather.com/services/desktop_install_faq.html#13</a></p>
<p><br />
To remove or uninstall Desktop Weather from your computer, click on "Start" - "Programs" - "The Weather Channel" - "Desktop Weather". Then click on the Uninstall program. Follow the prompts to remove Desktop Weather.</p>
<p>You may also remove the application by clicking on "Start", followed by "Settings", then "Control Panel." Then click on "Add/Remove Programs." From the list, select "The Weather Channel," and then click on "Add/Remove." Follow the prompts to uninstall the
 application.</p>
<p>To remove Weather Services from your PC, you click on "Start" - "Settings" - "Control Panel". Double click on the "Desktop Weather" weather services icon, then click on the "Uninstall Weather Services" button. This should remove any remaining elements from
 your system.</p>
<p><br />
14. I seem to be unable to uninstall Desktop Weather from my computer. What can I do?</p>
<p><br />
This is a known issue with the product, and will be resolved in a forthcoming release. Copying the UNWISE.EXE from the Framework folder to the Desktop Weather folder will resolve this issue. The steps are as followed:</p>
<p>Go to Start, Programs, Accessories, Windows Explorer. <br />
In the left scroll window of Windows Explorer click the + next to My Computer, then click on the + next to C: drive to expand the view.
<br />
Scroll down that menu until you find the Program Files Folder. <br />
Double click on the Program Files folder to expand the view. <br />
Scroll down that menu to The Weather Channel FW folder and double click on it to expand the view.
<br />
Double click on the Framework folder to display the contents. <br />
Right mouse click on the icon that says "UNWISE.EXE" on the pop-up menu click on COPY.
<br />
Go to the tool bar on the window and click the Back button. <br />
In that window right mouse click on the "Desktop Weather" folder and in the pop-up menu click on PASTE.</p>
<p>From that point you will be able to proceed as normal with the uninstall. <br />
<br />

            That's an elderly modem and a quick Google shows that there are no Vista or Windows 7 drivers for it. Replace the modem with one that supports Windows 7.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Checked your solution</p>
<p>Meanwhile i contacted the Samsung (TV provider). They provided me a link to download Intel Wi Fi DIrect update tool. However this is the error i am getting. Are my drivers outdated?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03682b13-cb2a-42ea-94ee-95f73540d8d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03682b13-cb2a-42ea-94ee-95f73540d8d7" /></a></p>
