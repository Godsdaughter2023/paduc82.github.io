<h2>            Keyboard is too slow in Word app for iPad</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed and am trying Word on my iPad 2 (16GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type, the keyboard is very slow (long delay between key pressed and letter shown in the document).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The document is not very long (400 words) but has 5 tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behaviour of Word is the same on other similar documents: the keyboard is slow to respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, the keyboard is sufficiently fast in apps like the pre-installed Notes app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any hints on how to speed up the keyboard to an acceptable level?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 - Restoring fields to search box</h2>
                    <p>Running Outlook 2013 (Office 2013) on Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Outlook 2013, when I click in the single-line search box that appears at the top of an email folder such as Inbox or Deleted Items, it immediately expands into a blue box with several commonly used email fields available to enter search criteria.&nbsp; Each
 field also has an X to the right that removes it from the blue box.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mistakenly removed a couple fields and I haven't been able to put them back in that box.&nbsp; After an hour or more of futility searching Microsoft, Office.com, and even this Community I haven't found an answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andybody know where MS cleverly hid this?</p>

            That error simply means that your current connection strength is temporarily too weak. You can try refreshing the connection, rebooting the phone or trying to connect using a different network.&nbsp; a public network should do the trick and then you can reconnect
 to your personal wifi.

</p><p>Is there some way for me to get out of this conversation which seems to be between someone at Microsoft and AlyssaPerez1? &nbsp;It's an offshoot of a conversation that I started and am still engaged in, but this thread is not of interest to me, at least that's
 what I think. &nbsp;I want to have only one SKYPE account -- not a separate account on my phone from the one that's on my MacBook Air.</p>

<p>Hi Alice,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You simply need to sign in using the Skype account that's on your MacBook to the Skype application on your phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a suggestion, please check the Skype Name of the account that's logged in to your MacBook by following the steps on this support page:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10858/what-s-my-skype-name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What's my Skype Name?</a>. Once you found the Skype Name of the account that's on your MacBook, please sign out of the app on your phone, then sign back in using the Skype Name you've seen on your MacBook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Thanks. I couldn't see a way to sign out that would then let me sign in as another user. Finally, I just trashed the SKYPE app on my phone, reinstalled it and signed in with the account that's on my computer. Can I tell you, I had to let Microsoft walk off
 with even the tiny balance left in my other SKYPE account and I may go to the trouble of redoing this so I can use it up, but at least for now my computer and phone use the same SKYPE account. Helpful for contacts and history, for sure.</p>

            <p>After my 3rd session with my ISP I finally found a technician who could resolve my problem. My IP address was blocked from sending e-mails by spamhause. The only explanation we can speculate on is that the address was hijacked by a spammer who sent so many
 emails that is was automatically blocked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After verifying that I have active anti-virus software and that I had scanned my computer since the problem began, the technicial was able to remove the block and everything is working again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In reply to your question however, I believe my email was refused by the server. The instant I clicked on send the error message appeared. If I went to the webmail access with direct access to the server I could send messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your support.</p>

    <title>Changing font for text in one cell of table changes text in every - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> if52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing font for text in one cell of table changes text in every cell, and outside the table too&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So one of my associates has a Word document into which she has added a table. She claims to have added the table using
<em>Insert, Table</em> from the ribbon. This table is in addition too many other tables in the doc. When she tries to change the font for a word or a few word in a cell it changes the font for all the cells, and even some words outside the table? This does
 not happen in any other table in her document. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas why this is happening???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> - Never mind, I figured it out. She had styles applied to some of the text in the cells. I think she copied and pasted out of some other source to populate the cells and it copied over the styles. So when she would change the font for
 any word that had that style applied, it would change the font for everything that had the particular style applied. Removing the style corrected the issue.</p>

<h2>            Purchasing Office 365 University and Installing - currently have Office 2003</h2>
                    <p>I would like to purchase Office 365 University, but have noticed the problems many people are having installing it on their machines. Maybe some answers to questions could help me get it right the first time.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;I currently have Office 2003 installed on my computer. Do I need to uninstall it before installing Office 365?</p>
<p>If I need to uninstall it, are there any pieces that will not be removed by the uninstall process that I need to delete manually? What are those "remnants"?</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;The software will be physically installed on my computer - right? And I will be able to use the software even when my cable connection goes out for a while - right? I understand that to retrieve documents or objects&nbsp;from the SkyDrive I will need to have
 an active internet connection, and to use the software on someone else's computer I will need internet access - but I want to make sure I can use the software even when I don't have internet connection to the computer that the software is installed on.</p>
<p>3) I don't expect to be in college for another 4 years - once I have purchased the software, will I have to recertify my student status every semester? Or is the license good for 4 years even if I'm only in school for another 2 years?</p>
<p>4) I expect to install the 2 licenses - one on a PC, and one on a MacBook Pro. Are there any specific issues I need to be aware of prior to installing the software on Mac OS?</p>

            1 <b>No.</b>&nbsp; MS advertised that you could test Office 365 alongside currently installed versions of Office.<br />
<br />
1a. If you use Picture Manager (is it there in 2003?) , you will probably want to keep it. There is no equivalent in 2013.<br />
<br />
2. <b>NO.</b> Office 365 run inside of the "Click to Run" (CTR) virtual computer environment.
<br />
<br />
2a. YES you can continue to use 365 Off line. You have to connect to the internet periodically, I THINK roughly monthly.<br />
<br />
3. That is a subject of for discussion.&nbsp; MS advertises that it is a "4 year subscription", but when I contacted MS online support the story is still vague, but different.&nbsp; Apparently on the annual anniversary of activation of 365 University MS contacts the
 school to confirm you are still a student. The implication is that if you have graduated you will no longer qualify for the remaining time on your 4 year subscription.&nbsp; That is my interpretation, I have not seen an official confirmation from MS either way.<br />
<br />
4. Office 365 University comes with license to install on up to 2 computers at the same time, so you are OK that way.&nbsp; The 2 computers can be a mix of PC and Macs, so you are OK that way.&nbsp; It will install the Native Office for Mac, the current version is 2011.&nbsp;
 When the Mac version is updated (guesstimate a year or two) it will be upgraded automagically as part of the 365 license.<br />
<br />
NOTE: the license also allows you to install on up to 2 additional mobile devices.<br />

<div><b><span>Academic Status Verification</span></b> </div>
<p><b>https://</b></p><a href="http://www.msacademicverify.com/AVE/FAQ/Default.aspx?pid=26FD2679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.msacademicverify.com/AVE/FAQ/Default.aspx?pid=26FD2679</a>-84F3-4111-A0FE-340D5CF03032<span>&nbsp;
</span>- FAQ for Office University ID validation (annual student validation)
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b>Q: </b>How often does my academic status need to be verified?
</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b>A:</b> Once a year. Or, we should say, once every 12 months from your last verification date.
</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>Well, that is a little disconcerting. So I used the contact link on that page and had the following conversation to get clarification on the need for academic verification.</p>
<p>The answer is “maybe”. </p>
<p>The short answer is, contrary to what the advertising says, the subscription is only good while you are a student and for at most 1 year after.<span>&nbsp;
</span>MS automatically verifies your academic status every year, so after you graduate, when your anniversary date rolls around your subscription will be cancelled.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At the end of the conversation, there is a slight hope that the automatic renewal verification is simply a check to see if your EDU email address is still active. In that case, if the school allows you to continue to use your EDU email after graduation,
 you could continue to use Office 365 University.</p>
<p>For your edification, here is the whole conversation, </p>

<p>I see here you &nbsp;have &nbsp;an inquiry about Office 365 University?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:05:35 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I have a question about the Office 365 University subscription terms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The offer says the subscription is good for 4 years after you provide proof you are a student, after your "academic status is verified"....
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This FAQ page expands on that: <a href="https://www.msacademicverify.com/AVE/FAQ/Default.aspx?pid=26FD2679-84F3-4111-A0FE-340D5CF03032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</span>
<p>It says quote</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Q: How often does my academic status need to be verified? </p>
<p>A: Once a year. Or, we should say, once every 12 months from your last verification date.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the question is. If I buy 365 university in my last year and it is verified then, what happens to the subscription one year later when I have to verify my academic status again an I have graduated?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:09:11 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good question, the verification will conduct one time only, just to make sure that the customer is really a legit student from a certain university , and it will last for four years or until the subscription ends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:10:28 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would hope that is true. If it is true, then the FAQ has to be corrected because it gives a very different impression. Is your interpretation available online anywhere that I can see?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:15:15 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is true, and that is what we are trained to give the details for our product. Once your Office 365 University is activated on your Microsoft Account with the confirmation that you are with the University.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subscription will stay after 4 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:17:34 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need a link that contradicts the content in the FAQ. I provide support to people who are asking this question and they need to see something "official" from MS as confirmation. Right now all they see is that FAQ entry that says they will/could be "ripped
 off" after just one year of use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if I can point to them to a web page that says what you have just said, they will believe me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:19:29 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please send me the link again containing the FAQ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:20:01 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure here it is <a href="https://www.msacademicverify.com/AVE/FAQ/Default.aspx?pid=26FD2679-84F3-4111-A0FE-340D5CF03032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:22:36 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just stay on the line please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:22:49 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>ok</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:29:11 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What does being verified mean? </p>
<p>A: Simply put, being verified means that the academic status of a user has been confirmed by the verification source (usually a school, organization or commercial student identity provider) selected by the user within the Academic Verification Engine. Each
 user has to be verified as a student or educator before taking advantage of the education product offers in this site. We verify student status the first time they visit, and then once a year thereafter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:31:06 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I have is with the last line “We verify student status the first time they visit,
<b>and then once a year thereafter.”</b></p>

<p>The verification will be automatic, it will send email to your school just to check that you are still associated with them.</p>
<p>Same as what I have said that no need for you to update since the email will go directly to your school for the update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:34:22 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>YES, that is precisely the problem. Office 365/2013 just came out. A student who is graduating this year or next year buys it. After they graduate they will no longer be students and what you are saying is that the subscription will be automatically cancelled
 before the 4 year term is up because they are no longer students. That is FALSE ADVERTISING!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:43:41 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ron you have a very interesting question which the first time I have encountered, to better answer your question is for you to verify the school policy on how long they will keep your account as an active student, and for the Product title itself it's a
 University, it's for student and I get your point for the graduating issue, but it's with school's policy that will provide you the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:48:33 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have encountered this question several times. I finally decided to try and get official clarification. Lets face it, no school is going to tell MS a former student is still a student (for up to 3 years) just to allow the student to continue to use Office
 University. THAT would be a VIOLATION of their agreement with MS. Your interpretation of the license terms means that the price of Office 365 University has increased MANY times compared to the Office 2010 Academic Offer which was US$100 for a license with
 no time limit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:57:43 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ron, this is a fact that there will be administrator on your school that will take care of your school account, now they will be the one who will take charge as to when your account is still valid with them, and each school I believe that they have their
 own policy with school accounts which they can only answer that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7:59:44 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, that is an interesting twist. Do you mean that the "academic verification question" is "is this school email account still valid" rather than is this person still a paying student (or paid staff)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Israel V:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>8:06:53 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ron, an honest answer is that I don't know the content of the email verification since it should have privacy as to the administrator will be the one who can read and will reply for the verification. So if you want that question be answered your school office
 is the appropriate to contact with that, there is so called school policy right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>8:08:03 AM&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK. Thanks for you help. Even though I don’t like it, I have my answer. Office 365 University is good while you are in school and for no more than 1 year after you graduate no matter how much time remains in the 4 year subscription. Feedback</p>

    <title>Calls not connecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robc1ark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calls not connecting</h2>
                    <p>I have used Skype on a number unknown basis for three months. The amount of calls not connecting as it is coming from an unknown number was around 10-15%.</p>
<p>I have since bought a Skype number to leave a trace on my call and also to overcome the above issue, but the ratio of calls not connecting is now running nearer 30-35%</p>
<p>How can I overcome this as I use skype for business calling and means a lot of time is lost making a call that doesn't connect and then having to revert to other phones to make the call.</p>
<p>As one of my other options is an IP phone, I know it is not just because the call is being made from an IP address.</p>

            Just reply in the thread.&nbsp; As far as I know there is no facility for insider to insider private messages.&nbsp; I believe that moderators can send you a private message and that you can then reply in the same channel but I don't think private messaging is meant
 for general usage in bypassing threads.

<h2>            Concurrent editors on SharePoint Document</h2>
                    <p>Hi team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This question was in fact asked earlier and there's a suggestive recommendation provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time, it's still a highly concerned one among corporate users. If the recommended maximum number of concurrent editors upgraded&nbsp; with another number? Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Effie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the query and we are here to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The number has not been increased yet. The recommended maximum number of concurrent editors is still 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following table lists the recommended guidelines for lists and libraries.</p>

    <title>Hotmail&#39;s Rules for sorting new messages are gone 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmitriy g.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail&#39;s Rules for sorting new messages are gone 2</h2>
                    I had exactly the same issue at the beginning of the year and even though I have an original automated email that was sent to my email, the post is gone. Why can't I find it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's my situation. I have rules set up in hotmail where it resorts certain email to different folders. When I just opened my email I saw about 600+ emails in my inbox and i knew something was wrong. When i checked the rules, all of them were gone
 and a new one was created which says "Move messages to Junk if to/cc address contains word
<em>**Email address removed due to privacy** </em>"". I change my password constantly, so I'm not compromised. I've worked with Microsoft support in January on the same issue and after analyzing my account the only thing they could offer which I don't believe
 is that since Microsoft has a lot of different servers around the world, they need to be synchronized and there's a possibility that one of them was not and it replaced all my rules with a default one. Well, now it's
<em>**Email address removed due to privacy**&nbsp;</em>and in January it was something. The reason i don't trust this response is that since January I haven't changed any rules, so why all of a sudden it would change again? Is Microsoft trying to tell me that to
 sync all of it's servers it takes them 1 year?<br />
<br />
Anyway, anyone can help me with this?<br />

            Thank you for a response but it's useless and doesn't address my question. I didn't lose any data or any emails, so all of that information is useless to me.&nbsp; I have a very strong password which is 25 characters long even though when you login to account
 Hotmail recognized only 16 characters. This was a topic of my other post and based on google search is the issue for the longest time. I have the latest patches for OS, all my apps, etc. I already mentioned that I access my account from home only, so "<span>Be
 careful signing in to your Microsoft account from public computers or unsecure wireless networks</span>" is useless information. I understand that you need to provide best practices and that's why your email is scripted, but again it's been a number of days
 and my question is still not answered.<br />

<b>Options-More options</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under
<i>Customizing Hotmail</i>, choose<b> Rules for sorting new messages</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click on<b> New</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Follow the instructions to which messages you want to apply the rule.</span></p>

<br />
1) Why this happened?<br />
2) Where's the forum thread on the same topic from January?<br />

And an additional question of why it takes over 24 hours to respond for you and based on the responses I see it's more like over 2 days,<br />

<p>Hi Dhiraj,</p>
<p>Generally, we follow the steps in&nbsp;<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-passwords-getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this article</a> to enable users to reset or change their on-premise Active Directory passwords.</p>
<p>To better understand your scenario, I’d like to collect the information below:<br />
1. About “password write back option not working”, did you get any error message? If yes, please send us related screenshots.
<br />
2. What was the support code generated when you saw the error (to find this, reproduce the error? Then click the Support Code link at the bottom of the screen and send the support engineer the GUID that results).<br />
If you are on a page without a support code at the bottom, press F12 and search for SID and CID and send those two results to us.<br />
3. Was the user federated, password hash synced, cloud only? Did the user have an AAD Premium or AAD Basic license assigned?</p>
<p>To upload a picture, please click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> under the reply box and then click the
<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> icon.</p>

<p>Hi Poppy,</p>
<p>Thanks for response.</p>
<p>I am in new office 365 and 1st time is enabling password writeback feature for cloud users.</p>
<p>I have read this article and follow the steps but may be some mistake we are unable change password from office 365 to on-premise AD.</p>
<p>1. We did not get any error message.</p>
<p>2. No any support code generated. In event viewer event id 31005 is generated.</p>
<p>3. Users are cloud only. and assign AAD Premium license.</p>

<p>Hi Dhiraj,</p>
<p>The users need to be synced from on premise AD. Do you mean the user’s status is shown as “in cloud” in Office 365 admin center? I would like to confirm if you meet the requirement referring to
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-passwords-getting-started/#writeback-prerequisites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
azure.microsoft.com/.../</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you create a test user in AD, and sync to cloud. After that, navigate to Portal and click “Can’t access your account” to change the test user’s password. To verify if it is working, please look for event 31002 - PasswordResetSuccess from the source
 PasswordResetService for your test user.</p>
<p>Let me know the result.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Johnny,</p>
<p>I would like to clear my scenario. </p>
<p>1. Users are created in Cloud and status is shown as "in cloud" in office 365 admin center. for example *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>2. After that same id *** Email address is removed for privacy *** create in on-premise AD.</p>
<p>3. In between Azure AD connect tool installed.</p>
<p>4. we would like to when change password office 365 user *** Email address is removed for privacy *** then automatically should change on-premise AD user *** Email address is removed for privacy *** password.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi Dhiraj,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>If you have created a cloud user and want to connect it to an AD user, you can match them using the SMTP address

<p>Hi Dhiraj,</p>
In this situation, please try create a test user in AD, and sync to cloud. After that, navigate to Portal and click “Can’t access your account” to change the test user’s password. To verify if it is working, please look for event 31002 - PasswordResetSuccess
 from the source PasswordResetService for your test user.
<p>Any update will be appreciated. </p>

Hi Dhiraj,
<p>It means that the password write back didn’t work.</p>

<h3> colforbin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore Word style settings to default</h2>
                    At one point, I was working on a document that needed pretty specific formatting. So I modified all of the "heading" styles to fit what I needed there. But now those styles have persisted, and I don't want that formatting anymore. I'd like to go back to
 the default heading styles. Is there a way to restore these?

            <p>Hello sudeshsalokhe:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Answers forum,&nbsp;I understand that when you attempting to update your Nokia Lumia 800 device you receive the error 801811A3 at around Step 2 of the update process. I can certainly understand your frustration as this is
 certainly not the experience we want you to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the information you have provided, it seems like you have tried most if not all of the troubleshooting steps outlined in the following link below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2484484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2484484</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though this has been proven to fix a lot of instances with this error, there may be an underlying factor that this troubleshooting step does not fully address. There are two different ways we can rule out factors that could be causing this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Try the update on a different PC:</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the step suggests, trying the update on a different PC may help to rule out a lot of different issues such as background process interference or even permissions issues tied to the Windows user profile. As the update itself isn't necessarily native to
 the PC, this can be done using a friend/family/neighbor's computer.&nbsp; I would suggest you try this from a computer connected to another network.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Start your computer in Selective Startup</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding that not everyone will have access to a secondary computer, this step can help rule out any background processes or services that can interfere with the update. For information on this process, please refer to the link below:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this information helps to address the issue with updating your phone. As always if you have any questions or concerns please feel free to reply and we will be more than happy to assist.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So I made a group calendar and added my co-workers into that calendar. For some reason, one of my co-worker has access to our personal business calendar even though I only added her to the group calendar, not the co-workers' calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I disable that on my end? I added her through Office 365 and it is showing up on the Outlook 2013.</p>

<p><span>Hi Minh Nguyen,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is the Group calendar an Office 365 group calendar? If so, generally, every members can only view the calendars of the groups they belong to under “<strong>All Group Calendar</strong>”, and based on my test,
 I couldn’t add a new calendar under “<strong>All Group Calendar</strong>”. This behavior is the same as Outlook Web App, under “<strong>Group</strong>”, you can view all groups’ calendar, when you click “<strong>+</strong>” next to
</span><span>“<strong>Group</strong>”</span><span>, it will allow you to create a new Office 365 group instead of a calendar:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06fdc3c5-fbe6-4fd1-b250-c8162e067932?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06fdc3c5-fbe6-4fd1-b250-c8162e067932?upload=true" /></a>
 &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/786ccebc-0fb5-434a-a4b1-5740e9f99728?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/786ccebc-0fb5-434a-a4b1-5740e9f99728?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you are mentioning “<strong>Calendar Group</strong>”, when a new Calendar group is created, you can add other users’ calendar to that group on both Outlook client and Outlook Web App,
<strong>if you add the calendar group on Outlook Web App, it will also be synced to Outlook desktop client.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/accdf4be-1feb-480d-9b3b-8ca768a84305?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/accdf4be-1feb-480d-9b3b-8ca768a84305?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To better understand your issue, I’d like to confirm the following information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Whether the group calendar you mentioned is calendar group, and you add your co-works calendar into that group on Outlook Web App?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2. If so, the calendar group has synced to Outlook desktop client, however that co-workers calendar appears under “<strong>My Calendar</strong>” instead of the calendar group you created?
<strong>You may manually drag it to the calendar group to see if it can be moved.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please feel free to let me know if you have different scenario.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            <p>I have had no problem with Defender deleting .exe files.&nbsp; Perhaps something got messed up during your download, or perhaps there really is a virus and you may be sorry if you leave them there.&nbsp; Why don't you try putting them in another computer that does
 not have Defender&nbsp;and seeing what happens.</p>

            I have exactly the same problem, I want to download the zune music software which is a Microsoft certified product (how embarrassing)&nbsp;and I have exactly the same problem, It will instantly delete the .exe file as soon as the download is completed. annoying
 and frustrating.

            How can I exclude a program that windows defender deleted? Is there anyway to get the file back? Can I remove defender, or shut it off permanently?

 now,i would have to download it every time again and install!</p>
<p>
