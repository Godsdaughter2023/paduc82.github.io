<h2>            Fully legitimate MSDN copy of Windows 10 Enterpise has deactivated itself after 2 years with no hardware changes or OS reinstalls</h2>
                    <div>
<p>My MSDN Windows 10 Enterprise edition has deactivated itself and I get the watermark on my desktop.&nbsp; There has been no hardware changes or OS reinstall for more than 2 years.&nbsp; Why is this happening?&nbsp; What do I do about it?&nbsp; Has the key somehow become invalid?</p>

    <title>Why am I getting some prank toll free call about My Windows 10 licence - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why am I getting some prank toll free call about My Windows 10 licence key expiring&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I didn't do anything to my system to cause this message to appear on the phone!</p>
<p>What I have for protection is Avast and The Time Freeze Tool Sandbox from Microsoft.</p>
<p>I was using Teamviewer for mirroring my Samsung Galaxy Luna, </p>
<p>when this message had came on the home phone.</p>
<p>There's no reason why my license key would expire, because</p>
<p>I didn't purchase the package, when it was installed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Should I put this call on some blacklist? Seriously! Is it really some concern?
</p>
<p>Otherwise, the call possesses some kind of threatening message!</p>
<p>Were you making prank phone calls on the home phone?</p>

                    Hi - I found this file in my c drive along with documents and settings, program files, windows, etc:
<br />
&nbsp;"1f809fdf739beef1a4b5d1e816790dd7" on my computer and 2 folders located in this file: "am64" and "i386"
<br />
if I open am64 there are files: filterpipelineprintproc.dll, msxpsdrv, and more "msxpsdrv" files for set up, etc.<br />
if I open i386 they files are the same as am64<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After you install the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 in Windows XP or Windows Server 2003, there is an arbitrary folder that is generated in
 the root of drive C. This folder contains two subfolders that are named amd64 and i386. These two subfolders both include the following files:
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Filterpipelineprintproc.dll
</span></li><li><span>Msxpsdrv.cat
</span></li><li><span>Msxpsdrv.inf
</span></li><li><span>Msxpsinc.gpd
</span></li><li><span>Msxpsinc.ppd
</span></li><li><span>Mxdwdrv.dll
</span></li><li><span>Xpssvcs.dll</span></li></ul>
<p><span>These files were pending to be deleted from the XPSEPSC installation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I bought the app on my android phone google store, my laptop is a window 10 / windows store. I can imagine that is the reason I can't download it on my laptop. When I bought it I read I could download in 10 devices but I wasn't aware of this issue regarding
 the stores, I am hoping to find a solution so I can have it in both devices.&nbsp;</p>

            The Microsoft store isn’t connected in any way to the Google App Store as they’re different operating systems which means you’d have to purchase the app again. The good news is that it’s currently on sale:

<p>Recently, some malware that seems to be new, has infested my computer.</p>

<p>Have you checked Control panel&gt; Programs and features for imp.ytdwld.com (or similar)<br />
search.yahoo.com</p>
<p>or any other program you don't remember installing&nbsp;that might be causing this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most users report that Malwarebytes and Zemana remove a Yahoo search redirect. Curious that they didn't work for you.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>About those Registry keys...</p>
<p>With a stock Windows 7 installation, and no hijack or redirect or Yahoo problems, I have the same keys/values in #2 and #3 that you have. I don't think you need to change those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In #1 and #4 I don't have the DoNotAskAgain DWORD Values at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know how to backup/export the Registry, right?</p>
<p>I would backup the Registry then delete those DoNotAskAgain DWORD values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's a problem after deleting those DWORD values, restore that Registry backup.</p>

<p>Let's back up. Are you seeing any signs of a hijack? Has Yahoo taken over in some visible way? Are you able to select the default Search Provider for any browsers you're using and have those selections stick?</p>

<p>Im looking for some friends to play online with. Im pretty sick of talking to all the random ten year olds you find in lobbies who whine when they die. Im 16 and a girl and I usually play Halo 4, tomb raider, and occasionally CoD. Id love to be able to chat
 and play with chill people my own age.&nbsp;</p>

<p>P.s. im not one of those crazy chicks who get on live for attention. Im the crazy chick that whoops their *** in regicide.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows DVD Maker - Green screen and half green screen menu AND only - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bertock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows DVD Maker - Green screen and half green screen menu AND only first two chapters work</h2>
                    
<p>Can somebody please help me?&nbsp; I've been looking everywhere on Google for this answer and I can't seem to come up with anything somewhat understandable.</p>
<p>I'm attempting to burn my first DVD using Windows DVD maker.&nbsp; I'm currently running Vista at 32-bits and my installed version of Windows DVD Maker doesn't seem to have the "compatibility" tab in its options menu (I have absolutely no idea why that is or
 how I can fix it).</p>
<p>The problem I'm having here is that when I finally got my DVD to burn, the final product showcased a half green and full green DVD menu.&nbsp; What I mean by this is that I used the "Video Wall" menu style and half of the video blocks were either squished by
 a green bar halfway up the screen or were completely green.&nbsp; I want to say this has to be some sort of codec problem, as that seems to be the consensus from what I've found online, but their are parts of the menu screen that play exactly how they should.</p>
<p>This problem compounds when I go and try to watch the videos, which I have broken up into chapters.&nbsp; The first two work flawlessly.&nbsp; However, once I move to the third chapter about five minutes in it locks up.&nbsp; Every chapter from then forth doesn't even
 begin to play; they just lock up my DVD player.</p>
<p>My one hope is that, because I didn't sit around and wait while my computer encoded and then burned the DVD, that perhaps it didn't finish properly creating the disc.&nbsp; Oddly, when I returned to check on my computer it had turned off and the DVD burner was
 open with the disc sitting there waiting for me.&nbsp; Is it possible that one of my anti-virus programs, which I have set to turn the computer off after diagnostic, might have cut my DVD creation short?&nbsp; More over, if that is the case is it possible that this
 might contribute to the green bars/screens on my title menu?</p>
<p>Any help here would be greatly appreciated, because I'm entirely out of ideas.</p>

<p>=========================================<br />
This issue gets complex and hopefully the following info will help<br />
you begin to sort it out.</p>
<p>First...the Compatibility tab you refer to is found in Movie Maker...<br />
Tools / Options / Compatibility tab.</p>
<p>And...FWIW...if your DVD had not completed...it would not play at all.</p>
<p>As for the green screen...the following info...may be useful:<br />
<br />
If you created this project in Movie Maker before burning in DVD Maker...<br />
some users report that Publishing the project in the DV-AVI format may<br />
eliminate the appearance of the Green Bar. Once Published...you can<br />
import the .avi file into DVD Maker.</p>
<p>If you want several Scenes (chapters) on the DVD...just create several<br />
different projects in Movie Maker...Publish&nbsp;each one&nbsp;in the DV-AVI format <br />
to a folder on your hard drive and then import the collection of movie clips <br />
into DVD Maker.<br />
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I tried to follow the directions, I was unable to find XVid on my<br />
computer.&nbsp; So I googled XVid and then went to ( I think) the 2nd entry to<br />
download XVid.&nbsp; After I downloaded it, I was able to follow the directions<br />
from bernzilla and when I published&nbsp; a video -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Voila!! no green bar!!!!<br />

<p>Thanks for the advice, Volunteer J.&nbsp; I truly appreciate it.&nbsp; Although, I didn't create the project in Movie Maker; I took the raw .avi files and threw them into Windows DVD Maker.&nbsp; I didn't think it mattered.&nbsp; The "preview" option showed everything worked
 pristine, so I just went with it.</p>
<p>As far as the DV-AVI format goes, I'm not sure that is going to be a viable option.&nbsp; I set it up to publish in that file type and it estimated the file size to be over 12 GB.&nbsp; Something about that doesn't sound right at all - especially considering the original
 files barely creep over 350MB.&nbsp; I mean, if each chapter is ballparked around 12GB, how could I get one chapter onto the DVD, much less five more?</p>
<p>As for the "compatibility tab," it most certainly does exist in Windows DVD Maker ... just not on my version, apparently.&nbsp; We have a computer here that runs Windows 7 and its version of DVD Maker has exactly that.&nbsp; The reason why I even bring it up to begin
 with is because I came across suggested I remove the XVid filter (which I realize now I don't even have the codecs for anyway).&nbsp; But it definitely showed the option available in the Options of Windows DVD Maker.&nbsp; I have since, however, downloaded the XVid
 codec in hopes that perhaps that will solve the problem (though with my luck I highly doubt it).</p>
<p>The part that really seems to be bugging me about this is that the green bars do not exist when I'm viewing the raw files, so it's not like this is something that should have anything to do with Movie Maker - because I have no desire to clip or edit any
 of the footage.&nbsp; Everything works just fine until Windows DVD Maker creates my DVD.&nbsp; I just don't understand how everything can appear to work properly and then after I patiently wait for it to finish encoding and go through the entire burning process it just
 proves to be a complete waste of time and resources.&nbsp; It seems like this shouldn't be this difficult.</p>

<p>================================================<br />
I understand that you created the project in DVD Maker...I was just offering<br />
some info that I thought might help. Creating in Movie Maker and rendering <br />
in the DV-AVI format may eliminate the Green Bar. Apparently the info was <br />
not useful and I apologize for wasting your time.</p>
<p>BTW...DV-AVI renders high quality video and 13 GB per hour of footage would<br />
be expected. If you have 5 projects equal to the first one which must be about <br />
50 minutes...they will not fit on one single layer DVD. And...just to clarify...<br />
Video DVDs are rendered based on duration...not file size.<br />
<br />
One last tip and I'm done...creating smaller projects might be something to <br />
consider because the larger and more complex a project becomes the better <br />
chance you have for corruption and failed DVDs.</p>
<p>Good luck with your video editing...hopefully someone can provide some useful <br />
info for you.</p>

<h2>            computer won&#39;t restart or shut down</h2>
                    I've only had this computer for a few months, and its been fine. Normally I leave it in sleep mode when I'm not using it. Recently, (maybe a couple of weeks) it won't shut down properly. Sometimes it will lock up during use, or when updates install, it
 asks for a restart. When&nbsp;I initiate restart or shutdown, it just hangs. The only way to shut it down is to unplug, which gives me message that I didn't shut down properly when it does start up. Sometimes when I open Windows mail, I get a message saying it
 can't open because there is another instance of it running (there is not) and to log off, and re- open windows mail. It won't log off, just hangs and I have to unplug again.
<br />
I'm not a tech-y person, and this has me frustrated to no end.

<p><span><span>Thank you for using Microsoft Vista Answers Forums.<br />
</span><br />
Since this issue that you are experiencing started a couple of weeks ago, you can use the System Restore tool to restore the computer to an earlier point in time. Using the System Restore tool may not necessarily help you determine the issue. When you use System
 Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Before you proceed please back up your data</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type
<strong>system restore </strong>in the Start Search box, and then click <strong>
System Restore </strong>in the Programs list. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the System Restore dialog box, click
<strong>Choose a different restore point</strong>, and then click <strong>
Next.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Finish.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.</span></p>
<p><span>If it is an update, the best way to fix this is to only apply your updates one at a time to determine which of the updates is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Windows Update, click Change Settings from the left menu. Select Download updates but let me choose whether to install them,
 click OK. When you are notified to install a new update, from this window click View Available updates, uncheck all updates and select one at a time, install it, restart your computer, test, and update again. Once you find the update either continue to skip
 it, or look it up at </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;We hope this resolves the issue and look forward to hearing back from you on your results.</span></p>

            Hi <br />
Just to clarify, you are referring to the actual mouse touchpad on the laptop and not an external mouse that you have plugged in, correct?
<br />
<br />
Please tell us the results when you attempted to start the computer in safe mode.
<br />
<br />
Also, have you contacted the computer manufacturer yet. It sounds like there is a chance this could be a piece of hardware going bad.

    <title>My laptop is having problems because of this&#58; stop code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabriel wilson  say:</h3>
<h2>            My laptop is having problems because of this&#58; stop code driver_irql_not_less_or_equal storport.sys</h2>
                    <p>I'll start from with how my laptop began to mess up and then go onto the actual problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first notices the issue when I was playing League of Legends and my fps would spike for no reason. After I stopped playing and just used my browser, chrome, my screen would randomly cut to black then come back on. The laptop did not shut off or anything
 the screen would just flicker and my desktop apps would disappear then reapear as if reloading.&nbsp; Soon after when I tried to use notepad files they started messing up. Anytime&nbsp; I would try to save or edit the name of a file the my computer application would
 freeze and I would have to close all my notepad files and my computer applications. Thereafter my laptop began to lag and finally it just shutdown. I tried to turn it back on and it would try to load but eventually go to black screen. Once it was able to open
 the windows blue screen where you are able to troubleshoot but even that glitched and failed. After about 12 hours of restarting my laptop, using the take out battery and use ac adapter for power method, my laptop no longer had a black screen but turned blue.
 Nothing happened so I left my laptop on for a couple hours and then it was able to show a blue screen saying " Your pc ran into a problem and needs to restart..."&nbsp; and it said the problem was:
</p>
<p>stop code driver_irql_not_less_or_equal </p>
<p>storport.sys</p>
<p>I waited for the laptop&nbsp; to restart and it finally started working but it was very slow and my desktop icon names would not show and when I tried to open my computer app only the application border would appear but I coud not read or open files. I looked
 some stuff up on the internet and decided to try to resest windows&nbsp; while keeping my files but my laptop always gives and error saying its unable to reset. I also downloaded DriverDoc and when I installed it, it triggers my windows defender which says it has
 a threat named "Misleading:Win32/Sofolview". Note that this message only appeared much after my laptop began to mess up and windows defender always recognizes it and removes/quarantines it. I cant remove DriverDoc from my program files because I can't open
 and see them. So I think the main issue is the&nbsp;</p>
<p>stop code driver_irql_not_less_or_equal storport.sys </p>
<p>and if I fix this I can remedy my mistaken donwload. Also my laptop is runnig very very slowly and when I open my notepad filws they are in a bold font that I know I did not write them in. I have searched the internet but I cant seem to find anything useful.</p>

<p>Hi Gabriel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is an indication that a driver is malfunctioning, incompatible or out of date. To verify whether this issue is really caused by it, we recommend that you boot your computer in
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a>. </p>

<p>Ok im in safe mode and on Device Manager what next ? Also&nbsp; my laptop is telling me my generic PnP Moniter has a driver error and its saying I can remove it but Ill wait for your response to do anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: When I try to update the generic pnp moniter it says its already up to date. Also when I try to browse for drivers and manually pick from available drivers the Generic pnp is the only compatible hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Just remembered that before when my laptop would mess up it would say that my lenovo photo master had an error if that means something</p>

<p>Thank you for providing us an update. Even when the driver is saying that you already have the best driver, you can still try to uninstall the driver and reinstalling it manually if the device is still not working properly. Once the driver got uninstalled,
 you may visit the device manufacturer's website to download the latest driver that they released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the status of the issue.</p>

                    <p>I use Windows 8.1 and am a fan of the sidebar.</p>
<p>Generally, I use the old-style desktop for launching applications, but recently I changed the settings on my PC. &nbsp;I closed the window, but it still appears on the sidebar and won't go away. &nbsp;Do this two or three times and the sidebar gets very crowded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I really want to do is get rid of the app views when I close them.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you referring to the charms bar (as displayed on right side in the screenshot) when you say sidebar?</li><li>What do you mean, when you say the apps are crowded on the sidebar?</li><li>Do you get any issues launching the apps again thereafter?</li></ol>
<p>I would appreciate if you could send us a <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">
<em>screenshot</em></a> of the screen with the issue and answer the asked questions so that we could assist you better.</p>

<h3> cjkuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype 8.42.0.60 Not Saving Settings.</h2>
                    <p>After using 7.41 with no problem for ages I'm being forced to use 8.42.0.60 and I'm not having a good experience with what seems to be some sort of kids toy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to change any settings they're not being saved after I switch my machine off/on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 7x there was an option to Save Settings but in 8x I can't see this anywhere so I assume this is the reason that 8x doesn't save any changes permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 7 if it makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I save any changes I make permanently or is version 8 just a piece of unfinished poor programming?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Incidentally have all versions of 7 been blocked or is it just the last (business version) I was using? I'd much prefer to use 7 after seeing what 8 is all about which is very poor compared to what preceded it.</span></p>
<p><span>I think it's time for a change but I need something </span><span><span>usable
</span>while I look at my options.<br />

            Hi cjkuk
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi cjkuk 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try uninstall then reinstall Skype to see if it helps. 
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 8 or earlier, open Control Panel &gt; Programs and features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://download.skype.com/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.41.0.54.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://download.skype.com/s4l/download/win/Sky...</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the problem is resolved.

            <p>Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not a method for forcing you to Windows 10.&nbsp; But to say what is&nbsp;instead needs the "MGA results" data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download &amp; run the&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">MGA tool</span></a>.&nbsp; When the results appear, click on the
<em>Continue</em> button &amp; it will change into a <em>Copy</em> button after a short pause.&nbsp; Click on
<em>Copy</em> [ignore any error message that appears].&nbsp; Paste the results straight into Notepad or another word processor &amp; save them just to make sure that you cannot lose the information.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Then come back to this forum &amp; click on <em>Edit </em>beneath your question</li><li>Change the question title&nbsp;- add&nbsp;<em>Not genuine message, MGA results posted </em>
to get your question noticed by the people with the skills to diagnose from the results</li><li>Then paste the results into your question</li><li>Change&nbsp;the question category&nbsp;to <em>Download, install &amp; activate</em> using the dropdown lists underneath&nbsp;your question's&nbsp;description [main text] entry box</li></ul>
<p>Add a brief history of the computer &amp; its&nbsp;operating system.&nbsp; To avoid too much toing &amp; froing,&nbsp;you need to include this information in your question:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The make&nbsp;&amp; model of the computer</li><li>When &amp; where you bought it: new &amp; directly from the computer manufacturer, new &amp; from a small-scale computer builder, second-hand, refurbished, ...</li><li>What OS was already pre-installed when you bought it</li><li>What subsequent OS installations [replacements &amp; upgrades] you have since done</li><li>Where you bought your OS installations [replacements &amp; upgrades] from</li><li>What licence type [OEM / System builder or Retail] you believe that the pre-installed OS &amp;&nbsp;subsequent OS installations [replacements &amp; upgrades] are</li><li>What, if any, actions have you taken to activate in the past to achieve or to restore activation</li><li>What Certificate[s] of authenticity ["CoA"] you have on the computer itself or else included with subsequent OS installations [replacements &amp; upgrades] - the CoA is the little label with the Windows 7 Product Key on it but do not reveal the Product Key
 itself online [the extract from it shown in the MGA results you post is okay]&nbsp; Note that many laptops have the CoA inside the battery compartment.</li><li>Which Windows 7 Editions {Starter, Home Premium, Ultimate, Professional} are identified on the CoA[s].</li><li>Which Windows 7 Edition is identified at <em>Control panel</em>, [<em>View by</em> -
<em>Small icons</em>, if necessary], <em>System</em></li><li>What activation status is reported in the lower half of <em>Control panel</em>, [<em>View by</em> -
<em>Small icons</em>, if necessary], <em>System</em></li><li>What recent changes have there been to the computer [replacement HDD, motherboard, ...]</li><li>What indication are you receiving that your Windows is not genuine?</li><li>What you have already done to try to fix the current problem</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Do please note that the individuals who will try to help you may well be in a different timezone.&nbsp; Posting all this information in your initial question can avoid significant timezone-related delays in progress [<em>someone asks what your computer model
 is during their own daytime, you do not see the question until your next daytime, they do not see your answer until their next daytime - 3 days might therefore have passed without any progress being made</em>].&nbsp;
</li><li>Posting all this information in your initial question also establishes a single reference point so that people trying to help you can get all of the information they need in one place.&nbsp; This also helps avoid delays.</li></ul>

    <title>Black screen after welcome screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> declutch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen after welcome screen</h2>
                    About 2 weeks ago my wife had the icons on the home screen turn into white shadows and then the next time the computer was started it booted up properly (I guess), but once it got passed the welcome screen to her profile(desktop) the screen went black.
 The mouse pointer is still on the screen and can be moved around but there is no background. If you ctl-alt-del the proper screen comes up with the proper graphics. I have tried to restore to an earlier date to no avail. She said that there was an adobe update
 that&nbsp;she may ar may not have run prior to the problem. I have also tried the last known good configuration with no help. If I boot up in the safe mode with networking I have a black background but the desktop icons&nbsp;are restored to normal. Don't want to operate
 in the safe mode forever. The Vista ulitimate is an upgrade and not the full version and will not repair the problem.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>We'll need to do a general troubleshooting to see if we can identify and resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;</span>Skip any steps that require booting into normal mode for
 now and then reply with results. Use the disk or safe mode where required (if unable to boot into safe mode either, skip those steps as well).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:

 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />

 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer or perhaps in safe mode with networking if that is working).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp;
 It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp;
 Here's how to use Event Viewer: </span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search
 box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each
 for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should<strong>do so for at least the video card and the monitor</strong> and any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from
 the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span></span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span></span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this you have to also be able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp;</span>Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Please
 reply before doing the next step as it is a radical option and I’d like to make sure we’ve ruled out all other options before taking that step.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you don’t have the disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the
 Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 100 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>Good luck!</span>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.</p>
<p>Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular Windows and Safe Mode) is to<br />
CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe . Safe Mode is reached<br />
by repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up.</p>
<p>First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</span></a></p>
<p>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>

<p>Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your<br />
system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get there.</p>

<p>You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else same version (to do the System Restore it<br />
only has to be bootable).</p>

<p>If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.</p>
<p>You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data) or a repair installation<br />
(hopefully saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.</p>
<p>You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own<br />
Product Key.</p>
<p>In-Place Upgrade<br />

<p>If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.</p>
<p>This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a Vista DVD<br />

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD)</p>
<p>c:</p>
<p>cd\</p>
<p>cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there is a space between cd and C: )</p>
<p>ren Logs LogsOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there are spaces between ren and Logs and Logsold)</p>
<p>REBOOT to Windows</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />

<p>Alrighty. &nbsp;It sounds like it may be a problem with the browser itself. &nbsp;So just to be totally sure I'm understanding, you are looking at a gmail email with a picture attached, like the one below? &nbsp;And clicking the little down arrow button on it does nothing,

<p>No, incorrect. &nbsp;Normally I can left click on the picture (not the down arrow or other symbol) and the picture will open up, then I right click on the picture that just opened and the "Save picture as" box opens and then I can direct the download to my specified
 file and even title it but now that function does not work. &nbsp;So, take your example and add one more picture where you can Right Click on it to Save it to my specified download file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I have found out that I can do the same thing by Right clicking on the original picture, instead of left clicking and then I can do it but I want it to work like it always has in the past. &nbsp;Can you help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for your help...</p>

<p>Alright, I tried what you said many times, but at this point I think this may be a change that Google made to their Gmail service directly, because I see the same thing on all computers and browsers, including Windows, Mac, and several different kinds of
 Linux, and a variety of browsers including Edge, IE, Firefox, Safari, and a few others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I left-click on the picture attachment, it opens the picture up larger. &nbsp;But then right-clicking on it does nothing at all. &nbsp;The only way I can get it to download is to use the down-arrow button at the top:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ae17af2-d927-408d-8c6f-1f442c5c7ac3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ae17af2-d927-408d-8c6f-1f442c5c7ac3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think your options are to use the new method, or make a more significant change like using the built-in Mail app (or another application of your choice) to access your Gmail messages.</p>
