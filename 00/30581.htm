<h2>            Windows 7 and Apple Time Machine</h2>
                    HELP! Just fully installed Windows 7 and Office Ultimate from Windows XP system. Attempted to "find" Apple Time Capsule information to restore all backed up data files that was stored from Windows XP after downloading Time Capsule and Bonjour upgrades.
 Now I can "see" the files on the My Computer but cannot "restore" the files from Time Capsule because the "browse" feature does not recognize Time Capsule.
<br />
<br />
How did anyone else do this? Microsoft telephone support is CLOSED!

            Hey,<br />
<br />
I dont think so Time Capsule is compatible with Windows 7. Try the Back up and Restore feature withing Windows 7 from Control Panel instead.<br />
<br />
Look at it: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/backup-and-restore<br />
<br />
All the best!!!!<br />

<p>As far as i know you cant restore Time machine files into Windows unless you use a 3rd party app which does the conversion for you...i use altaro oopsbackup as a time machine for windows, has the same features.</p>
<p>windows 7 also has basic backup options too..</p>
<p>acronis for image based backup...</p>

<h2>            Change appearance of custom tiles</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10, all my custom website tiles are now the same blue with the same explorer icon, making them next to impossible to access quickly.&nbsp; Could you please put something out there so that they can be customized, at least according to colour as with Windows
 8.1?&nbsp; Which I will change back to today, if the rest of the Windows 10 experience is as miserable as this morning has been.&nbsp; It's awful.</p>

            This does not answer the question. The question is about changing the appearance on the tiles, not the background. Please let us know if there is a way to change the appearance of the tiles, because when they're at the smallest size, all the tiles for
 internet shortcuts look the same, which is not helpful.

<p>Hi RFuhrman,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like to use Skype for Business, you are required a Skype for Business account. Given your scenario, I recommend you can purchase Office 365 for Business subscription, after
 which you will be given an Office 365 for Business account, and you can use it to login to Skype for Business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the detailed information about Office 365 for Business, please refer to

<h2>            Vendor Firewall blocking communication &#38; Connection between access point broken</h2>
                    <p>I have a Netgear wifi router. Using wifi with my laptops, over the past 3 months I've started getting dropped from the internet and have to run the Troubleshooting tool to fix the issue. The Windows 7 wizard tells me the,&nbsp; "Vendor firewall is blocking communication"
 and "The connection between your access point, router, or cable modem and the Internet is broken."&nbsp; This only occurs when using wifi; when wired, everything is fine. Also, my iPhone and Vizio wireless TV never have a problem connecting to the wifi (just my
 laptops). Is there a setting that has changed in Windows recently that I need to adjust to make this stop? Other fixes?&nbsp; The troubleshooting wizard fixes it on my laptop that runs Windows 7 but my other laptop that runs Windows 10 cannot connect at all via
 wifi, only wired. Annoying. Thanks for any help!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Indexing not running</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a problem with searching.<br />
Every time I want to search for a song or file, it doesn't find it.<br />
Example:<br />
If I want to search a song, this would come up.<br />
<br />
It says "Search indexing was turned off". Under it, it says "Turn indexing back on".<br />
So I've clicked on 'Turn indexing back on' and Indexing Options opened.<br />
There it says "Indexing is not running"<br />
<br />
So I searched it on the internet what to do.<br />
Some said to go to services.msc and find Windows Search.<br />
Then change the Startup Type to Automatic (Delayed Start) and start.<br />
So I opened Services.msc and found Windows Search. But the status was 'Stopping' constantly.<br />
So I've restarted my computer and checked it again. Now it didn't even started.<br />
<br />
After this, I went back to searching for more information.<br />
I found someone saying that you need to change in the Registry the value of SetupCompletedSuccessfully from 1 to 0 in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Search.<br />
So I went to the Registry to change that. But it was already to 0, so I changed nothing.<br />
Even when I change it to 1 it automatically changes to 0.<br />
After that I did a reset. Hoped that it would be fixed. But it didn't.<br />
<br />
I also used the troubleshooter, but that couldn't fix it either.<br />
So again I went back to searching and found that I could try sfc /scannow in Command Prompt.<br />
So I've did that and it found some corrupted files but it was unable to fix some of them.<br />
<br />
My question is, what can I do now?<br />
(Sorry for the long post and for bad English)

            Hello,<br />
<br />
So here is what I've done.<br />
<br />
First I did the command <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></span>.<br />
It found some corrupted files but couldn't fix it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then I've did those DISM.exe things<br />
The first one (<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong></span>) was successfully completed.<br />
<br />
The second one (<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Cleanupimage</span></strong>) displayed an error. Error 87.<br />
<br />
The last one (<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong>) was successfully completed.<br />
Then I've restarted my computer.<br />
<br />
But still, it doesn't work.

            Hi David, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend as a first step to try creating another saved connection setting. Sometimes saved connections can stop working because of corrupted or outdated settings, so simply recreating the saved setting can fix the issue.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go after trying this! Thanks!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Were you able to use the cell phone without any issues earlier?</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You may try downloading the drivers from the below link and install it.<br />
<a href="http://www.motorola.com/consumers/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bda09ec8009a0210VgnVCM1000008806b00aRCRD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.motorola.com/consumers/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bda09ec8009a0210VgnVCM1000008806b00aRCRD</a><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Please restart the computer after installing the driver.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>You may also try checking the same cell phone manual to use mass storage option. You can use this mass storage option to access data stored in the cell phone.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to Internet after factory reset&#63;</h2>
                    Couldn't connect to wi-fi at home one day, several days of troubleshooting with nothing working ultimately ending up in me doing a full factory reboot. still can't connect to home wi-fi, but can connect to mobile hotspot and public wi-fi. Three other devices
 in the house can connect to wi-fi no problem. been trying for days with every fix i can find on the internet; system restore, proxy settings, flush DNS, updating drivers, internet settings rest, factory reboot..... Don't understand how factory reboot didn't
 solve the problem! anyone any ideas???? Troubleshooting the connection either gives me "the DNS serves isn't responding" or sometimes "the remote device or resource won't accept the connection"

<h2>            Need a refund</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had got a subscription on my account for a month on 1/10/18. Without my will to extend that subscription an order was placed on my account for Feb 2018 as well on 2/6/18. I have already cancelled my subscription and would like to cancel and get a refund
 for the order which has been placed before it was supposed to. Also, I don't see any "refund" button in my purchase history on the order as the sites are saying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not gonna be able to get Live chat because that system is broken. It's always me waiting in line and I've waited for more than 1.5 hours a couple of times with only 13-14 waiting. No one's gonna be able to follow up a chat for more than an hour, its
 a waste of time. You should fix that system to get a contact number and call us back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<br />
Please read carefully. I was working on a FLASH DRIVE, not on the computer. Does anyone know how to find files on a flash drive? When I went to drag and drop the file into the folder I had created, the icons jumped around and I don't know where that file went.

            I was working on a&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> flash drive</span>&nbsp; so what works on a PC will not help find things on a flash drive. Would it help to put the entire contents of the flash drive on the PC? I was helping a man and had told him
 to keep his work on the PC and use the flash drive only for back up but he doesn't want to do that. I hope he has learned his lesson, but I would really like to find the document that went somewhere else in that flash drive.

            The search function of Windows works equally well for flash drives (or any other storage device connected to the computer).<br />
<br />
The flash drive is considered to be "removable storage" and is not a "Local Hard Drive."&nbsp; If you want to search on the flash drive, you have to set the "Look in" option in Windows search to the drive letter assigned to the flash drive.&nbsp; If you're not sure what
 that is, open My Computer and you'll see the flash drive there with its drive letter assignment.<br />
<br />
If you can't find the file on the flash drive, your description ("the icons jumped around") suggests that it might be on the hard drive somewhere.&nbsp; In this case, set the "Look in" option to "Local Hard Drives."&nbsp; If the computer has a large hard drive (or more
 than one), the search may take some time .... but if the file is there (didn't get deleted by mistake), it will be found.<br />

            This man works from his FLASH DRIVE. He doesn't like working on the PC because it has issues at times. I tried to tell him that a flash drive is ONLY FOR BACK UP and that he should not but using to work from!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I was trying to transfer what was on his flash drive to his PC.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a folder to put them in but when I tried to drag the files in the folder, they jumped around and and we could not find them anywhere on the flash drive or the PC.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;He has tried putting everything from his flash drive on the PC but still can't find anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;So is it possible to loose data on a flash drive by dragging it to a new locations? I will probably have him contact this site himself so you can work with him directly.

            It's difficult to determine what happened, but if you searched for "All files and folders" in both the computer and on the flash drive and set the search options to look in System folders and hidden files and folders and still could not find the file,
 it's possible that the file was deleted.<br />
<br />
The problem is that if the file was deleted from the flash drive (that is, before it was copied to the computer), there is no Recycle Bin for the flash drive, so the file would just deleted.<br />
<br />
Assuming that the flash drive hasn't been written to since, download Recuva (free) from --&gt;
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/recuva/download/standard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/recuva/download/standard</a> and let it scan the flash drive.<br />

<h2>            No Games on Windows 10</h2>
                    I recently installed Windows 10, previously had Windows 7. There are no games (Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, Hearts) on Windows 10. Can Microsoft provide the Windows 7 versions of those games for me?

            <p>I have had very limited success. I definitely don't want an Xbox version of any games, just simple one like were provided with Windows 7. I finally found a Simple Solitaire in the Microsoft Store and downloaded it...so far so good. I found Hearts Deluxe
 and downloaded it, or so I thought, and now I can't find it anywhere on my PC. Spider Solitaire doesn't seem to be available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I ask is that Microsoft send me by email the versions of those three games that were included in Windows 7. That must be easy for you to do. Then I can download them to my PC and all will be well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not happy with this whole situation. You gave me Windows 10 for free, and it's much faster starting up than Windows 7 ever was, but something as simple as these three games, which I played a lot and enjoyed very much, has been taken away. Can't you
 just respond to my simple request by sending me the old games?</p>

<h2>            xaudio2 issues Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have recently been running into some issues with some of my games for a while where some games using xaudio2 crash, have no sound or return an error when I start them. I have tried a number of things that have worked for other people but I have had no
 luck myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made a list of games I have the issue with with any error messages I found:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Survivng Mars - XAudio2Create failed: 80040154</p>

<p>Administrator mode - no effect</p>
<p>SFC and DSIM - no errors/effect</p>
<p>Safe mode - no effect</p>
<p>Running directx_Jun2010_redist - completes but doesn't seem to fix anything</p>
<p>Running dxwebsetup - says I have the latest version installed</p>
<p>Removing all xaudio2 files and transferring the files from known working PC - no effect</p>
<p>Reinstalling .net framework - no effect</p>
<p>Editing the DirectX regisrty back a version to try and trick a re-install - no reinstall occurs, still thinks its on the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only idea I have left is to re-install windows and I would prefer that to be my last resort so if anyone has any ideas of what I can try please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p><span>Hi Thomas,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To have clarity on this issue and guide you accordingly, kindly help us with the following information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you aware of any changes that happened on the computer prior to which you were not facing these issues?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate you for the troubleshooting approach you’ve done so far. Ideally, these issues are caused due to bad DirectX installation on the PC.
 I suggest you to disable any third party security software installed on your machine, and then run the
<strong>DXSETUP.exe </strong>from within Warframe and see if it works for you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Disable the security software.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Navigate to
<strong>D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Warframe\Drivers\DirectX9 </strong>and run the installer from there.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Running the installer from there should take care of the XAudio2 issue on your PC. Let us know how it goes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Keeping the security software disabled always isn’t recommended. They

<p><span>We look forward to hearing from you soon.</span></p>

<h2>            Skype billing US customers from Luxembourg now instead of Redmond Washington</h2>
                    Could anyone verify that Skype is no longer billing US customers from Redmond Washington but will be billing everyone internationally from Luxembourg? This is what the call center has just informed me about a charge on my credit card statement.&nbsp;

<p>Hello Vijay Verma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am writing you back to tell you that they have been no help to me. I have attached our conversation. This is the 3rd time that I have tried to go through them. I decided to document it this time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello!</p>
<p>Talk to a person</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Celica L has joined the chat</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Support. I am Celica L. How can I help you today?</p>
<p>Please be aware that if you switch apps or change focus to another window while working with us, you may get disconnected from your chat session. To ensure the best support experience, please stay active in this chat window.</p>
<p>Hello there. How can I make your day better? :)</p>
<p>Celica, I haven't been able to get anyone to help me with this matter.</p>
<p>My recurring charge is coming from Skype Luxembourg instead of Redmond Washington. This is causing me to pay an additional currency charge.</p>
<p>I understand the situation. No worries, I've got this for you. Lets check on that :)</p>
<p>May I please know your Skype Name and email address?</p>
<p>let me check</p>
<p>Sure :) Take your time.</p>
<p>I am logging into skype</p>
<p>where would I look for the name?</p>
<p>Kindly click your profile picture then go to Skype profile to see the Skype Name.</p>

<p>For security purposes, I’ll need to send you a verification code to your email.</p>
<p>Code has been sent. When you get the code, please send it back to me :)</p>
<p>435405</p>
<p>Thank you. Your account has been verified.</p>
<p>By the way, please take note of your ticket number 1479972142, which you can use for your future reference for the same issue.</p>
<p>ok</p>
<p>Upon checking your account here, you've been charge $2.99 for the renewal of your Unlimited US &amp; Canada 1 month subscription.</p>
<p>Yes, that is fine, but that isn't the issue</p>
<p>Can you please clarify the additional currency charge that you are referring to?</p>
<p>It is due to the charge coming from Luxembourg and not Redmond Washington</p>
<p>My bank charges me a fee for the charge coming from outside the country</p>
<p>I have been all over the internet and everyone seems to be getting charged from Washington</p>
<p>I used to be charged from Washington but a few months ago, that changed and now I am being charged from Luxembourg</p>
<p>All of my other charges are coming from Washington</p>
<p>I can't find anyone else on the boards that has this same problem</p>
<p>Thank you so much for clarifying that. Please be advised that Skype is actually originally based on Luxembourg that's why it is the country that is appearing on your end.</p>
<p>Celica, I KNOW THAT. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SO MANY TIMES. HOWEVER, WHY ARE THEY NOW BILLING ME FROM LUXEMBOURG. I CAN'T FIND ANYONE ELSE WHO IS BEING CHARGED FROM LUXEMBOURG. ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH ARE STILL BEING CHARGED FROM WASHINGTON.</p>
<p>IF YOU CAN'T FIX THIS, GET ME TO A MANAGER</p>
<p>I HAVE DEALT WITH THIS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS</p>
<p>WHY DID THEY CHANGE THAT "RECURRING CHARGE" OF MINE, AND MINE ALONE TO LUXEMBOURG?</p>
<p>I totally understand where you are coming from. Trust me, I will feel the same way if I am on your place.</p>
<p>Let me transfer you to my manager now to further assist you on this.</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>Agent Transfer</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>You are now connected to Diane R.</p>
<p>Microsoft Answer Tech</p>
<p>Hi there! I am Diane R., a supervisor of Skype.</p>
<p>Please give me two minutes to review your conversation with Celica.</p>
<p>I will be with you shortly.</p>
<p>ok</p>
<p>Thanks for patiently waiting.</p>
<p>To make sure that we are on the same page, you are being charged now more that before as your bank recognizes the charge from Luxembourg. Did I get this right?</p>
<p>I am still being billed the $2.99 amount. However, this charge and only this charge is coming from Luxembourg. This causes me to be billed an additional $2.00 from my bank. This is not the fault of the bank. Skype has changed this charge to now be billed
 from Luxembourg. The entire time that I have had Skype, it has been billed from Redmond, Washington. Just this last week, I have charges coming from Redmond, Washington, never Luxembourg until 3-4 months ago.</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>Skype is based in Luxembourg and the charge will also come from Luxembourg.</p>
<p>When did this start?</p>
<p>Please provide me the consent for that to happen.</p>
<p>You should be charged originally from Luxembourg.</p>
<p>All other charges are coming from Redmond Washington</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Let me give more clarification by providing a support document.</p>
<p>Please do because I have the proof that it used to come from Redmond Washington</p>
<p>As per Skype Terms of Use - "For use of free and paid consumer Skype-branded Services, you're contracting with, and all references to “Microsoft” in these Terms mean, Skype Communications S.à.r.l, 23 – 29 Rives de Clausen, L-2165 Luxembourg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, look, that doesn't state that the charges will be coming from there</p>
<p>try again</p>
<p>read it before you send it</p>
<p>also there is no date on it</p>
<p>let me speak to your supervisor, I don't care if it is in Luxembourg, I will call them</p>
<p>No date is provided.</p>
<p>OF COURSE NOT, AND THERE IS NOT ONE SHRED OF PROOF THAT THE BILLING LOCATION HAS CHANGED</p>
<p>I am looking for a specific TOU for you but it seems that the above is the closest.</p>
<p>THAT WON'T WORK AS IT DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY LOGICAL BACKING FOR WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT</p>
<p>Your concern is not connected to your billing location.</p>
<p>MY CONCERN IS THAT YOU ARE BILLING ME FROM LUXEMBOURG NOW, NOT REDMOND WASHINGTON</p>
<p>Logically, Skype is based in Luxembourg so the charges will also come from Luxembourg.</p>
<p>You should have been charged initially from Luxembourg</p>
<p>DIANE, YOU CAN TRY THAT BUT IF ALL THE OTHER CHARGES COME FROM REDMOND WASHINGTON, WHY IS THIS ONE COMING FROM LUXEMBOURG</p>
<p>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p>For this, I will put your case in investigation to find out more.</p>
<p>I WANT YOUR SUPERVISOR</p>
<p>I would have transferred you to my supervisor if she's available.</p>
<p>For you to communicate with her, we will need to convert this chat to email.</p>
<p>OK, JUST GIVE ME THE CORPORATE NUMBER IN LUXEMBOURG SO THAT I CAN CONTACT THEM TOMORROW</p>
<p>Next response will be the next business day.</p>
<p>THAT IS FINE</p>
<p>I HAVE IT ALL COPIED ANYWAY</p>
<p>Alright then.</p>
<p>Ca I have your email address please?</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>As promised, I will put your case in investigation to find out more; that is while I will refer your case to my manager.</p>
<p>You will receive an email on the next business day on the email address that you have provided above.</p>
<p>Thank you Diane R</p>

<p>It has been almost 4 months and they aren't working this out for me. I received an email from "Danida" who wanted me to upload the proof. I have done that but I haven't received anymore help from her. Does anyone know of someone that I can talk to in the
 upper management to get this problem taken care of? The worst customer service that I have ever seen. I didn't like that I had to provide bank statements which showed their charges to prove my point. Even after doing this, they still aren't working to solve
 my problem.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>32bit Windows 7 with HP printer error 0x0000007e - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miscu  say:</h3>
<h2>            32bit Windows 7 with HP printer error 0x0000007e</h2>
                    I have a new 32 bit WIndows 7 pc with service pack 1, latest updates and an HP Photosmart C7280 all in one printer<br />
<br />
The printer was installed via a network cable through the hub in my router.<br />
Everything appears to install ok, I can ping the printer, it shows Ready in Devices and Printers, I can browse it and use the built in scanner but it will not print.<br />
<br />
I can print via another networked pc (XP) but really dont want that pc permanently powered on and its slow to boot so would like to get this working in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Printing from Notepad I can see the document briefly appear in the print queue but nothing gets printed and there are no error messages.<br />
<br />
Trying to print directly to the printer and avoid the spooler gives the error 'The operation could not be completed 0x0000007e'<br />
<br />
I tried updating the driver through Windows Update and through the comapatability centre.<br />
I have updated the driver from the HP website making sure to choose the x86 version and even reinstalled it following their suggestions of turning off startup programs and the firewall&nbsp; but still it will not print.<br />
<br />
Results are the same if I connect directly with a USB cable in which case updated drivers are downloaded automatically.<br />
<br />
Now I'm really stuck - can anybody help please?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
Mick<br />

<h2>            Driver installation problem with ANY hardware&#33; Win7 32-bit</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>please excuse my bad english. But i'd give it a try nevertheless.</p>
<p>System is Windows 7 Home Professional</p>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>Everytime, a new hardware (any hardware, even a simple usb flash drive!!) is connected for the first time, the device is recognized by the system correctly. The System now searches automatically for the correct driver. Because i permitted online search via
 windows update in my system settings,windows tries to search online for the equivalent driver. at least it looks like windows would. After 30 seconds or so, i get a message like "driver couldn't be found" or something like this. As this appears on ANY hardware,
 i cannot believe that windows even connected to its online database. right after this, windows searches in "preconfigured driver folder" (not sure about its name in english, but in german it is named "vorkonfigurierte treiberordner") - no success. i think
 there might be a wrong link to these folders (perhaps deep in my registry?)</p>
<p>now, when windows failed to find the drivers online, i everytime try to do a manual installation. because in most cases i don't know where exactly the drivers are on my harddisk, i tell windows to search the whole c: drive. after this, it takes about two
 minutes and the drivers were found and installed properly.</p>
<p>now, this takes a lot time every time a new device is connected and im sad it is like this.</p>
<p>i hope my english was sufficient enough to tell what exactly my problem looks like.</p>
<p>summary:</p>
<p>-no connection to windows update whilst driver installation</p>
<p>-no drivers in "preconfigured driver folder" /(german: vorkonfigurierte treiberordner) OR wrong link to them in registry or something</p>
<p>-upon manual installation i have to let windows search the whole c: drive to find equivalent drivers, then it goes ok</p>
<p>-i have to go through all of those steps to install ANY device, even mices, usb flash drives, keyboards or anything you could imagine. even for drivers which are included in windows normally! even for extremely standard devices!</p>
<p>i hope you can help me out of this one</p>
<p>best regards,</p>
<p>vgn</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi</span> Vgn<span>,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Online search for drivers via Windows Update for all devices might not give you the desired results, as Windows Update will have the drivers for the
 devices that have passed the verification in Windows Hardware Quality labs (WHQL) or if the device manufacturer is partners with Microsoft.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the devices other than these are used you will have to either visit the manufacturer’s website to update the drivers or search your hard drive to
 find the drivers for the devices.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.

<p>Hi Amrita,</p>
<p>thank you for your reply. I do know the fact with the WHQL Certification and i am aware of it. Unfortunately my problem is an completely other one.</p>
<p>For example, lets take my BT Mouse. Its the "Wireless Notebook Presenter Mouse 8000" from Microsoft. Intellipoint 7.1 is already installed. Although, i had to go through a.shwn. steps to get it installed. I bet now its much easier to see that my trouble
 has nothing to do with WHQL Certification of WU drivers. Because like i already described, WU seems not to connect to its online database at all in my opinion. Because NO DEVICE, not even one of them, not even a standard flash drive, NO USB device at all,
 no LG device, no Sony Ericsson device, no Printer, no optical Drive, no device AT ALL was recognized by WU, and most of them DO HAVE WHQL certified drivers in my case. So i DO have the drivers. Thats not my concern, though..</p>
<p>What i cannot understand is the following: WU does definately not find a driver- no matter what device is connected for the first time. NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF DEVICE. Even my Microsoft Mouse. So, i combine that theres no connection to WU Driver Search database,
 right.? No Problem so far..</p>
<p>Second, Now Windows searches in preconfigured driver folders. And finds no driver at all. It ends up with the message:&nbsp; Device could not be installed or something like this.</p>
<p>Now, i have to search the driver manually and tell windows to search the whole c: drive as i dont know, where exactly the driver is. After one minute or two, voilà: driver found.</p>
<p>Something has to be wrong with my registry, or the link to the drivers folder in my registry or somewhere? I really cant believe that im the first person having problems like those.</p>
<p>So please, if you now read this and perhaps know where the problem could be, please give me a hint about this. Please write!</p>
<p>Its simply not possible for me to do a clean install of W7, i really have no time because i have to learn for my exams.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>vgn</p>

<h2>            Broken index in video avi files need permanent repair.</h2>
                    I recovered deleted video avi files using a recovery software program. The problem is that the index needs to be repaired. The VLC media player has a feauture to fix the index&nbsp;whereby I can play the videos on the pc. The problem however is that you cannot
 save these changes and everytime I want to play the file I have to run the fix index program again. Also, since the index is still broken I cannot play the files on my video camera. Is there a procedure or program that can actually repair the index of avi
 files and allow me to save the fixes?
