<p>
</p><p>Just found out today that marking emails as Junk or Not as Junk in Outlook 2016 for Mac does NOT sync to the server (O365). &nbsp;Had to tell CEO that he must log into OWA to mark emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is adding this basic functionality on the road map?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am switching the CEO from Mac to Windows so his Outlook works.</p>
<p>

<p><span>I have done some tests but cannot reproduce the issue. If I mark some emails as junk and mark some junk emails as not junk, the changes will then be synced to OWA.</span></p>

<br />
<br />2. You may like to uninstall and reinstall Skype again (you won't lose any data).
<br />
<br />3. Try following
<br />Type cmd in Windows Start Search box
<br />Right click on cmd.exe &gt; Run As Administrator
<br />Copy and paste following one by one and press Enter after each copy paste
<br />netsh winsock reset

    <title>BUG in Remove Duplicates on a table with merged cells - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BUG in Remove Duplicates on a table with merged cells</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a table with a single column that contains 3 values in merged cells.</p>
<p>After running Data-&gt;Remove Duplicates the third value "<strong>Key-C</strong>" disappeared from my table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I see<strong> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NO DUPLICATE values</span></strong> in this table.</p>
<p>Secondly, the merged cells with&nbsp; "<strong>Key-C</strong>" were <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>mistakenly removed</strong></span>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmail.google.com%2fmail%2fu%2f0%2f%3fui%3d2%26amp%3bik%3df5b68839f1%26amp%3bview%3dfimg%26amp%3bth%3d150a84840f3a655a%26amp%3battid%3d0.0.1%26amp%3bdisp%3demb%26amp%3brealattid%3dii_150a845cd05f6f94%26amp%3battbid%3dANGjdJ-5lRAAMjDmOu0vRMq5qn3qTC8yRd9DUPfV570s1T8ZCkBvM6MuGCSWOGnF9rpDVciZNvd_KwgfsOrVO2UI361QJvxtj3XXaIpx_lMOg_NUbzwhWUzjp6ssxsU%26amp%3bsz%3dw886-h560%26amp%3bats%3d1446116022999%26amp%3brm%3d150a84840f3a655a%26amp%3bzw%26amp%3batsh%3d1" height="280" width="443" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe it's a bug because Excel must treat each value in the merged cells as a single value and not to compare such data cell by cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue was found in Excel 2013 (15.0.4763.1003) with all latest updates installed.</p>

            <p>It is also there in 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp; And note that the A5:A6 merge has disappeared.</p>
<p>Excel has always treated merged cells in unexpected ways, making them not always intuitive to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what is happening, I think.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;When you enter A B and C into the merged cells, the contents actually go into A1, A3, A5</li><li>Note that A2, A4 and A6 are blank and, of course, they are duplicates</li><li>The RemoveDuplicates function looks at every cell, so it will remove A4, and A6</li><li>When it removes a cell, those below are moved up.
<ul>
<li>So the contents of A5 has now moved to A4</li><li>Since A4 is part of the A3:A4 merge, it is no longer visible.</li><li>You can, however, note that A4 contains "C" by entering a formula =A4 in some cell.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>I suppose one way to fix this would be to treat merged cells as a single cell when doing the remove duplicates feature, but I fear that may not be so straightforward.</p>

            <p><span>Hi TALMADGEFOREMAN,
</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you get message “<b>internet shortcut not vaild check property sheet</b>” in Windows 7 Internet Explorer 9.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</span></p>
<p><span>2.What is the complete error message you get?</span></p>
<p><span>3.Does this issue happen to any particular favorite bar?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1.</span></b></p>
<p>1. The error means to check the PROPERTIES section of your shortcut to make sure the target destination is still correct.<br />
Browse through the following location:<br />
C:\Users\*username*\Favorites-&gt; Right click on your favorites folder and choose "Properties".<br />
2. Under the <b>Location</b> tab-&gt;check on the Shortcut details-&gt;Check the "<b>Target</b>" line to make sure it refers to the correct destination of the original location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method2:</b></p>
<p>1.Open Internet Explorer-&gt;Click on Tools-&gt;Internet Options-&gt;Under the Security tab check the box for “<b>Enable Protected mode</b>”.<br />
2. Restart the Internet Explorer now and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3.</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would like you to create a new user account and check if the issue still persists. If not, then
 you can transfer the files from the corrupted user account to new user account using the "<b>Fix a corrupted user profile</b>" article.</span></p>

    <title>Nokia Lumia 610 - WIFI, No prompt of reverting to Mobile NetwGo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srands  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 610 - WIFI, No prompt of reverting to Mobile NetwGo to&#58; Nokia, United Kingdomor Nokia, Worldwideork Internet once out of wifi reception range</h2>
                    
<p>NOKIA LUMIA 610, Orange/EE Network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q1). Is there a SETTING to advise current WIFI is no longer CONNECTED because of low reception or out of range, with choice of either available WIFI or MOBILE NETWORK?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, is it possible to prevent the NOKIA LUMIA 610 automatically using MOBILE NETWORK INTERNET, once WIFI out of reception/range?</p>
<p>Other then just turning off DATA CONNECTION or turning on FLIGHT MODE?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have consulted the Nokia Lumia 610 User Guide, in the Manual on Pg40+:</p>
<p>WIFI with DATA CONNECTION on, and FLIGHT MODE off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However currently once out of WIFI range the NOKIA LUMIA 610 automatically choose MOBILE NETWORK INTERNET, without a POP UP to advise of connection CHOICE to MOBILE NETWORK INTERNET CONNECTION instead, at the MOBILE NETWORK rates, if not an inclusive/extra.</p>

<p>I agree DATA CONNECTION <strong>OFF</strong>, is the best solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if this is a bit inconvenient,&nbsp;in the circumstances of having current inclusive INTERNET, DATA CONNECTION ON, however this can lead to unintentional paying PER MB from your BALANCE.&nbsp; This happened the other day, I was running&nbsp;low on&nbsp;INTERNET DATA, hence
 using WIFI, then unintentionally went out of WIFI&nbsp;RANGE/RECEPTION, and my phone automatically switched to using MOBILE NETWORK INTERNET, which I didn't want!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>However</em> I was wondering if newer SOFTWARE VERSIONS then WINDOWS PHONE 7.5 (Firmware Revision number: 1066.0000.8779.12260) have a prompt when DATA CONNECTION
<strong>ON</strong> and using <strong>WIFI</strong>, and when out of WIFI RECEPTION/RANGE to have a PROMPT offering the CHOICE to select your MOBILE NETWORK INTERNET?&nbsp; Instead of just automatically doing it!</p>

<p>Having to turn off data connection just to avoid using mobile data automatically is very inconvenient if you move in and out of WiFi range frequently. There is no need for the inconvenience of a prompt. The best way is to have an option to designate networks
 as 'use automatically' or 'use manually' like what Nokia has done for their pre-Lumia phones.</p>

<h2>            New OneDrive for Business sync client on Windows Server 2012 R2&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>in our installation we have several client PCs which unfortunately run on Windows 8.1 and they cannot be upgraded to Windows 10 within the next months due to other legacy software installed there. Therefore we are not able to use the new&nbsp;OneDrive for Business
 sync client on these clients right now.</p>
<p>Using the old client (groove.exe) is not an option because it produces too much sync problems which our users do not tolerate.</p>
<p>Therefore, we think about an interim solution where we would install the&nbsp;new&nbsp;OneDrive for Business sync client&nbsp;on our Windows Server 2012 R2 and share the synced folder as a normal network share with the clients.</p>
<p>Would this be feasible, i.e. is it possible to install the&nbsp;new&nbsp;OneDrive for Business sync client&nbsp;on Windows Server 2012 R2?</p>
<p>Best regards, Hans-Georg</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update stalled on Nokia mobile which is now jammed in a continual loop of failure to install.</h2>
                    After using Windows 10 on my Nokia mobile for a few weeks without problem I allowed an update which has now jammed my phone completely.&nbsp; All I'm getting on a constant loop&nbsp;is an update screen followed by a sad face then the mobile remains on constant restart
 to repeat the same process over and over again.&nbsp; Tried leaving the mobile off for long periods and taking out the battery but once turned back on the whole process starts up again.&nbsp; Anyone had this experience or has my phone just had it!

            Hi Sean,
<br />
<br />Are the spams going into the Junk Email folder? If yes, you don't need to add them to the blocked list - the junk filter is already filtering them.  (Blocking addresses doesn't keep them out of your mailbox, only out of your inbox.)
<br />
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Why does Outlook allow my email address to be accessed by these people in the first place? I get a lot from Holland and Russia - I have never emailed anyone in these Countries.
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />The spammers pick it up from the web (google for your email address) or from hacked databases - if you use it to for online purchases or website registration and the site was hacked, your address (and possibly your password) is "out there".

<h2>            Microsoft Word will not let me close without problems when I don&#39;t want to save</h2>
                    <div>I have Microsoft Word 2007. Whenever I try to close out of the program without saving, a pop up box says do you want to save the document? I click no (because I don't want to). After that, another pop up comes on saying that it cannot save or create this
 file. I click ok. Then another one pops up saying it had trouble saving and it asks if I want to save the document as (some long title) and do I want it to be marked to be recovered. I say no. Then save as pops up along with another message saying I don't
 have permission to access this folder. I click cancel on the folder box and then cancel on the save as box. Then I click the 'x' on Microsoft Word and yet another box pops up saying changes have been made to the global template and do I want to save those
 changes. I click no.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm so confused as to why this happens every time I try to close Microsoft Word without saving. I hope someone can understand my question and answer it. Please and thanks!!</div>

<h2>            Email sent from outlook.com or apps not sending, stuck in drafts folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been facing a problem with my Outlook.com account since mid March. All email I try to send does not go through and instead ends up in the Drafts folder. Attempts to resend it from draft, or to send a new copy, yield the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this from outlook.com web interface, as well as the Outlook.com app for iPad. I am sure that all recipient addresses are valid and I have corresponded with them before to these same addresses from this same account. Additionally, I have not
 made any changes to my account. Emailing is syncing across web and devices and I can see any mail that did not send from one device in the drafts when I log in to web. This is clearly a server-side issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see others have posted the same in earlier threads (most recent was Dec 2016) but there are no solutions offered in those threads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly advise what is needed to fix this problem as it is quite debilitating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A message goes to the Draft folder once it's being idle for 3 minutes or more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fully determine why this happens, we would like to know if you set up your email as an IMAP.&nbsp; Also, do you get any error messages before it goes to the Draft folder or when you try to re-send it from the Draft folder?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm also having the same issue as LeShaque. In my case I am not getting any error messages when sending an email, just get sent to my draft folder. When trying to resend the email in the draft folder the only message received is "This message has not been
 sent". IMAP is setup. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just an FYI, I'm a Microsoft employee (Sr. TAM in MID). This happened back in Oct / Nov 2016 too. I worked internally to find a solution that finally got it going. I'm trying to find that e-mail to see what happened for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have five Outlook.com mail accounts and it happens on all of them. It was fine after Nov until sometime in March 2017 when it started happening again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been searching around again and it looks like a LOT of people are reporting this once more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Outlook app (latest and dog food) for iOS (iPhone 7+ and iPad) or even the native mail client (Mail) on iOS or Android. Same results. When you click Send, it goes to Drafts forever. Same thing on web interface (regardless of where you use it from).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that works is Outlook desktop app (I'm on latest 2016 on Windows and Mac). THAT will send immediately. Also if your stuff is stuck in Drafts, you can use the Outlook desktop app to go to Drafts and send your messages. A pain, but a workaround
 for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you want my ID and you can contact me if you need more information or test cases.</p>

            All of the accounts are POP/SMTP. I am not sure what Exchange is but reading the thread you mention it seems to relate to businesses. This does not apply to me. I do synchronise my calendar with my BlackBerry.
<div><br />
<div>There is no Change View option, but when I change current view to Annual Events it shows 4 of my 11 annually recurring events, including the one in question. This view does not show the other 7 annually recurring events. Of the 4, the one in question is
 the only one not showing in the normal calendar view.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another clue: I changed this item earlier this year to give a reminder of 2 weeks as it is very important and I may not have internet access at the time it occurs. I cannot remember whether I changed it on my BlackBerry or my desktop. My BlackBerry has
 been replaced recently and OTA synchronisation stopped. I now synchronise via my desktop software.</div>

<h2>            Chat history &#8212;&#160;All chat histories have suddenly disappeared from Skype for Android&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I run Skype on several computers, and on my Android phone. Usually, all systems have automatically synced my chat histories, once they have been logged in after activity on another/previous device. Several days have passed since I used Skype on my phone
 without opening Skype on my computers; and today I logged into Skype on my phone to find that none of my chat histories are now available on my phone. ALL chat histories have disappeared. As it does appear that Skype is using enough memory for data and cache
 that my histories do still exist on my phone, My request relates to how to get Skype to recognize these former histories (if they do indeed still exist on my phone)... That they may eventually sync onto my computers, etc.. Obviously, because none of my other
 devices have logged into Skype since this phone activity, they likewise lack this recent Skype chat history of activity conducted from my phone. As I use information and links in these histories to continue research and to preserve records of correspondence,
 it is very important that I restore the lost histories, which evidently have disappeared as a consequence of software error.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">My "Storage" page of my Skype app info on Android reads:<br />
<br />
App&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 77.47 MB<br />
Data &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 71.12 MB<br />
Cache &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 52.09 MB<br />
Total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 201 MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus it would seem that enough "data" and/or cache is used (somewhere) as would indicate that the history likely still exists on my phone. Several reboots however have failed to get Skype to retrieve prior histories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Android version 8.0.0.</p>
<p>Skype version 8.34.0.72 was installed from the Google Play Store, and was last updated November 9, 2018.</p>
<p>An AVG scan for exploits shows my system is clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I restore the disappeared histories?</p>

<p><strong>NO GOOD FROM SKYPE FOR WEB, EITHER.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Thanks for the try, Joseph... but not only are my recent phone messages (since November 17) also gone from Skype for Web... EVERY Skype history for all my contacts is empty there as well... even though I'm simultaneously logged in from desktop Skype
 from one of my computers (assumably giving Skype for Web an opportunity to sync).</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The messages I have lost from my phone disappeared on November 17.</strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Prior</strong></span> histories ARE STILL maintained on my computers, but since ALL message histories have disappeared from my
 phone, and I haven't logged in from any of my computers since November 17, I am therefore missing message histories on my computers since November 17... thru November 27. I assume just the same, that to restore the post-November-17 histories on my computer
 (from my phone), I will need to resurrect the entire set of histories (on my phone) which I assume are still stored on my phone (given the reported memory/media usage).<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>As far as the other mundane concerns you raise... yes, all systems and/or logins are using the same Skype account. I do have a further account that I once used for radio broadcast support, but I haven't used it in years from my computers, and never
 once from my phone.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>REASONING:</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; At this point, I am assuming that my message histories still exist on my phone, because of the reported memory used.
<strong>I therefore assume that Skype is somehow not accessing the history storage areas; and that to "fix" the consequence of a software error, we somehow need to get Skype to re-engage the media to which it has been storing history information.</strong><br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; <strong>There is one event which <em>could</em> relate somehow to this behavior:
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Several months ago I added 128 Gb of memory in the form of a high-end MicroSD card — which was inserted in an empty memory slot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some applications recognized the additional memory, and asked if I would like to use the new media. I confirmed for these apps. Evidently, other applications automatically used the new memory.
<strong>But I see no obvious way to enable Skype to use the new card, so Skype <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
has</span> been operating successfully for several months with no re-configuration whatsoever.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A question remains therefore, whether Skype may somehow have erroneously reverted to a default usage configuration in conflict with its recognition of the new media:</strong> In other words, because file system navigation tools deny access to intentionally
 hidden directories... it is not evident (to me, without root access) whether Skype may have used the new MicroSD card (perhaps moving its data to the new card at one time).. and then later (for some later, erroneous software assumption), reverted to assuming
 its data was located in the original media (from which Skype had moved the original data, after recognizing the new MicroSD card). A question might exist then, whether Skype has somehow forgotten its recent decision to move data to the new media (if such a
 decision was ever made), and is now (for no good reason) looking to the original media (from which it moved its data) for histories —
<strong>which as a consequence only APPEAR to be missing.</strong><br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; MY PHONE IS NOTORIOUS FOR RE-CONFIGURING ITSELF, BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE SYSTEM SETTING I FIND WHICH MAY *POSSIBLY* (BUT PROBABLY NOT) AFFECT THE CITED BEHAVIOR:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the "Network" tab of system "Settings," there is a "Data usage" page; and on this "Data usage" page, there is a "Limit mobile data usage" option, which for reasons which are not entirely obvious, lists Skype data usage (which I actually believe reflects
 only network throughput — but may somehow affect data storage[?]). This "Limit mobile data usage" option is switched off — which I assume means that mobile data usage is not limited.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that it is a long shot to presume hypothetically that this option
<strong>MAY</strong> somehow affect WHERE Skype may store and/or look for its data... but because Skype IS listed on this page with a data consumption bar (showing &lt; 0.01 Gb), I am wondering if possibly, toggling this option on or off might affect what data
 Skype has stored locally — or how Skype accesses its history data (by <em>assumed</em> folder locations).<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, these are the only usage issues which I conceive might relate to the disappeared histories. In other words, as I believe (from the Skype data usage figures cited in my first post) that the histories still exist on my phone (as they are likewise
 locally stored on my computers)... I still am assuming that to fix this problem, the next logical experiment or step is to try to get Skype to re-recognize wherever it has been storing the history data.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; <strong>FURTHER BEHAVIOR NOW OBSERVED WITH THIS ISSUE</strong><br />
<br />
I have now observed that Skype is dropping history information (from my phone ONLY) A<strong>S A TEXT DISCUSSION TRANSPIRES:</strong> In other words, in dialogs over the past few days, I might be texted links with comments.
<strong>An hour later, the few histories which I am recently engaged in (over the past few hours) may disappear altogether.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recurring loss of history data therefore is forcing me to keep a computer logged into Skype to preserve lost dialogs. But of course, I am still missing the entire set of histories from November 17 thru November 27.<br />
</p>
<p>Since <em>weeks</em> of non-aberrant (proper) behavior transpired since installing the memory card, it is my assumption that aberrant software behavior is the root cause of the lost histories (which usage data indicates may still exist on my device); and
 therefore, it remains my most hopeful belief that it is only necessary to get Skype to find and use this data, to restore the history information. I'm not sure (or entirely hopeful) that Skype will then sync the re-discovered data to my computers... but that
 is of course my hope.</p>
<p><br />
Any ideas?</p>

<p>The latest mobile clients retrieve and post data to the cloud. If data is disappearing (not being deleted) then that cached data is more than likely corrupt locally. Since the mobile App does not allow you to install it to an external memory device (the
 last time I checked), Skype storage should not change with it present. If moving the App was an option provided by the developers, the OS would allow you to move it to either. There should be no half-state. Even if there was, the move would probably rectify
 it. Problematic/under performing memory could be the cause of overall phone stability issues, so I would not rule that out as a possible cause of your problems. I would not count on newer versions of Skype being able to repair possible local corruption. Removing
 or resetting the App would be the best option to try to resolve this type of issue, but would purge any cached data. Unless you want to root your phone or find a way to backup any local data in hopes of deciphering what is there, I would consider it a lost
 cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to retrieve past text/image data from the cloud up to possibly 2 years. Attachments generally only survive 30 days before they are purged. To attempt to view any older data stored in the cloud you need to be using an 8.x client on a desktop
 or mobile device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Web</a>&nbsp;can only retrieve up to the past 30 days of cloud history. If you need to retrieve history beyond 30 days, I suggest you try out
<a href="https://preview.web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Web Preview</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to retrieve the chat history you need, see if your recipients can find that history on their end, in their newer or older clients.</p>

<p>Thanks, Techfreak:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You wrote: <strong>The latest mobile clients retrieve and post data to the cloud.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is so (I'm believing you)... it seems to imply that my data would be disappearing from the cloud, for if locally cached data is indeed corrupt (which is an unproven assumption), I would certainly think the app would repair the corrupted cache by
 either restoring data from the cloud or rewriting an null cache. <strong>Whatever the case, we are left with the very important question, what can we do about good data, possibly orphaned on the cloud, and/or ALSO possibly continuing to disappear either locally
 or from the cloud, or both, on a potentially prolific basis?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Using FTP, I have searched my phone's memory for the lost data. As far as I can tell (and as appears to corroborate your statement that data is posted to the cloud), I have found a directory to which (other) Skype data is stored. The path to this directory
 is [phone_name]/mnt/sdcard/Android/data/com.skype.raider. This directory contains 6 ".blog", ".log", ".lck", and ".jwt" files.
<strong>For whatever it may be worth, I opened separate copies of each, and found that none contain any history information.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So far as I can tell then, indeed, it does appear that Skype for Android must NOT store history information locally.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp; But I am certainly not comforted to think my data is disappearing from the cloud in much less than thirty days — and often (recently) in less than an hour.</strong> As to why/how those histories were not restored instead, retroactive for 30 days,
 I am still quite disappointed, because it's still looking to me (then) like I'm going to lose phone history information globally, on a very short-term basis — MUCH more immediately than the stated 30-day lifespan. I would think that might alarm the people
 at Skype as well, but I'm not hopeful they will recognize the gravity of the problem, even if it substantially decommissions my phone for the greatest part of intended Skype use. (I realize the problem hardly reflects on more trivial usage.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; In regard to the sum of assertions raised in your post then, I have elected to uninstall and re-install Skype; and can report that computer Skype histories
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I have yet to ascertain yet whether I still may be losing data from the cloud on as little as an hourly basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OWING TO THE LACK OF MEANS OF REPARATION OR EVEN REASONABLE MEANS FOR TROUBLE-SHOOTING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THEN, I CONSIDER THIS ISSUE UNRESOLVED; and I do&nbsp; have one further question (at least):</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there some way then to trouble-shoot and possibly even rectify data disappearance from the cloud?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am certainly not comforted to find my Skype history can disappear from the cloud, not only in far less than the cited 30-day lifespan, but in as little as an hour. I hope this is a bug, and not an intended behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I do appreciate the help.</p>

<p>What mobile device are you using? Is this content that only originated on the mobile device or is it any past communication from any device? If it is was simply all history as your title stated, then most of the following save the last 2 paragraphs, is less
 likely to be the cause.</p>
<p>Have you checked with the other parties involved to see if they have the missing part of your communication or ever had (in case you sent it but it was never received)? In the past I believe I have heard of links in conversations being removed due to being
 malicious by smart screen. I currently do no know if that occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure that neither of you are deleting/removing conversations or messages? Doing so removes those messages from the cloud, which in turn removes them from all active clients (or the next time they sign-in, when cached). The latest versions of Skype
 do not display removal of messages. Hopefully someone else does not have access to the accounts doing so. If that is a possibility, I recommend changing the password of the accounts used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Skype 8.x scrolling up through history issues a download of that history from the cloud. Even on a brand new install of the Skype client (which could rectify your odd condition), you should be able to download prior history from the cloud. If you cannot,
 possibly you have not given the application enough time to download the history, or have not scrolled up far enough. Without scrolling up, it will default to recent history, which is generally no greater then 30 days. Even if not displayed in recent chats,
 you should be able to go to a particular contact and view its history by scrolling up through it.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you have not logged into another account. Sometimes people are signed into different accounts on their various devices. This might occur by accident after upgrading. If you have two similar, yet different accounts, you will have two different histories.
 Signing in with your Skype name verses your email address and vice-versa, can represent two different accounts. So for example, if in the past few weeks you created a new account, you would only have the history of the new account, when signed into that new
 account. If you signed into the same older account that is on your other machines, you would be able to retrieve your older data.</p>

<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Noted. But let's update the behavior of my phone, now:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Over the last two days +, chat history has persisted locally on my phone, and likewise synced to my computers. STILL HOWEVER, THE MISSING SEVERAL DAYS HAVE NEVER RE-APPEARED ON MY PHONE OR SYNCED TO MY COMPUTERS.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Have you checked with the other parties involved to see if they have the missing part of your communication or ever had (in case you sent it but it was never received)?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Indeed I have checked with respective parties, and I have had them re-post the orphaned history — which obviously has been sustained on the devices of multiple other Skype users. So, the history appears to exist, but for some is
 never successfully re-accessed by my phone or computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>In the past I believe I have heard of links in conversations being removed due to being malicious by smart screen. I currently do no know if that occurs.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">We all can understand why links to malicious material might either be removed or disabled, but if the re-posted links posed such recognized threats, I would presume the re-posted links would disappear likewise. This is not the case;
 neither is the material prone to exploit.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you sure that neither of you are deleting/removing conversations or messages?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">The subject links were posted by corresponding users. If THEY had deleted them, they would not have been able to re-post them to me. THUS, DELETION CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CITED DISAPPEARANCE OF MATERIAL (FROM MY CLOUD ARCHIVES
 ONLY).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>In Skype 8.x scrolling up through history issues a download of that history from the cloud.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I just double-checked the reported threads, and each scroll only to the latest date on which material has successfully been preserved and synced to my other devices. Thus, on my phone (which is the device used to post the lost material),
 ALL chat histories (including those not posted to over the period in which material disappeared) have disappeared; AND STILL, THE ONLY MATERIAL ACCESSIBLE ON MY PHONE IS MATERIAL SUCCESSFULLY PRESERVED, *AFTER* THE WEEK OR SO FROM WHICH MATERIAL DISAPPEARED
 FROM MY PHONE (WITHOUT OPPORTUNITY TO SYNC TO MY COMPUTERS).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Even on a brand new install of the Skype client (which could rectify your odd condition), you should be able to download prior history from the cloud.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">As further reported, I have re-installed Skype... and no... the disappeared material (which still exists on other Skype users' Cloud) is still not retrieved by either my computers or phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you cannot, possibly you have not given the application enough time to download the history, or have not scrolled up far enough. Without scrolling up, it will default to recent history, which is generally no greater then 30 days. Even if not displayed
 in recent chats, you should be able to go to a particular contact and view its history by scrolling up through it.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I well understand that this is the intended behavior... but NO CAN DO. My phone refuses to scroll to any material which may exist prior to the lost history; and, though my computers will scroll to prior history, THE LOST (AND NEVER
 SYNCED) MATERIAL FROM MY PHONE DOES NOT EXIST IN THEIR ARCHIVES — THOUGH IT EXISTS IN THE CLOUD FROM WHICH CORRESPONDING SKYPE USERS HAVE RE-POSTED MATERIAL.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Make sure you have not logged into another account.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I have already indicated that I have verified that I am logged into the proper accounts on all systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It seems quite odd to me that chat histories are successfully retrieved from the cloud on my computer systems (save for the material which was never synced and ultimately lost from my phone), and from the devices of correspondents who share the same conversation
 history — and most particularly, the period which not only disappeared from my phone, but which likewise is not retrieved by my computer — which I would presume shares the same chat history in which my correspondents CAN retrieve the lost period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is ALWAYS an explanation for presumably anomalous behavior. If it were possible for unsynced history to disappear from one device while it yet persisted on the devices of correspondents (only) — never to re-appear in the history of just one respondent
 (myself), obviously, you would discover that possibility in the respective handlers (software code). Inasmuch as no option exists for the end user to intentionally or even inadvertently invoke such "seemingly" untoward behavior, my thought is that it is not
 even reasonable to anticipate or question whether an end user's activities might be responsible for the reported adverse behavior.</p>

    <title>How to decrease selected values by a certain percent in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alnilamori  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to decrease selected values by a certain percent in Excel</h2>
                    <p>I often need to change a certain amount for a set percentage (let's say 20%). I do not need to change the whole column just certain cells. How do I do that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Values</p>
<p>200 </p>
<p>234 &lt;--- I wish to decrease this for 20%</p>
<p>567&lt;---- This for 20%</p>
<p>789&lt;---- This for 20%</p>
<p>335</p>
<p>778</p>
<p>367&lt;--- This for 20%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New values should replace old values. I found a formula on how to change the percentage value of the whole column but that is not helpful to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is there a way to apply the decrease of 20% on selected cells (and selected multiple cells) without changing it in the whole column?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the responeses :)</p>

            Hi Karthikeyan,<br />
<br />
Regarding "When trying to configure mobile devices with Office 365 e-mail account, it keeps prompting for password", I'd like to know which mail app you are using on your mobile devices. Outlook for Android/iOS, OWA for Android/iOS or the built-in mail app?<br />
<br />
If you are using the Outlook for Android/iOS mail app and encountering this issue, would you please try setting up your Office 365 account into the built-in mail app to see if you still encounter this issue? We suggest you setting up your Office 365 account
 into the mobile device by Exchange ActiveSync protocol because Exchange ActiveSync is a client protocol that lets you synchronize a mobile device with your Exchange mailbox. For more information, please refer to the following article:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa998357%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa998357%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a><br />
