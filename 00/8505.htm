    <title>How to loop through a list of flat text files and include them in word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to loop through a list of flat text files and include them in word document</h2>
                    <p>When trying to loop through a list of files and include them in a word document with VBA code I am having issues accomplishing this seemingly simple task. &nbsp;I am completely new to VBA but have experience in several other programing languages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my code so far:</p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>Sub GrabDataFromTextFiles()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim FILEPREFIX(1) As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; FILEPREFIX(0) = "File01"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; FILEPREFIX(1) = "File02"<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Each prefix In FILEPREFIX<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.Style = ActiveDocument.Styles("Heading 2")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.TypeText Text:=prefix<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.TypeParagraph<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ' Print File postfix one<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.Style = ActiveDocument.Styles("No Spacing")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.Paragraphs.Indent<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.Fields.Add Range:=Selection.Range, Type:=wdFieldEmpty, _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PreserveFormatting:=False</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.TypeText Text:= _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "INCLUDETEXT /users/user/documents/datafiles"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.TypeText Text:="s/" &amp; prefix &amp; "_dataone"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.TypeParagraph<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>The problem is when run the first INCLUDETEXT is not getting close the the entire second pass through the loop gets included before the first closing }.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what the output looks like, note that both INCLUDETEXT's are closed at the end:</p>

</p><p>Skype's <strong>caller ID</strong> will let your friends, family and business contacts know that you are calling them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have this activated, what your contact will see when you make a call to them is
<strong>Unknown</strong>. If you do have this activated, then the caller ID that will show on your recipient's end is either your mobile number or a Skype Number depending on what you set up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks, Danida.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot complete your instructions, because I am unable to receive calls at my Skype number, for reasons I do not understand.&nbsp; When I fill in the number that is to be displayed, the program checks it, finds that isn't working, and denies
 the change.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have submitted another query to find out how to activate my now-useless Skype number.&nbsp;

<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>Which make/model of laptop?</p>
<p>Which version of Windows? (Including SP level- e.g.&nbsp; Windows 7, Vista SP1, XP SP2 , 32-bit, 64-bit, etc. Right-click Computer/My Computer&gt; Properties to obtain this information)</p>
<p>Which version of Internet Explorer? (From IE&gt; Help&gt; About)</p>
<p>Are you using the touchpad?</p>
<p>Making the touchpad less sensitive may resolve this. There should be a way to adjust the touchpad sensitivity- it will vary with the manufacturer.&nbsp; Look in the System Tray for Synaptics TouchPad or Pointing Device or something similar. These settings should
 also be accessible from Control Panel&gt; Mouse. The Help/Support area of the computer manufacturer's website should be helpful.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br />
Don</p>

            The typical method of providing a cell with a date/time stamp is through an event
<i>Worksheet_Change</i> macro procedure which puts the current date/time value into an accompanying cell when input is detected.
<div><br />
<div>To put a timestamp into column C then a value is added, edited or deleted in column A, right-click the worksheet's name tab and choose
<i>View Code</i>. When the VBE opens, paste the following into the pane titled something like
<i>Book1 - Sheet1 (Code)</i>,</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; If Not Intersect(Target, Columns("A")) Is Nothing Then</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = False</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dim a As Range</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Each a In Intersect(Target, Columns(1))</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a.Offset(0, 2) = Now</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Next a</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; End If</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = True</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tap <i>Alt+Q</i>&nbsp;to return to your worksheet once you have that pasted in. Anything typed into column A will result in a static date/time value being input into the corresponding cell in column C of the same row.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Post back if you have trouble modifying that for your own purposes.</div>

    <title>No spell check when using Hotmail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lakewoodman  say:</h3>
<h2>            No spell check when using Hotmail</h2>
                    I have windows 10. I use Hotmail for my emails. I no longer have a spell check option since I bought new computer with windows 10. All options I hear and read about say to go to ..... I have NONE of the options available that people name. Can anyone help
 an ignorant senior citizen with this problem? Thanks in advance.

When you log into the account using a web browser does it say outlook.com,&nbsp; or Outlook Mail across the top?

            I use internet explorer. I have used internet explorer and I have used Hotmail for probably 20 years with NO problem like this. This problem started with my new computer that has windows 10. I tried to look at firefox and was not able to understand how
 it works at all so I deleted it. I tried google chrome and again was unable to understand hot to use it so I deleted it. Since I used Hotmail while using internet explorer for so many years and the problem only started with new computer that has windows 10
 I have to assume it has to do with windows 10. Now, I HATE windows 10 anyways so if this problem can not be easily fixed is there a way to get rid of windows 10 and go back to windows 7 or 8 which I liked and my Hotmail worked well with.

            This is getting to be UPSETTING !! I do not have ANY options of any kind when writing an email. This includes ANY kind of "TOOLS" option to click. Every time I ask someone on this site to help they always say "click tools": .......... This is NOT an option.
 The word tools does not exist. NEXT..................... Now for the ignorant person who said that "Hotmail" went away 4 years ago. I have been using Hotmail for MANY years. I write and receive my mail at HOTMAIL.Com to this day. So NO, Hotmail has not gone
 away................. I use it every day and I receive mail to my Hotmail named account at least 100 times a day... EVERYDAY.

                    <p>Hi Folks - I have a list of students that can have multiple codes assigned:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sample Data:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ID,Code</p>
<p>12345, ABCD</p>
<p>12345, DDDD</p>
<p>12345, FFFF&nbsp;</p>
<p>12349, ABCD</p>
<p>12349, DDDD</p>
<p>12349, TTTT</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to develop a query that displays students that have CODE X AND CODE Y, So, using the sample data,&nbsp;what would my criteria look like if I wanted to display all students that have CODE = ABCD AND CODE = DDDD?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: If they have only ABCD, they should not be in the list. If they have only DDDD, they should not be in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            HERE Mapping Software is a BIG disappointment</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought a Lumia 521 primarily to get the newest Nokia mapping software and it is a big disappointment and is far inferior to Symbian Ovi Maps. The two big problems are memory management and Places or Favorites. The downloaded maps can only go straight
 into the phone's main memory with no option to use a micro SDHC card, so there is an unnecessary limit on storage. And the Favorites or Places have no hierarchical structure with named groups so it is an incoherent and disorganised mess. A further bug in either
 HERE or in Windows Phone 8 now brings up a prompt to say additional map can not be downloaded without WiFi but the phone is connected to a strong WiFi signal. Is HERE version 3.2.214.8 some kind of beta test and am I an unpaid tester?</p>

<p><span>Hello FrankContreras1,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The phrase that you quoted "then you no longer need to add a contact", is only applicable for Skype for Windows 10 version 12.10, wherein your contact
 gets added once they reply to your message. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What
<strong>specific Skype version</strong> do you have installed on your device?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            My own &#42;sent&#42; emails end up in my junk folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem may have been dealt with before but I have tired advice in other threads to no avail, and lots of them are old threads and before recent changes to Outlook in any case, so I hope it's okay to post this here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a couple of months now my Junk box has regularly acquired 60 or so emails in one go which when I check the folder turn out to be emails
<em>I have sent&nbsp;</em>that for some reason have been marked as junk. If I try to mark these emails as "Not junk" then they're redirected to my inbox, which is still a problem as I need emails I have sent to be stored in my Sent folder for easy access. I can
 select all and move them to my Sent folder every time this happens, but obviously this is still not a solution. I need to stop these emails ending up in the Junk folder in the first place. If I try to add my own address to my safe senders list I'm told I can't
 add myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be grateful for any help anybody is able to offer.</p>

            Dear Charlie
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />If you are receiving emails that are not spam, and you already marked them as not junk <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a> you can add those account to safe sender list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />
<br />Also please check your rules, maybe you have set up additional rules that move emails to Junk folder.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

            Hi Charlie,
<br />it could be that there are Inbox rules that are configured that would send your messages to a folder or It could be that the rules configured are conflicting with other rules. 
<br />Click on link below will take you to your rules. Sign in if you are not already signed in. 
<br /><a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/rules</a> 
<br />Turn all rules off and check to see if emails are now going into the inbox and send yourself and email to confirm that you get it in the sent items folder. If they are then go back to your rules and turn them on one by one to see if a rule is causing the emails to go into the JunkMail folder. 
<br />Let me know if this resolves the problem or we have to troubleshoot further. 
<br />Regards, 
<br />Sam

            Thanks for your suggestion. My email address is already in my safe sender list. Although I had two rules set up, neither of them had anything to do with my own address. I have deleted them now just in case they were the problem.

            Thanks for your suggestion. I've deleted the rules that I did have set up, just in case they are the cause of the problem. Although neither of them were anything to do with my email address so I'm not sure how they would be affecting my emails. Unfortunately
 I'm not really able to test if this has solved the problem, as the emails go to my sent folder initially; it's only later that a large bunch of them suddenly teleport over into the Junk folder, which is very confusing!

            Hi Charlie,

It shouldn't be sending emails to Junk Mail folder that's very strange behavior. 
If wanting to save emails Right click on them and send them to the Archive folder on you list or create a new folder to send them to. I send important emails to my archive folder. This way they will not end up in your junkmail. 
Try clearing the Cache and Cookies on your browser. 

If using Internet Explorer -  Hold the  CTRL+SHIFT keys down and press DELETE on the window that opens leave defaults checked and Press  Delete&nbsp;

Google Chrome -  Hold the  CTRL+SHIFT keys down and press DELETE on the window that opens leave defaults checked and Press Clear Browsing Data&nbsp;

For Firefox- Hold the  CTRL+SHIFT keys down and press DELETE on the window that opens leave defaults checked and Press Clear Now&nbsp;

Now restart your computer. Once your back up open your browser and Log into&nbsp;https://outlook.live.com/&nbsp;;

Hopefully that stops the emails from sent being morphed to Junk Mail folder.

            Hello CharlieMethven,
<br />
<br />I am sorry to hear that you are having an issue with Outlook as your sent emails are appearing in your Junk Mail folder instead. I know how annoying this can be, rest assured, I am here to help you with this issue.
<br />
<br />I have noted that none of the solutions provided by the Independent Advisors above work:
<br />
<br />- inbox rules
<br />- mark as "Not Junk"
<br />- clear browser caches/deleted Microsoft/Outlook cookies
<br />
<br />In order for me to help you properly, I need you to revert me back the following information:
<br />
<br />1. Do you recall taking any actions that could possibly have resulted in this?
<br />2. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far?
<br />3. Do you have your email account setup on any devices/email clients?
<br />
<br />It is likely caused by your email client, a configuration error with IMAP folder mapping. Remove your email account from the email client and this issue should be resolved.
<br />
<br />Hope it works!
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />Sutharsan<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed131ebe-5bce-4694-947e-67866f2a2aac?upload=true" />

<p>Unfortunately I can't actively test if the solution has worked, because my sent emails initially go to the Sent folder as they're supposed to. It's only later that I suddenly discover the messages have moved to the Junk folder: I'm not sure what the trigger
 for this move is. I have sent emails since I made the changes, so the best I can do is wait and see if the problem persists.</p>

<h2>            E65 changed times without warning&#33;</h2>
                    I woke up this morning, and my E65 with Three in 1 hour behind!<br />
<br />
The strangest part is that I don't get my time from their server!<br />
<br />
That means Nokia (or Three) have built that lovely feature in and gotten the dates wrong.<br />
<br />
Now, that's not normally a problem except for when it makes you an hour late for your new job. I'm not happy.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else out there with an E65 have the same problem?

            goto tools/office/clock and click on options/settings and check if network operator time is set to auto-update. then check time zone is not set to GMT, as during summer time we are GMT + 1. easier to leave set to auto update and time zone to local time.
 i'm on 3, and time refreshed this morning no problem...<br />

<h2>            Unable to install Outlook Hotmail Connector&#58; Connector requires Outlook 2003, 2007, or 2010</h2>
                    <div><b>Original Title:&nbsp;</b>"I am unable to install Microsoft Ofice Outlook Hotmail Connector following installation of Microsoft Office 2010"</div>
Previously using Connector I was able to access my Hotmail account from Outlook 2003. I have installed Office 2010&nbsp;and under the file tab had a request to install Outlook Connector. The file is downloaded and when I run the program I get a message informing
 me that the Connector required Outlook 2003 207 or 2010

            <p>Another apology as I seemed to have missed the email informing me of your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried adding a new account and the installing outlook connector but still get the error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that the error may be due to a problem with the installation of Office 2010 as we are having problems when starting excel and word - every time we start the programs we are getting an message informing us that the program is configuring files and
 the only solutiion I have seen to remove this appears to be a rebuild of Windows folowed by reinstallation of MS Office 10.

<h2>            Record button missing from 64bit Skype for Business</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have recently upgrade one of our users from 32 bit Skype for business to 64 bit version 16.0.6001.1078 and the record call button is now missing. The only button that shows is "Manage Recordings" which shows us where the recordings are held. I have checked
 the admin console on Office 365 and the user is enabled for call recording.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Joe</p>

<p>I have realised that you can't record calls on one on one Skype for business calls. This is what our user was attempting. If you start a meeting, the button is available again. Thanks</p>

<h2>            How to enable Wifi tethering on Mango&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So Mango has WiFi tethering apparently. My carrier has advised me that it is fully supported and enabled for my service/phone (Omnia 7), but I can't see how to enable it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've read a few comments on blogs about possibly needing additional drivers, but I can't find anything about it. Does anyone have any suggestions/help?</p>

<br />
<div>The drivers are part of the phone OS image. They are added on by the OEM. Your computer doesn't need additional drivers to make use of the phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot since it will just look like a router or any other wireless access point.&nbsp;</div>

So I'm not tech savvy so I don't know a fancy way to fix this but I was on Xbox on last night playing Ark and everything worked fine. Woke up today morning and I couldn't connect to Xbox live yet network was fine and I could see my friend list and see what
 all they were doing. When I turned on my computer to see what was the issue with my subscription and it showed this message. I was billed a week ago for a month so it isn't that I didn't resubscribe, but I don't know how to fix this.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 IMAP Archiving. Stop Gmail Server Deleting</h2>
                    I have outlook 2016. using Gmail IMAP<br />
I have set up auto archiving. The archiving seems to remove the emails from the Gmail server.<br />
I want to auto archive to stop the .pst file getting too big. (before it removed my emails I had approx. 10,000 emails) I want to archive them on my outlook but keep them on the Gmail server so if I log into Gmail all emails will be there and easily found as
 I use several computers and sometimes need to revert back to old emails (even from 2014).<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.<br />
Many Thanks

<p>An IMAP mail account uses an *.ost data file, it is a copy of what is on the server, if you use the MS Outlook Archive option you are basically duplicating your data, and an archive process moves mail from the data file (server) to a pst</p>
<p>An IMAP mail account will show the same mail on all devices to which that mail account is configured as IMAP</p>

<h2>            Hacking and Phishing</h2>
                    <p>You warned users about the <em>hackers </em>offering help with a <em>Freefone </em>
number. I'd already had&nbsp;some where they used this page to send me an email with&nbsp; "<em>Help</em>" purporting to be
<em><strong>MS</strong></em>. Now they've gone a step further by piggy-backing on
<em><strong>IE11 Homepage </strong></em>[<strong><em>Win 7 Prof</em></strong>] just as I was closing it: they were obviously trying to get into my
<em>O/S </em>whilst putting up a (the same?) junk <em>Freefone </em>number. Judging by the amount of flashing their
<em>window </em>was doing, <em><strong>Win 7</strong></em> wasn't having any of it. I couldn't succeed in closing
<strong><em>IE11</em></strong>, so used the <em>Task Manager </em>to close it down and the
<em>hack </em>attempt with it. There followed my use of <strong><em>MALWAREBYTES </em>
</strong>and <strong><em>MS </em></strong><em>Security Essentials, </em>plus&nbsp;<em>3rd Party
</em>antispyware&nbsp;- everything was clean.</p>
<p>I don't know if <strong><em>Microsoft </em></strong>is working against these pests; but the attempted infiltration is getting more persistent.</p>

<p>Likewise do not call the '800' number listed, it is a spammer and you don't even have such numbers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I see that it's gone, thank you moderators!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does not send such emails, as you suspect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you might be seeing is a lock screen exploit. They will often claim that your Windows has been locked for your protection (no) and that if you try to defeat it it will cause some type of harm (no).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can hit Control + Alt + Delete to open Task Manager and locate the Application then close it. Chances are good that the rest of your hrowser pages will close as well, but this is not a huge problem. Open a new window and locate the offending site
 in History and report/block/delete it from History. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to carefully reopen the sites you were on, it's very possible that one of them triggered the event. If you remember where you were before the exploit happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I would recommend switching browsers, IE11 is not the best option anymore and will be history itself sooner or later, to be replaced by a new version of Edge we are to understand. There are other browsers available to you with Windows 7 as well, and
 support for 7 will end in 2020. You may wish to consider other OS options as well. It's up to you to choose them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for stopping these things, check to see that your antivirus can stop at least some of them. Many have been defeated already but hackers don't stop trying. Microsoft or any other party can only combat what they know about and work to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But these hackers rely on fear from those who do not understand what is happening. You know the truth, spread it to your friends.</p>

<p>The issue of a web&nbsp;browser being redirected to a fake "tech support"&nbsp;web page&nbsp;purporting to be Microsoft or any other well known and trusted business isn't typically able to be detected by antivirus or most other security applications, primarily because
 it's not actually malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases these redirection popup pages are nothing more than a small script launched by an advertisement which was directed to display by the very same advertising networks that display any other ads, so there's really nothing there for an AV program
 to detect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no real hacking going on here and the reason these can appear to be "locked" in place on the screen is due to flaws designed into the older web browsers (all of them), at a time when attacks like this weren't occurring.&nbsp; In most cases these issues
 with the browsers can't be fixed on the older operating system platforms, since in order to fix them the changes would need to be so severe as to break many of the millions of web pages all over the Internet, leading to utter chaos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has already fixed many of&nbsp;these problems on the more modern Windows 10 S Mode operating system delivered with all Microsoft Surface tablet and laptop devices and many current 3rd-party computers as well.&nbsp; However, these significant changes can't
 be made to the older browsers without breaking things as mentioned above, so the only way to get them is to choose to upgrade by buying a new device that ships with the Windows 10 S Mode installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the major web browser vendors have been working hard to move away from these outdated and flawed designs for a few years now and so these issues will mostly disappear as people replace their old hardware devices with new ones over the next few years.&nbsp;
 For example, that Windows 7 system you have will officially end support from Microsoft&nbsp;on January 14th, 2020, so you should be planning what you'll purchase to replace that relatively ancient operating system that started sales a decade ago in 2009.</p>

<p>I have more than a few Windows 7 computers and with proper protection I rarely see that problem now, regardless of how nice 10 is, which I am typing from right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are similar things that can plague Firefox as well, in Linux Mint even. I'm not sure what the device you allude to is but you don't need a special version of 10 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some point you will want to upgrade though. and the they have about 5 months to work on that. However, like XP, Windows 7 is not going to fall off the edge of the earth on that day. And if the new version of Edge is going to be ported to older OS that
 to is a good thing, if it works. I can't say what I use and it's up to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing we do to combat hacking is permanent. There is no resting place. Remember that and keep up to date and have backed up sources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS One of the biggest problems of recent times wasn't about the browser, it was about how many (a ton) of the CPUs in use had a flaw that could be exploited and had to be patched. One of those problems was called Heartbleed? by the white hats in order to
 scare you properly, the other Spectre? but those should have been offered in Windows Update by now if you even just got you computer up for the first time, no?</p>

<p>unrequited still,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, it isn't just Windows 10, since that doesn't stop the browser based ransomware,&nbsp;it's the very specific version of Windows 10 in&nbsp;"S" mode&nbsp;that doesn't contain the browser vulnerabilities which enable most of these popup exploits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 is ancient in computer terms and anyone with true security concerns stopped using it a few years ago, just as with Windows XP which was never a good operating system in terms of security and so was replaced by those with knowledge of security several
 years before it ended support by Microsoft itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course some will keep these outdated operating systems around, but that doesn't make it a good practice.&nbsp; Unlike an old car where the issue is just old hardware that needs physical maintenance, an old PC that in today's world is Internet attached by nature
 is a risk to your financial health and safety.&nbsp; Keeping it around for whatever reason is dangerous, so there's really no good excuse, ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heartbleed was an issue with the OpenSSL cryptographic software library used as the core of most of the world's secure electronic communications, which had nothing to do with the CPU hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meltdown was the greatest immediate risk for Windows based systems, but the easiest to fix quickly in software.&nbsp; Spectre was more technically difficult to fix, but also much more difficult to exploit, so though it affected nearly all currently popular processors
 it was never really exploited before there were fixes at least available from most major operating system developers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These processor based hardware&nbsp;vulnerabilities really had&nbsp;little to do with the individual operating systems that run on them and in fact it was the browsers&nbsp;that were often updated most quickly and easily in order to insure that the most likely attacks
 were protected from before they ever became a true&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardware design issues that enabled these vulnerabilities are also understood and have been fixed already in most affected&nbsp;processors, so newer versions don't typically contain them.&nbsp; Another reason to upgrade your physical devices, since the software
 fixes were really workarounds that required additional overhead and thus slowed the operation of the older affected systems that contained them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems being discussed in this thread related to browser popups can't be easily fixed in older browser versions simply because the items being exploited are inherent to the designs of those older browsers.&nbsp; Microsoft and most other browser developers
 have already designed out many of these issues, but they can't be redistributed&nbsp;in the older browsers and&nbsp;operating systems due to compatibility agreements Microsoft has with businesses relating to these, so the only way to resolve them completely is to move
 on from these old systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though it's true there will always be new vulnerabilities and exploits, many of the easier to exploit items have already been discovered, with human social engineering the most prevalent remaining that will never truly be completely "fixed".&nbsp; Whatever can
 be done to protect&nbsp;a person from himself aids in reducing these risks, but until everyone in the world grows up in an education system that teaches basic literacy relating to scams, whether technical in nature or not, there will always be fools available to
 be tricked (e.g. conned)</p>

<p>What is real is that most&nbsp;larger&nbsp;businesses have learned they need to keep ahead of the security curve, and that the cheapest way to do this is to purchase the latest equipment and software to go with it every 5 years or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consumers and&nbsp;very small business&nbsp;are a different situation, since they're mostly cheap and uninformed, so the manufacturers have realized they need to deal with this problem in a different way.&nbsp; Those like Apple began quite a while ago by making much simpler
 devices that many consumers wished to keep current, such as the&nbsp;iPhone and iPad, so rather than keep them for many years the consumer would tend to replace the entire device more often including the software that came with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, that system has begun to break down as the devices became more technically capable and so expensive, resulting in similar problems to those the PC and other general purpose computers have had for decades.&nbsp; Some like Google began to realize they'd
 need to maintain the devices they sold with patches or upgrades for at least a few (typically 3)&nbsp;years, expecting the consumer to keep them that long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other method is to make the devices themselves relatively cheap, which is&nbsp;where those like China's Huawei and other low cost manufacturers have mostly headed, though with less truly secure results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has remained in the better support group, switching their operating system support paradigm to one of software-as-a-service, or more specifically, Windows-as-a-service, where the significant upgrades come automatically as part of the security maintenance
 of the operating system.&nbsp; This solves the historical problem that major upgrades were required regularly, but still&nbsp; doesn't completely resolve the issue of an uneducated public making the wrong decisions, which has always been the true problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who care, there are 2 techniques I've successfully used throughout my computer career that over the long haul are usually the most cost effective, while still retaining the best security possible throughout the life of the hardware originally purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One is to buy the latest and most technically capable hardware&nbsp;you can afford, seemingly overpaying for the hardware today, since that tends to future proof the ability for that same hardware to continue to operate effectively with future operating system
 upgrades, without the need to upgrade the hardware itself beyond more minor external devices.&nbsp; This works most effectively for business and those with enough money to pay for the hardware in advance and was how I dealt with most of my purchases during my own&nbsp;computer&nbsp;career.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other is to buy slightly less capable, but often much cheaper device models from last year, which won't last as long but save enough to allow replacing them more often.&nbsp; This also has the advantage of replacing the operating system with the device, so
 rather than software upgrades&nbsp;you only need to&nbsp;install&nbsp;new (mostly free)&nbsp;app software and possibly migrate some data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since most today such as banks, financial and other&nbsp;businesses I deal with store the data for me, I only need to maintain my own personal data like pictures and video, which is also much easier and&nbsp;more safely&nbsp;done in the cloud.&nbsp; That means the
 hardware is even easier to replace, simply buying a new device and connecting it to my online identity when the old one either fails, is lost or damaged or simply gets too old to be useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem you bring up last of old donated hardware, stating "You have to work with what is real", isn't a problem the manufacturers can truly solve.&nbsp; The financially limited person will always exist, which the cheaper models help with, but can't be solved&nbsp;except
 by giving away devices and in truth, free software&nbsp;has become common today with the ad supported model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I no longer use the expensive device model, since as a consumer with plans to travel, a cheaper, lighter device makes more sense than the often larger, heavier business devices anyway.&nbsp; However, I still bought a decent device in the Microsoft Surface Go
 tablet, since I want&nbsp;modern capabilities, albeit with smaller display and&nbsp;less of the high-end features I often got with business devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Windows-as-a-service model and other trends like their plans to replace the current Windows 10 Edge based on Mozilla open-source&nbsp;with a browser based on the Chromium open-source
</p>
<p>model instead will only continue to make Windows better, so future support should be easier as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the more important thing for consumers to understand, that regardless of what small patches Microsoft tries to apply to outdated operating systems like Windows 7, these can never truly be "fixed".&nbsp; Moving to Windows 10 and especially to modern&nbsp;devices
 that include the much more secure Windows 10 S mode is the best way to insure your personal data security far into the future regardless how it's acquired.</p>

<p>Of course it's not perfect unrequited, but the point is that S mode removes most of the currently attacked vulnerabilities, so it immediately solves not only the popups that Old_hand was originally discussing here, but also much of the other malware affecting
 legacy Windows, without the need for antimalware to protect from these&nbsp;now outmoded&nbsp;attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update allows the application of security patches as well as other improvements.&nbsp; However, this doesn't include the ability to return to Windows 10 S, since once the 'upgrade' to Pro is performed, it can't be (easily) reverted to that more secure
 version.</p>

<h2>            can I upgrade office 2010 PKC to FPP and sell on the PKC on to a third party</h2>
                    i recently bought laptop and MS office Home &amp; Student PKC to activate the pre-loaded version, i'm now looking at installing a version of MS Office onto my home PC and was wondering if i can purchase an Office FPP version to install onto PC and then use
 the code on the laptop and then sell on the PKC version to get some money back. is this possible? i'm guessing that if i input the new code from the FPP version into 'Microsoft Office 2010 tools, office anytime upgrade' from the start menu, it will free up
 the product code from the PKC version?

            There is nothing you can do to "free up" the Product Key Card license. It is only good on the first computer you install it on. There is no provission to transfer it to someone else or a different computer.<br />
<br />
I haven;t seen explicit mention of it, but you could look into the possibility of using the "Anytime Upgrade" option to upgrade from PKC to FPP (Retail) license.&nbsp; You would still "lose" the PKC license, but you would get the FPP at a discount.&nbsp; It's worth a
 try at least.<br />
<br />
<b><span>Anytime Upgrade</span></b>
<p>You will have to buy Office 2010 Home and Business to get Outlook.</p>
<p><span>If you start with Office Home and Student and realize that you need Outlook, you have 3 options:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Buy standalone Outlook to add to Home and student</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Buy Home and Business full bundle</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Use Office Anytime Upgrade offer</span></p>
<p><span>Pros and Cons:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The standalone Outlook does not integrate with Word in Home and Student, and it is the most expensive combination.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Buying Home and Business is better price wise, especially since you can resell the Home and Student to someone else.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Apparently MS provides a discounted price to using Anytime Upgrade to a full Home and Student bundle</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the new and improved solution (much better than our previous advice) to your problem, direct from MS Customer Service.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Anytime Upgrade offers you a discounted upgrade between Office 2010 bundles.
</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p>I contacted Microsoft directly and was able to get an upgrade to Home and Business for $79.95.&nbsp; I was told that there is no way to buy it from the Microsoft store website but that you can get it through the Office website.&nbsp; (The rep said
 that the easiest way was to contact Microsoft.)&nbsp; Microsoft will e-mail you an authorization code so you can upgrade.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<p><span>Here is another similar story:</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I went to Office Anytime Upgrade under Start Menu <span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Made payment for Office Home &amp; Student &gt;&gt; Home &amp; Business upgrade ($120)</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>After payment, a box with an "Install" button came up. I wasn't given the opportunity to save the download. I was given a new Product key.</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I clicked Install &amp; it installed (or upgraded?) to Office 2010 Home &amp; Business</p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I ran Excel &amp; Word, and the "non-commercial use" was no longer there</p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>However, under my Control Panel / Uninstall Programs, there is only 1 office installation - Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2010; there isn't any Home &amp; Business.</p>
<p><span>My main intention in upgrading was to get rid of the "non-commercial use", so it turned out ok. But is there anything wrong that I did? Why does Control Panel show Home &amp; Student? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the “old” advice as an alternative.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Consider it based on the upgrade price they present you.</span></p>
<p><span>You have to buy a product key that is valid for Outlook.
</span></p>
<p><span>The simplest apparent solution is to buy Outlook standalone for roughly USD$140. However, I have been told that this may not be the best overall approach for a couple of reasons. The obvious reason is that
 you'll have to manage 2 separate Office installations: separate install files/CD's and separate product keys. The other reason I've been told about is that when you install a standalone Outlook it does NOT fully integrate with the existing H&amp;S. Apparently
 spell checking dictionaries are maintained separately and a few other things.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do the math, retail H&amp;S has list price USD$150. Standalone Outlook has list price USD$140. Home and Business is USD$280. So, if you have the option, buying H&amp;B makes best sense all around.</span></p>
<p><span>If you bought the Retail/"FPP" license for H&amp;S, you have the option of uninstalling it and reselling it to someone else. If you have an OEM or Product Key Card license transferring the license to someone else
 is NOT an option.</span></p>
<p><span>PS: prices assume Retail/"FPP" license (my only recommendation). The product key card name "equivalents" are slightly cheaper on the surface. But if you understand the implication of license terms, you instantly
 realize that for most people the PKC is effectively a s*c*a*m IMO (because most people are not aware of the downsides of the the PKC when they buy it)</span></p>
