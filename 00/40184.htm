<p>Assuming that the original license is genuine, you should be able to use the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool </a>to install Windows 10.&nbsp; When the install process asks for a product key, just skip past it and it should activate automatically when the install is complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To help investigate the cause of this issue. Please provide us with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Do you have Family Safety installed on your computer?</div>
</li><li>
<div>What version of Family Safety are you using?&nbsp;Please make sure that you are using the latest version of Windows Live Family Safety which is Version 2011 Build 15.4.3555.0308. You can download the latest
 version from this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>- Yes, Family Safety is installed.</p>
<p>- I just created my Windows Live account and downloaded Family Safety this past weekend, so it's probably safe to assume I have the most recent version.&nbsp; (I am at work now, &amp; will verify the version tonight @ home.)</p>
<p>- I could only get her successfully logged onto Roblox by removing her username from parental controls on Family Safety settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help with this matter,</p>

            <p>Hi Gareth,</p>
<p><br />
For us to troubleshoot the issue, please try to reconfigure your PC in Family Safety. This would refresh the connection between your computer and the Family Safety website. Please follow these steps:</p>

<br />
3. Click the checkbox for your computer, click <strong><span>Save</span></strong>, then click
<strong><span>Remove</span></strong>.<br />
4. Open Windows Live Family Safety on your computer.<br />
5. On the upper-right side of the Family Safety window, click the <strong><span>Get the latest settings from the website</span></strong> icon.
<br />
6. After a few seconds, it will show a dialog box saying that there are no monitored accounts on your computer. Click
<strong><span>Set up Family Safety</span></strong>. If the dialog box didn't show, just close the client and open it again<br />
7. Sign in again to <strong><span>Windows Live Family Safety&nbsp;</span></strong>using&nbsp;the parent account.&nbsp;<br />
8. Select the&nbsp;user that you want to monitor.<br />
9. Select&nbsp;the Family Safety member (the one that you have set the settings for Family Safety).<br />
10. Click <strong><span>Save, </span></strong>then click <strong><span>Close</span></strong>.<br />
11. Open Windows Live Family Safety again, then click the <strong><span>Get the latest settings from the website</span></strong> icon on more time.

            <p>I have the same problem. The Roblox player downloads the latest version and tries to run it as a&nbsp;new process from a temp file with a partially randomized name. Windows Family Safety won't allow it to run a process&nbsp;that way and stops it until you grant it
 permission.&nbsp;Once you grant it permission, the whole things starts over, but since it creates yet a&nbsp; new temp file (with randomized name)&nbsp;&nbsp;it has to ask you again, and your are stuck in an endless loop. I cant find a way out of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my son wants to play Roblox, I have to let him run it on my account, which defeats the purpose of family safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a viable solution for this problem?</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for participating in this thread. I understand that you want to let your child play the games on Roblox with Family Safety turned on. If the App restrictions is enabled in Family Safety, it will automatically block all programs not included in the
 allow list. Also, since the Roblox website creates a temporary file, there is no other way to allow it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way for your kid to play games on the website is to disable App restrictions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if you have any other inquiries regarding the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Anniversary Update Battery Charge Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> axelsteinhage  say:</h3>
<h2>            Anniversary Update Battery Charge Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a big problem after updating my 8inch Tablet "Touchlet XWi.8 3G" from Win 10 version 1511 to the anniversary update 1607. After the update, Windows will not recognize any plugged-in charger. This means, although the charger is plugged in, the battery
 symbol will not show the charging flash and the battery drains. Only when the tablet is completely shut down, the battery is charged (indicated by a blinking LED). I tried to uninstall the anniversary update, but windows will not let me do so as it requires
 a plugged charger :(</p>
<p>I also tried to get battery/charger drivers from the manufacturer but there are none. Also the latest cummulative update of win 10 1607 did not help. I also reverted the UEFI-BIOS parameters to its defaults which did not help either. Of course I could try
 a factory reset, but as it was originally a Win 8.1 device, I would loose the possibility to upgrade to win 10 again now, I suppose. Is there anything else I can do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Axel</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I forgot to mention that I also reinstalled the battery/charger devices in device manager which did not help either.</p>

            <p>Hi Axel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not worry we will help you with this issue. We appreciate your effort and time spent in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us try few of the troubleshooting steps below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>To access the new battery settings, open the <strong>
Settings</strong> app, go to <strong>System</strong>, and navigate to <strong>Battery saver
</strong>and set the settings as you wish to.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Windows 10 features that your device can't handle won't be shown as an option. If you're running the operating system on a desktop computer without a battery, the
<strong>Battery saver</strong> option won't be available. The same is true for other features.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong><span>I suggest you to <strong><span>restore the power plans to default
</span></strong><span>and check if it helps</span><strong><span>.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Reset and restore the power plans to default:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Right-click</span></strong><span> on <strong><span>Start button
</span></strong>and click on <strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin).</span></strong></span></li><li><span>In the command prompt, type <strong><span>powercfg –restoredefaultschemes
</span></strong>and hit <strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</span></li><li><strong><span>Exit</span></strong><span> command prompt.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> This would reset the power plan settings to default. Any customized power plans are would be removed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>Once the power plan is reset to default, you may create a
<strong><span>new power plan</span></strong> and customize the same according to your needs.</span></p>

</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Applies to Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Update us the status of issues on power settings and battery charging&nbsp;for further assistance.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Deepika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for the answer, but this does not help in my case. It is not a problem of the power plan. I suspect, the anniversary update has corrupted my BIOS settings. The problem is: Windows does not RECOGNIZE, when I plug in my power adapter. Only when the
 system is totally shut down and I plug in my adapter, the battery is charged. As soon as I hit the "on" button, i.e. during the BIOS-phase, long before win is up, &nbsp;the charging LED goes off and when windows comes up, it does NOT show the "plugged" symbol on
 the battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I believe, some option in the BIOS got changed, which handles the recognition of the charging cable, which is plugged into the USB-port of my tablet :(</p>
<p>

            <p>Danny357 I felt the same pain. I'd be using my computer except it slows down to a crawl and there is no indication of why. You can skip the rant and
<p>
</p><p>Trying to load a web page will take minutes. So troubleshooting 101 of course you reboot, and that's when the culprit comes out of hiding. Instead of rebooting, your computer says it is installing updates... 10% (eventually after you go get a sandwich it
 reboots.) Now you are pissed because it was apparently more important that you immediately install your latest windows updates as opposed to anything you were working on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway here's the solution: you turn off the windows update service by making it manual and stopping it. A few minutes later you realize it didn't work because windows will help you correct your mistake of not running this intrusive hog of a service that
 is more important than your other stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next solution, disable the service. Haha! You win. Until...</p>
<p>
</p><p>the new minecraft update is out, you read abotu it and got it on your phone already, want it on windows 10 as well. SO you go to the store, open the Minecraft app page and there's no update button. You "check for new updates" if you can find that button
 (it's there) but nothing happens. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah.. .Microsoft wins again. If you shut off the service, then you're dead to them and you can rot in the **** of yesterdays revisions. So... you now have the annoying ritual to go and re-enable the update service so you can update some apps. and then hopefully
 when you are done you remember to turn it off again or you're back at square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally one day (congrats if you're still reading, this is the actual solution) you make an icon on your desktop that you can click to simplify the whole enable/disable updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a new text file and save it on your desktop as "windows update control.bat" or "I H8 M$ux.bat" and paste this into it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>@echo when ready to continue press any key to enable Windows Update
</strong><br />
<strong>pause</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>sc config wuauserv start= demand</strong><br />
<strong>net start wuauserv</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>@echo when ready to continue press any key to disable Windows Update </strong>
<br />
<strong>pause</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>net stop wuauserv</strong><br />
<strong>sc config wuauserv start= disabled</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>@echo Windows Update disabled again!</strong><br />
<strong>pause</strong><br />
</p>
<p>now whenever you need to update your apps, just right click on this file icon and "Run as Administrator". Follow the prompts. First you press a key to enable updates. Then you go do your thing (while leaving this window open). When done you go back to this
 window an press another key to turn updating back off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long post. Windows deliberately chose to remove a button that would make this all unnecessary because you can't be trusted to decide if you need updates. I HAVE TO RANT SOMETIMES!</p>

<p>Sounds like you may have some failing hardware. &nbsp;Update your BIOS, if possible, and see if that has any impact.</p>
<p>With out the dumps, it is difficult to determine what the reported hardware fault was.</p>

<p>Bugcheck 0x124 is&nbsp;WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR - "This bug check indicates that a fatal hardware error has occurred".</p>
<p>Can you upload the contents of c:\windows\minidump to your <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SkyDrive</a> and provide a link?</p>
<p>General guidance for dealing with bluescreens:</p>
<p>Consider running chkdsk on all partitions. &nbsp;Let chkdsk complete on each partition and see if that helps.</p>
<p>Also consider running SFC /SCANNOW.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to use Driver Verifier. &nbsp;To enable Driver Verifier... start-&gt;verifier.exe-&gt;OK-&gt;Create standard settings-&gt;Next-&gt;select driver names from a list-&gt;Next-&gt;sort by Provider-&gt;select all non-Microsoft drivers-&gt;Finish, and OK your way out of the
 dialog.</p>
<p>Then, reboot and use the system as you normally would, and wait for a problem. &nbsp;In the event that the system does not boot completely after enabling driver verifier, boot into Safe Mode and run driver verifier, and tell it to delete the changes.</p>
<p>Wait for a bugcheck to occur after enabling verifier as described, and then upload the dump to your SkyDrive, and provide a link.</p>
<p>If you boot into safe mode, do you still experience bugchecks? What about if you do a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean
 boot</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/6115cb34-2890-46b5-8c1e-c934c56ecfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">device
 clean boot</a>?</p>
<p>Consider testing memory with Windows Memory Diagnostic or memtest86. Note that memory that passes tests is not necessarily good memory - it just hasn't failed a test. &nbsp;Consider systematically eliminating RAM from the system - run with a couple of modules
 for a while, and see how things go. Then try the other modules.</p>
<p>Other common suggestions include ensuring drivers are up to date, as well as ensuring that you're using the latest BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure that the system has adequate cooling and ventilation. Test RAM, reseat RAM and the processor if you can. &nbsp;<span>If the BIOS is the latest, consider reverting
 to a previous version and see if that helps. &nbsp;Also double-check BIOS settings; perhaps, note current settings, reset the BIOS defaults, and then adjust those settings you know are necessary to adjust. &nbsp;Double-check voltage, etc. and ensure/verify CPU compatibility
 with the motherboard.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>As screenshot shows, when my PC is in idle state, a thread called "KeGetEffectiveIrqI" will occupies a significant amount of CPU resources. I tried to search online but nothing came back. Any idea of this particular thread? Is it possible to be a malware?
 Or it's just a part of the OS (indexing, antivirus scan, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. This only happens when the system is in idle (not in use for 5 or more minutes) and that thread disappears right after any keystroke or mouse action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            <p><span>Do you understand what these files contain?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The files requested are technical reports about how your system works and do not relate to personal data, which you naturally wish to protect. They may contain your machine name, your user name, and
 where software is installed. The files do not contain passwords, bank pin numbers, log-ons and complete product keys. It is for you to determine if that violates your privacy. You only need to leave a file in your OneDrive for the limited time necessary for
 the other party to retrieve the file. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Having requested thousands of reports in these forums over the last 5 years, I can only say that I have never encountered a complaint that an exchange of files has contributed to a breach of the users
 security and a loss of personal data. I am not an expert in computer security but breaches of security occur when a user allows direct access to their computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Access can be granted by the user knowingly allowing direct access or access being achieved by deception or trick though a camouflaged link in an incoming email or other communication.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you look at other threads you will find many other users sharing files, notably by those seeking help with diagnosing the causes of blue of death crashes. Exchanging copies of files is an extremely
 practical way to aid and expedite the finding of a solution to the problem the user has. You no doubt are aware that these are moderated public forums. Abuse of whatever kind in these forums is rigorously dealt with and those seeking to abuse others are excluded
 from using the forum. However, I have never seen the type of abuse you fear reported.

            <p>Yes I am technical as well so I am fully aware of the risks to share this kind of data publicly, as well as what kind of information is contained in diagnostic reports, not mentioning system logs and memory dumps, which my policy strictly prohibit from sharing
 with unknown third party.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Depends; Did you first check whether your PC maker or hardware maker supports winxp, not all do, on modern hardware.</p>
<p>Nore have you mentioned what type of connection, via Lan usb modem or? I suspect that whatever connection hardware is being used isnt supported under winxp, consequently no drivers are installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And since you have win7 pro why did you not simply install virtual winxp?</p>

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Good morning</p>
<p>The answers to your question are as follows:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am presuming to a Windows App as the problem is when I click on the mail icon on my desktop, when I go into my emails it says Microsoft Outlook.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The complete error is&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Outlook account settings are out of date, in the right hand corner it says fix account/dismiss. When you click on fix account it comes up with an error or does nothing.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exact issues I am facing is that I cannot send or receive emails from Hotmail account on my desktop.</p>
<p>4,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried all the troubleshooter points below and none of them have worked. This is a new laptop that I have had only a few weeks and since I had no choice as Windows 10 came as a package, Windows 10 has only worked for two weeks before all the
 problems have started, I feel this is not good enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus the fact my Microsoft Solitaire Collection doesn't work either, I have tried what you suggested but when you right click on Display Adapter your choices are Scan for hardware changes or properties NOT update driver software so that didn't work either.</p>

<h2>            Updates knocking out sound on Windows10</h2>
                    Every update inc Apple knocks out sound.&nbsp; usual fixes to uninstall/reinstall drivers not working this time. Previously Techhelp efforts did not do any more than I had. Whist accepting Techhelp's view that my machine Dell Inspiron 1564 is not supported
 for Windows10, sound has been available from installation and standard fixes has got round the problem - until now when after an Apple update it won't come back. Any ideas?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>1. Did you able to install other windows updates on the computer?</p>
<p>2. Did you get an error code while installing java update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Java Update is a feature that keeps your Windows computer up-to-date with the latest Java releases. When you have auto update enabled, your system periodically checks for new versions of Java.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong> <strong>Try to turn off user account control and install the java update.</strong></p>
<p>Even though you are logged on with an Administrator account, Windows Vista and Windows 7 require elevated privilege to install certain things. That is the User Account Control (UAC) function. User Account Control (UAC) is a security component in Windows
 Vista and Windows 7 operating systems. UAC enables users to perform common tasks as non-administrators and as administrators without having to switch users, log off, or use Run As.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Follow the link given below:</strong></p>
<p>What is User Account Control (UAC) in Microsoft <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows operating systems?</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/uac.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/uac.xml</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After installing java update turn&nbsp;ON the user account control(UAC).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2 If the above step does not work follow the steps given below.</strong></p>
<p>You can uninstall older versions of Java manually in the same way as you would uninstall any other software from your Windows computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong> <strong>Uninstall the older java version manually.</strong></p>
<p>1. Click Start </p>
<p>2. Select Control Panel </p>
<p>3. Select Programs </p>
<p>4. Click Programs and Features </p>
<p>5. Select the program you want to uninstall by clicking on it, and then click the Uninstall button.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2 </strong><strong>Now try to install latest java version.</strong></p>
<p>Now try to install the latest version of java manually on the computer.</p>

            <p>So, do you have anything actually helpful to say about this? I have a brand spanking new, fresh out of the box install of Windows 7 Enterprise 64-bit, and UAC is probably the most annoying "feature" I have ever come across. Java wants permission every single
 time it searches for and finds an update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am 100% definitely unwilling to CONSTANTLY turn UAC off and on just for Java to update, and quite honestly I think I will risk it by turning UAC completely off since it's a blatantly broken program. Can you really not see thatUAC is the problem, and that
 rather than going through all of those bullshit steps to accommodate UAC by bending over backward for it, we should find a way to make it less intrusive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did anybody think it was a good idea to make UAC not recognize specific programs? I get it, someone could use that as a loophole, but you are seriously running the risk of people turning off your security entirely in favor of actually being able to use
 their computers at will.</p>

<h2>            Monitor bad quality on xbox, verry good on pc</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm having an issue with the quality on my LG flatron e2350. I've been using this monitor for 3 years and always had an excellent quality (using dvi connector). Now that i've bought an xbox 360, I connected the console to my monitor with a brand new Philips
 HDMI cable. When I switch to hdmi (to the xbox) screen, the quality is very poor (pixelated, looks like playstation 1 quality). I've tried other settings, tried resetting the display settings of the xbox but nothing works. Can someone please tell me how to
 fix this? The quality is really poor.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Compatibility and Graphic Drivers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Compatibility and Graphic Drivers</h2>
                    <p>I have made several posts to this community trying to resolve a graphics driver issue with Windows 10.&nbsp; I upgraded to windows 10 in Aug and have been having problems with graphic drivers ever since.&nbsp; I cannot find the appropriate graphics drivers to work
 with my HP Laptop fitted with an AMD switchable graphics card.&nbsp; Although I have received lots of advice from the site, unfortunately, none of the suggested solutions worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer became very slow just before Xmas.&nbsp; I finally took it into a repair shop and in the end, had Windows 10 removed and Windows 7 Home Premium reinstalled.&nbsp; The tech that did the work indicated he also could not find any of the necessary graphic
 drivers on AMD's or HP's support web sites for Windows 10.&nbsp; Hence the re-install of Windows 7 and all is working fine.&nbsp; What I find particularly vexing, however, is that as soon as I upgraded, I started to get messages from Microsoft to upgrade to Windows
 10 and that my computer was fully compatible with the upgrade.&nbsp; There is something seriously wrong with this OS compatibility checker.&nbsp; I am out $200 to get my computer working again, but Microsoft continues to push an incompatible OS at me.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I stop
 getting these messages being pushed at me from Microsoft to upgrade?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to answer your query. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As Windows 10 is a new operating system, some drivers for Windows 10 may not be available which might be causing the issue. As drivers are released by different manufacturers, we do not have information as to when the latest compatible drivers for Windows
 10 will be released. I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer for more information related to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you are facing compatibility issues with the driver, you can download the latest available driver from the manufacturer's website and install it in compatibility mode by following the steps below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After you have downloaded the driver:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select "<strong>Properties</strong>".&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Select "<strong>Compatibility</strong>" Tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Place a <strong>check mark</strong> next to "<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>" and select Windows 8
<span>&nbsp;</span>from the drop&nbsp; down list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to help.</span></span><span>

            <p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; If there are compatibility issues with drivers, why does Microsoft insist on saying my laptop is compatible with Windows 10?&nbsp; The issue has been outstanding for almost a year, if you read the posts on this community.&nbsp; Your reply
 gives the impression of helping, but it only exacerbates the situation.&nbsp; There is no point in contacting either of the manufacturers - neither of them (HP and AMD) have provided updated drivers - why would you suggest this as a solution - why hasn't Microsoft
 done the checking with its OEMs to ensure Windows 10 is compatible before releasing software that is misleading in its intent?&nbsp; I have no intention of upgrading to Windows 10 and go through the same frustration and costs I have incurred.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to
 do a better job in assessing hardware and software compatiblity with Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hello Barbara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WMSDK </strong>is a file related to Windows media player. However, this file may also be a malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booting issues may occur due to few startup programs or software conflicts. Wireless connection may not work due to corrupt wireless network drivers or settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot and check the issue with booting.</strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also <strong>run Microsoft safety scanner to check and remove any malware or virus in Windows.</strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For wireless issue, please refer this article and check.<br />

<h2>            File History to new Machine</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a new laptop in February of this year running windows 8.1. &nbsp;I ahd to bring it recently in for service adn i created a back up using file history, as well as Backup image.</p>
<p>The fix was to install a new harddrive and a new motherboard.</p>
<p>When I got it back home, i wanted to restore my laptop using the backup image, but that does not seem to work. &nbsp;When i go into the boot system, and i tried to access the backup image on my external dirve the message said that it could not boot form an external
 drive.</p>
<p>I then tried to see if i could find the File History and at least restore my items form there, but again, i cannot seem to direct the machine to the file that contains the back up files. &nbsp;It continues to try and write a new file history, but will not restore
 from the existing.</p>
<p>I then took all the files and dropped and dragged them over to the new laptop from my File History stuff. &nbsp;But now every file has a unnecessary date and time item added to it's name.</p>
<p>Also, anybody know how i can get my contacts back into Outlook? &nbsp;The contacts folder has names and email, but no phone numbers!</p>
<p>Can anybody please help with this?</p>
<p>This is a royal pain in the you know what! &nbsp;Why did they get rid of Easy Transfer? &nbsp;It was fantastic for relatively computer illiterate people like me.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You don't restore that image by booting from the external HD.</p>
<p>2. A System Image Basckup will not work on a new Motherboard as there are different Drivers now involved if you upgraded the Motherboard.</p>
<p>3. With an OEM preinstalled License, you can not upgrade the Motherboard, except under&nbsp;certain circumstances where the original is defective and the laptop manufacturer supplies their preferred alternative replacement.</p>

            <p><span>Hi ronnieharden,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What you see in the auto processing flashing box?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any software or hardware changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Let’s follow these methods &amp; check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) I would recommend you to run an online virus scan from the link given below &amp; check if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, make sure that you have the latest update for the antivirus software installed on your machine, so that it works properly.</span></p>
<p><span>b)
</span><span>You may also download &amp; run </span>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/securepc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft Security Essentials</span></a><span> on your
 machine. </span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may also configure the computer in clean boot state and check if the issue persists. It will start Windows XP by using a minimal set of
 drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts. </span></p>
<p><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a><span><br />
<b>Note:</b> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the section ‘Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state’ from the article: How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state:

<p><span>Hi lisa paiger,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. From your post, I understand that you wish to run desktop background slideshow but with the slideshow progressing by date, is that correct?
</span></p>
<p><span>b. How exactly are the pictures sorted in the folder?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There isn’t a setting available to arrange pictures in the desktop background slideshow to progress by date.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However you can sort the pictures based on the picture name, say if the pictures are arranged in the sequential format (IMG_01, IMG_02, etc).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t import any files into Windows Movie Maker 6 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> franciscoulombe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t import any files into Windows Movie Maker 6</h2>
                    <p>I am using the older version of windows movie maker, the one with the scrolling timeline interface in the bottom.</p>
<p>The version is Movie Maker Version 6.0.6002.18005</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I updated to windows 10, I found the process had uninstalled the program to replace it with the newer one. I just installed it again, and it worked fine, just as it worked before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A more recent update did the same thing again, my favorite version of movie maker uninstalled and the newer one I don't like replacing it again.</p>
<p>Again, I simply re-installed the version I like.... but now it no longer works at all. Old projects I open with it will not play, showing all of the imported videos as unavailable. "Browse for missing file" doesn't help, it just changes the red X of the
 files in the timeline for little movie file icons, and it still doesn't play. No feedback on what is wrong, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to import any files as imported media to make a video with gives no response at all. There are no error messages, nothing. I have tried this with files of all types, even image files and MP3 files, none of it works. Again, there are no error messages
 whatsoever, it just doesn't react to dragging assets into the window. The "Import media" button doesn't work either. It opens up a dialog form to pick files as normal, but when I press OK with my files selected, the Import Media Items dialog window closes
 and nothing is added to my project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what might be wrong? I really don't want to use the newer versions, I really hate their UI.</p>

            Never mind, I figured it out. I believe the problem was that, when I re-installed Windows Movie Maker 6, I installed the 32 bit version by mistake. I found a different version that was explicitly for 64 bit, and it seems to work fine! I cant be sure whether
 this is the exact reason this reinstall fixed the problem, but it seems likely.

    <title>Show hidden files and folders option not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelp2005  say:</h3>
<h2>            Show hidden files and folders option not working</h2>
                    I am trying to access a hidden folder, C:\programdata\..... I cannot see it in explorer. When I go into the control panel&gt;folder options&gt;View....the radio button to show hidden files and folders is already selected.<br />
<br />
I tried to change this to Do not display hidden files and folders by selecting the radio button and then clicking on apply. Then I exit the view menu. However, when I return to the view menu the radio button is next to the Display hidden files. ie it has not
 "registered" the change.<br />
<br />
I have changed other items in the Advanced view menu eg hide extensions for known file types, and this works fine.<br />
<br />
I have not been able to find this problem in the forum. I've obviously rebooted my pc. I do not know when this problem came about because I don't often go looking for this hidden folder.<br />
<br />
I am running vista home premium 32bit<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Michael
