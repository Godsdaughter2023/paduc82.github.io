<h2>            Skype 8  - blury texts, no proper copy&#47;paste support</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, i had to go back form Skype 8 to Skype 7 (on Windows 7) , as things are really ridiculous .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Main ideas of skype for me was always chatting - and now - fonts are blurred (see image attached) , contrast is lost, so there is no way i can read conversations fast , brings me a headache after 15 min of chatting :( (top is Skype 8, bottom is skype
 7 )</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9214abc-9023-4aa9-bc75-15fab34a9805?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9214abc-9023-4aa9-bc75-15fab34a9805?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I do copy paste a lot as i have to resend messages and information frequently . in SKype 7 , i could have started draging pointer from any area around the text and it would start selecting it form that line . In skype 8 (thanks MS DEVs who made this)
 - i cant do this ! I have to get the cursor to the FIRST LETTER ON THE LINE , otherwise it would select the whole conversation from the top, or nothing at all...</p>
<p><br />
It was a tough task to find a 7.40 installer but im back to old good 7.40 and hopefully someone would fix this one day.<br />
</p>
<p>PS - It looks like Microsoft just trying to kill skype at the end of the day ... Once they bought it - things are getting worse... Im already 50/50 of switching to another messenger and the only thing that keeps me here are people who are still on skype...
 Are they doing this on purpose ? :(<br />
<br />

<p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/91961d28-3009-4e28-8edc-22d17ab1faae" title="Bigwebas">
<p>
</p><p>For the blurred fonts, you may try to uninstall and reinstall the Skype client to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can do here on my end for the rest of your concern is to take it as your feedback and have it forwarded to our developers and engineers to help with the upcoming Skype updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your thoughts regarding the new Skype version.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the Olympus web site to see if a Windows 7 driver exists for it. For lots of older hardware, there are no Windows 7 drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you don't really need a driver for it. You never need to connect your camera directly. Buy a card reader for the type of flash card your camera uses (they are very inexpensive), put the flash card into it, and plug it into a USB port.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer doing it this way. It's easier and doesn't use the camera's battery. I have two such card readers--one that I keep on my desk, near my desktop computer, and another that I keep
 in my laptop case for use when traveling.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I hope I can help you today
<br />
<br />Display settings for mail
<br />
<br />Outlook Web App
<br />
<br />Use the display settings to control the appearance of the message list, reading pane, and conversation view.
<br />
<br />In a web browser, sign in to Outlook Web App using the URL provided by the person who manages email for your organization. Enter your user name and password, and then select Sign in.
<br />
<br />In the navigation bar at the top, select Mail, and then select Settings  Settings icon &gt; Display settings.
<br />
<br />Select the feature you want to choose display settings for and select the settings you prefer. Select  checkmark OK to save your changes or  discard Cancel to return to mail without making any changes.
<br />
<br />Display settings are:
<br />
<br />Message list    Normally Outlook Web App shows three lines of information for each message in your inbox: sender, subject, and part of the first line of text. Use this option to show the sender or subject on top, and show or hide the preview line.
<br />
<br />Conversations    Show newest or oldest messages on top, and show or hide deleted items.
<br />
<br />Reading pane    Choose options for the following:
<br />
<br />Reading pane position (right, bottom, or hidden completely)
<br />
<br />What to select when Outlook Web App opens (the first message, or you select the message)
<br />
<br />Select the check box Apply to all folders if you want your choices for the Reading pane to apply to every folder.
<br />
<br />Outlook Web App version    You can switch between the standard and the light version of Outlook Web App. If you have a low-bandwidth connection, the light version may be a better choice than the standard version of Outlook Web App. Also, the light version of Outlook Web App works better with assistive technologies such as screen readers. The light version also works with browsers that don’t support the standard version of Outlook Web App.

<h2>            Why is my microphone not recording any sound&#63;</h2>
                    So, i try to unmute it from Hardware &amp; sound -&gt; Sound -&gt; Recording, Succeed in that, then try to test it. And my mic does not record anything still (i have the latest drivers), it's a headset mic and it isn't muted. I reconfigured it, it didn't work.&nbsp;
<div>So i tried a new mic, this one didn't work too.</div>
<div>Can you give me an answer to what is happening and how to repair this?</div>

            <p>Thank you very much !!!</p>
<p>3&nbsp;questions for clarification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have received a recovery disc from Dell for my new laptop coming with Windows 10.&nbsp;I think if someday I need to reimage my laptop, I can use this disc to reinstall Windows 10. Is it right ?</p>
<p>2. I couldn't create a recovery disc from my new laptop, so I ran a system backup and stored it to an external hard drive. Is there a difference between the recovery disc and the system backup ?</p>
<p>3. I am planning to upgrade my old PC (Windows 7) to Windows 10. Once&nbsp;the upgrade is done, to Windows 10, and if I need to reimage my PC after 1 year (after the free upgrade period), can I do that ? and How ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

<li>There are lots of ways to re-install.&nbsp; Without doubt your hard disk will have a recovery partition which can be used to return your computer to its as-supplied (factory) state.&nbsp; You can use that unless your hard drive fails and has to be replaced.&nbsp; That
 will re-install Windows 10<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>and</strong></span> any software Dell bundled with your computer.&nbsp; Your recovery disc will probably do the same and could be used in the event of a hard drive failure.&nbsp; Or you can create
 recovery media as advised.</li><li>You can make a system backup at any time.&nbsp; It is an image of your system so will include any changes made since the computer was purchased.</li><li>With your Windows 7 machine, once upgraded you can use removable media and/or make a system backup exactly as with your other computer.&nbsp; But you cannot use any recovery partition or recovery disk as this would either fail or reset your computer back to
 Windows 7.</li></ol>

<h2>            Unable to install Windows 7&#33; Black screen &#40;w no mouse&#41;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>Hey everyone!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some background info:</div>
<div>I built my computer ~2 years ago and it worked fine for about half a year, until it crashed. Since then I've been unable to reinstall Windows and I kinda forgot about it... which sucks! So please help me get it up and running again :)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Motherboard: GigaByte Z68</div>
<div>Processor: Intel Core i3</div>
<div>HDD: Seagate Barucada 1TB (st31000524as)</div>
<div>OS: Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My problem:&nbsp;</div>
<div>When I boot from the windows cd (original), sometimes I get stuck at a black screen after "Windows is starting" or the black "loading files" screen. Sometimes it just takes a while but I eventually get to the install menu.</div>
<div>When I am about to chose my hdd, it says it can't install on it. I deleted all partitions, created a new one and formated it (took about 1 hour), still not able to install.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried booting from my GigaByte cd, and it went through some kind of install (not sure what it did, it was weird because it's actually made for backups). After I chose "reboot" I was able to install on my hdd again. But after I got to 100% i got stuck
 at the black screen again! I waited for a couple hours before I had to turn it off, so I'm back where I started. :/</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I always google stuff, and people said the black screen problems could be related to other drives/usb stuff connected to my pc. I only have 1 hdd and 1 usb for mouse/keyboard... I tried disconnecting it but it didnt work and also it doesnt make sense since
 I need to reconnect it to click on stuff anyway...</div>
<div>People also said I should try booting with F8 and choose "low res", didn't work either. Other people said "connect a secondary screen", I have a hdmi screen and a rgb screen, I tried all combinations of them and nothing seemed to work...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also have some confusion with the XHD/RAID/IDE/AHCI settings. I am only using one HDD, so I figured AHCI makes more sense for me - sine i have a SATA hdd and windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, when I load "Optimized System Defaults" from BIOS, it sets SATA mode to IDE...? When I reboot I get a warning screen that says the system is running in IDE mode and I should switch to AHCI for optimal performance.</div>
<div>How do I know if my system supports AHCI or not, what should I use?</div>
<div>Whenever I select IDE, and I enter Windows installation, it can't even find my hdd!</div>
<div>Only when I select AHCI it finds the hdd, but it won't let me install on it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been strugling for DAYS, so i REALLY appreciate help. :) Also, I've tried making "boot cds/usb", and I have no experience with linux so it's really frustrating. Please don't suggest going linux unless it's really necessary. :( I only have a Knoppix
 live CD, but I find the whole linux system so confusing I wasn't really able to do anything, despite several "guides" and youtube videos. I have a computer that's barely been used and a original windows CD, shouldn't I have all I need to repair my system?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sorry about the long post, I'll be eternally grateful if someone has any clues!</div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you have issues in regarding AHCI driver in the Computer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, I would like to know more on this information to help you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) What is exact installation error message&nbsp;that you get on the hard drive? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) What is the model number for the motherboard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile,&nbsp;I would advice you to follow the steps mentioned below to fix the issue.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Firstly, try to open the link and find the right motherboard number and install the drivers and see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/MicroSite/279/images/mb-z68-models.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.gigabyte.com/MicroSite/279/images/mb-z68-models.html</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Y<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ou can also&nbsp;try to load the ahci driver onto a usb drive and then try to install windows 7. Follow the steps mentioned below to do the same.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) When you install Vista or Win 7, setup can not find your Hard Drive.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><font color="#000000">b) Copy your <strong>SATA&nbsp;drivers</strong> to a disk. (Floppy, CD, USB)<br />
<b><font color="red">NOTE:</font></b> Keep this disk in a safe place, as it will be need to use in the Recovery Console.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">c)&nbsp; Click <strong>load drivers.</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">d)&nbsp; Click<strong> Cancel.</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">e)<strong> </strong>Click <strong>Browse.</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">f) Choose your Sata Controller. Click<strong> Ok.</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">g) Click<strong> Ok.</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">h)<strong> </strong>Click <strong>Unhide.</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">i) Choose your Sata Controller. Click<strong> Next.</strong></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">j) Continue with setup.</font></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see the Hard disk only when&nbsp;AHCI is enabled with the earlier installation of windows 7 or after installing windows 7 you must have enabled&nbsp;AHCI by installing it's drivers. So,now &nbsp;you&nbsp;will only be able to use AHCI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some operating systems, notably Windows Vista and Windows 7, do not configure themselves to load the AHCI driver upon boot if the SATA-drive controller was not in AHCI mode at the time of installation. This can cause failure to boot, with an error message,
 if the SATA controller is later switched to AHCI mode. For this reason, Intel recommends changing the drive controller to AHCI or RAID before installing an operating system. (It may also be necessary to load chipset-specific AHCI or RAID drivers — from a USB
 flash drive, for example — at installation time.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try&nbsp;to check the motherboard manufacturer website to get info if the mother board supports IDE/AHCI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;try&nbsp;to check with the hard drive manufacturer if, the&nbsp;HDD is working correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Otherwise, reply to this response and we will be happy to help you again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

    <title>Use Express Settings Loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skala17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use Express Settings Loop</h2>
                    <p>Recently I got a new computer from cyberpowerpc. Along with it, I got a windows 10 disk and I decided to put it into the computer and let it download. Ever since I've gotten this never ending loop where it asks for my country/language/timezone/etc. After
 that I choose my wifi and then it takes me to a page where the title is "Get going fast" and in order to procede I need to click "use express settings" and once I click that it, I get a circle that says "just a moment" and my computer restarts and I start
 the loop all over again. If you know a solution, please help. Thank you.</p>

    <title>Mouse without borders Not allowing to choose network interface - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse without borders Not allowing to choose network interface</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I just updated to <strong>Mouse without borders 2.1.8.0105</strong> and it stopped working. I think that it happened because normally it does not work with default settings, I need to choose the proper network interface and check the TCP checkbox.
 The problem is that these options are not there anymore, now in the "Machine Setup" tab there is only Shared encryption key and Computer Matrix menus,
<strong>no option to choose the proper network interface, no checkbox with TCP option.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a change in this version? What is the reason behind that? Is there anyway to make that option back? I am connecting in 2 different networks, but before it was working properly, I updated because from time to time it was returning an error with the
 "null reference" issue, but even with the error it was actually working.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Any way to make this version work?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi and thanks for answering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I installed 2.1.8.0105 in both machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried till the moment is following the setup wizard, setting the IP Mappings of both machines, tested with "same subnet only" option and also with "validate remote machine IP address" but all of them (but the wizard which never worked) result
 in the same: it connects, it works but it gets timeout each ~5 seconds, then it works again and then again timeout, it is unusable like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my point is that this was happening also before, but then I could change the network in the "Bind to Network" and everything would be fine. Problem is that the option "Bind to network" is not there anymore, so is there any other way to set this up? Or
 am I missing something maybe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<h3> kirsten..........................  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Virus protection is turned off&#34; notification keeps showing up after recent update installation on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows keeps telling me my security is turned off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep getting a notification saying my virus protection (windows defender and Webroot) is turned off, but when I go into my security settings to check, they're all listed as being on. All of my security features are checked as being on. I've run multiple
 virus scans and don't believe a virus is causing the issue -- I'm pretty sure this only started happening after one of the more recent Windows 10 updates. Is there any way to fix this, or should I just wait and see if it resolves itself?</p>

            <p><span>Hello Kristen,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From the above description, I understand you are getting the notification “virus protection is turned off” on your screen even though the security software settings are on.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Do you have 2 anti-virus security software installed on the PC?</li><li>What is the exact&nbsp;notification displayed on the screen?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to the conflict between the anti-virus security software installed on the computer.
</span><span>When two anti-virus security software is installed, <strong>Windows Defender</strong> will automatically get disabled.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> You might be facing this issue due to the improper installation of the anti-virus software. I suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the anti-virus software and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>

 as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If the issue persists, boot the computer in

<h3> bruceant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10 because of Incompatible Display even when replaced with new graphics card</h2>
                    <p>In an attempt to fix an incompatible display (integrated Nvidia GeForce 6150SE nForce 430 on a HP Pavilion a6200n, AMD Athlon duel core) preventing a Windows 10 upgrade and since there is no driver update, I installed a new graphics card Nvidia GeForce GT
 730 into a PCI-e slot. The incompatible display was disabled and only the new GT 730 is displayed in the Device Manager.
</p>
<p>Why do I still show the incompatible and disabled display in the Get Windows 10 upgrade instead of the newly installed graphics card?

Downloading the ISO from this site worked for me: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10. No errors; smooth installation.

<h2>            Xbox One BC constantly disconnects from Xbox Live</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to play multiplayer games with friends using BC, but Live keeps on disconnecting so frequently that it's starting to not even be worth the trouble. There are 3 games that I'm currently playing BC: Bioshock 2, Gears of War, and Super Meat Boy. For SMB, Live doesn't matter, but for the other 2 it does. I can assure you it's not my internet as the One's connection is unaffected, while&nbsp;the emulator's connection is interrupted.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is a more recent issue as I remember playing Gears of War&nbsp;about a year or two ago and experiencing no issues, but this has been persisting for months now. I have tried reinstalling as another thread suggest, but it didn't help. In fact, now it seems worse.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 hotspot not sharing internet after Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the anniversay update, I was able to share my Internet via the wifi (use the laptop as hotspot) no problem via the netsh command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the aniversary update, I can create the hotspot via the graphic tool, the devices(an iPhone and an Android Tablet)&nbsp;connect to the new wifi hotspot, and get IP address. But they are unable to browse the internet or connect to any app that uses internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to still do the internet sharing via the command line, it also does not work anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled drivres for both the Ethernet and Wireless, disabled firewall, and still no internet sharing.</p>

<h2>            Cannot scan from HP G85 Officejet.  Printer detected but not scanner.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have an HP G85 Officejet all-in-one.&nbsp; HP does not offer any drivers or software downloads with Windows 7 support.&nbsp; They recommend just plugging in the printer, letting Windows 7 recognize it, and WIA drivers will be installed for basic functions.&nbsp; They suggest
 scanning from Paint or Windows Fax and Scan.&nbsp; However, when I try either, it says no scanner is connected.&nbsp; The G85 is recognized as a printer and prints just fine.&nbsp; Is there something I need to do to get Windows to detect the scanner as well?&nbsp; Is it possible
 the WIA scanner driver did not get installed?&nbsp; I have tried unplugging and plugging back in, but still only the printer is detected.&nbsp; Thanks for any help.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 flickers into a white screen as soon as I get the welcome, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abue19  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 flickers into a white screen as soon as I get the welcome, login screen. Multiple boots are needed to get past this.</h2>
                    <p>This started happening after October 27. &nbsp;Last week I decided to reformat but i couldn't handle it anymore. &nbsp;Up until tonight, 7 days later... It started happening again.</p>
<p>I'll describe a little what's happening. &nbsp;The computer once logged in and running is perfectly stable, no problems at all. &nbsp;However, if I restart, not always, but sometimes as soon as the welcome screen is about to pop up, a white screen shows up and then
 a glimpse of the login screen shows, then it goes back to the white screen.</p>
<p>If by any chance, this does not occur, there's a more rarer occurence that could occur. &nbsp;This involves once being logged in, instead of a white screen flicker the screen will go black for a second, then back to normal. &nbsp;The mouse feels laggy, if I open any
 window and drag it around it might stutter alot while moving. The black screen flickering will continue regardless. &nbsp;Prior to reformatting, I had the same issue, however, it was worse because when the black screen flickers happened it would log me off and
 throw me back to the welcome screen over and over after logging back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not found any fix on this issue. My only chance of getting a working pc again is turning the computer off and hoping that the next restart will fix it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer specs are</p>
<p>AMD FX8350</p>
<p>16GB Corsair Vengeance&nbsp;</p>
<p>AMD 390X Visiontek</p>
<p>And an XFX 850W PSU</p>
<p>I've tried Crimson 11.5 drivers, 11.9.2 and 11.6 with windows installed. No differences yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than that, the system is installed on a Samsung EVO 256GB SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm 100% sure this is not hardware related since when the computer logs into a stable windows, it stays stable for days, 0 issues. But in the mishap that I have to reboot for whatever reason, this has a chance of occuring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first week of reformatting was fantastic, no problems, any restarts didnt cause any issues. &nbsp;The only update that installed itself last night, and I have already removed was&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">KB3200970
 . It doesn't seem removing it did much though.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>at this point I really don't know what to do, I've only found a few people with this problem. &nbsp;I've wasted tons of times trying to figure this out when I'm supposed to be writing my thesis, but alas I have a computer I can't use. &nbsp;Is there &nbsp;a way I could
 just downgrade to windows 8.1 again? I never had a single issue with that OS. &nbsp;Granted, Windows 10 has been working perfectly well for a whole year, until whatever started happening with these last few months of updates.</p>

            <p>I did a clean install last week after this started happening with full force. &nbsp;10 reboots didn't do anything then. &nbsp;I had the computer running perfectly fine until last night, which is when that KBxx970 hit. &nbsp;So far, all i've done is remove the graphics
 drivers in safe mode, did the DDU and reinstalled graphics. &nbsp;For now I've been able to log in to windows, but it's only been 2 reboots, I need more testing to see this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft can't possibly expect us to do a clean install or all these crazy procedures everytime an update gets pushed that fiddles with graphics or whatever it is causing this. &nbsp;People don't have time for that.</p>

            <p>I haven't tried a clean boot. &nbsp;I did a clean format, in other words, the problem was gone after the format, the point it is 100% an update that is causing it, which update, I do not know. &nbsp;I will try a clean boot if I end up reproducing the problem in the
 next few days again. So far I think running DDU to remove graphics drivers in safe mode has worked out. &nbsp;But i can't be certain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep you posted if it starts happening again, I've already disabled windows update at this point to avoid any further variables to be added to the issue.</p>

</p><p>The only way I've seen to fix this, or at least a work around is pulling the plug on the computer and rebooting. &nbsp;Otherwise, nothing else works.</p>

            <p>Well, I went to a meeting, came back, there was a power flicker due to a snow storm.&nbsp; Needless to say, I power cycled, 10 times, about 15 reboots and I could not get past the white screen flicker crap anymore.&nbsp; I decided to reformat once again, I reinstalled
 10, probably my last time I do this before I nag microsoft for a downgrade to 8.1 since I can't be wasting tens of hours dealing with a faulty operating system.&nbsp;

<p>Just an update on this issue. &nbsp;Somehow this issue fixed itself, since then I've gotten a new PSU and I thought this may have been the culprit. Regardless, it's been months since I've got that issue. &nbsp;However, 3 nights ago I had a power outtage while I was
 playing. &nbsp;Once the power came back on, the issue reappeared, the whole spiel white screen flickring on the welcome login screen for Windows 10. &nbsp;I decided to reinstall GPU drivers smelling corruption... When I did and I restarted, the problem kicked back into
 full force. &nbsp;I managed to eventually get into a working windows environment after 4 reboots or so and fully power cycling. &nbsp;So the problem is occuring right now with base windows gpu drivers, it's nonsense. If I load into UBUNTU right now I have 0 issues,
 everything works fine, repeatedly. &nbsp;But in Windows 10, the issue is reoccurring and after a few reboots I can repeat it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm speechless at this point, not sure what else to do, I'm beggining to think Windows 10 just does not like 390x cards and I'm thinking of just selling this one and switching to an NVIDIA card once the prices go down or something. Or wait for the new VEGA
 cards.</p>

<h2>            Cannot access safe mode. Password is not accepted. Tried everything and not getting an answer.</h2>
                    <p>I asked the question here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/question-about-password-in-safe-mode/aad5729e-4655-46a9-9bdd-e3608d615aab</p>
<p>but I am not getting any responses so here is is again:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is identical to this:</p>
<p>Likhitha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the the email address does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to log on to Windows 10 Safe Mode with Networking. It will not accept my password. I have used the on screen keyboard. I have changed the email of my Microsoft account. I have used the password that I set when setting up the user account
 after upgrading to Win 10. I have used the password that I used to log in to my Microsoft account previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, Safe Mode with Networking indicates that there are no network connections available when I click on the network icon at the bottom right of the screen. This despite the fact that my machine is wired to my router with an active internet connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is was a clean install of Windows 10 64 bit to a desktop computer. I continued using the user account that I had been using in Windows 8.1. I have not had any log in issues until trying to use Safe Mode. I do have a PIN set up for this user account,
 but I understand that Safe Mod requires the password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am am trying to get in to safe mode to correct another error with Win 10. It is frustrating to have to find a solution to a problem so that I can implement the recommend solutions to another problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here it is:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am having this exact issue. I need to get into safe mode but I cannot because it will not accept my password. I am using the MSN account password. I used another computer to change it so I do know what
 it is, and that it is working. I am on another computer with internet access. I have this in front of me and I have tried everything that you suggest but nothing works. I tried safe mode both with and without internet access but my password just doesn't work.
 I tried the on screen keyboard. Your method of rebooting from safe mode doesn't work either. Safe mode with internet shows no connection just as described above. Please tell me . ..how can I get into safe mode?&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>I change my password all the time. As you can see by reading my problem . . . I changed it just prior to my first (unanswered) post so that I could be certain that I was inputting the correct password and user account. As far as setting up a new account
 . . . why would this help? I am the only user and I am the administrator. I don't understand why it is so hard to get into safe mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think this will work . . . I will try it but it makes no sense to me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 &#34;run as administrator&#34; does nothing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>This looks similar to a problem a number of people are having but mine occurred after I in-place upgraded from Windows 8.0 Pro to 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>When I'm logged in as a non-admin user, and attempt a "run as administrator" operation on about anything (including the Win+X menu entry), I am prompted for the administrator account's password, and then...</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Nothing happens!</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Any clue?</p>
<p><strong><br />

<p>I found a solution on dell forums, and it worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>uninstall these 3 components</p>
<p>1. Intell Rapid Storage driver</p>
<p>2. Intel Management Engine</p>
<p>3. Intel Security Agent</p>
<p>
</p><p>after I removed those, everything seems fine now. No battery drain, no resume from sleep problems.</p>

            Hi,
<div>1. When exactly you get this error code?</div>
<div>2. What is the exact and complete error message?</div>
<div>3. Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>I would suggest you to boot the computer to Safe Mode with Networking and check if the issue occurs.
<div><strong>Step 1: Boot the computer to Safe Mode with Networking.</strong></div>
<div>a) <strong>Restart </strong>the computer if it is powered on.<br />
b) <strong>Tap the F8 </strong>key after the computer <strong>initially powers on.<br />
</strong>c) Once you see <strong>Advanced Boot Options </strong>menu you can stop tapping.<br />
d) Use the <strong>up/down arrow keys </strong>to <strong>highlight your selection.<br />
</strong>e) Select ‘<strong>Safe Mode with Networking’ </strong>and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.<br />
f) <strong>Logon to your computer </strong>using an account with <strong>Administrator privileges</strong>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Refer to the link: A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222</a><br />
<div>If the issue does not occur in Safe Mode with Networking the put the computer in clean boot.<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Step 2: Put the computer in clean boot.</strong></div>
<div><br />
By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />

<div><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state” in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.<br />

<p>Original title: <strong><span>Personal folder wont open from desktop or start menu.</span></strong></p>
<p>When I try to open my personal folder from the start menu, nothing happens. If I use the desktop icon, nothing happens. This use to work, but I don't know when it broke. I just noticed it after being on vacation for a week.</p>
<p>I can still navigate to my personal foders but starting with the computer icon. I can also place a shortcut to my folders on the desktop. I also note that the folder icon has a lock on it. None of the other folders under C:Users has this lock icon.&nbsp;Regardless
 of the icon, I can access all my files.</p>

<div>Hi svpainchaud,</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may be referring to your user account folder that shows a lock icon over it.<br />
<br />
That is designed by default so as to say that you are the exclusive owner of your account and you would not have given any permission to other users.<br />
<br />
Lock is related to the group "Users" in the security settings of the particular folder. The meaning of the padlock seems to be "No access to (general) Users".<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are referring to a personal folder created by you and has a lock over it, then probably it's some third party software (folder lock, if installed to avoid unauthorized access)</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>However, you may follow these steps and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Log in as <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/How-do-I-log-on-as-an-administrator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
administrator</a> and try to access the folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div><br />
You may take ownership of the file (or folder) you want to open/view and check if you can accomplish the same.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>To take ownership of a file or folder,</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Right-click the file or folder, click Properties, and then click the Security tab.</div>
<div><br />
b. Click Advanced, and then click the Owner tab.</div>
<div><br />
c. Click Edit, and then do one of the following:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>• To change the owner to a user or group that is not listed, click Other users and groups and, in Enter the object name to select (examples), type the name of the user or group, and then click OK.<br />
• To change the owner to a user or group that is listed, in the Change owner to box, click the new owner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>d. (Optional) To change the owner of all subcontainers and objects within the tree, select the Replace owner on subcontainers and objects check box.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Access the link below for more information: Try accessing the folder in safe mode and check if your able to access.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Take Ownership of a File or Folder<br />
</strong><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753659.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753659.aspx</strong></a></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>Try accessing the folder in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a> and check if your able to access.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 4:<br />
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you have a third party "folder lock" software installed, you may&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">uninstall</a> it if you do not wish to keep it.</div>

<p>I guess I did not make myself clear. I can access all my files. I have checked the ownership and it is ok.&nbsp;I will explain again.</p>
<p>When the start menu is opened there is a list on the right side of standard items to access. The top item is my name. If I place my mouse over that item I see the tooltip "Open your personal folder". If I then left-click on that item, nothing happens. The
 menu item also has an equivalent desktop icon that serves the same purpose. It also does not work.</p>
<p>1). I see this problem with my normal user account.</p>
<p>2.) I see this problem with my admin account.</p>
<p>3.) I see this problem on a coworkers new install of Windows 7 this morning.</p>
<p>I first noticed this problem this Monday after being on vacation for a week. The "Open your personal folder" menu choice use to work. My first suspect would be a Microsoft update that occured during that week I was gone, but&nbsp;all I am seeing is a security
 update on 8/5</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Have you tried creating a new user account?</div>

If not, I'd suggest you create a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>new user account</span></a> and check if the issue persists. You probably have a corrupted user account.<br />

<p>Just for amusement I created a new account, and it has the exact same problems. This is not surprising since:</p>
<p>1). I see this problem with my normal user account.</p>
<p>2.) I see this problem with my admin account.</p>
<p>3.) I see this problem on a coworkers new install of Windows 7 this morning.</p>
<p>4.) Many other people have had this same problem which seems to correlate with Microsoft updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem is probably related to the fact that I get an error message when I try to rename a folder. This is another common problem that many people have posted on in these forums.</p>

<p>I was premature in saying the problem is solved. Unfortunately, even with an admin account, I can not turn off automatic updates. There must be a group policy at a corporate level that I cant affect. I was very careful not to shut down the computer, but
 somehow the Microsoft Updates got installed again. So The problems have returned.</p>
<p>1) I can't open my personal folders from the account name on the start menu.</p>
<p>2) I can't open my personal folders from the persoanl folder icon on the desktop.</p>
<p>3.) I own the files, and can get to my folders via shortcuts.</p>
<p>4.) When I try to create a new folder (or rename an old folder) I get an error message: "Could not find this item. This is no longer located in xxx...".&nbsp;&nbsp; If I hit the "Try Again" button the rename goes through.</p>
<p>5.). I see this problem with my normal user account, and my admin account.</p>
<p>6.) I see this problem on a coworkers new install of Windows 7.</p>
<p>7.) This problem is caused by one off the first two August updates from Microsoft.</p>
<p>8.) I suspect there are registry errors caused by the updates. I need to know how to fix them.</p>
<p>Why would you congratulate me on solving my problem by removing updates? That is ridiculus. When I said I would need to turn off updates, that was a red flag, something is wrong with the updates.</p>
<p>Please, does Microsoft have an A team for resolving bugs caused by updates?</p>

            This is rather amusing to me as i'm looking to actually cause this to happen not remove the problem. i'll throw my 2 cents in. i'd say you are correct in thinking it is a policy something to do with redirected data. try runing gpresult /R from a command
 prompt to give you an idea of what policys are applied then talk to an network admin above you. in all likelyhood hes set this for the same reason i'm trying to set it and will tell you that you can not have that function. ( the reason is because users save
 data in the wrong place ) i hope my 2 cents helped.
