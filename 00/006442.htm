<h2>            Communicator 9210 Fax problems</h2>
                    I'm interested if anyone has experienced problems with receiving faxes from a Communicator 9210. I can send faxes to it from my fax machine, but from one user, all I receive is the message on screen saying receiving fax. No fax is received and there is
 no entry in the transmission log to indicate that the fax has failed. This occurs every time from this user, but all other incoming faxes are received OK. Does anyone have any suggestions please?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Jonathan Coulby.

            I used fax on it and on new 9500 - neverhad the problem - if it's from one particular person it could be that he / you have some strange non compatable fax formats.<br />
<br />
I do recall hearing that there are a number of different fax standards - sounds like it's more his end than yours though<br />

            Hmm.<br />
Both the 9210 and 9500 (which I have now) handle incoming faxes with the standard and fine settings.<br />
You cannot receive faxes with the super fine or photo settings or colour faxes.<br />
<br />
Also when receiving faxes both the 9110 and 9210 needs a separate incoming fax number, whereas with the 9300/9500 it depends on the SIM card.<br />
<br />
It appears that Firmware 5.22 you can receive faxes using your normal mobile number but with earlier firmware it seems you need a seperate number.

            no, its not that the firmware controls this - the networks started offering a fax/data/voice service all on the same number as soon as the 9500 came out.<br />
<br />
some people still have a voice/fax and data number on their sim with a 9500.

<p>

</p><p>Estimated time of battery is 16 hours 14 minutes energy saver not turned on. Fontana runs in the background too.

<p>If you use speech with Cortana she replies with speech.</p>
<p>If you ask silently by typing a search she replies silently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer I get for your Stan Lee birthday question,&nbsp;using speech,&nbsp; the date of his birth, spoken. The screen&nbsp;reads 'this is what I found for you'&nbsp; with the date of birth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get your answer you would have to say 'how old is Stan Lee'</p>

    <title>Unable to access Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petehx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to access Microsoft Account</h2>
                    I've got an old Hotmail account that I've been unable to access for the past hour. It was fine before then but not anymore.<br />
<br />
I get the "It looks like someone else might be using your account" message.<br />
<br />
Okay, so I ask for a notification code but none ever arrives and the last two digits of the phone number aren't the same as mine.<br />
<br />
So I chose a call and that didn't happen.<br />
<br />
So I chose the third option, entered my gmail account and then got through to a form asking for far more personal details that I am happy to part with given the suspicious activity of my Hotmail account suddenly clamming up. I have no idea if this form is real
 or some phishing website that I have been tricked into landing on.<br />
<br />
I'm hopeful that I'll get a message in my gmail account that will help but there was no confirmation on the verification process that my alternative e-mail address has been processed.<br />
<br />
My real question is to ask what I can do if I don't get any e-mail message? I could complete the verification form but how am I meant to know the titles of any sent mails if I can't access my account? And why should I be giving credit card numbers when Hotmail/Outlook
 have never been notified of them in the first place? Is this an outlook- wide hack or am I just unlucky?<br />
<br />
I'll just have to wait and see but any help, advice or reassurance would be gratefully received!<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />
Pete<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>There are many ways you can do this by setting Visible property (Form_frmSwitch.Visible=True /False).</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Add your custom button to the Ribbon to Show-Hide your form</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Add code to the buttons Click event to hide the form (you need to find the way to show it again)</p>
<p>3. Add code to other forms in Open and Close events</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">Word 16.9.1 running on a MacBook Pro 10.13.1 High Sierra cannot print and cannot safe to pdf. The print menu does not come up, not from pressing 'print' from the File menu, by apple-P, or pressing the print symbol in the top menu

            1. Is Adobe Acrobat installed on your computer? You can try to update that. 
<br />
<br />2. I can suggest you one solution. Mac offers the facility to upgrade or downgrade individual Office products. Unlike Windows where you need to upgrade entire package, in Mac you can choose to upgrade / downgrade individual products.
<br />
<br />The individual packages are listed at <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-history-for-Office-2016-for-Mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7#bkmk_current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update...</a>

<h2>            Error installing Skype for Business with ODT</h2>
                    
<p>i am trying to figure out how to install skype for business basic 2016 for 200+ users. i understand that i will need to use odt because we do not have sccm.</p>
<p>i run this in an administrator command prompt:</p>
<p><span>\\domain.local\it\software\microsoft\odt\setup.exe /download configuration.xml</span></p>
<p>and this is my configuration.xml file:</p>
<p><span>&lt;configuration&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &lt;add sourcepath="\\domain.local\it\software\microsoft\skype" officeclientedition="32" channel="current"&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &lt;add sourcepath="\\domain.local\it\software\microsoft\skype" officeclientedition="32" channel="current"&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;product id="skypeforbusinessentryretail"&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;product id="skypeforbusinessentryretail"&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;language id="en-us" /&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;language id="en-us" /&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/product&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/product&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &lt;/add&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &lt;/add&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &lt;updates enabled="true" channel="current" /&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &lt;updates enabled="true" channel="current" /&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &lt;display level="none" accepteula="true" /&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &lt;display level="none" accepteula="true" /&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &lt;!--&nbsp; &lt;property name="autoactivate" value="1" /&gt;&nbsp; --&gt;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &lt;!--&nbsp; &lt;property name="autoactivate" value="1" /&gt;&nbsp; --&gt;</span><br />
<span>&lt;/configuration&gt;</span></p>
<span>&lt;/configuration&gt;</span></p>
<p>which ultimately results in this error:<br />
error code: 30029-1007 (0)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a4592ee-9d75-4a9a-953f-85ff2f525fd4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a4592ee-9d75-4a9a-953f-85ff2f525fd4" /></a></p>

<p>i understand that using the /download switch is supposed to download all of the skype source files to "\\domain.local\it\software\microsoft\skype"</p>
<p>but once these files are downloaded once, do i run this same command on the other 199 computers?</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<p>hi acura,</p>
<p>in regard to your issues and questions:<br />
1. about the error message you met, i have also done a test with your configuration xml file and encountered the same error. after some modification, i can download and install it successfully as below:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=01788203-e20f-4908-bb98-760f8cf921ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d01788203-e20f-4908-bb98-760f8cf921ff" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; given this situation, could you add the source path in the modified xml file and run again to check the outcome?</p>
<p>2. after the skype resource is downloaded, you could consider using group policy or network installation point deploy the client to all the users. below are the related articles for your reference:<br />

    <title>Apostrophes and quotation marks changing font - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bethanysimonsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Apostrophes and quotation marks changing font</h2>
                    <p>I'm writing in Times New Roman, and whenever I type an apostrophe or quotation mark my font automatically switches to Courier, just for the symbol, and then back to TNR.</p>
<p>If I hit ctrl+z after typing the apostrophe it will change it from Courier to TNR, but to a straight one, not the standard curved one. I have the autoformatting enabled to change straight quotes to smart quotes; I've turned it off and on again, and it won't
 change the straight quotes to curly ones.</p>
<p>If I highlight the entire word and use the font dialogue box to set it to TNR, it fixes the situation.</p>
<p>I have already checked that my keyboard language input is set to US English.</p>
<p>When I go to the Symbols dialogue box, curly quotes aren't an option there either, only straight ones.</p>
<p>And yes, I've also checked for updates and rebooted the program and all that good stuff. It's been going on for a few months now.</p>
<p>I know I can work around it by doing a Find/Replace, but I'm an author and editor and it's driving me nuts. When you're proofing 400+ page documents, it's time consuming. I've also seen it happen to a few other authors I've edited for lately, but not everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone please tell me you know how to fix this!</p>

            Note, there are two places the check the box for "Straight quotes" with "smart quotes". &nbsp;One on the AutoFormat As You Type tab of the AutoCorrect dialog and the other on the AutoFormat tab of the same dialog. &nbsp;I am not sure why they are both there, but
 I believe that it is the former one that you need to have checked.

            Thanks, I just double checked, and both those boxes are checked. And what's even stranger is it doesn't happen throughout the whole document. The style selection isn't changing, or any other setting that I can see. Word just sometimes seems to forget how
 to do a TNR apostrophe and inserts a Courier one instead.

            It sounds to me as if the font applied at the insertion point is not TNR (since applying TNR corrects the situation); perhaps it is another roman font that doesn't contain the required characters, or a damaged version of TNR. In any case, I think the font
 at the insertion point is the place to start your investigation.

            Since you can apply TNR, and this corrects the problem, I suspect it isn't damaged, but, if it is, the easiest solution would be to copy a known-good copy from another computer.

Please advise on </p>

<h2>            Desktop application doesnt display incoming calls</h2>
                    <p>So...something happened the other night and I in inadvertently updated my Skype software. And today i noticed that inbound calls to my Skype phone number do not actually reach my desktop application. It does however ring through to my android device. This
 doesnt change if I log out on my Android device...I still don't get the call on my desktop application (which at this point is worthless).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 Home version 1709 (build 16299.192). and Skype Version 12.13.257.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>Thanks for the response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am signed in to the right account. I verified that the call history was the same on both devices.</p>

    <title>Lumia 950 XL - usb-c charging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark hr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 XL - usb-c charging</h2>
                    <p>How closely does MS stick to the standard (up to 100w universal charging)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is, is universal usb-c charging possible with the Lumia 950 XL?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will plugging in a more powerful charger, for example, a&nbsp;60w usb-c laptop&nbsp;charger, destroy the phone or will it work,&nbsp;charging the phone much&nbsp;more quickly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a 60w (at 5V 3A and&nbsp;12V 3A and&nbsp;20V 3A)&nbsp;usb-c charger available from a certain search engine's store&nbsp;(g.e p.y) that I'm hoping will work and,&nbsp;*if* Microsoft has used the&nbsp;standard in the 950xl, will be slightly faster charging than the boxed charger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 60w charger&nbsp;also&nbsp;has a 3.5m total cable&nbsp;length so is good for limited socket/work space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;edit:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's now a charger on the en-gb Microsoft store accessories page labelled as "Microsoft USB-C Fast Charger AC-100" (specifically for the 950/950xl) that I've just noticed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the naming conventions already used could this be a 100w usb-c&nbsp;charger?&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further advice regarding faster charging (any that attended the PR event?)&nbsp;would be welcome.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            You can take a hint from the following line,
<div><br />
<div>Range("B1:B" &amp; lr).Formula = "=A1*2"</div>
<div><br />
<div>This dynamically creates a formula in column B from the first row to the row specified by the variable&nbsp;<i>lr</i>&nbsp;, adjusting the row number to suit. This tells us that we can use the same behavior to create a dynamic formula across columns B through E
 with,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Range("B" &amp; lr + 1 &amp; ":E" &amp; lr + 1).Formula = "=SUM(B1:B" &amp; lr &amp; ")"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;... or,</div>
<div>Range("B" &amp; lr + 1).Resize(1, 4).Formula = "=SUM(B1:B" &amp; lr &amp; ")"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;... or in <i>R1C1</i>&nbsp;terms,</div>
<div>
<div>Range("B" &amp; lr + 1).Resize(1, 4).FormulaR1C1 = "=SUM(R1C:R" &amp; lr &amp; "C)"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Some of your formatting code ignores the fact that is is within a <i>With ... End With</i>, and non-recorded code should avoid the use of
<i>.Select</i>&nbsp;to get its point across. Here is my version of the cleaned up procedure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub Test()</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim lr As Long</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; lr = Range("A" &amp; Cells.Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Range("B1:B" &amp; lr).Formula = "=A1*2"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Range("A" &amp; lr + 1).Value = " Total :"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Range("B" &amp; lr + 1).Resize(1, 4).Formula = "=SUM(B1:B" &amp; lr &amp; ")"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; With Range("A" &amp; lr + 1).Resize(1, 5)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Font.Color = 65535</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Font.Bold = True</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Interior.Color = -16677886</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Borders.Weight = xlThin</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Borders(xlInsideVertical).LineStyle = xlNone</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Borders(xlInsideHorizontal).LineStyle = xlNone</div>
<div><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; End With</span></div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>In an effort to put my money where my mouth (or <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a05bdd23-6c19-4f50-9b4a-3c6ae7d72590">
profile page idiom</a>) is, there is no reason to keep using <i>With ... WEnd with</i>&nbsp;unless you are saving more code lines than you create unless you are getting paid for each line of code you write. If you were assigning multiple border attributes, the
<i>With ... End With</i>&nbsp;might be valid, but I don't see that here.</div>

<p>Solved the problem.</p>
<p>Seems 4 copies of Office 365 were installed today. Colleague states not by him. Default program was set to Office 2016 and he had German, Italian, Dutch and French versions on the PC. hence the German error message.</p>

<h2>            Excel solver issue</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi can share with me how to fix this for excel solver? First problem there isnt the option to drag and select boxes from table for the objective, constraints and the variable cells, which my other friends( including those with mac have) Secondly, when i
 manually input the values which i have done carefully, and when i press solve, nothing appears which i have checked should not be the case. Hope someone can tell me what to do instead of redownloading office(can i just redownload excel?) on my mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S my What if analysis has the option to select part of table(usually at right of white box) to use but not this add-on. So far everything else on my excel is alright. I do not know why it applies to solver only</p>

            Hi Leonard,<br />
<br />
About this issue, there should be a button at the right of the box just as you described. Please make sure your Excel for Mac is up to date.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Check-for-Office-for-Mac-updates-automatically-bfd1e497-c24d-4754-92ab-910a4074d7c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check for Office for Mac updates automatically</a><br />
<br />
Besides, you can try to unload and load the Solver Add-in again.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10. uninstalled apps</h2>
                    A couple of months ago I downloaded Windows 10 I don't use my computer a great deal for typing letters etc and it was only after the 30 day period to uninstall Windows 10 that I realised that I had had about&nbsp;30 Apps removed from my PC, including Microsoft
 office.&nbsp; I have an Icon in the top lefthand corner.&nbsp; If I click on this I can view all the apps but there is no option to reinstall them.&nbsp; Has anyone got any ideas as to how I resolve this problem please?

            <p>I hope Doug is right, but I strongly suspect he is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the Win 10 upgrade process, if it decides that a program is not "compatible" with Win10 for any reason the application will not be migrated to Win 10 and an entry will be placed in that list Heather is looking at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Officially Office 2010 is supported on Win 10, but sometimes the upgrade process has a brain fart and does not think so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your first option is to back out of the "upgrade". But as you noted, that is no longer an option because you have gone past the 30 day time limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, the only remaining option is to re-install all of those applications. To re-install Office 2010 you need the 25 character Product key.&nbsp; How did you buy Office 2010?&nbsp; In the Boxed CD (look inside the box for a sticker with the key), Factory installed
 and activated (you are out of luck) or online download?</p>

            <p>Heather said she "downloaded" Win 10 and she mentioned the 30 trial period.&nbsp; Those 2 items describe the Windows 10 "upgrade" process.&nbsp; The upgrade process specifically does not "migrate" (although it is not an "uninstall" the effect is the same) applications
 it deems are "not compatible" with Win 10. <br />
</p>
<p>The features you are talking about are for "restoring" or "resetting" or "recovering" Windows 10 to a previous known good state.&nbsp; This is different from upgrading from Win 7 or 8 which is what I understand Heather was talking about. .

            That was my point: for me to lose installed programs, I have to do a "reset." Upgrading won't remove 30 programs. Perhaps a few, very old ones will be uninstalled, but Microsoft Office wouldn't be one of them.

            <p>You are right, when it works correctly the upgrade does not lose Office 2010.&nbsp; But if you read through the forum, there have been many people reporting exactly the same problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, if you do any kind of refresh/restore, AFIK Win does not generate a list of programs "lost" during the refresh/reset etc.

            <p>If, for some reason, you need to do a "reset," Windows will generate a list of programs that were uninstalled in the process. I know that from experience, because I had to reset Windows 10 after Windows Update stopped working and the fixes in Knowledge Base
 articles all failed.</p>

            <p>In that case you have been lucky.&nbsp; Back in Win 3 days it was a fairly typical process to have to "refresh" Windows installations every 6-12 months.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the built in Win 10 "refresh" / "reset" features are "nice" they appear to be blunt tools.&nbsp; I really liked the Win 8 "refresh" when it was used in combination with "recimage" (the tool that created new "image files" that captured "desktop" application
 installations).&nbsp; The recimage function has been lost in Win 10 &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I prefer making periodic full "image copy" backups of my system to an external drive.&nbsp; Unlike the built in tools, using image copies takes you back to a known good point in time so it reduces the number of applications you have to re-install
 and the number of updates you have to re-apply. </p>

    <title>Windows Defender compared with MS Safety Scanner Compared with Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Defender compared with MS Safety Scanner Compared with Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I wonder if I could have a bit of advice as to what if any the above tools have over one another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly,&nbsp; it sounds like MS Safety Scanner would "cover all" by it's description however it uses the same Definitions as&nbsp;Windows Defender so what is the advantages of Safety Scanner to exist in addition to running Defender "on demand".&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there more aggressive
 programming in Safety Scanner ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Added to my question is the fact that Windows Defender has "Cloud based protection" &amp; "Automatic Sampling" which Safety Scanner hasn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So would just like to know what the advantages are of one over the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, is a comparison with Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The description says :&nbsp; removes the most prevalent threats</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Safety Scanner the description says : </p>
provides full, comprehensive on-demand antimalware scans. It offers robust offline scan and cleanup capabilities. However, it does not provide real-time and cloud-based protection available with Windows Defender Antivirus.
<p>Safety Scanner covers both prevalent and less notable threats. It is recommended as a more robust alternative to MSRT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On that description why use MSRT at all ?&nbsp;&nbsp; However how can Safety Scanner provide "Full, comprehensive on demand scans" &nbsp;when a full scan using MSRT&nbsp; (commandline /F:Y)&nbsp; scan in excess of 2,900,000 files
 whereas&nbsp; Safety Scanner only scans approx. 1,650,000&nbsp; files ??? in the same circumstances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Safety Scanner is scanner only and it contains removal for all malwares that have been detected by Microsoft Anti-Malware engine. Normally we use Safety Scanner when a system is infected and for whatever reason we are unable to install Anti-Virus
 software or Anti-Virus software is not working or there is non-Microsoft Anti-Malware there and we want to verify whether is there any virus which is being detected by Safety Scanner. MSRT has list of some of well known and dangerous malwares. The size of
 it is smaller compare to Safety Scanner, so if you want to rapidly check a system for malware or rescue it before install other Anti-Malware product , it is good tool, but it is not detecting all malwares and it is just good for a rapid malware removal to
 start other procedures to remove malware. For complete removal, it is better to use Safety Scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender has Safety Scanner engine and it is real-time protection and it supports Cloud-based scanning which is good for detecting unknown malwares. In general, if you are using Windows Defender, you don't need to run Safety Scanner or MSRT , you
 just need to update Windows Defender and run scan with it. Safety scanner is for systems which are using non-Microsoft Anti-Malware and you want to do a check with Microsoft Scanner without installing Microsoft Anti-Malware products. It is also good when you
 want to check a system with scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also Windows Defender Offline which build into Windows 10 but you may download it for Windows 7 and it performs deeper scan before system boot up:</p>

<p>Cyber stated all of this already, but I'm going to try and simplify this by explaining the primary purpose for each scanner to exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) was created many years ago to be automatically distributed once a month to all supported Windows systems via Windows Update, scanning only for the most common malware currently known to be attacking these
 devices.&nbsp; This smaller package downloads faster and detects and removes most malware, but since it's only usually updated once a month, it's not really valuable unless your system has a well known common infection, often due to the fact that the existing AV
 product either isn't working properly or is missing entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Safety Scanner was created later and contains the same detections that are currently being delivered to the full Microsoft AV based security products, but of course only performs scans on demand.&nbsp; This is the program that should be used by anyone trying
 to verify whether there's any significant malware infection, though it is still&nbsp;only aware of existing malware and doesn't attempt to detect via behavioral or other advanced techniques.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The complete AV security products like Windows Defender or MSE for Windows 7 obviously include these real-time, behavioral and cloud protections in addition to signature based AV detection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So MSRT isn't really useful unless it's for some reason not being properly "installed" monthly by Windows Update.&nbsp; Safety Scanner is the best tool for on demand scans for older systems, since it's easy to download and use and covers most of the current malware
 spectrum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Defender offline is more capable than Safety Scanner and can operate outside the normal operating system in order to detect items using rootkit or other techniques to hide from built-in AV.&nbsp; However, it's also typically more difficult to use,
 though in theory the built-in version with Windows 10 should be easy.&nbsp; Unfortunately it's still possible that some malware might manage to damage the operation of Defender Offline or it won't run for some other reason, so it's still valuable to have other
 manual tools like Safety Scanner or even the&nbsp;manual download&nbsp;version of Windows Defender Offline available in case these are needed for a second opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess I didn't end up making it simpler, but I do hope I've made the purpose for each more clear.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you both for the above replies. It makes sense other than why does the MRT scan more files on a full scan (2,900,000) as against Defender or safety scanner (only 1,650,000).
</p>
<p>I do use the Offline scanner built into Windows 10 and agree on occasions does not run but I find that this is because somehow at the moment the request to run off line scanner that the "offline Scanner" folder gets deleted. Again I would like to see more
 files scanned in offline scanner (quick scan) than windows defender quick scan. (off line 113,000 files, as against 118,635 quick scan WD) .
</p>
<p>so for different reasons how does MRT decide which files to scan that seems to limit itself in Safety Scanner / Windows Defender ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>what does offline scanner use to decide which files to scan as it is doing it outside windows ? Especially as it is looking for files that are trying to hide or not known to present ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>I saw that in your initial post, but forgot about it when writing my response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually there are a number of possible reasons that these numbers might be different and without lots of experimentation or research I can't be certain of which apply in each case, but I'll list them so you can understand why they probably don't matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The large difference for the full scans&nbsp;is most likely due to the setting to scan archive files, which I'm not even certain still exits in Windows 10 Defender.&nbsp; Since the scan engines count the number of individual files opened, this number will inflate
 dramatically if the individual files contained within all zip, cab or other compressed files including iso packages are unpacked and scanned as well.&nbsp; The requirement to unpack these files during a scan&nbsp;is less important now that the real-time protection included
 in Windows 10 is so fast that it can scan them as they are opened instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another common reason for different scan counts within Windows Defender itself is that both it and Microsoft Security Essentials maintain a file scan cache in order to keep track of which files have already been scanned since the last system reboot.&nbsp; This
 is done to reduce the amount of repetitive scanning performed each time a new scan runs, since re-scanning files that haven't changed according to both their last modified file date and the information contained in the cache is obviously pointless.&nbsp; Of course,
 this should result in a smaller number of files being scanned after the first, at least until another system reboot requires that the cache be reset as well, since nothing can be guaranteed if the operating system and so Defender itself has stopped running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last difference that comes to mind is the function of the individual scanners themselves, since as you noted their purposes and function are different.&nbsp; The most important thing to remember is that any malware that's well known and operating&nbsp;will always
 be detected by a quick scan, since that's what this type of scan is defined to do.&nbsp; Full scans are designed to scan the entire set of disk and other mass storage devices for potential malware, whether it's operating or&nbsp;just sitting there in a zip or individual
 file waiting to be opened and launched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The number of items that each type of quick scan needs to look at varies, even between individual sessions close together, both because of the cache operation I already mentioned as well as things like what programs have been run recently and what temporary
 or other files may be open, created or deleted within the most recent session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other aspect of this is that since the purpose for an offline scan is to check for items that might be hidden, it focuses on a more limited set of startup and other areas than the more general Windows Defender scan that operates when Windows is fully
 running, which also inherently opens even more files and functions.&nbsp; For this reason, it's not surprising that this number is slightly smaller, since you'd expect additional items to exist or be opened once all of the Windows drivers, startups and other application
 functions are running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point here is that the number of items scanned in truth means basically nothing, since it only has meaning in the context of the version of Windows, specific hardware and drivers and other applications included in startup on that specific machine, with
 that specific configuration and at that one single moment in time.&nbsp; This is one of the most confusing things to consumers, since they believe there are a fixed set of rules and the&nbsp;reality is that a computer is a complex system of many overlapping rules and
 status, that at any give moment is performing millions of individual operations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in truth, the number of files scanned is simply a relative indication of the amount of work the scanner has performed and nothing more.&nbsp; It's value is only to the user viewing it in order to determine whether the scan is nearing completion&nbsp;based in&nbsp;the
 results of this count in previous sessions.&nbsp; In fact, Microsoft only added the display of these numbers after lots of complaints from "techie" type users who were used to having these displayed in other 3rd-party scanners in the past.&nbsp; Microsoft as with&nbsp;all
 of us having deep backgrounds in security knows that this number has no intrinsic value to PC security&nbsp;and in fact most often just ends up in extended conversations like this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I'm not saying the numbers are pointless, but since very few ever pay attention to them and fewer still would recognize when they've changed or why, they serve little true purpose other than to confuse in most cases.</p>
<p>

<p>I don't know if I'd call my opinion an "insight", since I have no deep&nbsp;knowledge of how the support structure within Microsoft operates any longer, but it's clear that some support&nbsp;sub-group has decided that the MSRT is more widely useable than it truly
 is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, in the past you could sometimes tell the source of such a support article, but in this case I see nothing that allows us to determine who generated the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key&nbsp;problem in my view is that the option to perform a full scan was ever added to MSRT, though arguably even the ability to manually scan using the tool is questionable.&nbsp; However, in the context of history the MSRT was the first tool designed to allow
 for a quick "sanity check" of a system for malware and it still serves that basic purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what we're actually seeing here&nbsp;are the symptoms of a massively restructured Microsoft Support structure combined with the lack of a clear hierarchy for that support.&nbsp; Adding the fragmentation of support due to the quickly diverging Windows 10 products
 and the nearly dead legacy versions of Windows 7 and 8.x, and you'll begin to see the potential for the very sorts of product confusion exposed here.</p>

<h2>            Excel Online cannot copy within Excel Online workbook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Recently, my user has reported this issue. </p>
<p>They trying to use Excel Online to view their workbook and copy some of the content to another workbook at another Excel Client Application.<br />
&nbsp;But they were not able to do it. </p>
<p>I tested and i was able to reproduce the result. However, copy the Excel Online content to other format does not have this issue. I can copy to MS Word, Notepad, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Henry,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple browser based copying should work ( it does for me in IE ). I load a simple workbook in my personal live account, type say "100" into a cell, Choose "Copy" and then paste that into notepad and I see "100" pasted. Perhaps there is something more
 specific? Even in view/read mode copy should work ( you might try using the button on the ribbon just in case there is something interesting going on with your key equivalents for CTRL+C ).</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>-Tom</p>

<p>Try copying the image using "copy picture" rather than just copy. (this gives you a variety of options which will effect the quality of the image.</p>
<p>To do this select the tables, and press shift while selecting "edit" from the menu. you will now see "Copy Picture" rather than just copy.</p>
<p>Your options are "as show on screen" or "as shown when printed" and "picture" (usually wmf I beleive) and bitman.</p>
<p>Try the when printed option; and perhaps the bitmap options if you continue to have issues.</p>

<p>Hi Katanadog,</p>
<p>If you have a Zune HD you can delete them from the device itself by doing the tap and hold method on the book you want to delete.&nbsp; For the older model zunes you have to delete them through the software (Audible or Overdrive) that you used to put them on
 the device.&nbsp; The Zune software itself does not have any method syncing audiobooks.</p>
<p>Here a link with step by step instructions for removing Overdrive audiobooks:&nbsp; http://sergeiontech.com/2008/09/24/deleting-overdrive-audiobooks-on-zune</p>
<p>Don't know how the audible software works as far as adding and removing audiobooks on zune, but the overdrive is pretty tricky which is why I included that link.</p>

    <title>Making a shared mailbox the primary mailbox for Outlook profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthonyatkielski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Making a shared mailbox the primary mailbox for Outlook profile</h2>
                    
<p>I have two users who work almost exclusively with a shared mailbox, even though they also have personal mailboxes. In our previous on-premise Exchange environment, I set up mail profiles that made the shared mailbox their primary mailbox, so that it appeared
 at the top of the tree in Outlook and all email sent out was sent by default from that account. Now we've moved to Office 365 and I need to make this work again.</p>
<p>With on-premises Exchange, the shared mailbox was in fact a separate user account, and I gave the two users Full Access and Send As permission on the mailbox. I'm beginning to think that perhaps the shared mailbox in Office 365 also needs to be a separate
 user account with Full Access and Send As ... does it? I've also forgotten exactly how I made it work in the on-premises Exchange, so if anyone has a procedure for creating a profile with a "generic" mailbox as the primary mailbox, that would help.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the users should be able to open Outlook--while signed in to their individual domain accounts-- and see the shared mailbox at the top of the tree as their primary mailbox, with their own personal mailboxes below. New messages should be sent from
 the shared mailbox by default as well. That's how I had it working on Outlook 2010 with on-premises Exchange, now I need to make it work on Outlook 2013 with Office 365.</p>

<p>As long as you have Full Access permissions over a shared mailbox, you can add it as additional account in Outlook (vie File -&gt; Add account), and set it as Primary if needed. I've made a short guide here:

    <title>nokia C5 GPS and ovi maps problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeje1804  say:</h3>
<h2>            nokia C5 GPS and ovi maps problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a strange problem with my C5,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I press "5" on my phone, my compass don't work. Normally, on my old nokia e55, the compass became yellow and after red and after my map follow the north. With this phone, press "5" do nothing. The compass stay white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another problem I have, is that the GPS positioning will place my position on a road, even when I'm far away from any roads ( even 50 meters away ).&nbsp; As such, my location on the map is rarely accurate when I'm not on a road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is supposed it is due to the new version of Nokia maps compared to my old e55. Version is v3.04 10wk32 b04.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have idea !! Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are several phones called C5.&nbsp; Some have a magnetometer (for the compass feature) and others apparently do not.&nbsp; Are you sure yours does?&nbsp; Check your docs or visit
<a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com/Devices/Device_specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.developer.nokia.com/Devices/Device_specifications/</a> and look up your phone.&nbsp; I remember a similar E5 thread from here:

/t5/Phone-Applications/Nokia-E5-Compass-Calibration-Issue/m-p/1217635</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use a slightly older version of Maps (3.03) on my E73, so your settings may be different...but I wonder if you are walking or driving when the GPS positioning is wrong?&nbsp; I see a setting in Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Route -&gt; Transport Mode , and wonder if
 changing it to "Walk" would make a difference?&nbsp; Experiment with settings like this.&nbsp; (Just a guess...)</p>

<p>Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
My phone is a c5-00... and after reading extra feature, your are true, I don't see compass or magneto sensor. Strange because in the user manual, they explain how to make it work.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Route -&gt; Transport Mode , changing it to "Walk" : already try that. It doesn't work.<br />
Thanks a lot for your help.<br />

            Had the same some time ago. This error is related to zero-sized messages. If your folder has one of those, there is it. I've simply deleted all zero-sized messages from all Imap folders on the server side. And problems dissapeared.
