<h2>            How to contact Skype Support&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm no longer able to contact technical support. The only option presented at this path:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Get more help &gt; Select issue &gt; Select a contact method</p>
<p>
</p><p>...is <span>Skype Community</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a&nbsp;<span>Sign In</span>&nbsp;button at top right, but after signing in I end up back at the above path with the same contact method. The page doesn't recognize that I'm already signed in; the
 button still prompts to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&lt;frustration&gt;</span>Skype surely has fallen in quality and service since Microsoft took over. True, the website UX has always been horrible, but things have gotten even worse.<span>&lt;/frustration&gt;</span></p>

    <title>Excel 2010 only prints to the default printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike mcallister  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 only prints to the default printer</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Win 7 Pro on a Dell XPS 9100 (Intel i7) 64-bit.&nbsp; I have installed Office 2010 and Adobe Acrobat 9.&nbsp; All Office programs except Excel allow me to print to any installed printer including Acrobat for pdf files.&nbsp; With Excel, I cannot select any
 printer from the list (including Microsoft XPS Document Writer) unless it is designated the default printer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Excel, if I try to Add Printer, I get the error message, Active Directory Domain Services is currently unavailable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have repaired Office and Acrobat, from the respective programs, to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To recap, the only printer that will work with Excel, from the list of printers shown in Excel, is the printer designated as the default (from Devices and Printers).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            I had the same problem, but found a fix for it on a Microsoft Technet forum.<br />
<br />
In a discussion about Excel 2010 only printing to the default printer, Espresso13 wrote: "I had installed the add-in "Microsoft Office Labs Search Command".&nbsp; As soon as I "deselected" it from the active add-ins listing, I was able to change my printers again.&nbsp;
 If I enable it, I'm locked to default printer only again."<br />
<br />
I just tried this and found exacty the same behaviour.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I have no problem adding new printers from the AD Domain.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Insider Preview 16176 &#62; 16188</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I got a notification that the insider preview I have will expire on the 15th of May. So I decided to upgrade to the next Insider Build. During installation, I had a GSOD. Power failure something, if I recall correctly. But I have no hardware issues
 with my machine, so I did not technically have a "Power Failure", as the GSOD is suggesting. Is this a known issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My specifications:</p>
<p>Intel Core i5 3470</p>
<p>12GB DDR3 RAM</p>
<p>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB</p>
<p>A couple of SSDs</p>
<p>Current insider build is: 16176</p>

<p>Tried upgrading again and I got the same result. The stop code of the GSOD is DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE. Think I gonna stay with 16176 for the time being, seems more stable.<br />

<p>I am also getting this message after reverting to the previous build. What should I do? Seems I have no choice here, if I upgrade, I get the GSOD, if I don't this build will expire. Should I start from scratch?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bec884ff-d6d3-41be-b279-c1202c6388fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bec884ff-d6d3-41be-b279-c1202c6388fb" /></a></p>

    <title>Icon&#47;thumbnail preview of title slide in PowerPoint no longer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robin balbernie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Icon&#47;thumbnail preview of title slide in PowerPoint no longer showing.</h2>
                    <p>Since buying Office 365 for my Mac the title icons/thumbnails of my presentations mostly show up as the generic PowerPoint icon, not the graphic as previously. Icon preview is on. If I save the title slide as a pdf then this does display the graphics. No
 problem with pdf or word docs (so far). Please can anyone think of a solution, as this makes sorting and finding a bit of a fag compared to the previous version of PowerPoint, so not an improvement by any means.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            If a presentation was saved previously without a preview, you can open it, check the thumbnail display option, then Save As to create an updated file with preview. From your screen shots, it looks like older .ppt files are the ones missing thumbnails.

<h2>            how to get back to advanced settings in One Note and undo the encryption option I just tried to institute</h2>
                    <p>Help. I was actually looking for a way to pause syncing One Note between my phone, my laptop and my tablet and instead stumbled upon an option in Advanced settings to encrypt my One Note files/folders. I checked it and there were warnings popping up and
 going away, and then there was some kind of a format problem so I decided to undo that encryption selection in advance settings and now that option no longer exists. I never got to set a password or somehow personalize that encryption (I think I chose folders
 instead of files when the program suggested it), and now I am afraid to touch anything. I have been scouring YouTube and google for info on how to fix this unusual problem to no avail.</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com mail sync seems slow &#40;not push&#41;</h2>
                    Hi All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm running outlook 2013 to for my outlook.com e-mail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Strangely I am noticing that my desktop e-mail (via outlook) seems considerably slower in terms of syncing new mail, sent mail etc than both my Android tablet and phone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For example, if I receive a new mail it always hits my phone &amp; tablet before it hits my desktop via outlook. In fact sometimes I have to force a 'send/receive' to get the e-mail into my inbox.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This seems bizarre. Any ideas why this might be? I'd expect outlook.com e-mail via my desktop with a very powerful PC and a 100Mb wired internet connection to be performing better than this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many Thanks</div>
                </div>

            Are you perhaps behind a proxy server or a (too) strictly configured firewall? This could break the push based sync.<br />

<div>I am using Windows 8.1 without any 3rd party virus or firewall. I am simply using the built in Windows 8.1 firewall and virus protection.</div>

<div>The problem I have is, even though Outlook says "Connected" in the status bar at the bottom I am clearly not connected since I am not getting push e-mail in many instances.</div>

            I'm not sure what one of those looks like. But I don't think so.

<div>Where in Internet Options would I find that? I looked across all the tabs and couldn't see anything obvious.</div>

</p>
<p>Various ISPs also use proxy servers which could be the cause. Also make sure that you have applied all updates&nbsp;for Office 2013.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Are your tablet and phone working correctly when you connect them via your local WiFi only?<br />
If your PC can also make a WiFi connection, turn your phone into a hotspot and connect your PC to it. As you are then using the data plan of your mobile carries, this allows you to determine whether your ISP might have something in their network which kills
 the heartbeat required for push-based email.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Of course, this is just for testing, I'm not suggesting that you work like that from now on ;-)</p>

            Thanks. No proxy server from what I can see. That option is not ticked.
<div><br />
<div>Sadly my desktop doesn't have Wifi connectivity.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, the case remains that the wifi via my phone and tablet seems to be push, but the wired connection to my PC seems to drop out of push periodically.</div>

<div>I'll keep testing and maybe changing the registry value of EAS PushDuration and see what happens. Will report back.</div>

            <p>OK, additionally you could visit the below site which also tries to figure out if there is a proxy involved:<br />
<a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.whatismyip.com/</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What were the results of the previous test;</p>
<p>When you press the Send/Receive button and then send yourself a new email, does it arrive within a few minutes then?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Are you using an outlook.com address as well or a custom domain name?</p>

<p>Have you already tried it with a new mail profil?<br />

            <div>Thanks for the website... I have checked and there is no proxy involved.</div>
<div><br />
In answer to your question about pressing send/receive...
<div><br />
<div>If I am not getting new mail coming in, and I then press send/receive I then get all the mail that's backed up. If I then send myself a message directly after, I still do not receive it... I have to press send/receive again!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Seems once the connection goes down (although it still says connected in my status bar) the connection doesn't come back up again in a push sense... maybe until I restart Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any ideas?</div>

<p>Hi Smg,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your error message, I need to confirm if the file has been deleted or moved.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>If not, you can try the following steps to check if you can find it:</p>
<p>1. Open Word.</p>
<p>2. Select File&gt;click Open Recent.</p>
<p>3. Click More.</p>
<p>4. Right click the file&gt;select Open in folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you couldn’t find it, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Where did you store the file?</p>
<p>2. When can’t you open the file? Which operation have you done before the issue occurred, such as updating Office?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have deleted or moved it, the error message will occur.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Qing</p>

<br />- Kill any instance of Skype.exe 
<br />
<br />(1) If you are using Skype app from Windows from Microsoft Store
<br />- click Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall 
<br />&gt; then install Skype again from Microsoft Store (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>)
<br />
<br />(2) If you are using Skype for Desktop 
<br />- Copy the line 
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop 
<br />- Click Windows Key+R 
<br />- Paste into Run window by CTRL+V and then click Enter 
<br />- Rename this folder to something difference for instance Skype for Desktop_Skype_Old 
<br />- Reinstall Skype (<a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a> )

            <p>There are no registration keys any more.</p>
<p>Are you Activated?&nbsp; Did you upgrade to the Public Release?&nbsp; Is there a watermark above the date above the task bar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check if you computer is activated;<br />
Right click Start, click Command Prompt(Admin)<br />
enter slmgr /xpr&nbsp; Then hit the Enter key<br />
It will tell you when it expires.&nbsp; Mine tells me that my computer is permanently activated.<br />
<br />
If you make a change to the motherboard then you loose this activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not upgraded use the Mediation Creation Tool;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10, Do as an <strong>upgrade.</strong><br />
When it asks for a key just go to the bottom left and click on Do this later</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the upgrade your computer should be activated.&nbsp; If it is then use the tool to make an ISO that is boot-able and them If you want you can do a clean install.&nbsp;&nbsp; KEEP the ISO so you can recover if further testing fouls up you computer and you want to
 be clean again.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no key... after the initial upgrade is activated, Win 10 is activated my Microsoft's server using the hardware ID of your machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should see "Skip This Step" in small blue text... click it...</p>
<p>This may happen twice...</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the 2nd or 3rd request for a key it will display "Do This Later" in blue text instead of "Skip"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may take a day for your machine to activate after completing the install, but it will be useable...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that the machine must have been upgraded from Win 7 SP1 or Win 8.1 at some point for this to work... This is something that has changed since the public release....</p>

    <title>Another massive loss of data on One Note and One Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cortjohnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Another massive loss of data on One Note and One Drive</h2>
                    <p>My favorite piece of software in the world is also the buggiest, most frustrated and heartbreaking software I have ever encountered. Unless I can figure out why I am having these horrible problems I am moving to Evernote. I write for a living by the way
 so I've been using One Note constantly. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My history with One Note</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>About a year ago something with wrong with OneNote and somehow it tanked my entire computer. I had to reload every program and every document in my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About four months I noticed I had lost three blogs I was working on.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>About two months ago during the 2016 upgrade I lost a week or so worth of data. When I went to Dropbox to pick it up not only was the work missing but I couldn't access any of the One Note folders. All that showed was a icon. Clicking on that Icon failed
 to bring up a notebook.&nbsp; It also appeared that One Note was not being uploaded to Dropbox despite the fact that my laptop indicated it was being regularly synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After talking to MS about this I moved to OneDrive because it was specifically made to handle Office applications. The MS representative synced everything together.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday suddenly the section I work out of called Blogs disappeared along with a month and a half of data. Not only did it disappear on my laptop it also disappeared on OneDrive. In fact One Drive stated that the last time data was uploaded to that folder
 was in March.&nbsp; That was remarkable given the the MS representative in April had made sure that all my notebooks were syncing to One Drive<strong> in April.
</strong>The recent files section showed very few files had been uploaded to OneDrive despite the fact that I use it constantly.
</p>
<p>Other folders and files were syncing<strong>;</strong> files I had worked on yesterday morning before the big data dump were there.&nbsp; So far as I can tell only the one Blogs folder - the one I use the most (lol) was hit.
</p>
<p>I spent six hours hours on chat yesterday removing Office, reinstalling it and trying to find out where my data had gone. I went through the six options
<strong>- </strong>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Find-my-lost-notes-in-OneNote-2016-for-Windows-9f3e0e24-01fa-47c2-87ec-101560c13bf1 - without success.
</p>
<p>The current file - the one I do most of my work in - stated it was not syncing. I tried to resyncing it. That did not work.
</p>
<p>The MS tech tried system restore - that did not work. </p>
<p>Finally, somehow I stumbled upon the backup section. Why that is not mentioned in the lost files page or was not mentioned by the MS tech is beyond me because some of the missing files were there and I have begun to move them over.
</p>
<p>As I stated before this is my favorite piece of software and it is at the same time an absolute nightmare. I've never had anything approaching the problems I've had with One Note with any other application.
</p>
<p>I am using Office 365. I am running Windows 10 and I am using Dell Latitude E5540 computer.
</p>
<p><strong>I have two questions: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What the heck is going on? Why have I consistently lost files? Why would One Drive (or before it Dropbox) be affected? I cannot fathom how I could get such data loss or corruption on both my laptop and One Drive or Dropbox but that what is what happened.
 I lost data on One Drive dating back several months -&nbsp; and it was there. It was there when the MS tech connected me. I saw it...</li><li>How can I find my most recent files? (The backup occurred about five days ago).
</li></ul>

            <p>I appreciate your reply but I question whether you really read my post. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I stated I was using backups. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also stated that I went through the six so-called solutions for finding lost data - they didn't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also reported that the data was syncing but that it was suddenly and dramatically lost and that it disappeared on One Drive as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've experienced data loss on and off with One Note. In the last case it only involved one folder; it just happened to be the folder I work in the most.

<p>
</p><p>Do you have no explanation for this? Or no advice on how to stop data from disappearing?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In decades of computing I've never seen this before. You have nothing to say about that? You guys are the experts. Is all this a complete mystery to you? If it is I'm definitely moving to Evernote.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>When a SharePoint Online site name and url is changed, would the links on the quick launch and top navigation bar update automatically or should they be updated manually?</p>

            <p>Hi Sunitha,<br />
<br />
Yes, the links on the quick launch and top navigation bar will update automatically.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Only subsite URL (like <em>https://xxxx.sharepoint.com/sites/test3/sub333</em> ) can be changed (go to the subsite &gt; site settings &gt; Title, description, and logo &gt; Web Site Address).
<br />
Site URL like <em>https://xxxx.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename </em>can't be changed once the site is created.<br />

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. Please note that I have renamed a sub site but the link on quick launch isnt updated. Its still has old url. Its a custom link that i have added manually to the quick launch. Is this an expected behavior?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Sunitha,<br />
<br />
<del>Yes, in your situation, this is an expected behavior, custom links won't update</del>. The best practice is to create links via Site settings &gt; Quick launch or Site settings &gt; Top link bar, those links will update if we change the subsite URL.<br />

            Hi Sunitha,<br />
<br />
Sorry for the mistake above, the links in the Quick launch or Top link bar should update automatically after the subsite URL is modified, no matter the links are added via site settings &gt; Quick launch (Top link bar) or clicking EDIT LINKS button from the site
 page. <br />
<br />
In your situation, please make sure you have refreshed your site page after changing the subsite URL, if the link in the top link bar still shows the old one, you can also try clearing the browser cache (IE &gt; settings icon &gt; Internet Options &gt; General &gt; Delete
 &gt; In the Delete Browsing History page, select Temporary Internet Files and website Files, Cookies and website data &gt; click Delete), sign out and sign in to the site with InPrivate browsing (Ctrl + Shift + P) and check it again.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, there is no article which explains which section gets updated automatically and which needs manual update when a site is renamed, most of the articles are about how to add, remove or edit the links.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
James

            <p>Hi Sunitha,<br />
<br />
I'd like to confirm whether this is the issue:<br />
<br />
<strong>1</strong>. You have a parent site named test https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test and a subsite&nbsp; https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test/sub1.<br />
<strong>2</strong>. You went to the parent site, and changed the link address of the default
<strong>Notebook</strong> link in the left navigation pane.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31d5b239-546b-4c44-97b9-68ebbe1801c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31d5b239-546b-4c44-97b9-68ebbe1801c0" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. You changed the subsite URL through <strong>Site settings </strong>
&gt; Title, description, and logo.<br />
<strong>4</strong>. Back to the parent site, click on <strong>Notebook</strong>, error occurs.<br />
<br />
If so, please share more details with us:<br />
<strong>a</strong>. In <strong>step 2</strong> above, what is the new URL of the Notebook address?<br />
<strong>b</strong>. A screenshot of the 500 error.<br />
<strong>c</strong>. If you directly visit the URL which you added into Notebook address, what is the result?<br />
<br />
If that is not your situation, please correct me.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
James</p>

            As you can see even the support folks here struggle to understand how this dysfunctional product works. I've seen several "sorry I got that wrong" posts from support folks today which tells you a lot about how badly designed this product is.<br />

<p>Nokia N900 Review: Good, the bad and the ugly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Good:</strong><br />
•&nbsp;Excellent Web Browser (Mozilla based)<br />
•&nbsp;Full Flash Support<br />
•&nbsp;Excellent GPU, and thus games<br />
•&nbsp;Fast CPU<br />
•&nbsp;Excellent Camera<br />
•&nbsp;Good Internal Storage, memory and mSDHC support<br />
•&nbsp;Responsive GUI<br />
•&nbsp;Multiple Desktops and 'true' multitasking<br />
•&nbsp;Well thought out GUI<br />
•&nbsp;Stable OS (as long as you don't start hacking around without a working knowledge of Linux / maemo)<br />
•&nbsp;Maemo Linux based OS, more apps and tools than you'll ever need.<br />
•&nbsp;Great community support (see above)<br />
•&nbsp;Open OS, no need to unlock, jailbreak or hack to do whatever you want, although this can be dangerous if you don't know what your doing.<br />
•&nbsp;Great for IT admins. (Given the tools that are available, rdesktop &amp; nmap for example)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bad:</strong><br />
•&nbsp;<strong>No Bluetooth PBAP or rSAP support</strong>, so it will not synchronize contacts with Car Kits<br />
•&nbsp;<strong>No Turn by Turn on OVI Maps!!</strong> The N900 has a bespoke OVI Maps install that is basically rubbish. This is a killer feature for many people, and if you need it; buy another phone, as it doesn't look like Nokia are interested in updating it.<br />
•&nbsp;No MMS Support, you can't send or receive Multimedia messages. (I can hear the Apple brand-droids laughing already!)<br />
•&nbsp;OVI Suite isn't supported on the N900, yep, you heard that right!<br />
•&nbsp;PC Suite isn't 'fully' supported, you can't use the SMS feature for example!<br />
•&nbsp;The Screen isn't Multi Touch<br />
•&nbsp;<strong>You can't copy/paste from/to Emails</strong>. This one I can't believe, for an 'Internet Tablet', this is a must have feature<br />
•&nbsp;Cant mark/unmark multiple message to read/unread status<br />
•&nbsp;Steep learning curve for non techies, you'll need to understand Linux and the maemo OS to get the most from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ugly:</strong><br />
•&nbsp;If Lego made a phone, it would look like the N900.<br />
•&nbsp;It's very heavy.<br />
•&nbsp;Impossible to use it with any Car Holders (Inc the Nokia ones) as they all foul some or all of the top buttons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All that being said, I really love&nbsp; the device, and I won't be sending mine back unless the Bluetooth problems aren't sorted soon!</p>

<p>There is plenty good in the n900. It is a fantastic internet browser with a bunch of nice little tools to go along with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in a basic way it fails. I would like to see better portrait mode support so it can more comfortably be used as a, you know, phone. When looking at a contact on your desktop it is in landscape, then you have to switch to portrait to talk/call. When making
 sequential calls it really hurts functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems so simple but it could be a much more user friendly interface if the phone responded to &nbsp;its position or could be set to default display one way or the other by the user's choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is so open source and customizable, why can't this be done?</p>

<p>Hi all, I would like to make some comments about the New Nokia N900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shortly the phone SUCKS!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been a Nokia user for about 10 years, and for the past 3 I have been using the NSeries, I started 3 years ago with the N95, then moved’ on to the N96 an now as you can see I have had the chance to use the N900 even thought my original plan was the
 N97. The reason for this is that I contacted my provider (T-Mobile UK) as I was due an upgrade, and was told that they didn’t do this handset directly, but I could get this phone if I did the upgrade though Carphone Warehouse (Don’t even get me started on
 them) any way I contacted Carphone Warehouse and told them that I was due an upgrade and wanted the N97, the idiot on the phone started telling me that the N900 was much better and that it was faster and all. I told him I would have a look into it my self,
 at least to read some comparisons online. After having read the comparison on several sites, on “paper” the N900 sounded much better, faster processor (N97 is about 400Mhz, N900 is about 600Mhz), more RAM, the use of a Linux based OS and so on, sounded great,
 I accepted the upgrade with 14 exchange if not happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well I have used the phone for about 3 days, and let me tell you what I think…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device is not as fast as people say, you would not think that there is about 200Mhz speed difference between them and that the N900 has double of the RAM then the N97. Yes it does allow you to open several tasks at once, but the CPU drain of more demanding
 applications is definitely noticeable, for example when running a YouTube page in the background with a video playing and opening other apps, the music temporarily just like the N95/N96 did/do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that it’s a new mobile technology makes it also not very popular right now and there is lack of application unlike the Symbian OS used by the N97, even Nokia them self are not up to speed, the OVI map on the N900 is version 1 point something and
 is really useless, unlike version 3.03 (3.04 BETA out too) of the N97 (don’t forget that I am using the N97 as a Symbian comparison).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firmware upgrade is very complex for general users, this includes having to use a Flashing Tool and command lines, I had some issues at the beginning and I am an IT technician. The NSU (Nokia Software Update) didn’t detect the new version available even
 thought the phone was delivered with version 1.x and the version available was 3.2x.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the phone “Hard Reset” is complicated, once again you have to use the Flashing Tool and download an other file called EMMC that should technically erase the 32GB memory, but be were, after having used this file my contact were still there and some other
 information were there too such as my OVI e-mail account and my SKYPE account details, there was also a file from the sketch software that had not been deleted and had to do so manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Talking about SKYPE, many sites when comparing N97 to N900 state that the N900 has SKYPE and some other software unlike the N97, well I use to use SKYPE on the N95, it may not be inbuilt but no one says you can’t download it, I use to have SKYPE Lite with
 many more features then the “messaging” SKYPE inbuilt in the N900. I also use to have 3 different versions of Opera, Windows Live messenger, the IPlayer application, an application provided by SKY TV to control TV listing and Remote Recording, Google Map,
 Google YouTube application and much, much more, most probably you wont find half of those for the N900, but you don’t see anyone stating that anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The N900 also lack the option to create folder to organize your applications, any application is “plonked” with the rest if a random order and there is nothing you can do about it, apart from creating a short-cut on one of the 4 useless screens and try to
 organize it that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also seem to lack the use of the SIM contact option, all you can do is copy from the SIM but not use the SIM storage, now my SIM allows me to store 200 contacts, this would A) save memory on the phone, and B) be used as a back-up of the numbers. I normally
 use it as B, I back-up the numbers on the SIM (apart from the PC) because the SIM does not die as easy as the phone, lets say (and this has happened to me before with the N96) that the phone drops in the bath, the phone would most probably short and die, but
 if you had the numbers on the SIM you can move to a back-up phone no problem, same as if you drop the phone and it brakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An other issues I had with the N900 is that when you create short-cuts on one of the 4 desktop, you cant align the items, so you may have one up, one down and so on, you would think that they would have a snap to grid or something, but no such thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battery is worse then any phone I have seen, I have lost a “line” while playing only 2 YouTube videos over 3G network hardly anything else running, now the videos were about 3 to 5 minutes each so lets say I lost a batter “line” in 10 minutes, I guess
 with-in 1 hour your battery would be flat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battery charger is not a standard Nokia one (pin) but it uses the same socked of the USB cable, maybe the run out of money while designing, who knows, the only good thing about the charging is that you can charge it while connecting to the PC via USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The keyboard misses the mouse pad that we have on the N97, and even thought the device supports on-screen keyboard too, I have noticed that many of the application only support the normal slide-out keyboard, application such as the OVI map (while using the
 search address option).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The messaging options are very limited too, IM and SMS is all included in an option called conversations located in the main menu, as far as I have seen you are also not able to select multi items when trying to delete them, and this does not only happened
 in the “conversations” section, I had to delete all the inbuilt songs 1 by 1 and several other files 1 by 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camera options are very limited too, and the picture quality is very poor as far as I can see, I have taken better pictures with the N95 2 years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There seem to also be a limitation when trying to edit website short-cuts name on the desktop, the name is basically whet ever the site owners use as a title for the site, for example YouTube uses “YouTube – Broadcast Yourself” and that’s what the phone
 seems to use as a desktop short-cut title.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 3G seem to also run slower on this device, web-page loading time between this phone and the N95 seems to be slower more then faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this is what I have discovered in 2 and a half days of using the phone, I don’t even want to imagine how dissatisfied I would have to be if I had to keep this phone for 12/18/24 months, luckily I have the 14 days to exchange and will contact Carphone
 Warehouse in the morning to arrange an exchange for the N97, I have already taken my SIM card out and placed it in a spare N95 I have at home, that’s how quick I want to get away from the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My general advice would be to stay away from this phone and technology at least for now, and not to always believe what is stated by device specs on “paper” as sometimes it’s not all as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This phone reminds me of a scene from the film “Bad Boys 2” when Will Smith is driving the black Porsche with Martin Lawrence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence): You mean, y'all paid, what, $80,000 for this car and you ain't got no damn cup holder?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Lowrey (Will Smith): It's $105,000 and this happens to be one of the fastest production cars on the planet. Zero to sixty in four seconds, sweetie. Limited edition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence): You damn right it's limited! No cup holder, no back seat. Just a shiny **bleep** with two chairs in it. I guess we the balls just draggin' the **bleep** along.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn't that because the N900 loads up Full Web pages rather than the cut down Mobile versions that the N95 would load??</p>

<p>Well the browser on the n95 loads FaceBook as a over 1MB page and seems to work fine,</p>
<p>I don't use the basic mobile view for pages, I don't like it, I also use other browsers like skyfire and 3 other versions of Opera (which I understand that loads "reduced" sites).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even streamed YouTube on the N95 while using other online apps with no problems</p>

<p>I DO confirm, that phone sucks !!! I have been waiting it for 2 month, and received it yesterday evening. I "played" with it for 4 hours and put it back in the box. It is just useless as a phone and even worth if you need to synchronize with your exchange

<p>Lord vic's comments hit many good points,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device has been released for quite some time now,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The should put a warning, This is not to be used as a main cell-phone unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just for a good web browsing device, for people who want linux in their pockets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am dissastisfied that this product was released, and after all this time, (thought it should have been tested properly prior to actual release) they haven't ironed out these big issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever, i'm stuck with this device, and will be using it as WiFi phone in my office, when i can't be bothered to answer from my laptop. I took out the SIM card, it is really pointless. It's too premature of a product to be considered a cell-phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least the E71 and E72 are amazing products, so I still have faith in their E series line.</p>

    <title>Software Update Problem in Lumia 630. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Software Update Problem in Lumia 630.</h2>
                    Recently I installed windows insider and preview for developer app but since everyone was taking that preview version has lots of bugs so I decided not to upgrade. But agey uninstalling both the software when I checked for updates it showed that an update
 is ready for you. I want to know that is this a OS update or a preview out technical version. Should I downloaded it or not since Lumia denim is still not launched in my region(India) as per Microsoft website. Please tell me how to stop that downloading if
 its not a original update. Cause everytime I connect to Wi-Fi it starts downloading the update.

            <p>Hi Smittychart,<br />
<br />
Some troubleshooting steps (as i have searched) I have taken are:<br />
<br />
_ changing the format of rate and bit depth<br />
<br />
_ reinstall the driver (also on graphic )<br />
<br />

</p><p>Firstly, I will upgrade to 9879 first, then I will find out that thing for you as I saw that you have worked specifically on 9879. I thought it would be easy for both of us.

            Hi Shubham,<br />
<br />
According to your screenshot, you’re using the classic view of SharePoint document library.<br />
<br />

switch to the modern experience</a>, and confirm the information below:<br />
1. Update your Chrome to the latest version, currently 54.0.2840.59.<br />
2. Open the document library in the private mode.<br />

<p>There is a well published issue that the return from Hibernate will cause a freeze.&nbsp; I have it on 2 @ 14267.&nbsp; I have now gone to the Sleep option.&nbsp; Some have stated that the removal of Fast Boot will cure but not for me.</p>

<p>Keith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't be disturbed, just move to the slow ring.&nbsp; Those releases are much better tested and generally very reliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you like getting the latest versions, stay on the fast ring, but don't complain about bugs like this.&nbsp; That's the purpose of the fast ring insiders - to check it and report problems right away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my main computer set to the slow ring so that the updates don't cause issues on our home network.&nbsp; My wife gets very annoyed when shared resources stop working or if the main computer won't boot! But my laptop is on the fast ring, and I am willing
 to&nbsp;do workarounds on it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I've heard and addressed this issue in 14257 also...you can try to turn off the 'Fast Start-up' in Power Options this works for some in similar cases:</p>

<br />
You could try turning off fast startup and see if you get the startup issue.<br />
<br />
1. Right-click start, Power Options<br />
2. Click Require a password on wakeup<br />
3. Click Change settings that are currently unavailable<br />
4. Untick [&nbsp;&nbsp; ] Turn on fast startup<br />
5. Click [Save changes] button<br />
6. Shutdown<br />
7. Start your computer and login.<br />
<br />
A number of us have done this and it worked.
