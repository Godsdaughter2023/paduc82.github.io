            Hi Cheryl
<br />
<br />Please try this first:
<br />
<br />Right click an empty part of your Taskbar, choose Taskbar Settings
<br />
<br />On the resulting page, click 'Turn System Icons on or off
<br />
<br />Is the volume icon tuned on?
<br />
<br />If not, turn that on
<br />
<br />If that was already turned on, please check if you turn another icon off, does the volume icon appear?

<h2>            Videos with a portrait resolution &#40;720x1280&#41; play with a black screen, audio is heard, in Windows Media Player 12 on Windows 7</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I've noticed that video playback for videos (with a portrait resolution, specifically 720x1280, appear black with audio being heard in Windows Media Player 12 (WMP 12) on Windows 7.&nbsp; A Playbook was used to capture the video in the portrait resolution.&nbsp; I've
 also noticed that if the Playbook captures video in landscape resolution 1280x720, the video plays just fine in WMP 12, so I know it's not a Codec issue and seems to be related to the portrait dimensions of the video.<br />
<br />
The same portrait videos can be played back normally with VLC and other video player applications.&nbsp; Is this a known issue or limitation with WMP 12 on Windows 7?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />
RS<br />
<br />
P.S.&nbsp; As an aside, Playbook captures videos in MPEG-4 format with AVC Video Codec and MPEG-1 Audio layer 2 Audio Codec.

<p>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that whenever you play a video in the Portrait format (720x1280) it displays a black screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To troubleshoot this issue we need to do some diagnostics hence I would suggest that you refer the link and follow the steps.</p>

Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan.

    <title>What We Want In MW3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oo stryker oo-5a6b225c-bda0-4508-a3e6-f6437bdcd8b3  say:</h3>
<h2>            What We Want In MW3</h2>
                    
<p>As a franchise, the<i> call of duty</i> series has been a great ride, and a lot of good fun for all of us, but what will we see in the upcoming title? It’s rumored to arrive this fall/winter for a Christmas release, and that’s exciting news.</p>
<p><br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-15.gif" />We’re all bracing for impact; locked and loaded, and ready to engage!<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-15.gif" /></p>
<p><br />
Will the community be cheering the release of yet another locked down COD title or has Infinity Ward learned to adapt to what the community wants? Personally, I’ve had enough of being pushed around by locked down server and in-game console files, no decent
 LAN support, and the lack luster desire of pushing a title’s shelf life. </p>
<p><br />
But that’s me, and that’s because I primarily do all my FPS gaming on the PC. I have an XBOX360 too and I understand where they’re heading with this new title.
</p>
<p><br />
Remember now, the game play, movement, weapons and story line was phenomenal &nbsp;in MW2 and we observed server improvements in Black ops as well. We’d be happy to see the story progress in MW3, and hopefully they’ll take the best of both titles, progress with
 the blockbuster movie quality storyline of MW2, and bam, they have themselves another best selling title of all time. Again.</p>
<p><br />
Hopefully Infinity is taking on this project to save the reputation they got from COD4 players worldwide upon the release of MW2, it’s sad to see the player community frown on any change whatsoever, but if you ask me, change is exactly what they need.
</p>
<p><br />
Will MW3 be what the PC community asks for? Probably not, but it will blow your socks off and put them back on again for you in the morning.</p>
<p><br />
To be honest with you, no matter what we as PC players have come to expect in a title in the past, the days of free maps, pc ports (whatever that means) and quality 1 on 1 support are long behind us, and maybe that’s a good thing. What want to have added to
 the game may or may not be there, but one’s thing’s for sure, MW3 will kick you right in the face like the rest of them did, and most of us will be there to fully support the release of the upcoming prequel.</p>
<p><br />
It seems our wants as PC users will be shoved aside as a bump in the road by the developers and at best, a loss of a couple thousand sales, I just hope someone in their office has a soft spot for a good old fashioned PC gaming experience.</p>
<p><br />
The consumers are fed up, and they’re starting to think the development community doesn’t care about PC gamers, or that they’re simply concerned with marketing and selling the new title for max profit, which is partially understandable, but we’re been waiting
 for our bone for quite some time now.</p>
<p><br />
I put together a little formula to help you further understand the fork in the road the industry has come to at this point and correct me if I’m wrong, but something here needs to change:</p>
<p><i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Developer wants sales.<br />
Player anticipates ultra quality.</b></i></p>
<p><b><i>——————————- = Happy Developers and a cry baby teenage customer base</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>Developer sells Regardless<br />
Player buys the title any way, plays for a while</i></b><br />
<i><b>Then rants about how much better he would have made the title </b></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a member of the competitive PC gaming community, I personally think mod tools and user generated creativity is an essential stepping stone to keep a game alive and in good competitive hands for a long time to come, and we're all interested to know why
 you came down so hard on modio. It was a great community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, realistically speaking, this is what developers want to steer the masses away from. New titles means new money, so perhaps they don’t want to move forward with an explosive mind blasting title and maybe they’re looking forward to releasing
 yet another half broken, quick fix title, not to mention stopping us in our paths as we try and mod their content.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know they’re capable of delivering good products and explosive entertainment, we’ve seen it in the past, and we’re all very excited for the release of MW3 None of us are about to give up on the franchise just yet, and who knows, maybe after years
 of pushing around the little guys, they’ll throw us a bone this time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b><br />
<br />
<br />
</b></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>What we as PC users crave:</b></span></p>
<p>Mod tools, the ability to share and distribute server files, a good LAN support interface, and an overall better user experience what the community’s been asking for ever since the release of COD4. Sure DLC map pack content and cross-platform compatibility
 comes into play here, we understand that. All the competitive gaming communities simply don’t support DLC but as a PC user, I get the DLC just to have a good time regardless of what they support.
</p>
<p>I’m sure if you go out and ask a group of dedicated COD players which is better and still competitive, they’ll tell you COD 2, 4 and maybe 7, like I would. Hopefully Infinity Ward will come together and put the best of those titles into play here, and bring
 spectacular results like they have in the past.</p>
<p>We’ve touched base with what I believe the community thinks of the series so far, and as an avid daily gamer with ties to the actual customer base itself, I can report to you that players are already buzzing and speculating about this title. Let’s just hope
 this time it’s actually “For the Players by the Players.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b><br />
<br />
<br />
What We All Want to See:</b></span></p>
<p><b>1)</b>&nbsp; Take what Treyarch thinks is so cool and spin it around on them like a punch to the face, “SinglePlayer – Free with every copy of MW3.” Let’s be honest guys, single player is outstanding but people love COD because we play with friends, have a
 good time, and could care less about the single player experience after the first week.
</p>
<p>We’re all here for what the multiplayer has to offer. CO-OP, SnD, BareBones, TDM GroundWar and all that good content. If you improve those, people will love you for a long, long time to come.</p>
<p><b><br />
<br />
<br />
2)&nbsp; </b>Let The Story Progress in full force as it was in MW2, we loved the adult feel you brought to the table in MW2, but reserve space to improve the multiplayer.</p>
<p><b><br />
<br />
<br />
3)&nbsp; </b>Bring Co-op Back from MW2; add more missions and 4 player support, zombies is fun, but not as good as co-op was on Mw2. I played Overwatch 1000 times over just because it was so good.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
4)&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b> Fully Customizable Guns</b></span></p>
<p>That was a good idea, and whoever brought that to the table deserves a cookie, promotion and a seat on the board. We as players love it, just remember the following when developing your next player customization interface,
</p>
<p>“This is my rifle, there are many like it, but this one is mine.”</p>
<p>A camo/gun shop where you can buy, paint and fully customize your gun the way you want it would be a great addition as well. Everyone and I mean everyone loves their own load outs; we want you to take customization to a new level and surprise us.<br />
<br />
Anything else you want to add to this title would be greatly received, but stick to the core multiplayer experience this time, make it better, and we’ll all be happy campers.
</p>

<p>I'm talking about MW3, <b>regardless of the platform</b>. I have a <i>PC, XBOX 360. PS3 a Wii.</i> How do I know.... Because I just do.
</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
I've talked to a lot of people since the release of&nbsp; the original <b>Call of Duty back in 2003</b>, played every title and t<b>alked to thousands upon thousands of enthusiasts since the release of COD</b>. The franchise itself has come a long way. It probably
 all started sometime before you learned to talk and walk so i guess i shouldn't expect you to understand.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
I've reached a general consensus on what people are looking for in the next title based on my experience within the community and the general feel of the most recent titles.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess i could put it into an easier to understand context for you so here goes:</p>
<p><i><br />
<br />
<br />
"Apples" (Call of Duty) come from "apple trees" (Activision). A lot of Apples picked this year (Black Ops
</i><i>Title) were eaten by "people who love apples" (Gamers who play Call of Duty).
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The "majority"&nbsp; I've interacted with (</i> Majority is a subset of a group consisting of more than half of its members<i>) are "people who love apples. They're saying they hope there will be bigger and better "Apples" this Christmas (MW3 release). They were
 talking about what type season they would have( <span>
speculating</span> --&gt; predicting the outcome on what and how the "Apples" will be improved).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</i>I took that information and created a little post, given my level of experience in the COD series I felt the need to share my findings on the XBOX 360 forum hoping to receive some decent responses. The only one who bothered to respond was you, which is
 unfortunate, but it happens.<i><br />
</i><br />
<br />
That's all i can do for you if you need further assistance i will refer you to 1800-ABC-DEFG.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Your pushing the stereotype to the limit, post something relevant next time, and i will also point out the formula I've posted above.</p>

<p>To be honest as long as they sorted out all the hacking and cheating and what not, that would make me happy in the next game. Everything else to do with the game would be an added bonus, especially weapons that you could customize.</p>

<p>Yeah Minus XP for Boosting would be a god send wouldn't it. There will always be J TAGS, there will always be modders who open lobby's to get free XP and people looking to get ahead unfairly. It's unfortunate and there's probably little they can do to prevent
 it, other than hiring a team to actively investigate these matters, which is not at all cost effective nor realistic.
<br />
<br />
But who knows maybe they'll add some type of anticheating software like what they have currently available on the PC. I guess only time will tell.</p>

<p>a nice well written post...and while I don't game on the PC, most of the problems you mentioned also exist on the consoles. The difference bettween the two companies is that IW makes a decent quality game full of bugs to *** up your experience, while Treyarch
 makes a Less buggy game with a less than memorable storyline and keeps rediculous perks in the game that should have been scrapped out after Cod4.</p>

<p>I would like to see:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; A game that lets you rank up in story mode and have the ability to carry over what you unlock to online multi-player.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A different approach to unlocking things and ranking up online.&nbsp; No more prestige.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The ability to put more than one or two attachments on your weapon, other games let you do this now, I would like to be able to use a gun with extended mags, grips, and a scope if I want.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Tone down the kill streak rewards with smaller more simple rewards: Uav, Jammer, restocking ammo, at the most a predator missile or attack chopper.</p>

<p>I'm hoping for a more balanced multiplayer experience. Removal of the OMA perk and rescavenged grenade launcher ammuntion is a must. Stackable killstreaks should no longer be implemented either. Hopefully they'll have a killstreak similar to the SR 71 from
 black ops, its very useful.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s follow these steps &amp; check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a) You may boot the computer into ‘safe mode’ and check if the issue re-appears. It will start Windows XP with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed, follow
 the steps to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></p>
<p><span>i.
<b>Restart</b> the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>ii. Start tapping
<b>F8</b> key.</span></p>
<p><span>iii. You will get
<b>Advanced Boot Option</b> window.</span></p>
<p><span>iv. Select the option
<b>Safe mode</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, refer to this link:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP</span></a></p>
<p><span><br />
b) If the issue does not re-appear in safe mode, you may configure the computer in clean boot state and check if the issue persists. It will start Windows XP by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate
 software conflicts. </span></p>
<p><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a><span><br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the section ‘Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state’ from the article: How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a><span><br />
<br />

            Hello Natassa kar,<br />
<br />
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
There are a few things that could be causing this issue, please try these steps first,</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open
<strong>Administrative Tools</strong> by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>,and then clicking <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Double-click Services. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Right-click the
<strong>Windows Update </strong>service, and then click Stop.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click
<strong>start</strong>, then click <strong>all programs</strong>, then click <strong>
accessories</strong>, then right click <strong>command prompt</strong> and choose to
<strong>run as administrator</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Type:<br />
<strong>net stop wuauserv<br />
regsvr32 wuapi.dll /s<br />
regsvr32 wuaueng.dll /s<br />
regsvr32 wucltux.dll /s<br />
regsvr32 wudriver.dll /s<br />
regsvr32 wups2.dll /s<br />
regsvr32 wups.dll /s<br />
regsvr32 wuwebv.dll /s<br />
net start wuauserv<br />
exit</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Restart the system and see if it can update now.<br />
If this does not fix the problem you could also try repairing the BITS service, by following the below article:<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940520.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Download the .Net Framework removal tools "<strong>dotnetfx_cleanup_tool.zip</strong>" from the below link,<br />
http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/attachment/8904493.ashx</span></p>
<p><span>Run the tool &amp; you should remove only that version for which you are receiving error code. (i.e. you should only remove .NET Framework 3.5 &amp; its service packs package)
</span></p>

<h2>            How to stop annoying windows updates&#63;</h2>
                    Is there any dedicate way of stopping updates entirely. My computers hardware dosent react well with the latest version of Windows 10 ver. 1709 but it all works fine on ver. 1609. How can I stop windows from updating to the latest version. I'd rather be
 subject to spyware then have a useless 70lb paperweight.

            Yes AlRecalde, there is a way.
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + R together. Enter in, without quotes, "services.msc"
<br />
<br />Look for the Windows Update service, scroll all the way down to get to it. Double click it, then set its Startup type to Disabled, and make sure the service is stopped.
<br />
<br />Hope that was helpful.

            I have actually been trying that as well as disabling the update orchestrate service as well. Unfortunately they keep reactivating because another service that I can't stop that makes the computer run keeps on starting them as a protocol. And this past
 time when I went to shut down my computer there was no shut down option, only "update and shut down" so they are literally forcing this on my computer without my permission or even a warning.

            Go to Task Scheduler - TaskSchedulerLibrary - Microsoft - Windows - Update Orchestrator.
<br />Then pick UpdateAssistant - right click - Properties - Triggers Tab - Edit each Trigger then click Enabled box to Disable - OK.
<br />Repeat for UpdateAssistantCalendarRun.

<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 5:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver 
<br />
<br />
<br />Option 6:
<br />
<br />Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which can pause updates for up to 35 days or block them for a year.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/defer-block-uninstall-windows-10-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/defer-block-un...</a>
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation
<br />Click the link ‘Go to the store to upgrade or enter a product key’
<br />Click the $99 button to make your purchase (the price might vary by region or depending on the edition you are upgrading from or upgrading to).
<br />Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase.
<br />Within 5 to 10 minutes, your system will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, your personal files, apps and settings preserved. 
<br />You won’t get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase. 
<br />
<br />additional options:
<br />
<br />1. running from CMD (as administrator) the following lines:
<br />sc stop wuauserv
<br />sc config wuauserv start= disabled
<br />
<br />
<br />2. changing the group policy to "Notify for download and auto install" but it only ensured now updates will be installed. the service still restarting.
<br />3. Adding WindowsUpdate/AU options keys toHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows
<br />thanks for your help.

            Hi AlRecalde, none of the old methods will turn off Automatic Updates anymore, this method will turn off Automatic Updates completely . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find Windows Update Service
<br />
<br />If it is Started, double click it and stop that service
<br />
<br />CLose the services App
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />sc delete wuauserv
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />If you also have the Update Assistant installed on your system:
<br />
<br />The Update Assistant in Windows 10 cannot be uninstalled, but you can get rid of it 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Task Scheduler and hit enter 
<br />In the left Pane, navigate to: Windows - Update Orchestrater 
<br />Right Pane double click 'Update Assistant' 
<br />Click on Triggers Tab 
<br />On each of the triggers ( At login . . . etc.) double click and uncheck 'Enabled' 
<br />
<br />Under 'Update Assistant, there is another event 'Update Assistant CalendarRun' 
<br />Do the same for all triggers on that event 
<br />
<br />Restart your system, that's It!
<br />
<br />When finished and after a system restart, open the services app and make sure the Windows Update Service is now gone . . .

            Hey Al,
<br />
<br />Unbeknownst to me, Microsoft makes this difficult or arguably impossible to disable updates as a whole. The best you can do (and this has worked for me although it doesn't disable updates as a whole) is that on Windows 10 Pro, you can use the Local Group Policy Editor to make sure Windows 10 does not automatically download and install updates, and that it has to notify you first and ask you before it downloads.
<br />
<br />To do this, hit Windows key + R together to go to Run, then without quotes, type in "gpedit.msc".
<br />
<br />You should now be in the Group Policy Editor.
<br />
<br />Navigate in the left pane to Local Computer Policy &gt; Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You should see a bunch of Windows Update related tasks. Find "Allow updates to be downloaded automatically over metered connections" and disable it. Now find "Configure Automatic Updates" and toggle it as "Enabled". Now under "Configure automatic updating", select "2 - Notify for download and auto install". This, as implied, does automatically install the updates but you can at least stop it in its tracks.
<br />
<br />Remember that metered connections policy I told you to make changes to? Hit Windows key + I together, go into Network &amp; Internet, then go into your applicable network connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) on the left pane, then on the right side, click your network icon (the one with the label "Connected". See under "Metered connection"? Toggle "Set as metered connection" on. If you're confused about the process, Microsoft has a support article here (helps especially if you're under Wi-Fi): <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028458/windows-metered-connections-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402845...</a>
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, there is no cinch way to disable Windows Updates entirely. Microsoft made this arguably impossible. Hope that at least clears it up.

<h2>            Windows 10 Installation 80240020 and 0xC19001 - 0x30018 Error &#40;Success&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Updated 2 Desktops and 1 Laptop without problems (all Win 8.1 Pro to Windows 10 Pro), but my main Desktop tried to update 36 times, without success. Tried everything I've read on this and other forums, but no joy. I wont bore you with everything I tried,
 but on the 37th attempt I decided to give this a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to run and type msconfig</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When it loads, on General Tab, make sure "Selective Startup" and the three items below are selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Select "Services Tab" and tick the box "Hide all Microsoft Services" I the disabled everything else, then clicked apply and OK.</p>
<p>I use "Tuneup Utilities 2014" and it would not disable and so I uninstalled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Inserted&nbsp;a USB&nbsp;Memory Stick with Windows 10 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Rebooted computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. From inside Windows 8.1 I selected&nbsp;the USB stick, then right click selected "Setup" and run as Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>20 minutes later Windows 10 was up and running and everything was OK. I rebooted and checked "Settings, Activation" and it said windows was activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many sleepless nights and much stress, I am a happy 69 year old bunny.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me and I hope it does for you, Good Luck.</p>

            The Kodak Support site for the ESP5210 has a "Setup for all-in-one printer (including the wireless connection and troubleshooting)" that may help.&nbsp; I just looked at the first steps and it looked like it might take a while before it gets you to the wireless
 troubleshooting as it seems to be a detailed step-by-step with no way to skip ahead.&nbsp;

                    I can't access my public folder when my firewall is on. But can access it when my firewall is off. I have already enabled file-sharing and public folder sharing.<br />
<br />
Also, I cannot see computers connected to my computer when their firewall is on and can see them when their firewall is off. Why is this?

            You need to configure your firewall correctly instead of turning it off and on.<br />
<br />
<span>Excellent, thorough, yet easy to understand article about File/Printer Sharing in Vista. Includes details about sharing printers as well as files and folders:<br />
<br />
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb727037.aspx<br />
<br />
</span><span>Configure firewalls on all machines to allow the Local Area Network (LAN) traffic as trusted. With Windows Firewall, this means allowing File/Printer Sharing on the Exceptions tab. Normally running the Network Setup Wizard
 on XP will take care of this for those machines.The only "gotcha" is that this will turn on the XPSP2 Windows Firewall. If you aren't running a third-party firewall or have an antivirus/security program with its own firewall component, then you're fine.&nbsp; With
 third-party firewalls,&nbsp;I usually configure the LAN allowance with an IP range. Ex. would be 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.254. Obviously you would substitute your correct subnet. Refer to any third party security program's Help or user forums for how to properly configure
 its firewall. Do not run more than one firewall. DO NOT TURN OFF FIREWALLS; CONFIGURE THEM CORRECTLY.<br />
<br />
If you need more help, please provide these details:<br />
<br />
1. Operating systems/versions/Service Pack levels of all machines.<br />
2. Name of antivirus/security software used.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Skype Directory&#34; tab is missing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>One of our clients have this problem. They are a small company. They have got 4 active users. When any of them make a search on their Skype for Business clients, only "My Contacts" tab appears and "Skype Directory" tab is missing.</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS (SRV) records set up correctly. </li><li>Settings are correct in Portal. (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Let-Skype-for-Business-Online-users-communicate-with-external-Skype-for-Business-or-Skype-contacts-b414873a-0059-4cd5-aea1-e5d0857dbc94?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Let-Skype-for-Business-Online-users-communicate-with-external-Skype-for-Business-or-Skype-contacts-b414873a-0059-4cd5-aea1-e5d0857dbc94?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a>)
</li><li>We've turned off "External access" and waited for 24 hours. Then turned it back on and waited for 24 hours again. Problem persisted.
</li><li>We've cleared Skype for Business cache (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2604176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2604176</a>), but problem persisted.
</li><li>When we test it with other accounts from other tenants on the same computers and same network, "Skype Directory" works properly.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
Looking forward to your suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Bruce</p>

<p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>To better understand the situation, I’d like to confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. By saying “<strong>When any of them make a search on their Skype for Business clients, only "My Contacts" tab appears and "Skype Directory" tab is missing</strong>”, do you mean this issue happened to all users in your client’s organization? Meanwhile,
 can you share some related screenshots showing "<strong>Skype Directory</strong>" missing? To upload images, please click<strong> Use rich formatting</strong> and then select the
<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> button.</p>
<p>2. Regarding “We've turned off "External access" and waited for 24 hours. Then turned it back on and waited for 24 hours again. Problem persisted”, did you try unticking the option “<strong>Turn on communication with Skype users and users of other public
 IM service providers</strong>” and ticking it back on again after some time? If not, please first untick this option and tick it again 1 hour later to see if the issue can be fixed.</p>
<p>3. Do all users in your client’s organization upgrade their Skype for Business client to the latest version?</p>
<p>4. Does your client’s organization deploy a Skype for Business 2015 server environment?</p>
<p>Any updates are appreciated.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>
        </p>

<p>hi mouran,</p>
<p>let me reply your questions:</p>
<p>1. yes, all 4 users in the organization encounter this issue. here is the screenshot ("kişilerim" stands for "my contacts"):</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d85f080d-fbee-4b02-8d97-e70ab5ae17ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd85f080d-fbee-4b02-8d97-e70ab5ae17ac" /></a></p>
<p>2. we did. we unticked that and waited for 24 hours before ticking it back. we also unticked "let people in your organization use skype for business to contact people in other organizations" and waited for 24 hours before ticking it back:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=317fa594-a25f-4c31-a252-54f86b8f76c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d317fa594-a25f-4c31-a252-54f86b8f76c0" /></a></p>
<p>3. they all have the latest version available.</p>
<p>4. they don't have any on-premises environment. only cloud it is.</p>
<p>also, if it helps in any way, their subscription is office 365 business premium.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Bruce,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the information. Since accounts from other Office 365 tenants work for this organization’s “Skype Directory”, the issue is probably related to the tenant itself. To check with it, when the four users login to other healthy tenant’s Skype
 for Business clients, does the same issue happen?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to rule out the possibility of network environment, please try a different network environment to see if there is any improvement. Also, please create a new user and assign the Office 365 license to check the results.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br />
Ran</p>

<p>Hi Ran,</p>
<p>We've already tested it as well. Problematic users cannot see "Skype Directory" even when they sign in to other healthy tenants' Skype for Business clients or try it with a different network. Also, just as I mentioned in my very first post, when a user from
 a different tenant signs in to the same Skype for Business client in this very network environment, "Skype Directory" comes up with no problems.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't think creating a new user and assigning a license to that would make any difference. They have got 4 different users, they have got 4 licenses, and all licensed users have got this problem. We also tried to unlicense/license a user for
 testing. It made no difference.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bruce</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>There are like 3-4 checkboxes we can tick/untick, disable/enable to make tests regarding this issue and we have tried them all. You know, that's all the settings for Skype for Business in Portal to let us troubleshoot the problem and they haven't helped
 at all so far.</p>
<p>No offense, but we've been waiting for a solution for 4 days here and all we've been told to do is ticking/unticking those checkboxes and doing the tests we've already done over and over again.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h3> electrojim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen font justification in Windows 10 with 125&#37; &#39;Change size...&#39;</h2>
                    <p>With both Windows Vista and XP before it, I elected to set my display to show text, icons, etc. at 125%.&nbsp; The setting is found under Display Settings after right-clicking the Desktop.&nbsp; This worked fine under earlier OS versions, but with Windows 10 the justification
 of fonts in certain applications is very poor.&nbsp; Text is readable, and does print just fine, but on the screen the character spacing is all over the map... extra space between some letters and others nearly overlapping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere along the line I came across instructions for 'optimizing' the typeface within applications, which I tried, but to no avail.&nbsp; As I type this posting into my browser, justification is fine.&nbsp; But other applications, such as my Windows Live Mail email
 client, and some other text-entry boxes via the browser, look terrible.&nbsp; Is there a fix for this?</p>

<p>Hi, Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>...and thanks for checking-in on this.&nbsp; The computer is probably just about a year old, and was used until just recently out in a lab, where this issue did not come up.&nbsp; It received all the MS updates prior to its relocation.&nbsp; Now the machine is re-purposed
 for my office desk, and I like the magnification because my monitor has better native resolution than my eyes.&nbsp; So I can't tell you if the problem was an issue beforehand or not.&nbsp; Here's what the screen looks like at the '100% (recommended)' setting.&nbsp; All
 is well:</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdc53fe9-4748-48ae-96b1-14638a9b5015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdc53fe9-4748-48ae-96b1-14638a9b5015" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here's the same message with a 125% setting:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88719806-a309-4405-9c4e-dae99102fa63" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88719806-a309-4405-9c4e-dae99102fa63" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as you can see, it's not a show-stopper, and if I print this text it looks just fine.&nbsp; I've taken these screenshots from your reply, as received in Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; I know I'm not supposed to be using this mail client, but it's my favorite and runs
 fine except for this.</p>

<p>Thanks, Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana abandoned my installation of Windows 10 shortly after I installed it, but installing another app and the whole Feedback Hub thing in general is really more additional work/complaining than I have time for.&nbsp; I'll just live with it for now and hope
 it'll get fixed someday.</p>

<p>Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine goes back and forth just fine.&nbsp; Right-click on your Desktop background image, rather than formally going to Settings.&nbsp; Once you get the little box, click on Display Settings.&nbsp; That's where the 'Scale and layout' selection is (and works!), at least for
 me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sure wish they'd fix that text justification issue, a large, high-res monitor sure makes icons and stuff small.&nbsp; I've tried doing the same thing by hand-picking an alternate resolution for my monitor, but that comes up fuzzy.&nbsp; Good luck!</p>

<p>That's crazy, Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something must be broken.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>While I had this page open, I tried it again here, and the print sure as heck changed sizes... from 100% to 125% and back, changing instantly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open that box again and go to Custom Scaling (in blue in my box), is there any figure set?&nbsp; There is not on mine, and as I change from 100% to 125% and back again in the main Settings/Display box, nothing appears different in the Custom Scaling box.&nbsp;
 If you do have something set there, maybe that takes priority.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried changing the screen resolution through the Resolution utility?&nbsp; Is yours set for the 'native' resolution of your monitor?&nbsp; Mine was not, initially, and once I set it for 1920x1080 (Recommended), the sharpness aspect increased, both at 100%
 and at 125%.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The last of the three minidumps would not download.</p>
<p>Since the machine is still under warranty you really should get Dell to fix the machine.<br />
<br />
Frankly I would backup the data off the machine in a redundant manner and then revert the<br />
machine back to out of the box state and if the errors still happen contact Dell Support to<br />
have them fix the machine. Doing this takes anything that you might have done out of the<br />
equation so Dell can't say it is something you have done.<br />

This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is "possible"<br />
that it is driver related (rare). Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory and cables (on<br />
both ends) - actually remove and replace&nbsp;- do not just snug. Make sure the system has adequate<br />
ventilation - add a small fan blowing into intakes. Carefully inspect the motherboard and other<br />
cards for damage. Pay attention to the <strong>fatal hardware error</strong>&nbsp;implication.<br />

            <font>The easiest way to enable Windows Mail in Windows
      7 is if you have access to a Vista machine. If not, see the links
      at the bottom.<br />
      <br />
      On the Win7 machine, find the "Windows Mail" folder in Program
      Files. Rename it to "OldWindows Mail" as a precaution. <br />
      <br />
      Using a Flash or CD, copy the "Windows Mail" folder in its
      entirety from the Vista machine.<br />
      <br />
      Go back to the Win7 machine and copy the "Windows Mail" from the
      Flash or CD to a location in Program Files. <br />
      <br />
      Open it and right click on the WinMail.exe file and send a
      shortcut to the Desktop. Done.<br />
      <br />
      <br />

            <p>I did number 1 with the flash drive. When I copied the file to my wndows 7 laptop. I opened it up to find "winMail.exe" the file on the windows 7 lapter does not say WinMail.exe, it just said, WindMail so I put a shortcut on the desktop. clicked to to open,
 but would not open. what happened is that little blue circle just went around and around Laptop would not work right. So I had to shut it down and restart the laptow to work right. What next? The other to things you say to do seem over my head.</p>

<p>Usually you would not open a CID attached file.&nbsp; Its an image file that appears in the email itself.</p>
<p>Some mail programs may allow you to double click a CID attachment and then decide to open its image - but that's not normal.&nbsp; It's also not safe to manually open if you dont know the sender as they can be nefarious sometimes.</p>

    <title>Weird Issue With Network Adapters and Bridging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hooboo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird Issue With Network Adapters and Bridging</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm on the latest Windows 10 Pro and running it on a mini PC which has two ethernet ports as well a WiFi card.
</p>
<p>I recently tried to Bridge my WiFi with the Ethernet 1 port so that I can output internet to a laptop through Ethernet 1 and still have internet on the mini PC (don't know if that was the right way to do it but I tried after reading about the Bridge Connection
 feature). A new adapter appeared, simply called Ethernet (see pic) and under WiFi it now said "Enabled, Bridged" but there was no internet detected on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/115aadd1-0133-4388-99e6-8694e83972d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/115aadd1-0133-4388-99e6-8694e83972d0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't wanted to mess with it any further and tried to revert back by selecting WiFi and Ethernet 1 again but strangely there was no "Remove Bridge" option as I was anticipating. Also, I can't delete the "fake" Ethernet port and disabling it stops internet
 connectivity.</p>
<p>So weird! Please help! Why does networking has to be so complicated...</p>
<p>

    <title>Xbox one will not restart after finishing initial update. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saloric  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one will not restart after finishing initial update.</h2>
                    
<p>After finishing the initial update (10-15 times last night) and about 6 times this morning, my xbox will shut off, tell me its going to restart, have a quick flash of the X on the actual console (this is telling me that it wants to start up but just wont
 get past the first second of it) and then go silent. I have tried all steps that have been offered to me.</p>
<p>-Unplugging cords for 5 minutes. (after about the 20th time i waited 30 minutes, to no avail.)</p>
<p>-Switching from wireless connection to hardwire straight to the router and back...No luck</p>
<p>-Power cycled the xbox to clear the cache...no luck</p>
<p>-Tried to manually restart it after it shuts down...no luck</p>
<p>-I also plugged into the wall, rather than the power strip....no luck</p>
<p>I have been very gentle and patient with my <strong>$600</strong> doorstop but everything I have tried seems to fail. I chatted with a support agent last night named Rye, they were very helpful but unfortunately I lost connection to them (likely due to the
 overwhelming of the support lines) and have been on hold waiting for a new agent for quite some time now.</p>
<ul>
<li>I also know that Microsoft had a 20-step instruction set to install the day one update offline and without an internet connection. This was called the
<strong>Emergency Offline Update</strong> If we were provided this, im sure it would work considering the only real problem I am seeing here is the hardware not wanting to restart.
</li></ul>
<p>I know I have the option to return it to Best Buy for a full refund for 15 days after my initial purchase, but that means I wont be getting an xbox one for maybe a month or more.</p>
<p>I would be very happy if someone from Microsoft could provide us with an option to get a quick replacement or possible reimbursement. This whole situation has been very disappointing, considering I sat outside in 15 degree Minnesota weather for 4 hours for
 this...</p>
<p>Any reply from Microsoft or anyone who knows of a way to fix this problem would be much appreciated.</p>
