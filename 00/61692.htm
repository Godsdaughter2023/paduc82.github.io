            <div>Hi Kim,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Did you make any recent changes to your computer after which this issue has started to occur?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If your computer has just been formatted, your computer might require you to insert the boot CD to be able to run it. You might hence get the error message<b> Disk Boot Failure</b>- I<b>nsert disk and press enter
</b>displayed on the screen every time you will try to run it. This might be linked to:
<ul>
<li>The boot options not correctly set in Basic Input Output System (BIOS). </li><li>A non bootable CD is found in your CD drive </li><li>You do not possess any bootable device </li><li>You have installed a new hard disk </li><li>The hard disk is not properly plugged </li><li>Your system files have been infected</li></ul>
<p>Check which one of these reasons could be the cause for your issue and post back with details to help us assist you better.</p>

            <p>Hi Streetz212,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting, I would suggest you to check for any settings, if any, within the iPhone (you may try and compare the settings with your wife’s iPhone,
 if need be) and check if you’ve accidentally missed out anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an Apple KB article that may just have the fix for the issue you’re facing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>iPhone or iPod is not recognized properly by computer when USB drivers are not installed properly or are out of date</b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1538</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the troubleshooting steps mentioned in the above article, in the order and check if your issue gets fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the steps mentioned in the above article do not fix the issue, I would suggest you to contact Apple Support:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>iPhone Support</b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/</a></p>

<p>Hope this information helps.</p>

                    <p>How have XBLPET not banned this guy ... He's abusive to everyone and yet despite many reports (we have a private FB group and at least 50 of us have reported him) he's still not banned?</p>
<p>
</p><p>He sends messages calling people the N word, saying black people don't matter, saying he knows where they live and he's gonna kill them, he even claims he's a "Convicted Killer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is he not banned with rubbish like this? (Not my photos BTW, came from the FB group)</p>

            The enforcement team doesn't use the forums and you can't call out people like that.The only option is to report the player and the messages, also block him. The amount of reports doesn't matter if they are not real reports, the enforcement team checks
 every report.

            Sounds like your motherboard has died. It could be the power supply but from your description of the symptoms I doubt it.

<p>===========================================</p>
<p>It may be worth a try to go to Control Panel and open your printer's </p>

<p>
</p><p>If it's set as 4x6 that could explain why you do not have other size </p>

<h2>            Computer Won&#39;t Start After Bios Update</h2>
                    I installed the latest update for Windows 10 on my HP laptop and all went well (1903). The next day it wanted to update the bios so I went ahead with it and the computer shut down so I thought all was good. WRONG-when I turned on the laptop the next morning
 it wouldn't even come on at all. There is power to it and it seems to want to turn on but never does. Has anyone had this problem and if so how did you fix it?

            Hi Pat.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you follow the steps given on the Download page or in the Download's "Read Me' file to correctly complete the BIOS Update?  Did you observe the Update complete and restart, see any prompts to do something else:  Can you enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to see if it needs to be reset to defaults, which is sometimes a step that's required after it flashes?  See how here:
<br /><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />You may need to reset CMOS to access the BIOS:  
<br /><a href="https://www.maketecheasier.com/how-to-reset-cmos-and-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.maketecheasier.com/how-to-reset-cmo...</a>
<br />
<br />If you're within a year of purchase you have HP Support included so you can contct them to try to help you.  This sometimes can be fixed by shipping it in to reflash the BIOS, if there isn't a method to flash it from outside of Windows.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power button on your laptop for 30 seconds 
<br />
<br />Re-insert the battery, if you removed it 
<br />
<br />Re-connect the power adapter

            Hi <br />
<br />
Thanks for your posting in Microsoft Community<br />
<br />
Have yo checked reinstalling USB driver<br />
which OS you are using currently<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>After plugging the pendrive in the device,</li><li>Go to device manager (In run type "devmgmt.msc") </li><li>In Device manager go to "<b>Universal serial bus controllers</b>" It should list the storage devices that you have connected to your PC.
</li><li>Right click and then click "<b>Uninstall</b>. Remove the pendrive and restart your system.
</li><li>Try connecting the device again</li></ul>

    <title>CPU Turbo Boost Disabled in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lecrzd  say:</h3>
<h2>            CPU Turbo Boost Disabled in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 on a laptop, I've noticed that my CPU (i7-4710MQ) no longer achieves its turbo speed of ~3.5 GHz. This occurs even with 'High Performance' enabled in the power options. CPU-Z indicates that the CPU multiplier
 is x 25.0 (Range = 8-35), so this must be what's limiting the CPU's performance.&nbsp; I am unable to change this setting in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to change this in Windows 10 or somehow remove this limitation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            Photo gallery does not import pictures in bulk</h2>
                    <p>Problem with Windows Photo Gallery- Original Title</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to&nbsp;import all of my photos from my iPad mini to computer using Windows Gallery.&nbsp; It used to work perfectly when I was using Windows 7.&nbsp; I don't know what is wrong with it now that my version is Windows 10.&nbsp; I have 9128 photos in my camera roll
 on my iPad mini.&nbsp; When I try using&nbsp;"import" in Photo Gallery, it won't import all of them like it used too.&nbsp; The first time it only imported 2551.&nbsp; I called Apple and asked them what to do and the tech had me try importing again.&nbsp; This time it imported 4514,
 still leaving 2063 photos still left on my iPad that have not been imported.&nbsp; I did not check erase after importing because I didn't want to lose any of them.&nbsp; The second time I went to import my photos, it started right with the jpg number it left off at
 and then imported until the error occurred again.&nbsp; If I do it a third time importing the last 2063, I don't see how I am going to remove the original 9128 from my iPad once I am done.&nbsp; It will take forever to delete them manually.&nbsp; Photo Gallery won't recognize
 there are anymore left to be imported once I import the final 2063, thus I won't be able to import them again&nbsp;so that I can checkmark the erase when finished importing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me.&nbsp; There is a problem with my Photo Gallery that needs to be fixed.&nbsp; I don't want to call and spend a lot of money talking to a tech on the phone,&nbsp; just to figure out what causing this malfunction.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I would like you to provide the information stated below</p>
<p>Can you provide the error that you received when you failed to import the pictures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I suggest that you refer to the link below and check if you are able to rectify the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Link 1: Import photos and videos from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT201302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT201302</a></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Link 2: If you can‘t import photos from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your computer</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204597" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204597</a></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Perform the above methods even if mentioned for unrecognized PC, as it might help rectify the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above did not work, I suggest that you try repairing Windows Photo Gallery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Navigate to <strong>Control Panel&nbsp;&gt; Programs and Feature </strong>and click on
<strong>Windows Essentials.</strong></p>
<p>2. Here select<strong> Uninstall/Repair </strong>from the option available on the bar.</p>
<p>3. In the new Window you will receive the option to&nbsp;either repair a particular app or all the elements of Essentials.</p>
<p>4. Click on the option suitable for you and&nbsp;follow the on screen instructions.</p>
<p>5. One done reboot the system and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I went ahead and imported the remaining pictures on my iPad mini to my computer using Windows Photo Gallery.&nbsp; I had the "delete after importing" checked, and got the error message again.&nbsp; I think the problem is that there were bulk photos still left in my
 camera roll and Photo Gallery couldn't&nbsp;remove the imported photos correctly because of the bulk photos still existing in the camera roll that could not be imported.&nbsp; I had&nbsp;the box check marked to delete the last 2083, I imported but it didn't delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the future, I will import more often and always make sure the box is check marked for "delete after importing."&nbsp; I've always had this box check marked in the past.&nbsp; I won't make that mistake again in the future, because it took a long time to manually
 delete 9148 photos from the camera roll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this will correct any future problems.</p>

            Hi,
<div>Some languages are installed by default, if your language of choice is not in the list of default languages then you need to download and install the MUI pack.</div>

            <p>System Restore should fix the problem.</p>
<p>When you install third-party software and drivers then good house-keeping is essential. You should note these details:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your suggestion. Unfortunately System Restore is not an option for me. I'll have to find another way to re-install or get hold of the driver.

            <p>Things get progressively harder with a double contingency: System Restore turned off and no backup of installation files. The following complex process illustrates what I mean. It restores your registry files to an earlier point in time. Maybe it will work,
 maybe it won't. It is fully reversible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />
2. Select Repair from the menu.<br />
3. Log on under an admin account if prompted.<br />
4. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
5. Select the Command Prompt from the menu.<br />
6. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall call that drive "Q:".<br />
7. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd&nbsp; /d&nbsp; Q:\windows\System32\config<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xcopy&nbsp; *.*&nbsp; Q:\MyRegBack\<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd&nbsp; RegBack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir<br />
8. Examine the dates of the Software, System and SAM files. Were the files created before or after you deleted the driver?<br />
9. If they were made before you deleted the driver then you can type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y software&nbsp; ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y System&nbsp; ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y Sam ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (the two dots are part of each command)<br />
10. Reboot normally. If things do not work out then you can backtrack by copying the original registry files from Q:\MyRegBack to Q:\Windows\System32\config.<br />

            Hi,
<br />How did you get previous Windows version? 
<br />If it was preinstalled you have no rights to use it after motherboard replacement unfortunately. 
<br />If you bought Windows in Microsoft Store or in local retail store you may transfer Windows to a new motherboard but may be need to call Microsoft support during work hours and ask a help from support person.

            Since you have changed your motherboard, this is a hardware change.
<br />
<br />1. If Windows was preinstalled i..e OEM version, then you can not use the license on another hardware. OEM license is tied to motherboard and if motherboard is changed, you can not reuse the same license on new motherboard.
<br />
<br />In this case, you need to buy a new license.
<br />
<br />2. But if it was Retail license, then you can follow the below process
<br />
<br />To Reactivate Windows 10 after a hardware change, refer to following Microsoft Help -

    <title>kb2919355 driver_overran_stack_buffer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            kb2919355 driver_overran_stack_buffer</h2>
                    <p>Lost a day and a half so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initial symptom is failure to boot. Blue screen with "DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER" as the only error details. No indication of which driver.</p>
<p>Was able to recover using a 5/5/2014 restore point, 5/10 failed. Didn't know at first that the problem related to update kb2919355, so after updating Visual Studio - which caused by 5/5 restore point to disappear - when kb2919355 automatically attempted
 to reinstall itself I was completely stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooted into safe mode. Made backups of what was on the boot (C) drive. Restarted and after the two reboot tries routine selected "Reset my PC" to re-install Windows 8.1 with Update downloaded from MSDN on 2014-05-25 and burned to DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initial clean re-install rebooted without problems. First attempt by Windows Update to install kb2919355 resulted in the same blue screen and error message, but ended up recovering with a note that only that update had failed to install. The error code ended
 with "841" I believe (hex). Not a value I was able to find in existing posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried again to install the update. The second time it claimed to have successfully installed, but on restart I was back to blue screen. This time terminally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So again I re-installed Windows 8.1 with Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time I'm not touching KB2919355 until Microsoft does some "s'plainin". Maybe the trouble is third party drivers. But there should be much better error reporting and recovery. This was a major pain. In addition to an explanation and appology, how about
 2.5 BTC for my lost time as well :-)</p>

<p>2. Checked only KB2267602, but found that KB2950153, KB2958262, KB2954879, and KB2899189 got installed as well..... rebooting. Failed after entering password. Succeeded on second try.</p>
<p>3. Same 5 updates still listed as successfully installed. Rebooting again. Failed again before entering password this time. Same error. Second automatic reboot attempt also failed. Same error. Third automatic reboot displays Recovery blue screen.</p>

            <p>On 4th PC Reset:</p>
<p>1. Immediately after completion of re-install, reboot (Windows-C,Settings,Power,Restart). Ok. Again. Ok.</p>
<p>2. Change to download updates only. Unchecked give me recommended updates "the same way I receive important updates" this time. The four that were installed without being requested were the four available recommended updates. THIS IS A BUG - THEY SHOULD
 NOT HAVE BEEN INSTALLED WITH KB2267602 in previous Reset.</p>
<p>3. Check for udpates: 16 important, 6 optional. For some reason Window key, "Windows Update" is now not displaying "Update Settings" and selecting "Windows Update" opens the control panel version instead of the Windows 8 version. Odd. Typing just "Update"
 shows both. Gear icon results must be Windows 8 UI. Control panel displayed an error trying to list the important updates. Suggested using Win8 UI.</p>
<p>4. Checked just KB2267602 again (Defender update file). This time important updates were not installed. Reboot test #1, FAIL. There's NO REASON updating Windows Defender should break the boot process!!!</p>
<p>=&gt; WINDOWS UPDATE ITSELF IS BROKEN.</p>

            <p>5th PC Reset Continued:</p>
<p>1. Installed Visual Studio 2013 Premium from an MSDN downloaded ISO file. Reboot test FAILS. PC is again unusable. Restarted in Safe Mode with Networking: "Update and recovery" Win8 UI screen has "Windows Update" choice, clicking on it seems to infinite
 loop, never get in to list if any updates were installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This PC has two video cards driving three monitors. That's the only non-original DELL hardware. After a "PC Reset" the OS typically first comes up on only one screen in low resolution. Twice, as soon as I started downloading and installing Chrome using IE,
 the video flickers and comes up on all three screens in full resolution. After that it looks good and stays solid. As long as I don't reboot. Coincides with the OS figuring out which graphics cards are really in the system (AMD Radeon HD 6800 &amp; ATI FirePro
 V4800).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the chance the the default video drivers are the problem, downloaded and installed current Catalyst drivers from amd.com prior to first reboot. Nope. Loosing track of how many "PC Reset's" its been. I think #6 happened in there.</p>

            <p>Finally learning something helpful:</p>
<p>1. c:\Windows\Minidump folder contains the dump files that get written each time the OS restarts.</p>
<p>2. A tool such as&nbsp;http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html is needed to easily determine which driver was responsible.</p>
<p>3. In my case it was AksFridge.sys, by SafeNet Inc. which was getting installed to handle a USB security key required by a software library I use. Here's hoping.... Just unplugging the device doesn't do it.</p>

            <p>PC Restart #7 (SafeNet HASP dongle removed):</p>
<p>1. Installed chrome and rebooted - OK.</p>
<p>2. Installed Defender update (...7602) - OK.</p>
<p>3. Installing all Important updates... OK.</p>
<p>4. Download and install version 6.62 of Sentinel HASP/LDK for windows: 2014-05-05 date: NOPE - Same DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER. Note, the USB key was not plugged in.</p>
<p>5. Can't run uninstaller in Safe mode... So how to disable the driver to allow a reboot? Changed the file name of c:\Windows\system32\drivers\AksFridge.sys... Reboot OK.</p>
<p>6. Changed the name back after a normal reboot and uninstalled SafeNet 6.62.</p>
<p>7. Installing recommended Windows Updates (four). Reboot... &nbsp;OK</p>
<p>8. Installed VS 2013. Reboot... OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Final analysis (?):</p>
<p>1. Windows 8.1 does a better job of detecting misbehavior by drivers, but it causes an OS restart, which leaves the user to figure out how to decode the minidump files to figure out who's to blame.</p>
<p>2. All "recommended" updates will be installed if you select to install any "important" updates when the Windows Update is configured to download but not install updates and the handle recommended updates the same as important option is checked. Expected
 behavior is to require explicitly checking them.</p>
<p>3. Exactly when Windows 8.1 became pickier about driver errors is unclear. It appears to at least somewhat dynamically detect and update drivers after startup (video drivers were updated after startup - a number of apparently unrelated actions causes the
 SafeNet driver to be installed after startup). It's possible that I worked for weeks without rebooting after the original 8.1 upgrade, with SafeNet installed and working, but it appears that something changed between May 5th and today to "break" living with
 what may always have been a "broken" (misbehaving) driver.</p>

    <title>Xbox One S&#58; Endless Loop Trying to Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> klytuslord  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One S&#58; Endless Loop Trying to Update</h2>
                    My Xbox One S failed during its auto-update and no longer boots up into anything beyond the "Something went wrong" screen. As such, I have downloaded the update to a USB drive and followed all of the steps to get an offline update done, but this fails
 every single time, repeating the cycle. I am posting here, because everything that is found on standard Microsoft troubleshooting articles has already been tried several times, i.e. soft reset, hard reset, factory defaults, offline update, etc. If you can
 link to an MS article, then it's been tried, and it has failed. What I am hoping for is an actual new thing to try. If someone out there with this problem (including normal "solutions" failing) has found a way to fix it, please post your steps. Thanks!

    <title>Bluetooth Connection results in Blue Screen Error&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lalalola_986  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Connection results in Blue Screen Error&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a pair of bluetooth headphones. They connect to my computer fine, and I can usually reconnect them if the headphones have been idle for a long time. There is a problem that exists once I turn the headphones off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turn the bluetooth headphones off, it is extremely difficult to reconnect. The headphones will be "paired" and start connecting, but they will never finish connecting. When bluetooth devices do this, I usually click "Remove device." But after a while
 of trying to remove it, I will get the message "<strong>Driver Error</strong>" and the bluetooth headphones will stay listed under bluetooth devices. (I then go to device manager and try to uninstall the headphones from there, but it just loads and loads and
 will not uninstall).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way for this to stop is to restart the computer. However, the computer gets stuck restarting. I then get a blue screen, with a message along the lines off "Driver_Power_State_Failure." After restarting, the headphones disappear from the list of
 devices and connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened at least five times. I only get the blue screen if I restart after the bluetooth driver error message. I don't have any other bluetooth devices to test with to see if it is the headphone's fault.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

    <title>Computer crashed &#43; screen error when starting up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisenium  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer crashed &#43; screen error when starting up</h2>
                    <p>Earlier today I was in the middle of a game (Sims 4, not exactly graphics intensive) and my screen suddenly went grey with many vertical lines. Here is a picture:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e588699-b4ef-499c-b00f-2754ade94575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e588699-b4ef-499c-b00f-2754ade94575" /></a></p>
<p>I had spotify on in the background which kept playing, however I was unable to do anything on the computer, no response to ctrl alt del or anything, so I had force shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing this, my computer as it booted, had these strange red lines as seen here:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9699a53-3a2a-4cad-a793-400001c27d21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9699a53-3a2a-4cad-a793-400001c27d21" /></a></p>
<p>After many attempts of booting and trying different things the lines are now solid red like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69249fba-2fd2-4516-a84d-d459f97ea92a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69249fba-2fd2-4516-a84d-d459f97ea92a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, once I get past boot and to where the computer normally starts log in, I get again a screen full of veticle lines. Usually they are green like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/abfd832b-d312-4288-a6d8-80426e3c7d0f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/abfd832b-d312-4288-a6d8-80426e3c7d0f" /></a></p>
<p>I have tried many thing and did manage to log in to the computer in safe mode and suddenly there were no lines. When I restarted after than I manage to log in properly and see my desktop, but after about 15 minutes the screen just spazzed out and went all
 glitchy (screen image was cut in half and on the wrong side) and then again the verticle lines appeared and I had to force shut down. I then AGAIN went into safe mode to have a look at my display drivers and this time the red lines persisted till log in and
 while I was working in safe mode. I cant tell if the lines are red really or if they are just inversing colors?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c6bd3fd-e4b6-4ce2-854c-7e20d4ff1db2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c6bd3fd-e4b6-4ce2-854c-7e20d4ff1db2" /></a></p>
<p>I have been doing many searched for hours and trying to figure out what the problem could be. I tried different RAM, tried a different screen, different HDMI wire, tried turning off any overclocking on the GPU, completly cleaned up the inside of the computer
 and reapplied thermal paste to areas that needed it, did a system restore back to 4 days ago, tried the boot up repair, tried slotting the graphics card into the other PC-E slot. None of this has helped.</p>
<p>What I am wondering is what sort of problem this is? Lately I feel like my computer has been getting pretty hot, even when I'm not doing much, but VERY much so when playing games, no idea if this is related.. Is this likely a hardware issue (if so what could
 be the cause?? I can't really afford to just trial and error with replacing all parts), might it be an issue with a recent Windows update, could it be a driver issue? I think everything I have is up to date, I did a factory reset of my computer 2 months ago
 and updated everything then and it was working beautifully for a while.&nbsp;</p>

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1. When (approx. date) did you purchase (build?) the computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.
<br />
<br />7. When (exact date, preferably) did you do the "factory reset?"
<br />
<br />================================================
<br />Marking one or more of my replies as ANSWER at any point will officially close (end) your thread, whether your problems have been resolved or not. HELPFUL votes very much appreciated at anytime. Thank you.

<p>1. Early 2012 was when we ordered it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It came with Windows 7. We updated directly from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. It was custom built by Computer Planet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Nope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Nope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. It's version 10.0.15063</p>

            1. What third-party anti-virus application was installed on the Windows 7 computer when you upgraded to Windows 10?
<br />
<br />2. Did you choose to upgrade the Win7 computer to Win10 manually or was the upgrade offered AND INSTALLED via Windows Update?
<br />
<br />3. Did you do a "factory reset" [which would have left you running Windows 7 again] or did you Reset Windows 10 in late August?

<br />~~~~~~~~~~
<br />
<br />PS: If you're running Windows 10 Version 1703 OS Build 15063.0, I suspect you may have done a Repair Install [AKA In-place upgrade] of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Note: It's 21:00 where I live so it must be 02:00 where you are. I'm shutting down for the night - and you should, too! &lt;wink&gt; See you sometime "tomorrow" if not later.

<p>First off, when we did the reset, we did a proper wipe and reset. We deleted everything (wiped the hard drive), kept no files and redid the partitions. We then reinstalled Windows 10 from a USB drive using a boot media. So is it still relevant what was there
 when we updated from Windows 7? I mean I'll add the relevant info below, but let me know if what I said above changes anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Our PC came with Panda anti-virus pro 2012, which we immediately uninstalled. Since then we only had Windows Defender (it was called Security Essentials back then I think).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Yeah, we did it via the offer and Windows Update back then, but after the reset it was as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. See above. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what you mean by "In-place upgrade" and that bit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for taking the time to help. Have a good evening!</p>

<br />
<br />You did a clean install of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />1. Your Win7 computer came with a specific set of hardware drivers five (5) years ago. Did you install those drivers (i.e., from a disk or set of disks Computer Planet gave you when you bought the computer) after you did the clean install of Windows or...?
<br />
<br />2. Assuming you can do so =&gt; What happens when you run a manual check for updates? If any updates are offered, will one or more of them successfully install?

<p>1. No, when we clean installed WIndows, pretty much all the drivers seemed to have automatically been detected and installed on the computer. We made sure they all were updated, and any that could not be detected we manually downloaded from the manufacturer's
 website. The one driver which seems to have an issue is the "co processor". I will include some screen shots as to be honest I'm not sure what this is and I can't figure out how to update it..</p>

</p><p>2) I'm not sure if this is related to the fact that I can only go on the computer in safemode (with networking), but I followed the instructions you gave and nothing happens when I try to go to the Windows Update tab. It just loads endlessly..</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a0fed04-4965-4c23-95d3-6e03a42871e5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a0fed04-4965-4c23-95d3-6e03a42871e5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also a small update, the number of red verticle lines has increased to 5 instead of 2, while logged in to safe mode..</p>
<p>Thanks for the help so far, hoping it's possible to get to the bottom of this!!</p>

            The clean install of Windows 10 in August installed default drivers for Win10 Version 1703 (i.e., brand-new computers which came with Win10 1703 preinstalled). They date from late March 2017. Those drivers weren't necessarily compatible with your five (5) year old, custom build computer.
<br />
<br />I think you're seeing the effects of incompatible hardware drivers - which is also having an effect on Windows Update (i.e., no updates have been installed since you did the clean install in August). That latter, especially, is NOT a good thing. [1] A (literal) clean install of Windows 7 then another upgrade to Windows 10 may be your only recourse here. [2]
<br />
<br />Q: Did the custom-built computer come with a set of disks (CDs or DVDs)? There should be a Windows 7 disk as well as one or more disks containing drivers for the hardware Computer Planet used.
<br />
<br />PS: The computer's long out of Warranty but Computer Planet may be able to help you anyway. Try reaching out to them.
<br />
<br />================================================
<br />[1] IMPORTANT! =&gt; The computer should NOT be connected to the internet or any local networks for extended periods (i.e., more than a minute or two) in its current state. All business &amp; personal data (including online banking &amp; credit-card passwords) should be considered at-risk, if not already compromised. 
<br />[2] You have a "digital entitlement" to Win10 which is associated with your Microsoft account - that'll allow you to upgrade again.

<p>Ah, OK! So two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Considering it worked for 2 months after the clean install, wouldn't this problem have cause issued much sooner?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. And if I do a clean install of Windows 7 and then upgrade to Windows 10 is there any point during that progress where it will not allow me to access safe mode? I worry that in case this does not fix the problem I will be stuck with the computer needing
 to boot as normal to finish the install, and thus loosing the ability to at least use my computer in safe mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will probably try this tonight, hopefully it will work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for taking the time to help me get this sorted.</p>

<h2>            How do you update a file on a CD-RW and burn the new information to that CD</h2>
                    When I install a CD-RW disc into my disc drawer on Windows 7 program I get a dialog box asking me if I wish to see the contents or Files on the CD. I click open and the files are listed. I select the file which appears on Word Pad. I make additions to
 the File and then click Save and a page appears with the file name at the bottom of that page as well as Rich Tech Document on the line below. I brought Documents up on the screen as well and I have tried to impose the saved document on Word Pad to my Documents.
 I see a shortcut file appear on Documents but, it does not burn properly even when a dialog box says it will replace any file on the Disc with the same name. Even though the shortcut file has a more recent date on it it does not replace the file on the disc
 with an older date. can you help as I never had problem with my Windows XP system.<br />

            You were probably packet writing to the CD. It is not a good idea to use CDs like a floppy drive. Use a flash drive instead..

<p><span>I own&nbsp;Lenovo S100 laptop with a preinstalled Windows 7 Starter. Recently it has been upgraded to Windows 10. I had an app/program viz. IIFLTT, which&nbsp;is used for trading shares in stock market.
 This app/program was installed with Windows 7 Starter but after upgrading to Windows 10, I continued to use it without any difficulty. Last week the share trading app/program has been upgraded&nbsp;and I have to install this upgraded new version of the&nbsp;app/program,
 which works on .NET version 4.0. The older version did not work on .NET. &nbsp;I have to uninstall older version of the program before installing new one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I uninstalled&nbsp;the older version of app/program using Control Panel and deleted any remnants by editing registry till it has been completely uninstalled.&nbsp;Then when I tried to install the
 new version of app,&nbsp;I read a message on the screen stating&nbsp;' <strong>another version of this product is already installed. Installation of this version cannot continue. To configure or remove the existing version of this product, use Add/Remove Programs on
 the Control Panel&nbsp;'</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The older version of this app is no more&nbsp;in Control Panel and I have also edited the registry several times to ensure that it is not in&nbsp;it as well. But I am still not able to install the
 new version of the app/program as the same message keeps appearing on the screen and I cannot proceed further with the installation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I request your assistance so that I may install the new version.&nbsp;</span></p>
