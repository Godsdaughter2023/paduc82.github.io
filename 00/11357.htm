<p>The Feedback Hub is for People to give feedback for Windows 10 and all the stuff that Microsoft engineers are working on.</p>
<p>When you go into the Feedback Hub there is a big box under Feedback.</p>
<p>The note in the box says "Give us feedback to make Windows better".&nbsp; It says nothing about Office type software.</p>

            <p>OK thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wasn't that way in June when I&nbsp;first configured W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was going over the new type apps back then</p>
<p>I saw this and wondered why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled for confirmation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to be this way but:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 32 incremental image backups from when I first</p>
<p>installed W10 and began configuration in June. I have</p>
<p>a boot manager. I could restore an early image into</p>
<p>another partition and boot it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably not worth the effort as it is fine now.</p>

            Hi Richard,<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are having a synchronization problem on MSN, there's a possibility that you just need to rename the .sdf (sync files) from the database folder on your computer. Before we proceed with any troubleshooting, we advise you to sign into http://www.outlook.com
 with the problem email address and password and check to see if you are able to view your emails. If you see them on the Outlook.com website, then it’s a problem with MSN email synchronization process.<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
&nbsp;

            <span>Thank you very much Jenicel for your very helpful response. &nbsp;I am able to view my emails on Outlook. &nbsp;So it looks like maybe the problem
 is with the MSN email synchronization process. &nbsp; What should I do now? &nbsp; Again, thanks, Richard</span>

<h3> denmarfl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where can I Download a copy of Office 2010 H&#38;B, can I save to CD</h2>
                    <p>Purchased a New Win7 64bit Pc from dell.&nbsp; Purchased this PC with Microsoft Office Home and Business 2010 which of course was an extra charge. To my surprise when I opened the Box and checked out all that was included, I did not have Microsoft Office Home
 and Business 2010 Discs. Included with my Dell order was a card that had&nbsp;the Software's required product ID number which I had to enter when I opened Office for the first time.</p>
<p>I contacted Dell tech Support and asked about the Install Discs and was told that if I needed to re-install Office I would be required to go to the Microsoft Office site and Download the Office Home and Business 2010 trial version....and once that trail
 version was installed on my PC I would use the product ID number I have and the Trial version would no longer have time constraits.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1) is this really how it works? No longer do you get the Install Discs?</p>
<p>2) When I download the Trial version, can I save it to my PC to burn a DVD, or, will it only let me RUN and Install office ?</p>
<p>3) What I saw at the Microsoft site was to download Office 2010 and use it free for 60 days....this would be what I do....then enter the Product ID Number?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>4) What do I open on the trail version to enter the Product ID?&nbsp; Help???menu and there will be a menu item to enter Product ID?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is sure different; when I purchased 2003 and 2007...I got the install discs.........</p>

            The activation process reads a bunch of configuration information from your computer, thinks like OS, CPU ID, MAC and several other pieces. It then "encodes" the information using a "hash" formula that protects your identification. The generated hash value
 can (in theory) only be produced using one specific set of inputs.&nbsp; So yes, they can identify that the activation is associated with one computer. When you try to ACTIVATE on a different computer, or after you do MAJOR upgrades to your system, the generated
 HASH value will not match original and the activation won't be allowed.<br />
<br />
This next link describes in more detail what goes on in the activation process:<br />

The "one" computer installation used to be limited to the OEM license. With 2010, MS rolled out the "new &amp; improved", "cheaper" Product Key Card license.&nbsp; Originally the limitations were really understated.&nbsp; The packaging, and marketing has been tweaked a little.
 But, people are blinded by the "cheap" price and don't fully understand the limitations that come with the discount.&nbsp; They forget the motto, "<span style="font-style: italic">if it looks too good to be true, it probably is!
</span>".&nbsp; I have to admit, I almost fell for it myself.<br />

            Very frustrating - I can get into my secondary MSN email account but not my primary email account.&nbsp; When I call MSN support, it says it doesn't recognize my billing phone number even those I have a paid account with that phone number,&nbsp; I won't let me talk
 to a live human being because it doesn't recognize my account phone number - very frustrating...

            <p>Welcome to my world, I have had a problem for the past week!&nbsp; I use the Butterfly account which shows both my active MSDN e-mail accounts,however I have not been able to get into my @msn.com only the @hotmaoil.com and then it askes me for my password each
 time I do something.&nbsp; I have had the Butterfly account since MSN came uip with it, and the Premium since it started two years ago, now the entire thing is garbage while at the same time they damn gmail for google, what's it all mean?</p>

<p>Have few questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Since when this started happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Have you tried reverting back to previous version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) What type of Account is it? Exchange, O365 or IMAP/POP Account?<br />
</p>
<p>4) If we configure a new profile and then configure a test account in the new profile does that exhibit the same error message? it could that your account might be having some corruption in the inbox that could be causing this issue. may be there could be
 a lot of folders which might be the cause of folders not getting synchronize here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please share above detail so that we can troubleshoot the issue accordingly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I think you're right.&nbsp; I'm on the Insider Preview on my test desktops and the release version on my desktop, but not the release

            <p>Apparently it is either very big or very complex or both.&nbsp; It took my Release Preview system over an hour to get it done and I have a fairly fast internet connection.&nbsp; Also that computer uses SSDs so an hour is a big deal.</p>

            I did restart. Afterwards, Windows update showed the failed install when I checked.&nbsp; When I hit Retry, it proceeded to check what it had, apparently, while using&nbsp;little bandwidth,&nbsp;and then carried on with the download from the same % it had before, finally
 now&nbsp;using my full Internet bandwidth.&nbsp; Even so, it is still only up to 63% downloaded now, but at least it is coming in as fast as possible (which for me is only 5.2 Mbps max).

    <title>Macro to Add Hyperlinks Based on Cells - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Macro to Add Hyperlinks Based on Cells</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
I have an issue with Excel not adding hyperlinks to an exported document I'm getting from other software.
<br />
<br />
Issue: I am exporting a massive excel sheet from Crystal Reports, has over 10,000 rows, 5 columns. Column D is a list of file locations, they are showing up as non hyperlink. If I click on the cell and push enter they remain as no hyperlink BUT if I double
 click into the cell (to where the cursor shows up) and then push enter, they get the correct hyperlink set.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I want to do is one of two things:<br />
<br />
a. Make the hyperlinks just work right away, I've checked all the options and the auto format hyperlinks is on, so it's an issue with an exported document, if I type in the exact same addresses they work no problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
or even better:<br />
<br />
b. Create a macro to where I can make the hyperlinks work. I'm running into issues because of two things:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. As far as I can tell you can't past into a hyperlink using a macro, using the normal paste into active cell doesn't work<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The other option is just to automate the "double click" function into each cell, unfortunately when I'm recording my macro I'm seeing that it's not detecting a double click, instead it just shows me single clicking on a cell which as I said above, does
 not activate the hyperlink.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />

<p><br />
Use an adjacent column and the HYPERLINK formula.&nbsp; A lot faster than debugging code and then having to deal with macro warnings and down-the-road maintenance issues.</p>
<p>Suppose col. F is empty and that your data start with row 2 with row 1 being a header.</p>
<p>Then, in F2 enter =HYPERLINK(D2).&nbsp; Copy F2 as far down as you have data in A:E.&nbsp; The fastest way to do this is to move the cursor over the bottom right of F2.&nbsp; The cursor will become a solid plus sign.&nbsp; Double-click.</p>

<p>There seems to be a long term and unresolved systemic issue. </p>
<p>Many users are reporting the same thing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It is up to Instagram to make their system work with Hotmail/Outlook.com not the other way around.</p>

<h2>            Excel VBA - FYI, if color&#47;highlight rows for used range works except for certain cells</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a code that colors used range of rows where the hub name changes or where the Week column changes within that hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the table below, I've bolded the rows that are green, but the last 2 cells&nbsp;<strong>(CELL SHOULD BE GREEN)&nbsp;</strong>wouldn't be colored green, and I didn't know why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried removing the color for the whole data set (by the way, this data is not in a table), and I tried highlighting the data set and chose Clear Formatting and then rerunning the code and it didn't highlight those 2 cells.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What worked for me is to convert the data range to a table via CTRL-T or INSERT/TABLE and I removed the automatic coloring under DESIGN/TABLE STYLES/NONE (choosing no table style). When I reran the code, it worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes that happens with data sets. I guess after copying/pasting and formatting data a lot, Excel gets messed up and doesn't include certain cells. I forget about the Table feature, and one of the experts online says to use the Table feature if at all
 possible, so here is another reason to, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Asifjanjua,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for all information in the private message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have checked them again and the new migration user still got the same error. Since you migrate users from third party servers and the error is “Transient error FolderHierarchyContainsMultipleRootsTransientException
 has occurred”, the issue is related to the folder Hierarchy. Based on my knowledge, the fold Hierarchies of some third party’s servers are not compatible with Office 365 servers. Therefore, you cannot migrate them via IMAP. Given the situation, please use
 pst to migrate users as a workaround. I know it is not a convenience workaround. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Erick</span></p>

 to see what happens after inserting the final controls tonight.</p>

<p>the quick "repair office" "solution" did not work, but just forced me to go through a lot more password mumbo-jumbo to recover my Outlook mail.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Dear Redmond folks, PLEASE tell me you have a solution for this. I can't add calendar invites and my corporation schedules hundreds of meetings for me each month. This is really painful.&nbsp;<br />

I REALLY DON'T WANT to post this absolutely insane notice (who wrote this?) to my 10K+ LinkedIn fans, but if I have to do one more day of this time-wasting pain, I will. Then I will get someone high-level to fix this. Why do we have to be so confrontational?
 This is not the Microsoft that really cares for its users.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>It sounds like you have more than one version of Office&nbsp; installed on your computer.&nbsp; You need to specify which version of Office you have installed.&nbsp; Please check to see if you have more than one version of Office installed.</p>

<p>You may not be having the same problem as I did, but here goes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was finding that (Office) files some people sent me had a different icon then the old.&nbsp; Instead of the little green 'X' icon for excel, they had a red, squarish icon. (O365?).&nbsp; &nbsp;When I double clicked the red ones, it would give me the message you got -
 "You have a newer version of Office installed" - with no hint at a solution, except to remove the 'newer'.&nbsp; The green "X" Excel files, double clicked to open, just fine.&nbsp; Workaround:&nbsp; If I saved the 'red square' files, then went into Excel, I could open them
 no problem at all and they worked fine.&nbsp; But that's annoying of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what seemed to fix it.&nbsp; Right-clicked on one of the 'red square' icon Excel files.&nbsp; Selected "Open with" on the pull-down, and changed it to Excel 2016.&nbsp; And it magically changed all the files that had the red square icons to the old Excel green icon.&nbsp;
 Will prob have to do it for Word and PowerPoint too, but it seemed to work, now the open with a double-click works again, especially helpful for email attachments (subject to the usual cautions against double-clicking suspicious ones!).&nbsp; Note that I tried
 to do this change in Settings, it wouldn't even give me the option to.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, hope that helps you or someone else!&nbsp; Cheers.</p>

    <title>IM Sound for Skype &#40;Desktop&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dandos40  say:</h3>
<h2>            IM Sound for Skype &#40;Desktop&#41;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Is there an option to have any default sound at all for incoming/outgoing IM using Skype (Desktop)? (recent/ current/ new/ sent message)</p>
<p>I am not getting, nor can I figure out how to get IM sound. Calling sounds are ok (calling, receiving calls, speaking, hearing other side).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried:</p>
<p>- reboot</p>
<p>- reinstalling the Skype</p>
<p>-&gt; combination of the above as well</p>
<p>- playing around with "Audio &amp; Video" (playback device), "Notification" + restarting skype after making every change</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: <br />
1) Disable "chat notification" settings, sign out <br />
2) sign back in to Skype,&nbsp;enable "chat notification" settings again -&gt; test<br />
3)&nbsp;<span>sign out +&nbsp;</span><span>sign back in -&gt; test</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- changing Windows sounds (also trying "Troubleshoot sound problems")</p>
<p>- changing "Skype for Windows 10" sound settings</p>
<p>- checking&nbsp;<span>power and volume levels -&gt; put everything on max (still no sound for "incomming IM")</span></p>
<p><span>-&nbsp;</span><span>'Get notifications from apps and other senders' is ON + Skype itself notifications ON (banners on as well, priority set to High)</span></p>
<p>I am using Skype for Desktop version 8.27.0.85 on Windows 10 Pro (x64).</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<p>Please let me know how to make IM make ANY sound when I get a message.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

            Hello Dandos.b I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am sorry to hear you're having this difficulty. I know it is very frustrating.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Skype version 8 is still under development and is lacking many of the features and functions that users have come to know and expect.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, Microsoft is expected to begin rapidly releasing updates for Skype 8 in the very near future. These updates will bring features and functionality back to the level that users know and love.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to Classic Skype it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br />I hope this helps you. Please let me know if I can offer any further assistance. I do hope you have a great evening.       
        </p>

            Currently, those options aren't available...yet:
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

    <title>Can&#39;t Setup Outlook.com Account - OST Not Recognized&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jl.ak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Setup Outlook.com Account - OST Not Recognized&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I've finally decided to dump Google and get myself a fancy new Outlook.com account! But I've been having a bear of a time getting all of my emails transferred over. Trueswitch just doesn't work for me (no matter what I try, it refuses to recognize my
 gmail password. But that's neither here nor there), so I want to add both accounts to Outlook 2010 and just copy over the messages manually. The gmail setup worked just fine, looks like all my emails and contacts are showing up great in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to add my Outlook.com account, however, things go awry. I've downloaded the Hotmail-Outlook Connector (64-bit) and ran through the setup. I already have an exchange account, so I'm trying to add the Outlook.com account under the same profile (i.e.,
 File&gt;Add Account. My gmail account was also set up this way). The initial setup process goes swimmingly - I configure it using the Connector option, it accepts my name/email/pass and says it's successful. But when I try to open the account, Outlook throws
 an error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The set of folders cannot be opened. The file C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\&lt;account&gt;.ost is not an Outlook data file (.ost)."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've check and the file does indeed exist, though it's at 0kb (I only have 5 messages in my Outlook.com account right now, but the ost should still be a bit bigger than nothing). I've tried deleting the OST, removing the account altogether, reinstalling
 the connector plug-in, all to no avail. Scanpst.exe cannot recognize the file and says the data is unrecoverable. I've tried creating a new profile with only the Outlook.com account, but that throws the same error. What the heck is going on here? Am I missing
 something obvious?</p>
<p>Thank you all for your help!!<br />

            Thanks, Diane, for your quick response! I like your thinking, but an unfortunate no to both questions.<br />
<br />
I tried running Outlook as admin and opening the mail profile I already had, which popped up the same error. Also tried running Outlook as admin and creating a new mail profile with just the Outlook.com account, which also gave the same error.<br />
Compatibility mode was not enabled (and never has been, as far as I'm aware).<br />
<br />
<br />
But your admin question gave me an idea - I tried logging into my computer as a different user (non admin), and it worked! I was able to set up the Outlook.com account under a different Windows user on the same computer. I was also able to set up the Outlook.com
 account on a different computer using my regular Windows user (a local admin)! So I guess that means there's something up with my Windows user profile on my computer? But I can still add any other account, just not Outlook.com...<br />

            Yeah, something is wrong in the windows account, I just don't know what. I thought maybe folder permissions on the folder where the ost is kept. But run as admin should have worked.

<p>
</p><p>Just a warning I am a noobie so may have to go into detail about what I need to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been stuck on build 10130 for over a week now trying to upgrade. I am on the fast ring and it continues to try upgrading to 10166 but never succeeds. I have looked at endless forums, blogs and videos and am at my wits end. I have done several things
 so far that have worked for other people with the same problem but haven't succeeded so far still looking at 10130. I have always made sure I am logged in, changed time, language etc to suit. I reinstalled 10130 again to try and fix the problem. Deactivated
 my firewall and other antivirus. Not sure what else to do. I have read about mounting?? not quite sure how to do this. Or just wiping and starting again. Please help</p>

            <p>I'm no tech expert by no means - I had (have) the exact same problem (no builds worked after 10130) using a g3258, and I'm not the only one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our 'temporary fix' is enabling only ( 1 ) core in the bios <strong>[ </strong>
I have no idea <em>WHY</em> <em>the h*ll </em>this works <strong>]</strong> this has allowed the system to install and update normal all the way up to 10240, but we're stuck using the just one core until hopefully a fix comes along - enabling the second core
 at (any time) causes a re-startup loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this will help you or is even if we really do have the same problem. &nbsp;No answers coming down from the top, my only conclusion so far might have something to do with a mid-June update&nbsp;<strong>KB3064209&nbsp;</strong>(??)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck, and I really do hope you don't have my problem :)</p>

</p><p>Just a warning I am a noobie so may have to go into detail about what I need to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been stuck on build 10130 for over a week now trying to upgrade. I am on the fast ring and it continues to try upgrading to 10166 but never succeeds. I have looked at endless forums, blogs and videos and am at my wits end. I have done several things
 so far that have worked for other people with the same problem but haven't succeeded so far still looking at 10130. I have always made sure I am logged in, changed time, language etc to suit. I reinstalled 10130 again to try and fix the problem. Deactivated
 my firewall and other antivirus. Not sure what else to do. I have read about mounting?? not quite sure how to do this. Or just wiping and starting again. Please help</p>
</blockquote>
<p>try going into services, turn off windows update service, then turn back on, set to auto. it may take up to 24 hours before getting the next build. it may work or it may not as some have gotten updates while others didn't. I did an it took almost 20 hours
 to get it.</p>

<h2>            NOKIA N97 CHARGING PORT BROKEN&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    
<p>HI ALL,<br />
<br />
I have a Nokia N97, the charging port as broken, so i require this to be replaced....<br />
<br />
I was wondering is the charging block (available from ebay) connected with a screw or is it attached to the main pcb (motherboard) of the nokia headset???<br />
<br />
Will this be covered under the warranty at all???<br />
<br />
The Headset was given as a birthday present.... so will this be okay?????<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind Regards<br />
<br />

<p>Attempting any self repairs involving disassembling of the phone will void your warranty and forum rules forbids discussions on anything which may result in the voiding of warranties.</p>

<p>Hence, I only suggest that you get it repaired at your nearest Nokia Care Point.</p>

            They will be able to look up the warranty based on the serial number, which will tell them when the handset was manufactured. If the Care Point isn't being unreasonable (it's sad but it happens sometimes) it should be covered under the warranty.

<p>You should ask CPW and the Nokia Care Point for a quote. I the man time, you could also contact Nokia Care using the "Contact us" tab to the top right of this screen to see if there is anything they can do for you. Physical damage is always is tricky one
 because it is very difficult to prove it wasn't due to misuse, but no harm trying.</p>

            When you say you reset the HTC, did you perform a full factory reset of the device or a soft reset of the device.<br />
<br />
Did you delete your existing syncing partnership and set it up again?&nbsp; What syncing software are you running on your computer (ActiveSync or WMDC)?<br />

<h2>            Office 365&#47;Windows 10 - Need VBA or Shortcut Key to Open Hyperlink in Excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi All -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies if this is a silly question, I am having a harder time than normal finding a solution online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet with multiple links to other Excel spreadsheets. I want to open these links with keystrokes. I have looked at several options on Stacked Overflow (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28188425/how-to-open-hyperlinks-in-excel-without-mouse-click-is-there-any-shortcut-key-k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>)
 and elsewhere. The only options I have run across don't work:</p>
<p>- Using Menu Key, O, O (the second O goes to Sort, not "Open Hyperlink", in fact, I don't see an "Open Hyperlink" option anywhere in 365)</p>
<p>- VBA to activate link is unresponsive</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only VBA that <em>sort of&nbsp;</em>works tries to open the file in Chrome.&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code>Sub ClickHyperlnk()
'
' ClickHyperlnk Macro
'
' Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+d
'

With Selection.Interior
    URL = ActiveCell.Value
    Shell "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe " &amp; URL, vbNormalNoFocus

End With

End Sub</code></pre>
<p>If anyone can advise how to tweak the above code to open in Excel, or has any other solutions I would very much appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>WLM to Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dixr_at_hotmail  say:</h3>
<h2>            WLM to Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have read everything that I can find about the conversion (Editorial comment - STUPID thing to do. If you can code Outlook 2016, you can modify WLM to work with a new format. MS just wants to force us to a product inside their new pay-to-play structure).</p>
<p>I use about 10 different email addresses. I have over 10GB of emails (200,000 files, 1,200 folders) stored in my Personal Saved folders, which because I am where there isn't always internet connection I access offline as well as online.
</p>
<p>You can not convert your WLM store to Outlook/Office 2013, so it looks like I will have to try 2016.
</p>
<p>Q#1) Will I still be able to keep the structure that I have established and keep the files on my computer, or will I have to store it on Microsoft's servers. It worries me that I may have to stick something on someone else's system.&nbsp; I don't care how secure
 things are supposed to be, the only real security is physical possession.</p>
<p>Q#2) The instructions to get the contacts over to Outlook include exporting the contacts to a CSV file. As I have used that format within WLM, I can guarantee that not all the data in your contacts will come over. For example (and I have not compared field
 by field on every contact I have), the BIRTHDATE field is not exported. There is no column in the exported file that contains the data. Has anyone else found this? Is it being addressed? I checked the box for ALL FIELDS when I exported the file.
</p>
<p>Q#3) What about coverting the RULES that I have in place in WLM and Outlook.com?</p>
<p>Q#4) What about all the email addresses that I have blocked (or marked as SPAM) or marked as OK? How do I bring those over too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found anything else to watch out for?</p>

            <p>Palcouk, Lets start out simple. The HOTMAIL that I have that is still inside the account is fine. What about all the mail that I have dragged to my offline folders. What do you suggest that I do with that? If you think that I can just drag my offline folders
 back to an online location, remember I have over 1,200 folders, 200,000 email files, and 10GB of offline emails in my WLM Store. The organization of my offline folders is by topic and dates, not anything that has to do with the original email, the Sender,
 Recipient, Subject or Message. It is a subjective choice made by me as to where it is placed.&nbsp; I often used the FIND command to locate a document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brian, it doesn't work for me.</p>
<p>Outlook 2013, WLM 2012</p>
<p>I have set Outlook as my default, closed and re-opened both applications. (WLM asked if it should be the default mail program and I said NO).</p>
<p>I go in to WLM, to FILE, then Export Mail and select Email Messages.</p>
<p>It gives me the choices of Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Windows Live Mail formats. I select Exchange. and click on NEXT.</p>
<p>I get a pop-up "This will export messages from Windows Live Mail to Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Exchange". I click OK.</p>
<p>Pup-up: Microsoft Office Outlook - "Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request. Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client."</p>
<p>Didn't I just do that?</p>
<p>I click on OK as it is the only choice.</p>
<p>Popup window - Export Messages - "The export could not be performed. An error occurred while initializing MAPI." I click on the only choice: OK.</p>
<p>I am back to the Select Program choices of the format I want to export to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I close both mail programs and then re-open WLM and make it the default again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brian, also I think you missed the note that I made that the mail in my Storage Folders - Personal Saved is not associated with ANY valid email account. Many of the email accounts that were active when the email was received have been closed. These folders
 are offline. All the documents that I have seen imply that I put these emails back into the email account and do not keep them offline.&nbsp; In&nbsp;most offline&nbsp;folders the&nbsp;contents are from MANY email accounts.&nbsp;They must remain offline and not on some MS server,
 just on my machine.</p>
<p>Because of the length of the file names I can not put them in the standard location. I have created a WLM STORE folder very close to the root of the drive where the data resides. Where will Outlook try to put my offline email? Will each email still be searchable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next suggestion or what did I miss, or have I found another thing that is broken in MS code (Yes, I have found many 'brokens' and have caused HOT-FIX's and patches&nbsp;to be created before.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANYONE WANT TO JUMP IN HERE? </p>

</p><p>#1 - What bit level of Office is installed &nbsp;(32 or 64bit)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just did a quick test before replying here exporting from WLM 2012 on a system with OL'2016 and everything worked exactly as expected so suspect that the error may be due to 64 bit having been installed</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Ignoring all else, just to bring this on point, questions about the WLM export process should be posed in the WLM specific forum (this forum is for Outlook (desktop) - the WLM export is initiated from WLM - not Outlook - so if there is anything that
 needs fixing - it would have to be done from the WLM side (but wouldn't expect that there would be any updates to WLM). The folks who focus on WLM will be found at:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>at the same time...................when it comes to Outlook.com and WLM - there are changes applicable to the migrated Outlook.com accounts in terms of being able to be used by WLM.&nbsp;</p>

<p>#1 - Yes, I have the 64-bit Office software installed. Why should it matter. I have other 64-bit applications installed and I am running on a 64-bit Windows 7 platform? Are you saying the there is a bug in the 64-bit office application? Then Microsoft should
 fix it.</p>
<p>I do not have access to a Office 2016 or another 2013 load (32-bit) The 64-bit software was provided to me, I do not have the activation keys. What do I do?</p>
<p>(And before you say to go online for my free year of 2016, it requires a credit card be registered at the Microsoft Store and I don't have a credit card, only a local ATM card that does not work for online purchases) Where I live I cant even access the internet
 every day - the worst internet access in the world I am told.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 This is the forum that I was directed for all things relating to WLM being shut off from handling the new Outlook things. I have just a few days to get this working. HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole problem is to get my WLM accounts AND ALL THE OFFLINE DATA (in the WLM Store on my hard drive) moved to the new Office Outlook environment before the system shuts down.
</p>
<p>AND I DON"T WANT IT LOADED TO SOME ONE ELSES SERVER or Cloud account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You refer me to the article about WLM2012 not working with Outlook any longer. I know, that is what I am trying to take care of.</p>
<p>I keep getting referrals to that article, that is where I started. Why do you always refer people to information that they have already gone through, give us fixes to our problems, not old news.</p>

<p>
</p><p>#1 - There is nothing to fix - 64bit and 32bit applications cannot be used together - doesn't matter what the combination of applications happens to be and absolutely nothing to do with a deficiency in MS Office/Outlook - it's the way the world works. To
 put this another way, a 32 bit application can't integrate with a 64 bit application and vice versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - As for being directed to this forum for "all things WLM" - sorry but this forum is for Outlook (desktop) - not WLM and your question is about
<strong>exporting data </strong><strong>from WLM</strong> &lt;to&gt; Outlook. When another application exports data - the control resides with that application - not the other way around, in this case, Outlook itself is not remotely involved other than the other
 app (in this case WLM) using Outlook data files. Have given you the forum where WLM questions should be directed and if anyone in that forum sends you to this forum then feel free to refer them to this post because they have no clue as to what your question
 is about or how things work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short - at a minimum, your issue resides with using 64bit Outlook - change back to 32bit Outlook and your problem will likely go away since, as I have already stated, I had no problems exporting data from WLM to 32bit Outlook on a quick test before I
 posted my previous reply but by the same token - I don't use or focus on WLM.</p>

            <p>When given a choice, all the software that I have loaded has been 64-bit software. Nothing has intentionally been loaded with 32-bit software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say to 'change back' to Office 32-bit, I have never had a 32-bit version of Office 2013 loaded on this machine.&nbsp; Where do I find it and will I have to enter an activation key? I don't have it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(You say that I should be entering this into the WLM forum, but they only say to export and what to click on, they don't seem to know about a problem in how to export the WLM Store.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can help me get the right version of Office Outlook running, then maybe we can move past the WLM/Outlook and who is responsible question. (Why can't Microsoft's left hand work with the right hand to solve this?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If/when the 'correct' version of Outlook be installed, will all of the parameters and options still be there, or do I have to set everything&nbsp;/ Office&nbsp;all up again?&nbsp; Is there a stand-alone&nbsp; 32-bit version of Outlook&nbsp; so that I don't have to totally mess up
 my computer's configuration?</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEXT QUESTION - Assuming that with your help I get Outlook (32-bit) out there someday and I can export and then import my offline emails. Where will the emails reside on my computer? How can I specify where the offline store will be kept?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where will all of the Outlook Email support files be kept on my computer? (contacts, rules, safe and&nbsp; blocked lists)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reassure me that these emails will not be going to some server somewhere. They are not affiliated with any current email address, but many contain information from old email addresses that are now defunct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have to move each individual folder or can they be moved as an entire structure? I do have 10GB, over 1100 folders and about 200,000 emails in my offline store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another question:</p>
<p>I read that to move the CONTACTS, I should export them from WLM as a CSV file. I have copied my contacts to a CSV file before and then reloaded it. Not all of the data is exported when using the CSV format (I did check on&nbsp; the ALL FIELDS option). Specifically,
 I know that Birthdate did not cove over, I am not sure if other fields were left behind.</p>
<p>Is there a way that you are aware of that captures ALL of the data in my old Contacts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>other Question:</p>
<p>How do I export and then import my thousands of Blocked and Safe email addresses?</p>
<p>How do I export and then import the RULES that automatically send certain emails to certain email folders (online and offline).</p>
<p>How do I export and then import the SIGNATURES?</p>

            <p>Karl:</p>
<p>You said - "I don't use or focus on WLM."</p>
<p>This is an editorial comment***************** Be on a computer that has old software but works just fine and then have some mega-company come along and want to extract just a few dollars per month (annually or monthly) when the family is living below the
 poverty line, on a fixed income, or all the working members of the family are making around the local&nbsp;minimum wage.&nbsp; We can't afford to subscribe to get new software. We have to exist on the old stuff.
</p>
<p>I would guess that the primary reason that you don't use WLM is because someone set you up with OFFICE suite and it is free to you.</p>
<p>I know, I can use Outlook.Com, but I can't seem to access multiple email accounts and I have not figured out how to keep an offline store of old messages, as well as many other things that WLM gave us for FREE.</p>
<p>If you want to argue that the company needs to make money, fine, but the company was built on the backs of people that wrote code to make the world a better place to live. ALL companies should have ways that the less-fortunate can apply to get FREE and REDUCED
 COST products, including Microsoft. </p>
<p>I could not afford to live in the USA any longer and earlier this year moved to a "third-world" country where the cost of living is just a fraction of what it is in the USA. For internet I am piggy-backed on free Wi-Fi and lucky if I get 1.0 download and
 .25 upload speeds. I still am not making ends meet and am looking for a job&nbsp;here. BTW, the daily wage around here is $7.00 per day, and the people work 6-days a week. Microsoft wants people to pay 3-4 days wages every month&nbsp;just to license OFFICE?&nbsp; That is
 immoral.</p>
