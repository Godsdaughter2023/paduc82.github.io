<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t start &#47; Recovery won&#39;t work &#40;0xc00000bd&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've upgraded to Windows 10 a couple of months ago and recently had a system crash after which nothing seems to work anymore... (no new hardware or software that I'd be aware of)</p>
<p>Now whenever I try to start Windows, I get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0xc0000001</p>
<p>The PC couldn't be startet properly / The PC needs to be repaired</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm supposed to use recovery tools. Unfortunately, I didn't create one earlier, but using a second PC, a Win10 iso and rufus, I created a recovery USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I boot from this USB drive, I get a Windows logo for a couple of seconds, before going straight to a blue screen again with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0xc0000225</p>
<p>Your PC needs to be repaired</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further action results in 0xc00000bd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All it says is to use recovery tools from installation media, which I thought I was already doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I've successfully run is a Windows memeory diagnostics which didn't find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have no idea what else to do. It won't even let me reistall - with the added challenge that I naively didn't note down my new Win10 Product-Key back when it was running.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Lukar</p>

            <p>Hello Eeshwar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you! Your suggestion led me to try flashing the BIOS first of all, which fixed the entire issue without any recovery or repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I assume it had something to do with the hardware configuration in the BIOS or something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I'm glad that the issue is gone, could you offer any clues to what might have caused it and how to prevent it in the future?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

<h2>            Office 2007 SP3 update repeatedly offered after showing successful install</h2>
                    <p>original title: Office 2007 SP3 update problem</p>
<p>At the end of Oct, I download and installed Office 2007 SP3.&nbsp; When I check the ABOUT menus, I verify that SP3 is indeed installed.&nbsp; yet Windows update keeps presenting an Office 2007 SP3 update to me (and it is 80MB LESS than the what I downloaded and applied
 originally, yet has the same exact name!).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, I know about ignoring updates.&nbsp; But doing that doesn't solve the problem or answer the question posed.</p>
<p>AGAIN - WHAT is the difference between the previous Office SP3 version at 360MB and this Office SP3 version at 280MB?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>And why doesn't Win update recognize that I already have Office updated to SP3?<br />

<p>No, it's not a joke and some people are not kidding.</p>
<p>For example, I have 36 boxes (1 teacher's and 35 students') in service with very special software for specialist's retraining, that was developed under W2K. I don't know who developed this software, but all my attempts to transfer (reinstall) this soft on
 XP or Vista or W7 failed. The only solution I found is to make full backups of all 36 boxes. The soft is sertified at state level.</p>
<p>So I pray every day that there is no some specific hard drive binding inside it. Unfortunately students uses USB flash cards in the learning process, so my second pray last day is that nobody of students will bring me a new version of ransomware today.<br />

<p>A suggestion for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few years ago, a client asked me to look at saving the life of a very important but quite old specialist machine tool in their factory. The control system was using 2 Windows 3.1 PCs.&nbsp;The custom&nbsp;written control system software would not run on&nbsp;Win9x or
 later OS as it was&nbsp;hard coded for the specific PC and graphics card. The company were desperate to find a solution because the machine was going to be very costly to replace and with a 2 year lead time so they needed to buy some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These legacy PCs had no USB ports and only floppy drives (long since broken) for backing up so the company had always struggled to back them up&nbsp;were therefore very vulnerable to hard drive failure. Also, the PCs kept breaking down and spares were really
 hard to get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what I did was virtualize the 2 Windows 3.1 PCs complete with their application software and ran both of them inside a single modern PC. The one application required LPT port support and so was run in MS Virtual PC and the other had some special graphics
 modes which required VESA emulation so I used Oracle Virtual Box for that. I got the 2&nbsp;PCs to talk to each other via a virtual network and was even able to access them remotely through the host for backing up. Also we were able to protect the host PC with
 a UPS which would not have been possible with the originals (at least not with controlled shutdown anyway).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, could you not do something similar. From what you describe, your WIndows 2000 PCs and custom app are&nbsp;not using any special or dedicated hardware so could you not virtualize them in a VirtualBox VM and run them inside new PCs. Yes, if the Windows 2000
 system is accessing the internet/network, it would still be vulnerable but at least it would be running inside something that is fully protected and patched and would be very easy to&nbsp;backup and/or recover in the event of a problem.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Bamboo Ink Won&#39;t Pair with the Levono Yoga 730-15IKB</h2>
                    Hi, I just recently bought this Levono laptop and I purchased the Bamboo Ink with it so that I would be able to use the ink features with the touch screen and draw and such. However, I can not get it to connect to my laptop at all. I do not think that
 there is anything wrong with the pen as I am able to connect it to my&nbsp; iPhone's Bluetooth but it is not compatible with the product. I do not think that there is anything wrong with my computer as it is brand-new and seems to be picking up other Bluetooth
 devices but I just can not seem to get it to connect. Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

            Hi Sierra
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Hold down both of the stylus' side buttons for two seconds to switch between modes of compatibility ("Wacom AES mode" indicated by one blink of a blue LED light behind the two side buttons, and "Microsoft Pen Protocol" indicated by two blinks). Switching from the default compatibility setting of Wacom AES mode to Microsoft Pen Protocol should fix it.       
        </p>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />The Bamboo Ink works on Windows devices with Wacom Active Electrostatic technology (AES) and/or Microsoft Pen Protocol (MPP). In general, the integration of the Bamboo Ink will vary slightly depending on your hardware configuration and system software installed.
<br />
<br />If switching between modes of compatibility is not working, your Wacom Bamboo Ink, there's a chance that it might not work with your Levono Yoga 730-15IKB. 
<br />
<br />Check for Wacom issues here:

<br />
<br />Levono Yoga 730-15IKB is not in the list of compatible tablets:

    <title>Black Bars added on clips with Pan and Zoom Applied - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Black Bars added on clips with Pan and Zoom Applied</h2>
                    I was editing a movie using pictures, and i added pan and zooms to the clips, then saved the file to work later, the only problem is now that the clips still pan and zoom, but include black bars with the pan and zooming. The only one that doesn't show
 black bars is the Pan Left/Right in the middle, everything else shows the black bars, and it's rather annoying. Is there any way to fix this?

            <p>A&nbsp;few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are the dimensions of your photos?</li><li>What is the aspect ratio of your project (4:3 or 16:9)?</li><li>Are any of these photos in a vertical (portrait) orientation?</li></ol>
<p>Black bars are added to images that don't fit within the aspect ratio of your project.&nbsp; Most cameras take images that are in a 4:3 aspect ratio.&nbsp; If your project is a widescreen (16:9) aspect ratio, you'll see black bars.&nbsp; Similarly, if you have vertical
 (portrait) orientation photos, they don't fit perfectly into a horizontal aspect ratio of your movie.</p>
<p>One workaround is to edit the photos (crop them) to the same aspect ratio as your movie.&nbsp; I can't give specifics until I get your answers to the questions above.</p>

            They're standard 4:3 and they're normal Landscape orientation. Some of the pictures I load in will work fine, the others will letter box with no apparent reason, even though they were taken with the same camera and same settings.<br />
<br />
When I opened up the project this morning, some of the pictures that were affected are now normal again, but some are still letter boxing.

            Can you provide some more details? Are you working on a 4:3 or 16:9 project? What are the exact width and height of your picture in pixels. What's the name of the specific Pan &amp; Zoom transition you are using. Do you see black bar on the top/bottom or left/right?
 And does it start with black bars but then zoom in?

<h2>            Nvidia nForce 680i SLI on-board Ethernet Port not detected by Windows 7.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I've just done a clean install of Windows 7 and I am finding it impossible to install nvidia's updated drivers for the motherboard. I've downloaded the drivers, but when installing them, I only have the option to install the 'Nvidia Storage Driver'. The&nbsp;.exe
 does, indeed, include the ethernet drivers. It's Windows 7 that isn't allowing it to be installed when installing the .exe that is available from Nvidia's site.<br />
<br />
Any help would be great, as I know many people on the Nvidia forums are having the same problem.<br />
<br />
Edit: also, in my BIOS, there is no option to enable or disable the onboard NIC.

            I worked out what was wrong a while ago, I have the Abit IN9 Max32 680 and hopefully the problem is the same fix for you basically when you uninstall the drivers from previous versions, check the back of the computer, there are two lights next to the ethernet
 port a top one which is Green and an Orange one at the bottom, after you uninstall the drivers it stays lit up Orange at the bottom of the port, it seems to go into some sort of suspend mode and no matter how many times you try to install the drivers, it won't
 allow the networking controller driver to install, what works for me is to uninstall your old drivers then completly shut the pc off for 5 mins and remove all cables from all ports, then switch on again and check the lights at the back, they should both be
 unlit, then go ahead and install the new driver package and then it should now allow you to install the NIC driver, it always works for me, the bug seems to be NIC goes into suspend mode on uninstall of drivers, and doesn't stop su

            i had the very same problem but simply switching the pc off for five minutes is not a solution. the problem lies with the 680 chipset ethernet driver. here are the ones you should use.<br />

            <p>I had the same problem too. The way to fix it is to go to control panel/ hardware and sound/ device manager. Then scroll down to where the exclamation mark in a triangle is, right click on it to highlight, then left click to uninstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then all you have to do is install the latest drivers which are and always will be now, nForce 15.58. Reboot and voila!</p>

<h2>            MyPhoneSupport technical service</h2>
                    Has anyone done business with MyPhoneSupport Technical - ConsumerSoft?&nbsp; They claim they are 24/7 tech support, antivirus, clean up etc. and that they provide services that Windows Defender does not via Windows 10.&nbsp; I had them for 2 years and they talked
 me into 2 more years at $169.00.&nbsp; I spoke to Microsoft and they did not recognize the name MyPhoneSupport, but Microsoft does provide clean up - might do for free and might charge for it.

            Did you call them or did they call you saying they were Microsoft/Windows support?
<br />If they phoned you then they’re probably scammers.
<br />If you phoned them did you believe you were calling Microsoft or did you know they were third party support?
<br />Windows Defender is enough for most people, you can add another on-demand scanner or Malwarebytes pro if a user prefers a second opinion.
<br />Tbh if you get hit by malware &amp; MB or Defender doesn’t stop it there are free dedicated removal forums available.

</p><p>Recently just a couple weeks ago my laptop went laggy when on battery (not just laggy , everything is not responding and my cursor is gone so i cant do anything) lets say my laptop freeze while on battery . And i tried to open windows menu by pressing the
 windows logo in my keyboard and its so slow like i have to wait 10 seconds before the menu appear . I tried to fix it myself and find out that Microsoft ACPI compliant battery method is the cause of it , i disabled it and my laptop went back to normal (uninstalling
 it also fixes my laptop but after i restart the laptop the driver is back) but because i disabled it now i dont know the percentage of My battery . Third party applicatipn like battery bar also wont work (well i guess thats because i deleted the driver that
 detects the percentage of the battery and third party application r using it too to read the percentage) please help me guys! (Whether if you guys help me to find out how to fix the problem without removing the microsoft ACPI compliant battery or you guys
 help me to find a new way to detect the percentage of my battery without ACPI Compliant battery&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Steven, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />It's possible reinstalling the latest ASUS drivers for your power settings could fix the issue. Here's a download link, where you can find ASUS Power Scheme under the Others subheading. You'll need to expand the Others section to see the rest of the downloads:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Laptops/ASUS-TUF-Gaming-FX505/HelpDesk_Download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.asus.com/us/Laptops/ASUS-TUF-Gaming...</a>
<br />
<br />Install that, then reboot, and see if the problem is fixed. Otherwise, you could also run the Power troubleshooter by searching Start for Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go! Thanks!

<h2>            After Chkdsk, Folders are missing or hidden &#40;space seems occupied&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have had a problem with an external (usb) HDD after chkdsk /F:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an usb HDD attached to a Windows 10 system. It is 1TB Basic, Primary partition,&nbsp;NTFS formatted.</p>
<p>At some point it disappeared from File Explorer. Disk Management was showing a Raw device (of the correct size). After a chkdsk /F, the drive reappeared in the File Explorer with the correct total and used/free space size... (pretty similar to what the chkdsk
 output said)</p>
<p>But, when opening the folder in File Explorer, it shows <strong>much less files (at least 2 huge folders are missing)</strong>:<strong> only 144GB</strong> worth of Data shows in there. (Command prompt in the folder shows the same)</p>
<p>Rerun <strong>chkdsk </strong>without options and gave me the same report:<strong> 817GB out of 931 are used leaving ~114GB free</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>So, I am missing ~670GB of used space (thousands of files and folders under at least 2 "parent" folders).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Three more details: </p>
<p>1. both parent folders that I've noticed missing had titles in Greek: one at root level, the other a subfolder of one of the remaining root folders.</p>
<p>2. Windows complains that Recycle Bin Folder on the Drive has been corrupted. It shows 0 size.</p>
<p>3. There are two found.000 and found.001 which are reported as empty / zero size but also not accessible. When accessed through an Elevated Command Prompt, I can see a lot of folders (dir00xx.chk) which seem to contain at least some of the lost data</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what happened and how I could retrieve these Folders?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Stavros</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            I don't know of any way you can easily undo what chkdsk did. Use the elevated cmd prompt to copy your files out of those folders, and then I guess you'll have to laboriously rename them (the
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/40822-chkdsk-log-event-viewer-read-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
chkdsk log</a> might help with names) and confirm your data is intact. Based on what you describe though you might not get 100% back because something seems to have corrupted the file system on the drive for sure. (Later once you've backed up your data elsewhere
 you can try running <em>chkdsk /r</em> on the drive or better still the drive manufacturer's utility to check for bad sectors.)

            <p>Thanks, I have already evaluated this path, which is ... well, laborious and, for that size of data, leaves quite some uncertainty: you just&nbsp;can't manually&nbsp;check all the files... especially if you don't know what caused the problem in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I was hoping for some utility or method, related probably to the apparent common cause for the problem: is it a coincidence that both directories that disappeared (for sure) were (the only ones) named in Greek, possibly not UTF-8 but some other coding
 (ISO or even older, I do not know for sure and do not know how I could check that)</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, consequent chkdsk reports the disk OK so, I do not know if there is a point to perform a repair afterwards?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One element that I did not mention is that this is a Disk that was prepared on a Windows 7 System ages ago and then&nbsp;was placed in a Media Server Box (Xtreamer) and I was managing (move, copy, rename, delete, New Folder, etc.) that as a Network attached Disk&nbsp;(some
 implementation of CIFS) from various networked devices (Windows, Linux, Android).</p>
<p>The problems started when I accidentally deleted (remotely) a bunch of files and directories. As there is no Recycle Bin to restore from, I took the disk on the Windows systems to try to recover what was possible. I found what was deleted, made a list and
 decided not to restore because I would have to manually rename everything, etc. So, apart from analyzing the Disk with various tools and copying deleted files on another external disk, I did not attempt any modification / repair, whatever on the Disk.</p>
<p>One day later, before returning the disk to its original place, and without any apparent cause, the system lost site of the Disk which led to running chkdsk /F and from there you know.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

            Hi Rebecca, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />In the seconad Command window, run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />select volume D
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />remove letter=D
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt 
<br />
<br />That's It!

            Microsoft is aware that previously-hidden partitions are improperly being assigned drive letters after installing the April 2018 Update.  As a result, they now appear in Disk Management and File Explorer.  These partitions are typically recovery partitions used by the Windows Recovery Environment or by the Original Equipment Manufacturer.  It is not recommended that you attempt to delete or reformat these partitions as this may have adverse effects on your ability to recover Windows.  Microsoft is currently working to address the issue in a future Windows Update, and we’ll update this thread when a solution becomes available. 
<br />
<br />(Update 5/14/18:  The solution that will soon be released via Windows Update will only prevent this issue from occurring for devices that install the April 2018 Update after the solution is released.  If you've already installed the April 2018 Update and are experiencing this issue, you'll need to follow the steps below if you want to hide these partitions.)
<br />
<br />Although you can safely ignore these partitions, if you prefer do away with the low disk space warnings and hide the partitions so they no longer appear in File Explorer, you can do so by manually removing the partition’s assigned drive letter.  To do this:
<br />
<br />1. Select the Start button, type cmd and then right-click Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />2. In the Administrator:  Command Prompt window, type diskpart and press Enter.
<br />
<br />3. Type list volume and press Enter.
<br />
<br />4. Make note of the volume number for the drive letter you want to remove.  For example, if the drive letter you want to remove is Drive “D”, note the volume number for Drive D.
<br />
<br />5. Type the following command, and press Enter. 
<br />
<br /> select volume &lt;volume number&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;volume number&gt;, substitute the volume number you made note of in Step 4.   In the example above, if the volume number for drive D is 5, you would type: select volume 5
<br />
<br />6. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />
<br />remove letter=&lt;drive letter&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;drive letter&gt;, substitute the drive letter you want to remove.  In this example, you would type: remove letter=D
<br />
<br />7. Close the Command Prompt window.

<p>I just bought a Surface Pro 6 (i7-8650U - 16 GB RAM) and can't stream HDR content towards a 4k OLED LG monitor.</p>
<p>My monitor is capable of HDR, since I use it with my XBOX ONE X (the HDR icon correctly appears).</p>
<p>I have connected that monitor to my surface pro 6 (using the same Xbox one x cable and TV port) and indeed I can see that the PC is able to select 4k 60hz, so cables and tv are fine.</p>
<p>Then I enabled stream HDR on the HDR settings in windows.</p>
<p>After that I installed the <span>HEVC codecs from the Microsoft store as suggested in:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4040547/windows-10-display-requirements-hdr-video</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>after all this I still can see 8 bit color depth in my advanced display settings for the 4k external monitor instead of the required 10 bit color depth for HDR.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know the integrated Intel UHD 620 can stream hdr but all the suggestions didn't work.</span></p>
<p><span>what did I do wrong?</span></p>
<p>

    <title>why can&#39;t I see files on other computers using homegroup&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            why can&#39;t I see files on other computers using homegroup&#63; I&#39;ve done everything including paid MS to fix it which they don&#39;t seem to be able to do.</h2>
                    <p><strong><em><u>Why can't I see files on other computers using homegroup? I've done everything including paid MS to fix it which they don't seem to be able to do.</u></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am the administrator on all my pc's. Still cannot get HomeGroup to work.. I can see, read and write the files of my other 2 laptops from the desktop pc which is the computer connected by ethernet and which is where the homegroup was created but the 2 laptops
 can only see the libraries on the desktop. They cannot see, read or write the files on the desktop.</p>

<p>I have done everything, including paid MS tech support, TWICE, to fix the problem. They have been working on it this time for 2 days and still can't solve the problem. Up until last night 9/4 I could at least print to the shared printer, connected to the
 network through the desktop but after the MS tech guy worked on the issue for 4 hours on 9/4 I can no longer print from the laptops. I don't know what the HE double hockey sticks he did and I doubt he does either. He finally decided to tell me that it is a
 Windows 7 Professional file corruption issue and I would need to run the OS disk to do a repair or would have to reinstall the OS completely. However, he could not tell me what file or files ae corrupted so he is blowing me a bunch of smoke. That is what it
 always comes down to when tech support can't figure out the problem, reinstall the OS. I can't tell you how many times over the 30+ years I have had computers that I have been told to reinstall the OS and usually it doesn't fix the issue either.</p>

<p>I wish MS would go back to the way XP shared files and printers. It may have a been crude and litte more difficult but at least it worked. I am so fed up with MS I can taste it. I have 3 Dell PCs, a Mini1012 purchased in spring 2010 with still 900+ days
 of service ( bought an extended contract since it is just a mini), a Dell XPS8300 Desktop which in most respects is awesome except in file and printer sharing but that is the fault of MS not the machine. It was purchased May 2011 and has all the bells and
 whistles. It's awesome except for the OS. I purchased because the Dell 810 laptop I was using for a desktop replacement couldn't be upgraded any more and I wanted dual dvd/rw drives and one to play Blue-Ray and I wanted USB 3.0 ports, and a TV tuner. Lastly,
 I have a Dell XPS15 with pretty much all the bells and whistles because well, my Mini is, well a Mini and because I have grandkids that when they are over want to play on the PC even though they have 3D DSi's :-). Again except for the OS it is an awesome laptop.
 A little heavier than I would have thought but it is awesome. Looks very industrial and all business with the brushed aluminum top and rubberized bottom. It's not one of those new cutzy print covered laptops you see these day.</p>

<p>Anyway, I digress. MS!!!! get on the stick and develop a product that works the way it is intended. If you start doing that then you won't have to spend a fortune making cute commercials to compete with the Mac. Which by the way if I didn't say it earlier
 I will be purchasing next time if I live long enough or the grandkids break one, knock on wood, I guess. :-D.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We aren’t sure what troubleshooting steps technician has performed, let’s start with basic networking steps.</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b></p>
<p>You may start your computer in safe mode with networking.</p>
<p>Start your computer in safe mode</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b></p>
<p>Try accessing the problem computer using IP address or computer name.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Start.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Run</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type \\ipaddress or computer name</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><b>Method 3</b></p>
<p>Try to disable Router Firewall. If you’re aware of.</p>
<p>Note : Firewall can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>

Tried all the above nothing worked. Even tried reinstalling OS on all computers still would not work on&nbsp;all computers all the time. In fact the issue of which computer could share it's files would change from the XPS15-L521 to XPS8300 and vice-versa. I even
 paid for Dell's premium Tech Concierge service over $384 and after&nbsp;5 days begining last Friday, September 7, 2012 and ending today Tuesday, September 11, 2012 the Tech Concierge team was unable to fix the issue. I even paid for Microsoft Tech Service over
 $105. including tax and the tech tried for one night, promised to call back and he tried me once while I was at my grandson's track meet but I've been able to speak with anyone since. I am deeply, deeply disappointed in Microsoft and Dell Corportations. Both
 entities are aware of the 1000's if not 100's of thousands of users having is this issue and they refuse to fix it. In fact, Microsoft continues to tout HomeGroup as some magic pill that render file and printer sharing as easy as clicking on a few check boxes,
 verifying the Network Type (Home, Work, or Public), making sure each computer has an unique name and that each computer is sharing the same Workgroup and Wala file sharing bliss will be yours. Well, nothing could be further from the truth. I throw Dell in
 the indictment because Dell is complicit in the cover up.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>George</p>

            <p>Here is the text of the chat I had&nbsp;with the Microsoft about the HomeGroup. I am posting this in hopes that someone from Microsoft will decide to step up and take ownership. Not much here but lots of connects and reconnects and you can see he worked on the
 problem over 6 hours. I wasn't exaggerating.&nbsp;At the end his&nbsp;promise to call back&nbsp;which he did.&nbsp;However, I asked him not to call back next day because the Dell rep said it would take 2 days for the software to arrive. What did he do, He called back anyway and
 I wasn't home. Anyway, here it is. I apologize for lenght but it was necessary to make the point.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Setup file doesn&#39;t ask for product key</h2>
                    I already have a Windows 8.1 Pro Upgrade installation installed. I bought a 64-bit OEM Windows 8.1 Pro disc to make a clean install of Windows. However when i initiate the Setup file from this page:<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media<br />
<br />
It never asks for a product key, instead it asks it after i have created the boot media but it's already prefilled the product key i am using with this copy which is the Windows 8.1 Pro Upgrade installation i am using now.
<br />
<br />
I intend to do a UEFI installation that's why i need to do a clean install. <br />

http://www.goldshell.com/pedit/</a>&nbsp;if you would like to give it a try. </p>
<p>Don't forget to contact vendor to find out if their software is supported under Win7 64-bit,&nbsp;and you can also try installing it in 'compatibility mode with WinXP'. To do this once file is saved to your local drive: right click it-&gt;Properties-&gt;Compatibility
 tab-&gt;choose OS mode required. May also require to be run as administrator (check the box at the bottom Compatibility tab).</p>
<p>After installation do the same for the source program file before you run it for the first time.</p>
<p>BTW 'copy con' command explained in <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/edithlp.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.computerhope.com/edithlp.htm</a>&nbsp;works fine under Win7 64-bit. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Greetings.</p>
