<h2>            PDF files won&#39;t delete and I can&#39;t save over them</h2>
                    <p>While I realize that others have posted this same question, I've decided to basically post pretty much the same question since it has yet to be resolved.&nbsp; Simply put, why can't I save over or delete certain pdf files?&nbsp; It's not all of my pdf files that are
 like this either.&nbsp; My only solution has been to save as another name, however, I have to end up saving as a third name since it won't let me save as the previous name.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when it comes to deleting, I CAN delete a file, however, when I return to the containing folder it comes back again... It's kind of frustrating and surprising that no solution has come up for this problem.&nbsp; If it has please send me a link to that Microsoft
 community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>KR</p>

            Haven't tried that yet.&nbsp; I will give it a try and if it works I will mark this as the answer.&nbsp; I did install the latest and greatest adobe reader and I was able to delete one file somehow.&nbsp; The rest are still saying that I don't have permission to delete
 this file and won't display the owner as usual.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I will try your suggestion.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

            The symptoms you describe are so bizarre that you need an experienced person to look at your machine, either by him sitting in front of it or by granting him remote access.

            Hi Rhapsody095, 
<br />
<br />I've found the following in regards to this error: <a href="https://neosmart.net/wiki/0xc000000f-error-read-boot-configuration-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://neosmart.net/wiki/0xc000000f-error-read...</a>
<br /><pre><code>Causes of this Error
This error has been known to occur as a result of one or more of the following:
Cause 1: BCD is missing or corrupt
One of the most common causes of this error is the BCD that became missing or corrupt. That could happen because of disk write errors, power outages, boot sector viruses, or errors made while configuring the BCD manually.
Cause 2: File system integrity compromised
For the same reasons, the file system itself may become corrupt or damaged. That happens even more often if one turns off a PC while it is in the middle of writing crucial data to the boot sector.
Cause 3: HDD data cable is faulty
Like all components of our PC’s, hard drive data cables tend to deteriorate as the time passes. If the same cable is used for several years(or even across several different computers), then it might be the cause of periodic read/write errors that can affect the loading process.</code></pre>
<br />
<br />You will want to follow along from the section named "Fix #3: Use Startup Repair to repair BOOTMGR"
<br />
<br />You can download Windows 10 bootable media from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/win...</a> - 'Select Download Tool Now'

            Hi  Rhapsody095, please try this:
<br />
<br />Unplug your PC and if it is a laptop, remove the battery 
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power button for 30 seconds 
<br />
<br />Plug your PC back in and if it is a laptop, replace the Battery 
<br />
<br />Start your PC and see if it boots into Windows 
<br />
<br />If not, let's see if we can get into the Windows Recovery Environment: 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<h2>            How Do I Get Into the HP Pavilion p7-1234&#39;s BIOS Menu&#63;</h2>
                    I have an HP Pavilion p7-1234 desktop computer, and I cannot seem to get into the BIOS. When I press the ESC key, it just brings me to the Windows Startup menu. F1 doesn't seem to do anything, and F2, once again, brings me to the Windows Startup menu.
 Does anyone know what key will work? I couldn't find anything on the HP website on how to get to it, either. Any help would be awesome.<br />

    <title>Problems using Hard Drive Data Transfer Cable&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> apota  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems using Hard Drive Data Transfer Cable&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have an Xbox Elite with a 120GB hard drive &amp; I just purchased a new Xbox Slim with a 320GB hard drive. I wanted to transfer all of my date over from the Elite to the Slim. So, I went to GameStop and purchased the new HD Data Transfer Cable that has both
 hard drive connectors on it for the external hard drives and the internal slim hard drives.&nbsp; When I plug my 120GB hard drive into the adapter and into my Xbox Slim console nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called up Microsoft and they said that the cable is bad and I should return it and get another one.&nbsp; They hadn't even heard of the new cable yet with both connectors on it.&nbsp; So, I went and got another cable and I had the same problem.&nbsp; Then Micrsoft told
 me that probably the USB ports on the new console were bad and that I should return the console and get another one.&nbsp; I told them I could plug my usb keyboard and&nbsp;usb thumb drive into the USB ports and they worked &amp; they said it doesn't mean the USB ports
 are working right.&nbsp; So, I went and returned my Xbox console and it doesn't make a difference. I still have the same problem.</p>
<p>I tried plugging the data cable into all of the usb ports and none of them are working. After doing it a number of times and turning the Xbox on and off I got it to recognize the external hard drive, but after I unplugged it and plugged it back in it wouldn't
 recognize it again. I can feel the external hard drive buzzing so I know it's getting power, etc.</p>
<p>If I take out the Slim hard drive and plug it into my old Elite console the cable works fine.&nbsp; Microsoft says that it has something to do with my Elite Hard Drive then.&nbsp; How can it have something to do with my Elite hard drive when it's working fine plugged
 into my Xbox Elite?&nbsp; There must be something else going on here.&nbsp; The only way I can test to see if it's my hard drive is to have another external hard drive to test it with, I don't have have that right now.</p>
<p>Can anyone else please help me with this issue?&nbsp; Thanks so much for all your help and time!</p>

<p>Try plugging the cable into the console first, waiting a few seconds, then plugging the HDD into the connector on the cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been reports that people cannot get 20GB drives working if they're plugged into the cable before the cable is plugged into the console. You may be having a similar problem with your 120GB HDD.</p>

<p>Thanks for the information. Do you mean before the Xbox is powered on, or after the xbox is powered on? &nbsp;Because even when the xbox is powered off there is still power going through the USB ports to power the hard drive connected to the transfer cable. I
 actually already tried that but maybe I didn't wait long enough, so I'll try it again. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>
<p>Do you know if it's true the the biggest thumbdrive that the Xbox will support is 16GB or will my 32GB work? Someone told me it would work but only format out to 16GB. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Power on the console. Once it finishes booting, attach the cable. Wait a few seconds for the cable to power up (there's some electronics in there that convert from SATA to USB), then attach the drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 360 can support just about any USB storage device that is formatted/partitioned as FAT32, however it will only create a Memory Unit of up to 16GB in size. I personally use a 32GB flash drive with my 360 consoles. I have a full-sized 16GB MU and plenty
 of space left over to store the latest system update and other media files.</p>

<p>Hi Apota4U. Just a quick question. Is your Transfer Cable a genuine Microsoft Transfer Cable or a third pary one?. This can sometimes cause problems after reading further info regarding transfer of content. Also please try this link
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/live/transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com/.../transfer</a> (if you haven't already done so). It contains a blow by blow procedure for transfer of content.</p>
<p>Finally has your console got the latest dashboard update? I think this is a requirement for the transfer to work correctly.</p>
        </p>

<p>Well, I still haven't tried what you suggested yet. I kind of gave up and just used my 16GB thumb drive instead, but I will try it some day to see if it works. I'm interested to know.
</p>
<p>Yes, my transfer cable is a genuine Microsoft, I purchased it at GameStop. I already saw that link, it's useless to me. I already know what to do and it doesn't work. Yes, it has the latest dashboard update.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to backup the data to my PC incase my Xbox HD dies on me someday? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>There is a way you can back up your HD Data to a PC but its a bit cumbersome, unless there is another method anyone knows of. I asked Support the same question and they said it would have to be done in 16GB chunks to a USB Flash Drive. 16GB being the current
 maximum amount allowed for a USB Flash Drive transfer in one go. I know this may not be ideal, but at this moment its the only way I know of.</p>

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The UDF file system used for Windows Vista is not supported by Windows Millennium Edition.<br />
</span></li><li><span>You can try using the Flash Drive to copy the drivers.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Note: Make sure you format the Flash Drive to FAT32 file system.<br />
<br />
I hope the above information helps you.</span></p>

    <title>Black border - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bradley4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black border</h2>
                    <p>A black border suddenly appeared on my monitor display. I initially got rid of by doing a " system restore ", but when the next update occurred the black border was back, I tried " system restore " again but can't go back far enough to make any difference.
 My operating system is Windows 10, and the graphics card is an ATI Radeon HD 4600 series which I have uninstalled the driver, restarted the PC and under Device Manager- Properties it says " no drivers are installed for this device " I visited the AMD website
 to update the drivers but it says " components are already installed " I downloaded RegCure Pro to see if it could cure any problems within the Registry, but to no avail, the black border is still there. I'm convinced the problem was caused by a Windows Update.
 I tried altering the resolution of the monitor, but it only makes the enlarged desk top icons smaller it has no effect on the black border. Please could you tell me how to get the display back to normal, without the black border.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Brian</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. Going into Settings - Display I find the resolution set at 1024x768 ( Recommended ) altering the resolution only makes the icons on the desktop larger or smaller it doesn't have any effect on the size of the screen, the setting
 for text apps and other items is set at 100% ( Recommended ) The option to customize the scale between 100% and 500% is not recommended, any other figure cannot be applied.</p>
<p>I'm convinced the problem lies with the Windows Update, when I look at the display adapter properties it says it has Microsoft Basic Display Driver, but if I go to Device Manager - Display Adapter - ATI Radeon HD 4600 Series - Properties it says " no drivers
 are installed for this device "</p>

<h3> adammv  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I downgrade to Windows 8.1 on my Surface Pro 3 and does the product key stay the same when upgrading from 8 to 10&#63;</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 10 and I made the mistake of deleting the files in the settings that allowed me to downgrade back to Windows 8 trying to clear up memory space on my Surface Pro 3. I really like Windows 10 but I just do not like some of the changes
 they made with OneNote and lately have been experiencing hardware problems with my Surface pen. I would like to downgrade to Windows 8, I'm not sure what version it was, I'm guessing it was Windows 8.1 Pro. I saved the Windows 10 product key but I'm not sure
 if it is the same key before I upgraded to 10 from Windows 8. I know I can use the media creation tool but I'm not sure which windows came with my Surface or the Windows 8 product key that came with it.&nbsp;

 supports.&nbsp; Alternatively it may mean your computer has failed.&nbsp; Try borrowing a different monitor from a friend and attach your monitor to a friend's computer and that should help narrow it down.</p>

<h2>            Integrated webcam is not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i have Asus s550 ca vivobook. My camera stopped working properly about 4-5 months ago (i have got my laptop third year and up to last year's september were things fine). I reinstalled windows (i had originaly win8, then i upgraded on 8.1, and after some
 time system slowed down to unbearable degree, so i reinstalled win8.1). After complete formating of hard drive i installed win normally, all updates, etc. Skype used camera alright at first, then it stopped(picture freeze), so i switched camera off to switch
 it on(in the skype call options). And it wrote me that camera is used by another program and so on. well, it wasn't. Nothing helped, only to restart pc, and even then camera would work just for few minutes, then picture freeze, and all story over again. I
 couldn't reinstal pc right away(personal/work reasons), so i waited and reinstalled win 8 couple days ago. skype did just the same thing again. so i downloaded drivers from asus and installed them (properly, unpacked into file, went to system drivers list,
 chose usb webcam driver to be updated from proper folder). no success. so i uninstalled skype, cleared it from registers, installed older version. no success- it still shows my video for few minutes, then it gers frozen, then it says that another program is
 using webcam- when it's not. it must be a software thing, when it does show some picture at all(before disconnecting), right?</p>
<p>So i checked all possible forums related to my laptop and OS, and i didn't find anything helpful. Could? please, someone help me, please? (heartbraking moment of the story is, that i work abroad, away from my husband and daughter, and they can't see me via
 skype)</p>

<p>Mozilla Firefox might have been messing with my camera. I had a skype call when i refrained from opening firefox and my camera kept running for solid 45 minutes(wow!). So i checked it.</p>
<p>First of all i disabled facebook website from using my camera and microphone(nowdays there is no "about:permissions" site, so these permissions are made for each site separately - rightclick-&gt;show website info-&gt;permissions).</p>
<p>And just in case i kept digging through web and found an article about "Hello" plugin ( https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1043588 ), so i tried that "about:config" and typed into search bar "camera". And then i set this one "camera.control.face_detection.enabled"
 on FALSE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, so far, 40 minutes and my camera keeps going, i will post updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>*note: i don't really know what i'm doing, so i would appreciate a warning if applicable, if i just doomed my laptop :-)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 29-01-17 20:35</p>
<p>webcam is still working alright, no disconnections. we had 3hrs call, perfect.</p>

            <p>Hi Gilbert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly reply: Since you are unable to open Windows Live Photo gallery, could you open Windows Live Mail or Windows Movie Maker, click on
<strong>File &gt; About</strong> and reply with the version of Windows Live Mail or Movie Maker installed in your computer? Also, mention the version and name of operating system installed in your computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Windows essentials version 2012 installed in your computer then I would suggest you to repair Windows Live Photo Gallery and check if it helps.
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Go to <strong><span>Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features</span></strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Search for “<strong><span>Windows Essential</span></strong>” and click <strong>
<span>Uninstall</span></strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;A new Window will open with two options a) Remove one or more Windows live program b) Repair all Windows Live Program.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 product key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimuq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 product key</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm making a thread because for some reasons I can't end up contacting any of the microsoft support and that's starting to get on my nerves.</p>
<p>To introduce quickly what's happening, I bought a windows 7 product key a while ago, like 2 years, and had a problem with it's activation on the ISO download page of microsoft (I'm using Bootcamp on Mac), I then contacted an agent on a live chat support
 who perfectly helped me by providing me a working link after I sent her/him the product that I bought earlier.</p>
<p>For some reasons I decided to have a fresh start on my Mac few weeks ago and ended up erasing/recovering my files, but, for some reasons I'm not longer able to download that windows 7 ISO file because whenever I'm entering my code there's an error displayed,
 and it seems I can't find any solution for it on the microsoft website.</p>
<p>Pretty much why I'm making this thread, if there's any one of you who can help by figuring how I could make it work, that'd be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your responses,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alex</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer. In fact that license was a legit one, it was validate by a microsoft support agent when I initially did the windows installation 2 years ago on my mac, but for some reasons I can't no longer access to the ISO download by providing
 this same key.</p>

            According to the following from the Logitech Support Forum, the Logitech Setpoint software is required for the on screen caps lock display:&nbsp;
<a href="http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Keyboards-and-Keyboard-Mice/MK320-On-Screen-Display/td-p/601288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Keyboards-and-Keyboard-Mice/MK320-On-Screen-Display/td-p/601288<br />
</a><br />
However when following the link they provide for it <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/433/6232?WT.z_sp=Image" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.logitech.com/en-us/433/6232?WT.z_sp=Image</a>&nbsp; , it doesn't appear that they have Setpoint software for that keyboard for Windows 7.&nbsp; If that is correct (and I'm not sure that it is) your other option is to use the Windows 7 option to have a sound
 play when caps lock is turned on and off (I actually prefer that to the onscreen display since you don't have to be watching the screen to be notified when you inadvertently hit the key).&nbsp; The caps lock sound is controlled via Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Ease
 of Access &gt; Change How your keyboard works.&nbsp; (Or if you go to the Search programs and files box immediately above the Start button and type "toggle" and then select "Change how your keyboard works")&nbsp; Once there, but a check mark beside "Turn on Toggle Keys."<br />

</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I have a Lenovo G510 running windows 8.1 64 bit, bought about 6 weeks ago. Installed windows updates
 on 18 August, including an optional one for the conexant audio device, and now there is no sound. There is an exclamation mark next to the device in device manager and an error code for the driver that states 'Reinstall the drivers for this device. (Code 18)'.
 I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling many many times, including downloading the driver from the Lenovo website and using the driver from the D drive, always with the same error:</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I also tried doing a system restore to before the update but this failed with the message 'access denied'. After spending hours
 trying to find a fix I discovered that the driver update in question is still listed (now as 'important') in windows update. So I've downloaded and installed and restarted several times but still with the same error message, and the update is still listed
 in windows update.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Update history states the audio device update was successful - every time I've downloaded and installed
 it. I've also tried uninstalling and reinstalling all the other updates I originally installed on the 18 August.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">The events tab in device manager shows a list stating 'device installed' over and over. The information for the most recent

</p><p>Hello again Ramesh. Sorry for the delay in replying. I can't say I saw much sense in this last suggestion, seems like &nbsp;you were just running out of ideas.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case I discussed the problem with a friend that works in IT and when I mentioned a possible conflict with my security software they suggested turning off wifi, disabling the firewall and then trying to install the driver. This worked. Driver installed
 correctly, sound back, simple as that. Firewall is re-enabled of course and no problems so far. Feel pretty daft I didn't think of trying this myself but even more bemused that Lenovo and MS support engineers didn't suggest this or even ask what kind of security
 software I had. Instead I've wasted hours over the last month carrying out their suggestions (most of which I had already tried anyway). Next time I think I'll just ask my friend!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect Netgear WG111v2 wireless adapter using Win7 Home Premium &#40;32 or 64-bit&#41;</h2>
                    I had no problem obtaining connection with D-Link DSL-2640R router using Win7 RC1 but since installing Win7 Home Premium I have had no success. Win7 appears to install its own WG111v2 driver and the led on the adapter does blink but there is no connection.
 Did Microsft remove the Netgear driver from the final retail release or was RC1 running in XP compatibility mode? On its website Netgear states it has no Win7 driver/software ready for Win7. I have also tried installing a Edimax EW-7318UG wireless adapter
 but again had no success.&nbsp;

            Hello again Doomerz. Well, I had high hopes that your tip would work. I managed to isolate a Vista driver and replaced the driver installed by Windows 7. However, Win 7 keeps a copy of its driver in a folder called Driver Store and no way was it going
 to let me delete, rename, move or do anything to it no matter how hard I tried to change ownership and permission rights. As soon as I put in the Vista driver it would be replaced by Win 7's driver from Driver Store. I've seen something similar to your solution
 on another forum site and I know it should work but I'm putting up the white flag and sticking with my wired connection until Netgear release a software update. Thanks, anyway.
        </p>

            it was my pleasure again Bruce1949 it was a minor trouble you did get... it was driver related just as me and all other ppl that have network connectivity issue.. i do not know why windows 7 default drivers have trouble... i wish it will be fix it the
 near future.Now you will know what to do if you have any hardware issue its almost of the time related to driver, still windows 7 is a really good os and i like it a lot it is stable and i do not have any bad comment about that os.. Dont hesitate to ask other
 question or help if you need help a lot of microsoft staff are here to help ppl having trouble and other user like me.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.
