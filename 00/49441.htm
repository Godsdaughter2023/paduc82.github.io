<h2>            un-fixable corrupt computer files</h2>
                    I ran scannow and found I have corrupted files on my computerthat can't be repaired. &nbsp;So i ran findstar which reported the source file could not be located. I am getting in over my head with computer issues that appear to be "above my pay grade". What's
 the simplest way for a dummy like me to resolve my issue.&nbsp;

    <title>Where did &#34;Show estimated data usage&#34; go in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theoneandonlyzooid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where did &#34;Show estimated data usage&#34; go in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good evening. I upgraded my i5 Surface Pro 3 from Win8.1 x64 to Win10 today, July 29, 2015, figuring if any of my computers was going to be 100% compatible with Win10 it ought to be my 10-day old SP3... and was initially very pleased with the look and feel
 of the new OS... Quickest Windows upgrade ever, too and I've been using since Windows 3.1...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I get to work where I use a Sprint mobile broadband router -- 6GB monthly data plan -- and am further pleased that Win10 automatically set this as a metered connection, so no data gorging by default. However, I'm on a strict ~335MB per workday budget.
 In Win8.x, all I had to do was right click the connection and select "Show estimated data usage", then click "Reset" to monitor my daily usage... Now, that monitoring option is *gone*.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can find is what I've used for the past 30 days (useless as a pig with a sidesaddle in my situation) with no way of forcing a daily reset. Is there some way of enabling this data? Without it, I'm kinda left to try to figure out how much I've used via
 the WiFi Status box 'Activity' section and adding sent and received bytes; far from ideal...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some 'secret squirrel' way of hacking this? If not, I may have to revert to Win8.1, just to get "Show estimated data usage" back. More than a little disappointing, frankly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help, it'd be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>yes you can check your estimated data.</p>
<p>go to Network and Sharing Center, then click on your Wi-fi connection.</p>
<p>You can check your data usage activity here..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if you are using Kaspersky Antivirus, you can check the network monitor in "Show Additional Tools" option.

            <p>I think the person who posted this already mentioned that he'd found this already. However this is sorely short of the option that was available in Windows 8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a post/website that shows where, however the area/option it shows is not available to me. It mentions a section under "Network and Internet"&nbsp; titled "Additional Settings" where you can "Show estimated data usage". I however do not have this in my
 setup for some reason. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the link for any of the rest of you with the same question. If you discover how, please share.</p>

            <p>Thanks for responding Roger. But, that is for the Windows 10 Preview (let's call it 'Windows 8.2'). In the 'gold' or 'release' version that rolled out on 29 Jul 15, all those features have been disabled, at least on the Home version free upgrade for which
 many/most (?) of us qualified...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found a reasonable workaround:<br />
1. Forget the Microsoft Store apps. They are lame at best and chock-full of ads.</p>
<p>2. Download NetWorx from CNet's Download area. The application is lightweight, contains zero ads and offers (an overabundance of) information on your data usage, including separate pages for a running daily counter and per-app usage to help locate offenders.
 My only quibble with this is that it does not differentiate between separate data connections; to wit, the daily total includes *every* WiFi connection with which I've accessed the Internet. The only way I've found around this is to disconnect from all other
 WiFi transmitters, then do a complete reset of all data (handy button for doing so in the program UI), then connect to my Sprint mobile receiver. This loses all previous data; but, at least it gives me a *very accurate* total of what I've used on the day.</p>
<p>3. Wait for Microsoft to fix this 'bug' in future updates, hopefully by the end of August, before installing Windows 10 on any of my other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution includes downloading the Win10 standalone USB installers (combo x64 and x32 versions) for future upgrades to my other computers, and then *not* installing until this problematic behavior is solved...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea that a very useful tool which was present in both Win8x and Win10Preview was *willfully* excised from the Release version is... troubling. Get with the program, Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>Since installing on Friday, 31 Jul 15, NetWorx has consumed 5.87KB of Internet data, so no shenanigans on its part... Wish I could say the same for Windows 10 and various browsers' behavior, which seem glutinous compared to Windows 8.1. Maybe Microsoft reckon
 we've all got unlimited mobile data?</p>

            <p>I had come across the Wireless Metered Connection page before landing here. &nbsp;However, even though I have the setting on my laptop turning on metered connection doesn't help at all. &nbsp;I want the 'show estimated usage' per wireless connection feature back that
 Windows 8 had. &nbsp;It helped me as I may connect to different wireless networks throughout the day and when connecting to my phone's&nbsp;wifi&nbsp;hotspot I need to ensure I don't go over the 5gb limit on a monthly basis. &nbsp;Being able to see that connection's use over
 the month and being able to easily reset it (similar to how you used it on a daily reset) let me know when/how often I could use it, how much data I had left etc., &nbsp;I could stretch out using it over a month then the first day of use in a new cycle I'd reset
 and start counting up again (or rather, Windows would do it for me). &nbsp;That Windows 8 feature was wonderful and it sucks that Windows 10 got rid it, especially since the whole wireless usage of all networks combined doesn't help in my case nor yours and probably
 everyone else who thumbed up your post. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the NetWorx tip, I'll look into that now (though it'll be a pain since I change back and forth several times a day sometimes), and look for other tracking apps.</p>

            It may not be possible with all phones (wasn't on mine, I just get total usage). &nbsp;Since I didn't find any suitable apps, for my case I've just been logging into my cell provider site and clicking a few steps to view there. &nbsp;I know that wouldn't help in
 tracking a different type of wireless provider. &nbsp;The 8.1 feature was just so helpful and convenient. :)

<p>
</p><p>Yeah, I'd already found that less-than-useful page, too. Unfortunately, even that is a 'full history' not a per-connection tally for wireless data usage...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like this truly useful tool is gone forever, for no particularly good reason. At least, none forthcoming from Microsoft. I find this complete lack of response from MS's usually very helpful resident 'answer gurus' most troubling. It's almost as if
 Microsoft is <em>intentionally</em> hiding this data from us...in hopes of running up our data bills? To whose ultimate profit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certainly not ours, the end users. I'll say it again: Microsoft, put it back in! First, Windows 10 does away with BD-playing Media Center (which I paid to add to Win 8), then they take away our ability to even track our data usage in a useful way. What once
 were features of the OS are now third-party expenditures for us.&nbsp; | (</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - My laptop requires a password and I don&#39;t have one, Please Help</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I downloaded some time ago windows 10 to my laptop, I do not use the laptop online as such but do keep up to date with all Microsoft up-dates. I do not have a password for the laptop so was surprised when it asked me for one.</p>
<p>When I tried to open the laptop I was unable to do so and the following message came up - This feature requires removable media, such as a USB ... Please connect a USB flash drive, and. Then try again.</p>
<p>So my question is how do I bypass the password so that I can get to my documents. I would be very grateful if someone could let me know how to fix this problem in easy to follow stages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Dear Vanessa</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that I can not get my lap-top to start up. It wants a password and I didn't ever use one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This message comes up when I try to press enter - This feature requires removable media, such as a usb flash drive. Please connect a usb flash drive, and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the most part I only use my lap-top on-line to get the Microsoft up-dates, this happened after I had downloaded several new up-dates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for removable media or usb flash drive - I downloaded Windows 10 direct from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps with my problem as it is very important that I get my lap-top back in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be very grateful for any help you can supply me with</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

</p><p>I have just tried your suggestion, and it still wants a correct password to start up the lap-top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to change my password to the Microsoft Account yesterday as if I had one I couldn't remember it and could not find any mention in my password book.</p>

            <p>Dear Vanessa</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past I did not use anything that I know of to start my Lap-top, I just pressed the power button and it would start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also would have to connect to the internet manually. So I didn't use the Microsoft account to log in and am not sure if I used a local account to log in, sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am concerned that when I downloaded Windows 10 to my lap-top I created an account with Microsoft and my lap-top is looking for a password I must have used at the time. If this is the case I do not remember the password and cannot find it in my password
 book. Clearly the book is not fool proof.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing my pass word as you suggested but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been looking on the Microsoft site and read that my lap-top may have to be re-started for scratch. My concern there is all the documents that I have been working on will be lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts that could be of help as always is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

<p>After checking my external hard drive I have found that there is over 240 Gig of files on the Lap-Top that I have working on so do not want to make anything worse for myself.</p>

            It will be best if you can back up your files. The link which was provided to you will refer you to channels in retrieving your files from a forgotten account. If you could back up your files, you may just do a backup and then create a new account.

</p><p>Fortunately I had already backed up the information in a raw state on an external hard-drive but have spent many-many hours working on them on the Lap-top.</p>
<p>So will endeavour to find a way to retrieve the information, also there may be other documents that I have added.</p>

                    I have been wanted to extract zipped files but i don't have a means to do so at the moment, i have been thinking of using winzip, but its quite expensive, would there be another alternative to extracting files? or do i just have to deal? I am aware of
 another program called 7-zip but i don't know if i can trust it.

TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            biometric devices is not found in the device manager, Windows 10  - Voyo V3 Pro</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hey guys, I wonder if anyone can help.</p>
<p>I have a Voyo V3 Pro, but I've had no luck getting the finger print scanner to work.</p>
<p>It doesn't show in the device manager at all (under biometrics).</p>
<p>I heard this may be a windows Home thing, so I upgraded to Pro, but this hasn't fixed it, and yes I enabled them with gpedit..</p>
<p>I downloaded the driver packs from the manufacturers site, installed them, but no joy.</p>
<p>I'm reading around that this problem doesn't seem exactly unusual. Any ideas guys?</p>
<p>Appreciate any help you can give.</p>

<p>Hey <span>Manjunath,</span></p>
<p><span>In it's short life (a week), yes it's been through some changes.</span></p>
<p><span>When I got it, it was already set up with Windows Home, which I found a little unusual, and the fingerprint scanner wasn't working. When I went to do it, it told me that the computer wasn't compatible
 with hello, so I couldn't use it. I wasn't looking to use hello (tin foil hat and all that ;) ), just to use it as a quick sign in.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyway, I contacted Voyo, and his greatest advice so far was, "did you set up a pin?", and ask for a photo of the Device manager, not showing Biometrics.
</span></p>
<p><span>At this point I downloaded the drivers and OS from the Voyo website.</span></p>
<p><span>I installed the driver packs, and nothing.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried opening OS file, but it had a couple of corruptions in the zip file. I downloaded again, same deal. Toyed with the idea of downloading the dual OS for the mini, but thought better of it (but I
 can dream)</span></p>
<p><span>I looked into it a little, found Home had a problem with biometrics. I installed GPedit and altered the biometrics values, but no luck. so upgraded to Pro, figuring that would&nbsp; solve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Installed the driver packs, restarting each time (one of my questions to voyo was did it matter about the order of installation, I ran as Admin by default), still no luck.</span></p>
<p><span>I&nbsp; noticed that while these packs were installing, there were a lot of missed/failed installations.</span></p>
<p><span>The packs are the ones from the same link you sent.</span></p>
<p><span>I have even emailed Goodix to ask them, but have heard nothing.</span></p>
<p><span>A side note, I tried to install a virtual router, Connectify, but it wouldn't work because it could find the IO or something.</span></p>
<p><span>I read about this problem and fixed it by installing Visual studio, although it occurred to me that maybe those packs are faulty, and this is one of the drivers that has been missed. Is there anywhere
 else to download?</span></p>
<p><span>I tend to blame the packs, as I did a clean install (getting good at those).
</span></p>
<p><span>I don't quite remember when I stopped seeing it in the device manager, but I know I have seen it there at least once.</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the long response, I just wanted to be as detailed as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for any help you can give.</span></p>

            It has only appeared once that I noticed in the device manager, so it was there. What I also notice, is that when the driver packs from the manufacturers are installed they miss a lot of drivers installations due to a problem with inf files,. I've been
 looking for fresh driver files for both the motherboard and fingerprint scanner? (and possibly the touch screen drivers too). Do you know where I can get them? Thanks guys

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>- Which repair program are you referring to?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you refresh your PC, all of your personal files will be deleted and your settings will be reset. Any apps that came with your PC will be reinstalled, but all other apps will be removed.
<br />
<div>For reference:</div>

<h2>            Why is my computer automatically doing CHKDSK Verification any time I start my computer&#63; This takes 30 to 45 minutes to complete&#59; before my computer finally starts. </h2>
                    
<p>Why is my computer automatically doing CHKDSK Verification any time I start my computer? This takes 30 to 45 minutes to complete; before my computer finally starts. This Checking of File System on C and CHKDSK verification start, once I turn on the computer.
 It says -</p>
<p>"Checking File System On C: The type of the file system is NTFS. A Disk-Check has been scheduled. Windows will now check the disk"....&nbsp; Then it goes on to
<br />
"CHKDSK is verifying files (Stage 1 of 5); CHKDSK is verifying indexes (Stage2 of 5)....all the way to CHKDSK is verifying Free Space (Stage 5 of 5)..... Then it finally says file check is completed, and then allows my computer to start finally.</p>
<p>*I can't remember scheduling a disk check. What do I do to stop this? Please, somebody kindly give me a simple step by step process, as I consider myself a nontechno. Also, is there a possible problem that's making this happen? Thanks.<br />
<br />

<p><span>Hello
<span>Noelie</span></span></p>
<p><span>Here's how to stop it
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to "Start" "Run" type in "msconfig" without the quotes. When window opens select on first tab "General" select "normal Startup"<br />
Click apply and OK </span></p>
<p><span>Have a look in the Msconfig&gt;Boot.ini tab. Make sure that "/SOS" is unchecked in the Boot Options section. If it is checked then it will cause
 chkdsk to do check on every boot.</span></p>
<p><span>If you continue to have the problem with CHKDSK then from a command prompt window<br />
&nbsp;(Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Command Prompt) </span></p>
<p><span>At the prompt type</span></p>
<p><span><strong>CHKNTFS /D</strong> (there is a space before /)</span></p>
<p><span>Enter</span></p>
<p><span>Reboot</span></p>
<span>Chkdsk will run again, but hopefully that will be the last time it does so<br />
<br />

            I have a similar problem. I scheduled a disk check and it seemed like it was going fine. I saw a message that said the disk was clean and it looked like it was working, but then it started the disk check again. I pressed enter to cancel it, it went back
 to the Microsoft XP loading screen, and then it went right back to the disk check screen and again gave me to option to pess any key to cancel it. I did, and then it looped right back to disk check screen. I kept going like this for a few minutes and it never
 stopped. Now I don't even know how to get to Run so that I can get it start. Any advice?

<p><span>Start your PC with the XP Setup CD in the drive. When you see the "Press any key to boot from CD..." prompt, do so and let the CD-based boot process begin.</span></p>
<p><span>When the Recovery Console option is offered ("Press R to start the Recovery Console"), do so. You may be asked which Windows installation to enter, in which case type the number of

<p><span>When prompted, enter the Administrator's password for that Windows installation. If you did not set a password just press ENTER</span></p>

<br />
Secondly, everything was going well until the last step. I got the error message "The command is not recognized&nbsp; Type HELP for a list of supported commands." I'm reasonably certain I was typing it in correctly (I tried a few times). Any ideas?<br />
<br />

<h2>            Game progress not being saved</h2>
                    <p>I know from reading previous posts that this post won't get a response, but I'll give it a try anyway. I running on Windows 10, playing Microsoft Jigsaw. I recently had to reset my computer and have had to reinstall my apps. When I download most of the puzzles I completed the puzzles are intact and my stars are there, but most of the puzzles I have done recently I'm going to have to pay for and replay. I was down to the last puzzle group, Italy. If there is a file on my computer&nbsp; holding the information, I'd like to know where it is. If it's supposed to be in the cloud, I wonder why the cloud isn't keeping it. Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<h2>            &#36;WINDOWS.&#126;BT folder</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 last year and afterwards deleted the $WINDOWS.~BT folder and another with a similar name.&nbsp; The first folder then came back a few weeks later, so I assumed it was some kind of update for W10 and left it.&nbsp; After 2 months with nothing
 happening I deleted it again, but it came back again. size is just under 6Gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does it keep recreating itself?&nbsp; According to Windows update I have no updates pending.&nbsp; I have Windows 10 pro version 10.0.1.10240.&nbsp; In case it is relevant the current folder was created on 6th February but some of the sub folders are dated in October
 last year which I think is the date I installed W10.&nbsp; It was a clean install after the auto update of W8.1 failed.</p>

            latest version is 10.0.10586 so I suspect that you should check under settings&gt;update and security&gt;advanced options and see if&nbsp; defer upgrade option is checked. If it is, uncheck it and run the windows update again to get the latest build installed.

    <title>&#34;View installed update history&#34; shows the same Win 10 updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mayur nayak  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;View installed update history&#34; shows the same Win 10 updates installed twice on consecutive days</h2>
                    <p>I recently performed a clean install of Windows 10 Home x64, version 1709 via ISO image on my laptop to eliminate unwanted remnants from my Win 7 upgrade a couple of years ago. I did this on 13-Mar but when I checked update history the next day, I was surprised
 to see an entry labelled "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709" that stated it was successfully installed on 14-Mar. If this wasn't strange enough, when I revisited the section the day after, I saw an additional identical entry under Feature Updates
 (so I now see 2 identical feature updates) that claims to have successfully installed on 15-Mar! :-S<br />
<br />
While my system is running fine, I would be interested to know if there is an explanation for this behaviour because I intend to take a backup of the primary partition for any future reinstalls and would like it to be as clean as possible.<br />
Has Windows actually wasted my bandwidth (which I notice Win 10 generally seems to care little about) in downloading and installing the entire 1709 update two more times after the initial install or are there some incremental revisions involved?<br />
<br />
I became even more concerned about this the day after because I could now see two identical entries for KB4088776 as well under "Quality Updates" - the first claiming it was successfully installed on 14-Mar and the second saying the same for 15-Mar.<br />
I am a fairly advanced computer user but am baffled by this. What in the world is going on and is this likely to happen for other updates down the line?<br />
</p>
<p>Searched around and found someone who had reported a similar issue here:<br />
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/feature-update-to-windows-10-version-1709-listed/a2683442-83a8-4169-9787-7d6b942010d7<br />
However, the OP had not reported back and I was hesitant to attempt what was suggested in the final reply without knowing if this was a problem or expected behaviour.<br />
<br />
Any insights would be appreciated,<br />
Mayur</p>

            Hi Mayur,<br /><br />There really is no problem. That is just a check to be sure the updates are current so that later updates, such as the coming 1803, will be properly applied.<br /><br />Rob

<p>Thanks for the response, Rob, but why would mere checks result in duplicate entries under intallation history bearing discrete dates? It's hard for me to imagine that a seasoned Microsoft development team would deliver such confusing messaging to users for
 an aspect of OS functionality as important as its update engine. Just seems sloppy:</p>

            They may have added a check without changing the KB number or even  may have made a minor change. Remember not all updates are pushed out to all systems at once and yours may have been an early one. Lots of reasons are possible. Please realize there is no issue or need for any action on your part.

<p>The thought that there may have been a minor change pushed out for the same KB number did cross my mind but I would have expected that to append to or at least replace the existing entry rather than add a new, identical one at a non-adjacent location in
 the list. As it stands, as more updates get applied, it will become very difficult for a user to get a clear picture of what has happened.</p>
<br />
<p>Good to hear that it is probably just an issue of aesthetics. I searched online but couldn't find any documentation on how Windows Update behaves in that situation. If anyone reading this can point me in the right direction, it would help me with closure.</p>
<p>Apologies if I'm obsessing on this somewhat excessively but I was keen on getting a stable and clean base with this reinstall and put in a lot of effort to identify the right set of drivers for my now-ancient workhorse Dell Studio XPS 1640 laptop that does
 not officially support Win 10 and this threw a spanner in the works. Expected a better user experience from Microsoft.</p>

<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Expand the Network Adapters section
<br />
<br />Right click your Ethernet (LAN) device and choose Disable - do not uninstall it, because Windows will just re-install it when you restart your PC

            Why not ask the tech? Are you sure it is a key logger? Many techs - like me - will install a remote assistance application like TeamViewer or GoToMyPC to help our clients. These are NOT key loggers, so what is the name of the program you think is a key
 logger?

            Do you know what a key logger is? A good one isn't detected by antivirus programs. And before we go all out with possible solutions, the OP needs to come back and answer my questions. There is no other way to give her focused help.

<blockquote>How do you locate and detect key logger on your PC? I had a tech install a key logger program and now I would like to know how to remove it.</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>This is what I would recommend you to do.<br />
1. Boot your computer in Safe Mode with Networking by restarting your computer and pressing F8 until the Advanced Boot Options appear.<br />
2. Select Safe Mode with Networking.<br />
3. Open Internet Explorer and run a Full Service Scan of our OneCare Safety Scanner located at<a href="http://safety.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://safety.live.com</a>.<br />
4. Take note of the items that it detected but CANNOT remove. Get back to me with the names of those items, if any.<br />
4. Restart the computer in the Normal Mode (the normal way you restart the computer).<br />
5. See if that problem still happens. If it still happens, perform a System Restore by clicking Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, and System Restore. Select a Restore Point. Select a restore point that contains the date before the problem started.</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps.</p>

<h2>            Folder view settings and desktop icons.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I turned on my computer to find my folder's view settings are changed and messed.&nbsp; I also found my desktop&nbsp;icons changed order and all messed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever since I bought my computer I have used the default Windows Vista Home Premium settings for folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not downloaded anything or updated Windows Vista Home Premium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I turn on "Remember folder's view settings" in the folder options - nothing different&nbsp;happens - they all have views that I do not want them set to and they open in small windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone please tell me why this has happened? &nbsp;Could this be the results of a hacker?</p>
                </div>

            <p>The second solution resets all view settings. These next two commands reset the defaults set by you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><font><font><font>
<div><font><font><font><em>reg delete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Streams" /f</em></font></font></font></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Resetting the saved settings will allow you to change the settings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This achieves the same as shexvw.</div>
<div><strong>Advanced Clean Boot</strong>

<p>If the above doesn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download Autoruns from&nbsp;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start the program by right clicking and choosing Run As Administrator and click
<em>Options</em> menu - <em>Filter Options</em> and tick <em>Hide Microsoft entries</em> and clear
<em>Include Empty Locations</em>. Untick everything left on the EXPLORER tab..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reboot. If this solves your problem reenable ½ of the items until you find which one.</p>

<div>Understanding Saved Views and Browsing Folders<br />
In Windows 2000 Professional, the view you use is not always permanently saved in Windows Explorer. You can control whether the views you use are saved permanently or temporarily by using the Remember each folder's view settings check box on the View tab of
 the Folder Options dialog box (see figure 9.3). <br />
<br />
By default the Remember each folder's view settings option is enabled. When you choose to leave this setting enabled, the following happens:
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; a.. The changes you make to a folder's view is automatically saved when you close the folder.
<br />
&nbsp; b.. The view you use to view one folder is not applied to other folders. <br />
&nbsp; c.. When you open a folder, it opens in the view you used when you last viewed it.
<br />
When you clear the check box for Remember each folder's view settings, the following happens:
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; a.. When you start Windows Explorer, the first folder you view displays in the folder's saved view. Windows Explorer holds that view in temporary memory and applies it to all the folders that you visit while Windows Explorer remains open unless you manually
 alter the view. <br />
&nbsp; b.. As you browse to other folders (after the initial folder is opened), the saved view for each folder is ignored, and when you quit Windows Explorer, the folder view that you have been using to view multiple folders is deleted from temporary memory.
<br />
&nbsp; c.. The next time you open Windows Explorer, once again, it is the saved view of the first folder you open that determines how you view multiple folders.
<br />
Setting All Folders to the Same View<br />
Some users want to have all their Windows Explorer folders set to the same view. In Windows 2000 Professional, the default setting is that any change made to a folder's view is automatically saved when you close the folder and is not applied to other folders.
 However, you can set all folders to the same view by using the Folder Options command as described in the following procedure.
<br />
<br />
To set all folders to the same view <br />
&nbsp; 1.. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, set the view to your preference. <br />
&nbsp; 2.. On the Tools menu, click Folder Options. <br />
&nbsp; 3.. In the Folder Options dialog box, click the View tab. <br />
&nbsp; 4.. Under Folder Views, click Like Current Folder. <br />
Important The Remember each folder's view settings check box on the View tab of the Folder Options dialog box (see Figure 9.3) affects how the view settings of individual folders are applied and saved. For more information about the impact of clearing this
 check box, see "Understanding Saved Views and Browsing Folders" earlier in this chapter.

            <p>Win 10 handles keys VERY differently. Once you have upgraded and activated your win 10 install the important bits are kept online on the activation servers so should you have to re-install (even a clean install) you simply skip the step where it asks for
 the key and the installation will check with the online activation servers and complete the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no unique win 10 keys (except if you purchased a win 10 key, MSDN, and volume keys) all users have generic keys which by themselves are useless.</p>

            How can I verify I have done this? I haven't uninstalled Windows 10, but cannot use many of the features. My dd tried to fix it and, well, it didn't work. I was coming here to find out how not to lose my info. I also think I lost my office - I have my
 key code for it, but the program isn't here anymore.

                    <p>Desculpe mas não concordo, já que eu estava na casa deles quando eles aceitaram meu pedido e se tornaram membros e fizeram compras. Detalhe eles receberam por eu indicar e eu não...Absurdo isso pois eu acompanhei. </p>

</p><p>Olá DanielMadeira05,</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Referindo-se ao seu post anterior em (https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/9f753de4-dd97-472c-96ae-fd0c4de12c6a), não vemos referências de console ou referências de compras da sua conta. Não houve nenhuma oferta de referência de console recente. Além disso, apenas dois dos amigos da sua lista de amigos são elegíveis para a oferta de referência de compra pela primeira vez e você não fez referência a nenhum deles.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Como é dito em nossos termos e condições (https://rewards.xbox.com/terms-and-conditions/):</p>
<p>O referido amigo adquire uma assinatura Xbox Live Gold on-line a partir do Xbox.com no prazo de 14 (quatorze) dias da referência (os resgates de código de varejo do Xbox Live Gold, cartões pré-pagos e associações promocionais não se qualificam);</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Vimos que um de seus amigos foi Gold, mas fez isso com um julgamento de um mês, que não é elegível para esta oferta. Dos 8 amigos que você mencionou em 12 de janeiro, esse amigo é o único que até tentou ir Gold.</p>
