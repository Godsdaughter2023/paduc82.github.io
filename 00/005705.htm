                    <span>I have windows mobile 5.0 devices with activesync 4.5 on the desktop that I sync with. The issue is not synching because each of the devices syncs just fine. The issue is connecting to the internet
 when the device is cradled. I have no firewall turned on and I do not connect via proxy. The connection settings for both the desktop and devices are My work network and yet there are always one or two devices that will not connect to the internet.
<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated<br />
Thanks<br />

            I can appreciate what is happening ... it has happened to me.&nbsp; What I have found is that because I use multiple devices that one day it will connect and the next day it won't.&nbsp; I have found that in my particular case that since I have multiple devices
 going onto my wireless network, that if I shut off my Wireless router then turn it back on, it seems to free it up so I can connect....

            Oh ok so by shut off do you mean recycle the power or reset the device since I do have 16 or so devices using my wireless network.<br />

<p>I think in my case it is the way it grabs the IP address.&nbsp; By cycling the router, it clears it and I am able to connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I would ask if you have&nbsp;been able to have&nbsp;each device&nbsp;connect at some point in time&nbsp;and if the answer is yes then with so many, it may well be worth assigning a specific address to each to avoid that problem.</p>

            Ok now we're getting somewhere. So I have them connecting to my work LAN thru an access point where they aquire an IP address from the server. Do you have any idea of how I should go about assigning them an address?
<br />
<br />
My quick little theory is in the Windows mobile connection settings under the ndis&nbsp; driver I specify all of the network connections and create an IP address within&nbsp; the scope of my DHCP server and then in the DHCP server on my create a reservation for the device
 under the IP address i've just created.<br />

<p>You would have to set up each device.&nbsp; I would suggest trying it out with a few and slowly add others as long as it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a device, you need to go to START, SETTINGS, Connections Tab, Network Cards icon then configure the Network Adapter (there is a tab there)</p>

            Yeah I know which tab you're talking about. Some of my devices call it Network Card and some call it Wifi. The thing is there is like a long list of drivers in there. I was wondering if I needed to seperately configure each driver and do I need to make
 any changes on the DHCP server?<br />

                    <p>I'm sure this question has been asked before but, as former ATT customer I&nbsp;am no longer able to use my windows phone and now I'm currently with Sprint. I would like to upgrade to the Lumina 950XL but as we know sprint doesn't carry&nbsp;any windows phone&nbsp;devices.
 My question is will Windows Phone ever be carried on Sprint networks or equivalent anytime soon? Would really like to upgrade to a new windows phone.

            <p>I feel the pain Anthony! Unfortunately Sprint uses CDMA technology which does not use SIM cards. Only GSM carriers use SIM cards. That would include AT&amp;T and T-Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not to make you feel bad but the 950XL (which I use) is unquestionably the best device I have ever used. Not sure if you can switch carriers but I certainly would consider it.</p>

            <p>Thanks Sharif,</p>
<p>
</p><p>at least the migration from Windows 10 changed the list of Accent Colors by adding the Color of my W7 AERO Task bar to the official list. In addition my old desktop's background color was migrated as is, but not listed on the Background settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So "Personalization" also offers Themes. My settings are obviously part of the list of themes.</p>
<p>If you could give me some hints how to change the Themes-XMLs this would help a lot of people that don't like to be forced by MS to use a work place shaped and colored&nbsp; according to MS programmers taste.</p>

    <title>Strange characters in text field in reports - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ernienet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange characters in text field in reports</h2>
                    
<p>I've seen it before, but I can't remember why it happens. I have a query based report that has a text field. In the report the text is replaced with strange characters (they look Japanese).</p>
<p>I've tried shortening it to 250 characters, changing it to a Memo field, and deleting it and reinserting it after each change.</p>
<p>I seem to recall something about it having to do with a multi-table query, but I can't remember if there was a solution or if it was some sort of unresolved bug.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Ernie</p>

                    <p>I received an email(copy below)&nbsp;stating that someone had started a process to replace all of the security info for one of our Microsoft email accounts.&nbsp; I know who this person is &amp; she is claiming that someone hacked her account &amp; did this????&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this
 really a possibility??? And if so, would it affect ALL email addresses in her contact list or just ours???&nbsp; Is there anyway to find out if she was really hacked or if she was just trying to hack our account???&nbsp; Any info would be appreciated.&nbsp;

            <p>Hmmm wrong answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A employee where I work is getting this also. sometimes twice in a week. The thing is, he DOES NOT even have a hotmail account. And Never has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is pure nonsense. As far as I am concerned this is just a Bogus message that should always be ignored.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or better yet, get a gmail account and forget about MS accounts altogether because they are the accounts hackers seem to have to most fun going after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had seen first had the amount of times either one of my kids or others always have there Microsoft accounts hacked.
</p>
<p>When MSN Messenger was still here.....got Hacked</p>
<p>Hotmail accounts...got Hacked</p>
<p>Xbox accounts...got Hacked</p>
<p>Live accounts......hacked</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone see a pattern here??</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS cannot protect you because they don't know how. Stay away from all MS accounts. IMHO</p>

            <p>Hi HowardHood,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your thoughts on this matter.&nbsp; There are emails/sites which are really identical to the original ones, which is called phishing emails/sites. These are the type of emails/sites that are extracting the information. One can create a bogus email
 and will just copy the original content. However, if the email has a green icon/shield then, we can say that it is a legitimate email from Microsoft. You can refer to this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/7e212973-8c82-4e78-85f3-8d7ee9e3b47b">
link</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Microsoft account or a service from Microsoft got hacked previously, then we truly understand where you are coming from. Anyone would feel the same way. If ever it came it a point the you encountered these kind of issues, please do let us know immediately
 so we can rectify it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Francis S.</p>

<p>Back-up any personal data (none of which should be considered 100% trustworthy at this point) then format the HDD &amp; do a clean install of Windows.&nbsp;
<strong>Please note that a Repair Install (AKA in-place upgrade) will NOT fix this!</strong></p>
<p>HOW TO do a clean install of WinXP: See <a href="http://michaelstevenstech.com/cleanxpinstall.html#steps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>After the clean install, you will have the equivalent of a "new computer" so take care of everything on the following page before otherwise connecting the machine to the internet or a local network (i.e., other computers) and before using a flash drive or
 SDCard that isn't brand-new or hasn't been freshly formatted:</p>

<p>NB: Any Norton or McAfee free-trial that came preinstalled on the computer when you bought it will be reinstalled (but invalid) when Windows is reinstalled. You MUST uninstall the free-trial and download/run the appropriate removal tool before installing
 any updates, Windows Service Packs or IE upgrades and before installing your new anti-virus application (which will require WinXP SP3 to be installed).</p>

<p>If these procedures look too complex - and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the machine to a local, reputable and independent (i.e., not BigBoxStoreUSA or Geek Squad) computer repair shop.</p>

    <title>Do thicker micro-USB cables charge phones faster&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do thicker micro-USB cables charge phones faster&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have a short 9" long cord to charge my Nokia Lumia 635 phone&nbsp;by plugging it into an URGE Basics battery block. The cord is made with thicker looking wire than any of my other ones were made with. My cable is getting damaged near each end due to my hauling
 it fulltime in my pocket so it is time to put another cord in my pocket. Should I go get another thick one or is a thinner, longer one just as fast, significantly speaking?<br />
I don't mean faster only by seconds but I mean are fatter gauge wire cords faster by many minutes?<br />
If I should get a fatter one, can someone also then give me a brand and part # since my research doesn't find any wire gauge info in their descriptions?</p>
<p>I know that I could just wrap some electrical tape or even clear tape or duct tape around the cable to help it. But my real interest is in finding out if there is any significant difference in the conductivity based on the cords thickness which I would assume
 affects the resistance.</p>
<p>Here's a photo of two cords that I have to show a comparison of the wire sizes. The one on the right is one of my 3' long thinner cords.</p>

            <p>Thanks. That will take that off my TO-DO list. I'd actually been keeping a little chart of how long it took to charge from x% to x% with either the thick or a thin cord and I'd learned to both close all tabs in Internet Explorer and also to go to the home
 screen and close any APPs by holding down the &lt;- icon in the lower left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't go in and turn OFF the wi-fi or data since I figured since I wasn't using it for an internet connection, texting, phone calls or any APPs as I'd turned everything OFF and it was just sitting there charging which unfortunately also turns the phone
 ON.</p>
<p>I learned, which is really, really weird, that even after closing all open tabs in Internet Explorer, there would still be a few to close by using that 2nd process that I mentioned. That makes NO sense at all.</p>
<p>I'd assume that probably the actual braided wire of both the thick &amp; the thin ones is very similar and the only real difference is the size of the inner piece of the cord that the braided metal is wrapped around that is there just to give it shape &amp; strength
 if it is pulled on or is bent.</p>

    <title>Office Document on One Drive Won&#39;t Open - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office Document on One Drive Won&#39;t Open</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi<br />
I have a problem with Office documents stored in One Drive which started yesterday.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I tried to open a regularly used spreadsheet (opened at least every other day).<span>&nbsp;
</span>I opened Excel and used my pinned link but, as soon as I clicked the link Excel crashed. After trying this a few times I tried other similar spreadsheets with the same result.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then tried a variety of Word and Powerpoint documents, again stored on One Drive with the same result.</span></p>
<p><span>Other document types such as pdf, mp3, videos and jpegs etc all open fine it is just Office documents.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried documents stored in Dropbox (shared folder) and they opened OK.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then decided to copy my documents into Dropbox and they opened fine.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I noted prior to this that the files seemed to include additional characters in the file name (I think it was %20%), this disappeared after I moved them.</span></p>
<p><span>From here I went into One Drive and tried to open the same regularly used documents within the web “Excel Online” environment and again they opened OK.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then spotted in the taskbar that I was able to “Open in Excel” but of course as soon as I tried this Excel started to open and then crashed.</span></p>
<p><span>I use Windows defender and this has always told me my system is clean and I have had no other problems.</span></p>
<p><span>I am at a loss of what to do.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I use One Drive for all my files as part of our Office 365 package and have thousands of files stored here including my very precious Family Tree.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I do not want to have to move everything onto another cloud application so would be grateful for a simple solution.</span></p>

<p>Hi Palcouk</p>
<p>tried a reinstall of Office 363, no effect, contacted Office Support, no help and passed me on to One Drive Support.&nbsp; Tried your repair still got problem.&nbsp; Office support said it was an office problem and referred me back typical Microsoft support.&nbsp; Next
 step is to move my 1900 files from one drive to hard drive, reinstall one drive and try moving a few office files back and if that doesn't work move to Dropbox.</p>

<br />2. Click the Device button, then click Info.
<br />3. Select the items/files, which you want to sync.
<br />4. Press Sync at the bottom of the screen and all your iPhone contacts will be copied to your PC.

            Hi David, <br />
<br />
<br />
Since your contacts were duplicated on the <strong><a href="https://people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Live People</a></strong>, it must be deleted manually. After deleting them, we advise you
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">back up</a></strong> your phone's data, then perform a hard reset. This will reset your phone to a factory default. To hard reset your
 phone, just go to <strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; About &gt; Reset your phone</strong>. Once your phone is up and running, set up your Microsoft account to have your contacts back again.
<br />
<br />
Please let us know what happened.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            What is status on error&#40;bug&#41; resulting in duplicates or silently disappearing&#40;vanishing&#41; contacts&#40;people&#41; in Outlook 2013 using outlook.com, live.com and hotmail.com&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After quite some test and searching I have finally discovered that I am not the only one having issues with duplicate and silently vanishing contact entries in Outlook 2013 using outlook.com.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately my testing shows that the bug is more general and severe than described in this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-outlook/why-do-i-get-duplicate-contact-files-when-i-add-a/2274cfe9-1324-4294-ba24-ff84a3870e42">
thread</a>. So please do not<span>&nbsp; </span>just delete the duplicate as recommended, this will just cause the remaining copy to silently vanish when it is edited at some point later in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My tests indicate&nbsp;that&nbsp;it is best to avoid any modification (create, edit or delete) of contacts in Outlook 2013 when using outlook.com. Use the web or another device (e.g. iPhone) to do any contact modifications until the bug is fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem starts when creating a contact in Outlook 2013 folder connected to outlook.com, but at this point it is only a hidden error in the internal outlook data structure.&nbsp;The problem&nbsp;becomes visible when the contact sometime later is edited, and then
 results in a duplicate contact entry (one with the update and one without). Deleting one of the duplicates will cause the other contact to silently vanish when later edited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to reproduce the problem:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Create and save a contact in Outlook 2013, just call it TEST or something else.</span></li><li><span>Wait until it has been synchronized with outlook.com, this typically happens in a few seconds.</span></li><li><span><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Perform this single step in Outlook.com (</span></em></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>people.live.com)</em></span><span><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">, another Outlook 2013
 client (different Windows account or Windows computer), a Windows App, a Windows Phone, an Android or an iOS device:</span></em></span><span><br />
Modify something on the contact, such as adding a company name.</span></li><li><span>Wait until it has been synchronized with outlook.com </span></li><li><span>Now there will be two identical contacts named TEST in Outlook 2013. In outlook.com and other connected devices there is only one contact.</span></li><li><span>Delete any of the two contacts in Outlook 2013 and wait for synchronization.</span></li><li><span>Now there is one contact named TEST in Outlook 2013 and none in outlook.com or other connected devices.</span></li><li><span>Open, edit and save the contact in Outlook 2013 and wait for sync.</span></li><li><span>Now the contact silently vanishes in Outlook 2013 and cannot be seen on any devices.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The problem does not occur if the first step is performed on outlook.com. This leads me to conclude that the first step is the root cause where some kind of internal data inconsistency is created in the Outlook 2013 cache. The issue cannot be reproduced
 on some of my older contacts, so it may be a bug introduced by an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This brings me to the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Can the above steps reproduce the problem for everybody using a fully updated Outlook 2013 connected to outlook.com?</span></li><li><span>Can the above steps reproduce the problem when Outlook 2013 is connected to an Exchange Server?</span></li><li><span>Are there any indications that Microsoft is fully aware of the extent and severity of this problem?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Further details: </p>
<ul>
<li><span>Fully updated Windows 8.1</span></li><li><span>Fully updated Office Home and Business 2013 (version </span><span>15.0.4693.1001</span><span>)</span></li><li><span>Fully updated AVAST Antivirus - temporarily disabling it has no effect</span></li><li><span>Full Office online repair does not solve the problem.</span></li><li><span>Reproduced on two computers connected to different outlook.com accounts.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Tips: </p>
<ul>
<li><span>A vanished contact can be restored to the state of step 5 within 30 days from
</span><a href="https://people.live.com/#vw=deletedContacts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://people.live.com/#vw=deletedContacts</span></span></a><span>, but the last edit is permanently lost.</span></li><li><span>A duplicate contact can be fixed by first printing the contact, then deleting the duplicates in Outlook 2013, and finally recreating the contact using outlook.com on the web.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any feedback, guidance or help is highly appreciated :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the quick confirmation of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way I can track the status of the issue? or should I just test again every month/year?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible for you to test the same sequence when connected to an Exchange Server such as<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/exchange/exchange-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Exchange Online</a>?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am interested in the impact on users with Exchange Server because I based on this and some other issues now consider changing to Exchange Online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Nice straight answers :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had hoped to use outlook.com as a simple low cost back end to "run the family calendars like a business". But with<span>
</span>critical issues in the core functionality of both contacts and <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/ocalendar-oaddevent/reproduced-bugs-on-accepted-appointments-resulting/df5673e8-078a-4565-aca3-61bdc030cfa8">
calendar invites</a>&nbsp;this no longer seems realistic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to suggest the management of outlook.com to take their own medicine. This will hopefully lead them to<span>&nbsp;</span>remove functionality they don't want to test and make sure that the remaining functionality is thoroughly tested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is soothing to know that&nbsp;Exchange Online doesn't have the same problem. I will certainly do a trial to check if it fits better for our needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, have a nice day.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is an update about this ‘Outlook.com’ issue in Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is caused after installing one of the Outlook update which was released in this month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is working on this issue and the fix would be out very soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current workaround to get rid of this problem is to remove this Office update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you’re using ‘Click to run version Office 2013’ then follow the article given below to revert to earlier version of Office 2013 Click-to-Run.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you’re using the MSI version of Office 2013, then remove the update number <strong>
KB2770432 </strong>from Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much. I really appreciate the quick analysis and confirmation of the fix being out soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I<span>&nbsp; </span>guess the issue was introduced by one of the Outlook 2013 specific updates described in
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2956087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB2956087 </a>which is part of the February Update to Office described in
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com//kb/3032763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB3032763</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Office update also includes an important fix for the vulnerability <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms15-013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MS15-013</a> and this certainly makes me keep the update. I will rather update contacts on web or phone than risk that a malicious Office file is used to compromise my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I am truly impressed&nbsp;that you and your Microsoft colleagues&nbsp;were able to&nbsp;confirm a fix&nbsp;within 10 days :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards.</p>
        </p>

            <p>I have exactly the same Problem!</p>
<p>I first thought, that the Problem first occured with the February 2015 Hotfixes for Outlook and Office.</p>
<p>So i restored a Systemsnapshot so that my last updates where from December 2014.</p>
<p>Still the same Problem.</p>
<p>Because i didn't edit so much the contacts i couldn't say when the error first occured.</p>
<p>However - the contacts app for Windows 8 seems also to have a Problem with the cache - by playing arround with Outlook 2013 Sync - creating and deleting contacts suddenly the contacts in the contacts app persist - while in outlook 2013, in Outlook contacts
 web and on my Handy with Exchange active sync ther are no contacts - which is correct.</p>
<p>The only way to get rid of the wrong entrys in the contacts app is to reinstall the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there are two Problems - with outlook 2013 and a Connection to outlook.com and the contacts app (Windows 8.1) which is missing Synchronisation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess, that the Problem may be is on outlook.com itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that the bug will be found very fast and fixed - because now contacts with outlook2013 are not usable.</p>
<p>Thanks Thorsten</p>

            <p>Thank you Thorsten!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is great to get some additional observations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your information I tried out the workaround proposed by Nayana, and I can now confirm that the issue remains even after reverting to the previous version<span>&nbsp;
</span>(December 2014).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can add that the issue remains even after reverting to the version before that (November 2014). In this version I also reproduced the issue after creating a completely new Outlook cache under a new Windows account to rule out any doubt of a corrupted cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally tried the test sequence described in my first post in the Win People App and the iPhone Contacts App. I tested twice in each App and this did not result in any duplicates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my current conclusion is that this an issue related to Outlook 2013 and outlook.com, and that the issue can be reproduced in minimum these versions of Office 2013:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>February 2015 Update, Version: 15.0.4693.1002</span></li><li><span>December 2014 Update, Version: 15.0.4675.1002</span></li><li><span>November 2014 Update, Version: 15.0.4667.1002</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't try older versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Office 2013 was configured in the Spring 2014,<del> so something has changed in Outlook 2013 or outlook.com since.</del> (edited Mar3, 2015)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I would be very pleased to hear some news from Microsoft again. Can you confirm the latest observations and how do they impact your analysis and plans for a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Ole</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>Notes on reverting to older version of Office 2013:</em></p>
<p><em>I have the 64bit Click-to-run version and therefore followed steps in described in
</em><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2770432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>KB2770432</em></a><em>. Additionally I did a restart and then
</em><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/office-2013-365-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>checked the version</em></a><em> before starting each test. Automatic updates were reactivated immediately after the last tests.</em></p>
<p>

</em></a><em>(version 17.5.9600.20689):</em></p>
<p><em>I noticed that Win People App only updates automatically when the mail app is added to the lock screen. Otherwise you will have to close and restart the App to make it synchronize. The People App appears to silently loose updates if updates are performed
 on multiple devices without making sure that the data in the Win People App are fully updated before modification. I prefer Outlook and therefore never user the People App. To me the App ratings already talk their own clear language, so let's&nbsp;start any additional

<h2>            Clipart in MS Word 2013</h2>
                    I do not like the new clipart function in MS Word 2013. &nbsp;I have 15+ years worth of purchased clip art on disks, from many different collections. &nbsp;I want to use THAT clipart, instead of the very limited and often unattractive offerings from Microsoft. &nbsp;How
 can I disable the MS Word 2013 clipart function, and go back to the way that I have used clipart in Word for the past 20+ years? &nbsp;Do I have to remove Word 2013 and reinstall one of the prior versions of Office? &nbsp;I use clipart ALL the time and I want what I
 used to have! &nbsp;I am a very unhappy Word 2013 user! &nbsp;I have been unhappy with the changes that Microsoft has made to its flagship programs in the past three years. &nbsp;I don't mind change, but when the changes are so radical that a heavy user has to spend weeks
 "re-learning" a program that they have been proficient with for many years, it makes no sense to me! &nbsp;I don't want to be a dinosaur, and I embrace innovation. &nbsp;But, the recent chan

            <p>I think what you're saying is that you added these clips (or shortcuts to them) to the locally stored Office Clip Art Gallery or Clip Organizer so that they could be accessed directly from Word using the
<strong>Insert</strong> command. Sadly, MS has been backing away from locally stored clip art for several versions now. But the clip art that you have purchased is still available using
<strong>Insert | Illustrations | Pictures</strong>. You just have to know ahead of time what picture you want. If you clip collection came with catalog (as many of mine did), you have to search the catalog to find the clip you want, then navigate to its location
 and insert it. I recognize that this is less convenient than being able to search by keyword, but it's what you're left with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the files on my system (where I have parts of Office 2003, 2007, 2010, and 2013 installed), I see a modest collection of Clip Art apparently intended for use in Publisher (two folders containing 1,657 clips 34 backgrounds) and a Media folder containing
 subfolders for CAGCAT10 and Office 11, 12, and 14. The Office folders include subfolders for Shapes, Bullets, and Lines. The contents of CAGCAT10 and the Shapes folder are all .wmf files, which can't be previewed, so they're not much help (the Publisher clip
 art is a combination of GIFs and WMFs. All of my other graphic files are on CDs with printed catalogs.</p>

            Thank you, Suzanne!&nbsp; Yes, I have previously stored heavily used clips within MS Word &amp; Publisher.&nbsp; Those are now gone &amp; I can't "see" a preview of the clips from my separate clip art collections anymore.&nbsp; Some of the collections came with little books
 containing illustrations of the clip art &amp; some don't.&nbsp; For the ones that don't have the book, Word used to let me click on the clip art &amp; it would show a preview of the clip, so that I could sort through them to find the one I was looking for.&nbsp; None of that
 works anymore.&nbsp; I hate the new interface &amp; am going to just abandon the product.&nbsp; I fired up an older laptop computer that has WordPerfect and Word 2002 installed on it &amp; both of them work just fine.&nbsp; I will just use those as my primary word processor when
 I am making newsletters &amp; the like.&nbsp; I'm going to get my computer tech to uninstall my new copy of Word 2013 from my main computer &amp; I'll get him to install Office 2008, which I had before purchasing the new computer.<br />

            <p>Legal_Tex, I'm afraid you maybe disappointed if you try to use an older version. From my experience at an elementary school, Microsoft seems to have "turned off" the server where their clipart was stored. If you installed the clipart locally (on the computer)
 when you installed Office, you might be okay. You can tell what you have installed locally by deselecting Use Office.com content in Word 2010. 2013 may be similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a deliberate (and in my view, unfortunate) choice by Microsoft to direct users to Bing images instead of the prior options.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Keetech, thank you for that input!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't care anything about using Microsoft's old clipart.&nbsp; I have purchased many programs that contain clipart.&nbsp; In the older versions of MS Word, when I'd search for my other clipart (not from MS), I could go to "Insert, Clip Art, From file" and navigate
 to the clip art program (or disk).&nbsp; I could get a "preview" of the clip art, so that if I didn't have a little catalog that came with the program, I could scroll through all of the pictures &amp; find what I was wanting to insert into the document.&nbsp; That functionality
 is lost in Word 2013.&nbsp; It only wants to use the Bing images online &amp;/or I can direct it will go to another program or disk, but no preview is available.&nbsp; So, if I don't know that the image I'm looking for is numbered A2133 (or whatever the program calls it),
 I can't pull up the image to insert it in my document.&nbsp; I'd have to select and then delete thousands of images, until I could find the *one* that I'm looking for.&nbsp; I'm sorry if I'm explaining this poorly!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think if I just uninstall Office 2013 and instead install one of my older versions of Office, the preview functionality may still work.&nbsp; (It does on my old laptop, which has Office 2006 installed on it.)&nbsp; I understand that Microsoft's clipart may be gone,
 but I don't care about that if I can still use some of the other clipart programs that I have purchased over the years, such as the program, "Clip Art and More 3 Million Images".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very disappointed with Office 2013.&nbsp; I've been a very loyal MS Office user since the mid-90s, but it no longer functions as I need it to function!&nbsp; I have ordered a new copy of WordPerfect &amp; I'm going to see if it still has the functionality that I used
 to like, before turning to MS Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for trying to help me with my problem!</p>

            You can still get the functionality you want. Use <strong>Insert | Illustrations | Pictures</strong> instead. Navigate to the folder where you want to look and set the Explorer window to Large Icons or Extra-Large Icons, and you will still get the preview
 you need.

            Unfortunately, the Pictures dialog (like all derivatives of Windows Explorer) can't display thumbnails of WMF files, so that won't work for the clipart in the CABCAT and PUB60COR folders. However, the free
<a href="http://www.irfanview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IrfanView</a> program has a Thumbnails view that not only will&nbsp;display them but will print contact sheets of some or all of the pictures in a folder.

            Yes, I did notice the WMF deficiency when I was exploring what little is left of the installed clip art in my Office folders. But most commercial clip art would probably be GIFs or JPEGs (or PNGS if newer).
