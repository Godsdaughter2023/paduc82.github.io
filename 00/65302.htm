<h2>            Taskbar keeps defaulting back to auto-hide.</h2>
                    My taskbar keeps defaulting back to auto-hide. This happens randomly when I am using the computer, not necessarily when it is rebooted. I keep unchecking the autohide box, clicking "apply" and then "ok"- it works for a little bit, but then switches back
 to auto-hide.

<p>Hi twins2702,</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>We recommend you to check if any non-Microsoft program is causing this issue. To do this, perform clean boot:<br />
a. Open the article: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
b. From the article, follow "Step 1: Perform a clean boot" Executing these steps will disable all the non-Microsoft programs running on the computer.<br />
c. Check if the issue persists.<br />
d. If the issue does not persist in clean boot, it means that some non-Microsoft program is causing the issue.<br />
e. To find out the program that's causing the issue, try "Step 2: Enable half of the services" to "Step 6: Resolve the problem"<br />
f. Once you find the culprit, check if there are any updates or patches for the program. If you find any, install them and check the difference or reinstall the latest program.<br />
g. From the article, follow "Step 7: Reset the computer to start as usual"</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Stuck Pixel Clusters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s. valen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Stuck Pixel Clusters</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 1 week ago I noticed (while watching Netflix) that I had 2 clusters of stuck pixels. When they should show black, they show a purple color instead. I know they are not dead, as they represent all other colors fine whether using Office, browsing, or
 playing video games. I have tried giving them a bit of time to fix themselves, gently rubbing them with my finger, and using a couple of stuck pixel fixers (flashing different colors on the screen).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has worked so far. As for the obligatory questions, yes, my computer is up to date; no, I have not dropped it or tapped the screen very hard; I use the computer every day with the pen extensively. The only color change is a cluster of pixels in the
 upper left hand of the screen that show purple instead of black. My computer does often warm from utilization, but in the upper right hand side of the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have included pictures of the pixels. The large cluster is clearly visible, but underneath it is a second cluster in the shape of a crescent moon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice (especially one that avoids sending it in as it is my only device I have access to) would be very welcomed.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfe95661-0eaa-4cb1-a35c-5ed7b06cb211" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes. After talking with Tech Support, we found it to probably be a hardware problem, and needs to be replaced. Unfortunately, I am outside the country and will be unable to deal with this until January.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Hui16. this is a known bug caused by an incompatibility between the new update and your video device driver . . .
<br />
<br />Try rolling that device driver back to a previous version and then restart to see if this resolves the issue.
<br />
<br />Microsoft are aware of the compatibility issue and will hopefully release a patch for this as soon as possible . . .

            Hi Hui16,
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

<p>My gamertag is Ajaxson...</p>
<p><br />
I have not modifyied anything.&nbsp; Having read some blogs I assume it is because of the avatar color.&nbsp; Honestly, I have no idea where&nbsp;the green avatar came from as I don't even know how to modify or make any changes&nbsp;other than what is offered as a standard which
 for me has always been the white guy with a mustache and hat.&nbsp; Now I have paid every month&nbsp;so&nbsp;either someone hacked my account or there is some type&nbsp;glitch in the system.&nbsp; I am not even very good at playing any of the games as you can probably see from my
 scores and I don't play that often as you can probably see from my play history.&nbsp; I have never been banned or warned&nbsp;before, at least to my knowledge, and it would see to me to be good business to keep a customer with a recurring payment history and countless
 purchased upgrades rather&nbsp;than to ban a person without a simple warning and instructions on how to make the appropriate change.&nbsp; Companies spend millons of dollars annually&nbsp;on customer retention&nbsp;and it doesn't seem that you have made any attempt&nbsp;to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Update makes TV app 480p on start up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radioslave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update makes TV app 480p on start up</h2>
                    
<p>Watching live TV through my XBox One was once awesome, but since the system update it's been problematic. &nbsp;Whenever I power on my TV and DirecTV receiver using my XBox, the picture is zoomed in and stretched across the screen to the point I can't see the
 edges. &nbsp;If I'm watching ESPN or CNN, I can't see the ticker on the bottom, and the tickers on the sides are half gone. &nbsp;I know for a fact that doing a simple calibration will NOT fix this problem.</p>
<p>Yesterday, an MS tech concluded that the picture is cut off because it's showing in 480p, not 720p or 1080p. &nbsp;To remedy the situation, he told me to power everything off, unplug every HDMI cable and then plug it back in again. &nbsp;He thought that would clear
 any errors that may have been going in a loop from the DirecTV box, to the XBox One, to the TV, and back again. &nbsp;It worked. &nbsp;The TV flipped back to 720p instantly. &nbsp;Then, I checked to see what the resolution would be if I powered on the XBox again. &nbsp;Again,
 it worked. &nbsp;The picture was indeed 720p and calibrated perfectly. &nbsp;Everything was fine, until...</p>
<p>This afternoon, I powered on the XBox One and the picture was back to 480p and stretched all over the screen again. &nbsp;The only way to get the picture back to 720p was to power off my DirecTV box and power it on again (while leaving the XBox One and my TV
 on). &nbsp;It appears that the XBox during startup doesn't wait long enough for the DirecTV box to output enough signal information for the picture to be displayed correctly. &nbsp;Since the update, I've noticed how much faster the boot up process is. &nbsp;Considering the
 problem I'm having, I think it may be a little too fast.</p>
<p>Of course, I could be wrong about why I'm watching a wacky 480p TV picture every time I turn on my XBox One. &nbsp;If you can think of any other possible causes, please let me know. &nbsp;Here's a list of things I've already tried:</p>
<p>1. Unplugging the XBox for :30 seconds to clear the cache.</p>
<p>2. Unplugging the satellite for :30 seconds to reset it.</p>
<p>3. Made sure the TV, DirecTV box and the XBox One are all set to the same resolution. &nbsp;XBox is set to 1080p (Auto-Detect). &nbsp;LG TV is "Set by program." DirecTV box is set to show in 720p or 1080p only (the 480p option is NOT selected).</p>
<p>4. Bypassed the XBox One to test the DirecTV box. &nbsp;Plugged HDMI cable from the DirecTV box straight into the TV to see if the DirecTV box still displays in 720p at startup. &nbsp;It does.</p>
<p>5. Swapped out the HDMI cables.</p>
<p>6. Reset XBox One to factory defaults to setup the TV and the satellite box from scratch.</p>
<p>7. Turned off Dolby 7.1</p>
<p>I really like my XBox One, but if I don't find a solution to this problem soon, I'll be forced to stop using the pass-through to watch live TV, which is supposed to be the best feature on the XBox One. &nbsp;It really bothers me because everything was working
 fine before the system update.</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear about the issue. To get a better idea of what is at play here, the following information is very useful. I have not yet heard of the system update doing such a thing, more proof would be excellent for me to follow up on. Before I do that,
 let us run through the troubleshooting (if you are so inclined).</p>
<p>1. Make AND Model of STB (cable/sat box)</p>
<p>2. TV Provider</p>
<p>3. Layout (example: STB HDMI Xbox One HDMI TV) (please note splitters and hubs).</p>
<p>-Cheers</p>

<p>Thank you XB1R Hermes!</p>
<p>I have DirecTV as my satellite provider. </p>
<p>My DirecTV HD DVR model HR24 is connected to my XBox One via standard HDMI cables. &nbsp;From the XBox One, I have an HDMI cable connected to a powered Auvio SimPlay HDMI selector which has 4 HDMI inputs. &nbsp;The HDMI selector is needed to share an HDMI input on
 my TV with 4 devices (my XBox One, DVD Recorder, Nintendo Wii, and a Google Chromecast). &nbsp;The HDMI output from my HDMI selector is connected to an LG Plasma TV Model number 50PV400. &nbsp;The other HDMI input on my TV is not being used, since I don't want to buy
 any more expensive 10-foot long HDMI cables for it (I have my TV mounted inside a very wide entertainment center.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that I had no issues at all with my setup prior to the XBox One system update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to make sure that my HDMI selector wasn't an problem, I connected my XBox One directly to my television today and bypassed the HDMI selector. &nbsp;It didn't make a difference. &nbsp;The picture was the same 480p resolution on start-up.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>I have a similar problem. &nbsp;My pass through TV signal comes out as a lower smaller image (like a letter box but with black all around it like a photo frame)</p>
<p>It could be 480 I guess I have not measured it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can stretch it to fit in the Xbox settings, but its scaled and doesnt look good (not HD quality) and if do scale it up the menus from the cable box are too big and run off the edges of the screen.</p>
<p>I havn't done much troubleshooting yet (I leave my cable box on all the time and I dont have the Xbox turn it on or off)
</p>
<p>STB is a Motorola/Comcast HD DVR box</p>
<p>TV is an Olevia 720p LCD</p>

<p>It turns out that this problem is NOT new. &nbsp;Others have had the same issue dating back to the November launch. &nbsp;The link below proves it.</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4277/t/1630780.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../1630780.aspx</a></p>
<p>I am extremely disappointed. &nbsp;The more I think about it, the more I regret buying my XBox One at launch. &nbsp;It's going to take a lot of fine tuning to get the TV app to work properly for everyone, regardless of their TV model or cable or satellite provider.
 &nbsp;What remains to be seen is whether or not Microsoft is willing to acknowledge all of their issues and work diligently to fix them. &nbsp;So far, all I've seen nothing from tech support but denial. &nbsp;The line I keep hearing is, "That's the first I've heard of that
 issue."</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I've spent the past couple of days trying even more fixes on my own, all to no avail. &nbsp;Add these to the list:</p>
<p>1. Switched the DirecTV box native resolution option to OFF.</p>
<p>2. Unselected 1080p as an option on my DirecTV box. &nbsp;720p is now the ONLY option checked.</p>
<p>3. Switched DirecTV box aspect ratio to 4:3 instead of 16:9. &nbsp;The XBox One support website suggested that.</p>
<p>4. Turned OFF the XBox One's ability to turn my DirecTV box on and off, so that the DirecTV box is always ON and ready to feed a signal to the XBox One during start-up.</p>
<p>In short, NOTHING works. &nbsp;No matter what resolution I have my TV and DirecTV box set to, the XBox One will always power on in 480p with a picture stretched all the way off the screen. &nbsp;I hate it!</p>

<p>After further review, I have NO DOUBT that there is nothing wrong with my TV, satellite box, HDMI cables or settings. &nbsp;The problem is definitely the updated XBox One TV app. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I know? &nbsp;I noticed that the XBox One TV app never launches in 480p whenever another app besides the TV app is in the main window at start-up. &nbsp;In other words, if the YouTube app was the last app used before the XBox was shut down, the XBox will boot
 up with the YouTube app in the main window (not the TV app). &nbsp;In that case, the XBox doesn't need to hurry up and put a live TV picture in the main window at start-up. &nbsp;What I've noticed is that the TV app launches just fine (in 720p) whenever it is not pre-loaded
 in the main window and it is selected from one of the smaller windows underneath the main window. &nbsp;That tells me the XBox One isn't giving itself enough time to load the TV app properly at start-up when it's in the main window. &nbsp;Clearly, the system update
 was designed to make the TV app load faster than before, but I'm afraid the extra speed causes a flawed picture that is displayed in 480p.
</p>
<p>When given enough time to load after start-up, the TV app works fine. &nbsp;That also explains why cutting off the satellite box and cutting it back on again upgrades the corrupted 480p picture to 720p instantly. &nbsp;It's just giving the XBox more time to load the
 TV app, and then re-sending the signal from the satellite box after it does.</p>
<p>In conclusion, The TV app needs to be updated again to fix this problem.</p>

<p>Thank you for the nice run down on troubleshooting. I hate to take the low-road, but upon testing simplification to form a control. Have you removed the switch to test?

<p>Thank you for responding Hermes.</p>
<p>Yes, I removed the switch completely from the chain to see if the picture looked any different without it. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it was the same 480p, overstretched picture.</p>
<p>The HDMI switcher was among the first possible causes that I tested. &nbsp;I'm sorry I forgot to mention that earlier.</p>
<p>I have switched my XBox One power settings from "Instant ON" mode to "Energy-Saving" mode. &nbsp;The TV app now launches in 720p every time, which further convinces me that "Instant ON" mode loads the TV app too fast to work properly (at least with my DirecTV
 receiver and TV). &nbsp;I'm ready to bet my life on it.</p>

<p>I don't want to jinx it, but I turned my TV on twice today with no issues. &nbsp;A perfectly-scaled 720p picture loaded into the main window with the XBox in "Instant ON" mode. &nbsp;I haven't changed anything. &nbsp;It's just working, at least for the time being. &nbsp;Perhaps
 there was a TV app update last night?</p>

<p>Never mind. &nbsp;It was working just fine for about 2 days, then this afternoon I turned on the TV and it was back to the same overstretched 480p picture. &nbsp;The only thing I did different this afternoon was a hard reboot of my Xbox One. &nbsp;I had to reboot because
 My XBox Live screen kept showing those pesky loading circles instead of actually loading content (even though my XBox One passed an internet connection test). &nbsp;After rebooting, XBox Live loaded just fine, but the TV app was back to being broken. &nbsp;I just can't
 win.</p>
<p>I know this is a ridiculous question, but could there be a connection between how the TV app loads and how XBox Live loads?</p>

<p>Here's an update. &nbsp;After trying every possible fix for weeks now, nothing has changed. &nbsp;The TV app still boots up with an overstretched 480p picture. &nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, I strongly believe an update is necessary for the TV app to work properly. &nbsp;Perhaps
 the TV app should wait a few seconds longer before attempting to display the live TV picture. &nbsp;That would give it a chance to get complete signal information from the set-top box, including the correct resolution. &nbsp;Why else would the TV app work perfectly
 whenever it is NOT in the main window on start-up?</p>

<h2>            GTA 5 Restarting At Same Area&#40;Marketplace&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I downloaded GTA 5 on my xbox 360 and when ever I tried to go to the mountains area pass the airfield, it will restart itself without any error message. I also tried to loop around the other side on both freeways and I cannot even get to it. I tried calling
 the taxi and still no breakthrough. It installed on my HDD, I have about 50GB of free space and &nbsp;I have cleared my System Cache many times. Should I re-download? :[</p>

<p>This is why I refuse to go to Digital Download for games... too many problems can (and will) go wrong with it. Besides... I'd rather have the physical.</p>
<p>Anyway, to the topic... My cousin downloaded the digital version on PS3 and was having the same problems you are @sk8terboy4, but after he checked the online and parental settings, deleted and then re downloaded, it worked. I know that was on PS3, but give
 it a try and see if that works.</p>

<p>Thanks Sorry for the late reply... I am Re-downloading the game and install packs. If that does not work then I will contact Rockstar or Microsoft. :)</p>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Unrecognisable Disc&#38;quot&#59; &#40;03-80-00&#41; Problem</h2>
                    
<p>I have just started having a problem with Fifa 12 in my xbox 360 console. Here's what happened...</p>
<p>As my xbox is a little dodgy it was stanidng up to allow more air flow and I had fifa 12 in it and was just sitting on the dashboard when my cat jumps up and starts attempting to climb the xbox. The console fell, not far just from where it was onto the desk.
 Then it said the disc was unreadable when I tried it. I tried a couple of times evrey time it said "unrecognisable disc" then when I pressed Y it said status code 03-80-00. I came on my PC and checked various "fixes." I then thought I better check if it is
 just Fifa or not, so i loaded up assasins creed and it ran fine in my console.</p>
<p>So I think there might be something wrong with the fifa 12 disc but there are no visible signs of scratch or crack. Any help?</p>

<p>This happened to me as well, I was in a forum with over 160 posts in the 00 section of the support forums. &nbsp;Now I go to check on its progress and it is down. &nbsp;Right after a bunch of us started saying we made reports to the FTC. &nbsp;The ambassadors are telling
 everyone we need repairs but its not a hardware issue its the stupid anti piracy crap codes they are forcing us to download that is causing this. &nbsp;And this is happening only to my Skyrim as well. &nbsp;I decided that if this isnt fixed soon I will be spending my
 christmas gift cards towards a PS3 or making a gaming PC and never using microsoft again. &nbsp;They have such poor customer service and poor quality of product anymore.</p>

<p>@Hitman I was also in that forum, and was following it for any updates. I go to look at it today and it's disappeared. Microsoft doesn't solve the issue, doesn't have any updates from any support members, has over 160 people frustrated trying everything
 possible, and when people start reporting them, they just delete everything as if it never happened. My xbox no longer reads discs and just sits on "open tray" when a disc is inserted and Microsoft customer support, chat support, twitter support, all say nothing
 can be done and I have to send it in and pay $99 to get something fixed that MICROSOFT caused with THEIR update. This is absolutely horrible customer service and has forever tarnished my view of Microsoft.</p>

<p>I am building a Gaming PC and taking my business elsewhere. &nbsp;I ma tired of their ***. &nbsp;They ruin a good thing and then try to hide it by deleting the forum we go to to get help. &nbsp;I hope the FTC gets more complaints and they get hammered for this. &nbsp;As I said
 though I will be gaming on PC only from now on. &nbsp;I mean everything that comes out on xbox can be played on a PC if not a good bit better. &nbsp;And if its xbox only I am sure I will find a way to play it on my computer. &nbsp;Even though I have never pirated a game
 before, thanks to Microsoft I am surely considering pirating the *** out of everything they put out from now on.</p>

<p>I'm having this problem with the Kinect Sports season 1, it's new, just opened it and it doesn't read. (my other games work fine) I used a PS2 before and never bought a original game, and now I thought to use a original console and buy original games, but
 if problems like this are starting to happening, I guess my xbox will be modded. I'm trying to go by the law, but if I can't use a console the way it should be, to play games, then I have to do something about it. (maybe get a PS3)</p>

<p>Very good idea Hitman. I just filed a complaint with the FTC regarding this issue. Hopefully an investigation will take place. Please everyone file a complaint (if you are indeed experiencing this issue) to the FTC. Microsoft is not taking responsibility

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Which version of Windows Operating system are you using? Is it Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you a re using Windows 7. .NET Framework version 3.5 service pack is pre-installed with the operating system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Based on your post, it looks like the.Net Framework installed on the computer is corrupt.<br />
Please try the following steps and let us know if it was helpful.</div>
<div>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type cmd in the Start Search box, right-click in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.<br />
Note: If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</div>
<div>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run sfc /scannow -&gt; This command checks for missing or corrupted system files. If it runs clean, with no errors, we learn nothing. If it finds missing or corrupted files, it will try to replace them with good copies and maybe fix your problem.</div>

    <title>Can&#39;t connect to wifi and Action Centre not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gemma63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to wifi and Action Centre not working</h2>
                    I have been using Windows 10 for a few months. After having initial and continuing problems with my wifi connection it then began to run well with no problems and I was happy with Windows 10 &nbsp;.... &nbsp;2 days ago I left the room for five minutes only to return
 to find my laptop was mysteriously in the middle of updating Windows 10. Since then I have had continual problems with my internet connection. If I click on the wifi icon at the bottom of the screen it opens the box and tells me I am connected to my connection
 and it is secure, however this is NOT the case as although it tells me this I have no connection. At other times it tells me there is no connection available... I have not been able to connect to the internet unless I use the internet troubleshoot. .. Today
 it has got worse and the trouble shoot won't connect me and either tells me that there is no connection available or that there is nothing wrong. So now the ONLY way I can connect is to go to network adapter trouble

            <p>Thankyou... I have continually checked to update the driver and it has continually told me that I did not need to update, so I have now uninstalled and reinstalled and the wifi problem appears to be fixed now... HOWEVER the Action Centre does not appear
 to be working ie I have not been getting any notifications since the Windows 10 update (which also caused the wifi problem)... I have no way to know if Defender is working and no notifications - Action Centre is not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me ..</p>

<p>Dear MA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also a&nbsp;problem before in installing an updates&nbsp;but the error was&nbsp;Ox80004005. I am running w10 pro, and ask help from the Microsoft Tech and was never solved. Instead, the tech recommended me to have a Premium Software Support for a month and for some
 reasons I apologized to deny.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the solution I made to try in order to resolved the problem was I did a clean install in an offline method (because before when I made it was I'm online). After&nbsp;installing in an offline method,&nbsp;I wait for the system to install its updates a couple
 of hours but it did&nbsp;nothing. So, I made a manual updates and waiting for the updates to get installed. Luckily, it was successful. All the updates were got installed. My system up to now was updated. If this suggestion won't succeed, try to&nbsp;find&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note in my way of having a clean install:</p>
<p>1. Go offline.</p>
<p>2. Insert media (I'm using a USB flash) and restart.</p>
<p>3. Boot the media from boot menu (F12&nbsp;in my Toshiba)</p>
<p>4. Select custom install and format primary drive.</p>
<p>5. When asked a country, language, and keyboard I select all into US.</p>
<p>6. After a successful install, I went online and logged in to my Microsoft Account. I&nbsp;made no changes to its settings except the way it deliver an updates (I checked "give me updates for other Microsoft products&nbsp;when I update windows").</p>
<p>7. Do not opened&nbsp;both the Edge and IE browser until the updates got installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Because it was stuck at that particular update at 0%. After deleting the folder, the Intel update is gone and windows update works again. I guess it was accidentally published, then taken offline and the update process couldn't handle that.<br />

                    <p>I've come across a new issue that I've never seen before - on a users workstation, when I signed in as the domain admin user to do some work on it, I found the profile was pointing to 'C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile'. I tried logging in as my user
 and the profile for my account was pointing to the same location. First thing I tried was using 'Advanced System settings' in system properties, deleted the profile for my user while logged in as the domain admin and logged out. When I logged in as my user,
 I now get a temp profile and messages indicating desktop can't be found. I've been searching for answers and I have only been able to find a few variation of 'answers', none of which either work or are answers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen people saying to copy your profile data to 'C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile', which ISN'T the answer, I've seen people suggesting logging in as another account (that hasn't logged in before), and for me, that gives the same result (temp
 profile), running sfc /scannow which I did with 'No errors found'. I've seen people say look for the 'BAK registry entry, something I'm very familiar with, and that wasn't the issue. I checked the registry and removed all references to my SID and the domain
 admins SID, no change. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any NEW ideas as to why two user profiles were looking to 'C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile' and when those profiles were removed from the computer, they now get temp profiles rather than creating new profiles like you'd expect?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Restoring %UserProfile% to its correct value with the SET command is futile because it changes this variable only in the current child process, not in the the registry. As soon as the OP closes this child process the change is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This location holds the value for all NEW user profiles:</p>
<p><em>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList/ProfilesDirectory</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This location holds the value for the current user's profile folder:</p>
<p><em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Volatile Environment\</em><em>UserProfile</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether resetting it to the correct value would solve the OP's problem I do not know.</p>

            <p>Well that's bizarre. The 'ProfilesDirectory' has '%SystemDrive%\Users' as its value, so the new profiles *SHOULD* be getting created there... But they're not. Short of a reload, I don't know what else to do with it.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say you've been using domain admin and domain user accounts. Is it only that one pc and only gives the problem with your domain account on that pc? If that's the case have you tried logging in as local admin and delete your domain&nbsp;admin account? This
 is also a bit out of my scope but if I haven't tried this then this is what I would have tried before reloading. Then while you are in on local admin run ipconfig /registerdns for the sake of it. Then reboot and try logging back in on your domain admin account.</p>

<h2>            Music Maker Jam in Windows 10</h2>
                    I 'upgraded' from 8.1 to Windows 10 today on my laptop, and I now find that the vast majority of the Music Maker Jam styles I purchased have gone missing from my own styles and are back in the 'available' section and asking for me to pay for them again!
 I'm not too happy about doing that, obviously. Any ideas on how I can reinstate my purchases? I tried the 'Troubleshoot App' option, but it couldn't find any problem. Thanks!
