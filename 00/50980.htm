<h2>            Trying to Tether mobile&#58; USB remote NDIS network device adapter is experiencing driver or hardware-related problems&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all! not sure if this is the place to post this, seeing as the phone is new, and otherwise problem free, I take it as a Windows problem.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've recently signed up for a Three's The one plan with the tethering on a Galaxy Note 1, but Windows 8 is having a little problems keeping track of it as GT-7000 in folders under computer as it appears and then disappears at random, but is OK for the
 most part, I've enabled USB tethering in Android-setting-Tethering and portable hotspot-USB tethering ticket but no love, it just won't register the connection in Network and shearing center in Windows :(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Have looked at the following help pages with no luck:</div>
<div><a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/182134?hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.google.com/android/answer/182134?hl=en-GB</a>&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's only by disconnecting my ethernet cable connection was I able to find the following error message, through fix problem. &nbsp;</div>

<p>I experienced the same problem today: (Sony Vaio Flip 15 w/ Win 8.1, Samsung Galaxy S4).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I created my problem by attempting to use "VAIO Control Center", which allows the user to preset certain factors, such as default printer, based upon the network connection.&nbsp; This software does not have "USB" as a network source and defaulted to
 LAN.&nbsp; Upon exitting, the software corrupted the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rolling back the driver as described above restored Internet access via the USB tether.&nbsp; Windows Update provided the new driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy also placed on Sony's support site.</p>

<p>Hi Dolores,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're having issues with Windows Store app in Windows 10, an issue with the Store cache may cause it. To troubleshoot your concern, we recommend that you run the WSReset command to clear the Store app cache in Windows. It means it will reset the Windows
 Store application into a clean state. To reset the app, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Close Windows Store app, if it's running.</li><li>In the Start Menu Search box, type WSReset. <br />
</li><li>Right-click on WSReset and then click Run as administrator option. Click Yes button when you see the user account confirmation box.<br />
</li><li>Wait for the command to finish.</li><li>Check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the solution above works for you.</p>

<p>Thank you Sher Amo for replying. I tried this but it did not work. When I am in Windows Store the Read &amp; Write extension still comes up Launch. I click on it and it bring me to the MSN page which I forgot to mention before.&nbsp; The same thing happens with the
 Pocket extension.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope this can be fixed.&nbsp; Thank you again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dolores Desroche</p>

<p>Thank you again Sher Amo for replying.&nbsp; I'm not sure what you mean. My problem with these two extensions are in Microsoft Edge. I cannot uninstall them because they are not in my list of extensions. In the Windows Store it show both as installed and when
 I click on either one it says Launch. When I click on Launch it brings me to the MSN new site.&nbsp; I just recently got Google Chrome only after these problems occurred, but Edge is my main browser. My other extensions are still working fine like OneNote Clipper
 and Pin It.&nbsp; Please let me know if there is something else I can do.</p>

<p>
</p><p>i have tried the PS/2 option and it works every time, as long as the device has a PS/2 port.&nbsp; some of the devices are AIOs or small form factor which don't have a PS/2 port.&nbsp; this is where i'm getting stuck..&nbsp; their&nbsp; was an upgrade to some software which
 i believe could be the cause.&nbsp; i've checked the bios one by one and all things pertaining to USB are enabled.&nbsp; windows version is win7 version 6.1, build 7601, service pack 1.</p>

            the computers without PS/2 ports weren't able to boot normally and unfortunately had to be reimaged as a resolution.&nbsp; all devices in question are company computers which experienced the same issue.&nbsp; this is an issue that has occurred intermittently, at
 least enough to send me to google without any success.&nbsp; I figured I would try to ask here so maybe next time reimaging would not be the only option for non PS/2 computers.

<p>Hello</p>
<p>This is currently an issue and there is no real thing you can about it, many gamers feel the same pain as you do not being able to use the English language on their console in a non native English speaking country.</p>
<p>There is however a thread on the Xbox Feedback website where you can vote to have your language and region being set independently from eachother so that in your case you can use the English language in the German region. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>XBOX COMMUNICATION BAN&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt2177  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX COMMUNICATION BAN&#33;</h2>
                    I honestly think this is uncalled for.&nbsp; I have been an Xbox Live member for over 15 years and I was banned tonight for no reason necessary.&nbsp; I did not send any harsh/offensive comments to any users on Xbox Live.&nbsp; This is a major disappointment, to the
 point where I am contemplating deleting my subscription permanently.&nbsp; I have already canceled my auto renew due to this anguish.&nbsp; My current ban for no reason is slated to end on 2/16/2019.&nbsp; My issue would be resolved if I receive a communication from Xbox
 Enforcement lifting the ban.&nbsp; I am currently still paying for the service but am not reaping the full benefit and am being penalized for an action that I did not commit.&nbsp; Please advise me on this, I would greatly appreciate it.&nbsp; Thank you.

            I thank you for your response.&nbsp; There is no assistance with a ban, is what I have gathered from your response as well as countless attempts on the said link that you have asked me to follow.&nbsp; I am one disappointed customer, but I know that my misfortune
 doesn't matter since I am just a cog in the machine.&nbsp; There is no one here to help me.&nbsp; I feel like I have been mistreated, let alone cheated out of a service that I have been paying for, for many years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>So there could be a few reasons you were banned. If you are 100% certain it was a communication ban, honestly it may be a miscommunication between someone random who may have taken a comment the wrong way, or a capture that may have been distasteful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't know if it was communications, it could be because someone thought you were cheating, which, by the way, will be lifted if Xbox finds you weren't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving forward from this, just wait it out. Don't be so hard on yourself, as you're not the only one this happens to. My friend was banned because he killed someone in one of my live streams on Battlefield 1, and Xbox found out he wasn't actually cheating.
 When it comes to this, the main keys are patience and optimism.</p>

<p>====================================<br />
Are you running Windows XP?<br />
<br />
If you right click a photo and choose...Send To / Mail Recipient...<br />
do you see a dialog that says "Make All My Pictures Smaller"?<br />
(if you click 'Show More Options' you can choose different sizes)<br />
<br />
If_Yes_and if you click...OK...it should launch a new email <br />
message with a resized photo attached.<br />
<br />
Also...the following free Windows XP PowerToy is useful for<br />
resizing photos:<br />
<br />
Go to the following link and left click the PowerToys tab...<br />
<br />
Windows XP Downloads<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-xp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-xp</a><br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Download and install:&nbsp;&nbsp; ImageResizer.exe<br />
(Filename&nbsp; :&nbsp; ImageResizerPowertoySetup.exe)<br />
(will not run on Vista)<br />
<br />
Then you can open any folder that contains<br />
images and you will have an option to resize.<br />
Just right click the selected image files and<br />
choose Resize Pictures from the menu. You<br />
can select one image or a whole group.<br />
<br />
The program will place the resized copies in<br />
the folder with your originals.<br />
(Tip: *Never* overwrite your originals)<br />
<br />
To insure that images in both portrait and<br />
landscape orientation are resized to the<br />
same dimensions...go to...Advanced...<br />
and enter the largest number in both fields.<br />
IOW...for 600x800...enter 800 in both fields.</p>

    <title>Corrupted Input Language&#47;Keyboard &#47; Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikodemussweden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupted Input Language&#47;Keyboard &#47; Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I have an utterly frustrating problem... I'm normally using Swedish as the Input Language and a Swedish keyboard layout. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, one (1)&nbsp;specific&nbsp;key stopped functioning. I am 100% sure that it's not a Hardware problem. The same
 (physical) key on the keyboard &nbsp;works perfectly when the keyboard layout is&nbsp;anything&nbsp;but Swedish (e.g. US), AND, also the OnScreen keyboard demonstrate exactly the same behavior, the key (which happens to be an&nbsp;ö on the&nbsp;Swedish&nbsp;physical keyboard) works perfectly
 when a US keyboard layout is used (language/regional settings), but immediately stops working when Swedish is applied. With Swedish applied, nothing happens, no character at all appears.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I reckon that the keyboard layout definition (file?) must have become corrupt somehow.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How on earth can I&nbsp;re-install/patch whatever it takes to have it working again?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm running 64-bit Windows 7, (6.1.7601)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried all obvious permutations of removing input languages/keyboards, adding them back, rebooting and so forth.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have my fingers crossed!</div>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Ram Issue</h2>
                    I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 with 8GB of RAM, 256 GB of Storage, and an Intel Core i5 in it. I am running Windows 10 64 Bit, and version 1709. My issue is that when I open task manager to see my performance, it says I am only using 4GB of RAM and not
 the 8GB that I paid for. Can someone please help me figure out why this is, and how I can use 8GB of RAM, and not just 4? I would really appreciate it if someone helps me out.

                    <p>While trying to add my Xbox 360 to Windows Media Center with Windows Extender I keep receiving the following error: "Configuration Error. An error occured while configuring Etender settings. Restart your Extender and computer and try setup again."</p>
<p>I have tried removing the Media Center Extender certficate, and the Network List Service doesn't need to be restarted. I have deleted any computers&nbsp;that were previously linked with my Xbox (there weren't any), and I have tried deleting the Xbox Live Dashboard
 from my gamer profile in My Xbox.</p>
<p>Windows Event Viewer has given me the following error messages:</p>

<p>I have tried to run the Windows Extender as an Administrator (which my user already is), and it still gave me the configuration error.</p>
<p>What are "realtime scanners"?</p>
<p>I believe my problem is that my computer cannot create a user account for the extender. How do I rememdy that? I have tried to delete the current user on my computer, but my computer won't let me. There is only one user on my computer, and it says "Valued-PC...etc.",
 and I am not given the option to delete it. I therefore didnt' bother to try to delete the user account in the registry files.</p>
<p>HELP! I am beyond frustrated by this issues. I have scoured the internet for HOURS AND HOURS trying to find a solution.</p>

<p>The "Run As Administrator" option, is different than just being logged on as an Administrator, it enables powerful privilege with greater powers.&nbsp; I take it you have tried it anyway and it didn't help?</p>
<p>Realtime scanners and anti virus scanners that are running continuously in the background and checking every file that is opened by the operating system etc.&nbsp; Performing a clean boot will stop most things that are running in the background.</p>
<p>Did you look at the links I supplied were they helpful?</p>
<p>You don't want to delete your current user on the Vista machine, you could use that user to create another Administrative user on the Vista machine, and test with that user.</p>
<p>This example might or might not work for you?</p>
<p><br />
"It seems that the "Run as administrator" command only gives you some administrative privileges, and they're not enough to install Java (and OpenOffice, by association). In order to get around this, you need to actually log into an administrator. Open a command
 prompt with admin rights by clicking start, typing cmd into the search/run box, and hitting CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER. At the prompt, type:</p>
<p>net user administrator /active:yes</p>
<p>Then log out of your regular account and back in as the administrator, where you should be able to install the program. When you're done, log back into your regular account and, for security purposes, disable the administrator account using:</p>
<p>net user administrator /active:no "</p>

<p>I checked all the links that you provided in your first reply. None of them applied to my specific errors, and I thoroughly read them and followed any links that were provided by the answers in those forums.</p>
<p>I did the "Run as Administrator" option when running WMC, and it still gave me the configuration error.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;created a new administrative user account, but when I tried to log onto my computer using the new account, and I wasn't able to log in. I had to switch back to my main user profile.</p>
<p>The error messages I get in event viewer are error 205 and 0x8007012b. I have looked both errors up on Microsoft's website, and yet I can't find a solution to correct them except for the "delete all users" option. I know that Windows Extender is failing
 while trying to set up a user account for my extender.</p>
<p>I had previously contaced Symantec before Microsoft because my first issue with Windows Extender was that my firewall wasn't configured to allow the specific ports needed for Windows Extender. Symantec uninstalled my&nbsp;Norton Antivirus. After I had that uninstalled
 I tried setup again on WE, and then&nbsp;I received&nbsp;my current error. I won't reinstall Norton Antivirus until I can get this problem resolved, but you are right: it was CONSTANTLY running background tasks.</p>
<p>I am wondering if something isn't wrong with my product key for Windows Vista 64 Home Premium because when I had previously tried to chat with Microsoft I wasn't able to even get to that option as my product key was not accepted. Perhaps this is why I cannot
 create a user account for my extender? I had read in one of the links you previously provided that Product Keys can be an issue as well.</p>
<p>I will follow the new links you provided and troubleshoot those. Thanks for all your help!!!!</p>

<p>I checked all the links that you last submitted. First off, I tried doing the command prompt that you suggested. After I typed in "net user administrator /active:yes" I received the following error: System Error 5 has occured. Acces is denied.</p>
<p>Then I tried to restor the security settings to their default. After that I tried to run Windows Extender again, and again it failed during the "Configuring Extender Settings" stage of setup.</p>
<p>I check my Event Viewer as an Administrator, and I copied down all the error codes that I saw:</p>
<p>-<span>Windows Media Center Extender setup failed with the following error code: -205.</span></p>
<p><span>-<span>Windows Media Center Extender setup cannot create account Mcx1 for device 'uuid:10000000-0000-0000-0200-00125AAA2C01'. Error code: 0x8007012b.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>-Windows Media Center Extender setup cannot configure the Windows Media Center PC for use with the Extender. Error code: -107.</span></span></p>

<p>System Error 5 has occurred. Access is denied.&nbsp; That sounds like the type of error you might get if you didn't launch the Command Prompt via the "Run As Administrator" option in the first place?</p>
<p>"created a new administrative user account, but when I tried to log onto my computer using the new account&nbsp;and I wasn't able to log in", that sounds a bit strange to me, was there any reason stated?&nbsp;&nbsp; If your machine cannot do something as basic as create
 a new user then any problems that you have may be more serious than just an Extender problem.</p>
<p>When Norton was uninstalled did they just do it via Programs and Features, or did they use their special removal tool?&nbsp; The reason I ask is that the first removal method may leave bits and pieces all over the place whereas the removal tool is more thorough.</p>

<p>The probable reason why your Product ID upset Microsoft is that perhaps your machine is an OEM install, in which case all FREE support is to be provided via the manufacturer and not by Microsoft.</p>
<p>It is possible for you to uninstall Windows Media Center and then reinstall it, and then try to get Extender setup.&nbsp; Have a look at Programs and Features/&nbsp; Turn Windows features on or off/&nbsp; Media Features/ Windows Media Center.&nbsp; Untick it to remove it, reboot,
 retick it to install it.</p>
<p>Another thing you can consider is saving all your valuable data, and using any recovery options supplied by your OEM to restore the machine back to the original factory defaults.</p>

<p>Hello bumblebeetuna,</p>
<p>Here are some more things to try:<br />
For the 0x8007012b see the following informtion in Technet: This error indicates a file copy or permission problem.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc733501(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc733501(WS.10).aspx</a></p>
<p>You just need to remove the Media Center Extender certificate first.<br />
<br />
To remove the certificate, follow these steps:<br />
1. Click Start , type mmc in the Start Search box, and then press<br />
ENTER.<br />
2. On the File menu, click Add/Remove Snap-in.<br />
3. Click Certificates, and then click Add.<br />
4. Select Computer account, and then click Next.<br />
5. Select Local computer, and then click Finish.<br />
6. Click OK.<br />
7. In the Navigation Pane under Console Root, expand Certificates,<br />
expand Personal, and then click Certificates.<br />
8. Right-click Microsoft Windows Media Center Extender Host, and then<br />
click Delete.<br />
After you remove the certificate, uninstall the Extender, and then<br />
reinstall the Extender. Follow these steps:<br />
1. Start Windows Media Center.<br />
2. Click Tasks, and then click Settings.<br />
3. Click Extender, and then select the Xbox 360 console.<br />
4. Click Uninstall.<br />
5. After the uninstall process is complete, click Extender again, and<br />
then click Configure.<br />
6. When you are prompted for the setup key, follow these steps: a. On<br />
the Xbox 360 Media Remote, press the Y button.<br />
b. Press the Windows Media Center Start button.<br />
c. Note the eight-digit setup key.<br />
<br />
7. Return to the computer, and then enter the setup key.<br />
8. Complete the Extender setup.</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then you can test for network related issues.<br />
<br />
On your Xbox 360 console, you can use the Media Connection test in the System section to help diagnose network-related issues. To access the Media Connection test, follow these steps:
<br />
In the Xbox 360 Dashboard, move to the System section.<br />
Select Network Settings.<br />
Select Test Windows Media Center to start the network test.</p>
<p>On your Media Center PC, verify that the network adapter driver is up to date. For help downloading and installing the latest driver, contact the manufacturer of the network adapter.<br />
<br />
Make sure that your router is "Designed for Media Center Edition" (DfMCE)-logo certified. For a list of DfMCE-certified devices, visit the following Microsoft Web site:
<br />
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/partners/dfw/partnerlisting.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/partners/dfw/partnerlisting.mspx</span></a>)
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have a firewall running on your computer other than Windows Firewall, make sure that the firewall software is configured to enable Xbox 360 to connect to your Windows Media Center computer as a Windows Media Center Extender. Some firewalls are already
 set up to enable Xbox 360 to connect to a Windows Media Center computer as a Media Center Extender. However, for other firewalls, you will have to change the firewall software configuration. For more information about firewalls and Windows Media Center Extenders
 such as Xbox 360, see the article that is cited in step 7, or visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:<br />

<p>1) Norton was completely uninstalled. I have since reinstalled Norton 360 4.0 which is supposed to have all the current firewall settings to allow Extender to work properly. 2) I have visited the website regarding error 0x8007012b, and it offers zero solutions
 on how to actually fix the error; it just instructs you how to find out if you're having the error and to verify if a certain action was performed. 3) I have tried removing the Certificate loads of times. It doesn't help. 4) I have no network issues. 5) The
 site you referenced regarding checking if my router is able to work with Media Center didn't work. I didn't see anything regarding routers.</p>
<p>6) Can I uninstall Media Center if I don't have an install disc? Yes, my laptop came with the programs and OS already installed. I guess I should probably just contact HP instead, but honestly I have a difficult time understanding the technicians' English,
 and I would rather not contact them.</p>
<p>Do you have any other solutions?</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div><br />
1. Do you receive any error when trying to install service pack 1?<br />
2. Are you able to install other updates successfully?<br />
3. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
You may run Windows Update troubleshooter and then check using the Windows Update troubleshooter in Windows 7.<br />
<strong>Open the Windows Update troubleshooter</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</a><br />
<strong><br />
Method 2:</strong><br />
You may follow the steps and then try to install the update.<br />
<strong>Step1: </strong></div>
<div>You may temporarily disable all antivirus software’s installed on your computer. Refer the following link.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a><br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks<br />
<strong>Step 2: <br />
</strong>After disabling antivirus, you may try to install Windows update manually in Clean Boot state. Refer the following article.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Make sure that you perform “step 7” in the above link to boot your computer normally after you troubleshoot.<br />
Step 3:<br />
Refer the following link to manually install service pack 1 on your computer.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5842</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>You may refer the following link</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Steps to follow before you install Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 from the Microsoft Download Center</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2505743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2505743</a></div>
<div><strong>Method 4:</strong></div>
<div>You may refer the following article.</div>
<div><strong>Troubleshoot problems installing a service pack for Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/troubleshootwindows7sp1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/troubleshootwindows7sp1</a></div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>:Disabling antivirus or antispyware software might increase your security risk. We recommend that you turn this software back on as soon as possible. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is
 disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks. </div>

<h2>            Xbox Live Ambassadors Program an Code Enforcement</h2>
                    <p>This is one of IF not the worst run sham on Xbox Live. There is NO monitoring of the FOUL BEHAVIOR displayed in most gaming lobbies an when a gamer tries to get actively involved in the gaming community to make a difference for the better it IS THAT GAMER
 who is targeted an suspended by the Enforcement Team. I'm a 58yr. old U.S. Veteran an I'm appalled by the type of nasty things I see going on daily online. An Xbox Live harbors some of thhe worst. This needs to be addressed an dealt with in a much moe effective
 manner, WITHOUT PENALIZING THOSE WHO SIMPLY WANT A POSITIVE GAMING EXPERIENCE.</p>

<p>It's not really about intention or who started the argument. All that matters when it comes to suspensions is if the rules are broken. My advice is to read through the Community Standards, and when / if you encounter toxic players, then report and block
 them; never respond.&nbsp; <br />

<h2>            XP reinstall stuck at &#34;Please wait...&#34;</h2>
                    I'm trying to reinstall XP on an old Gateway 831GM. I used the built in Gateway recovery partition by pressing F11 at startup. This brought me to the recovery program, where I selected the "Destructive Restore," since I didn't have any files I needed to
 keep and I wanted to start fresh. The process seemed to complete fine, and the PC restarted, but after the XP logo appeared, the image resized and shrank to the middle of the screen. "Please wait..." showed up under the XP logo, and after hours of this, I
 force restarted the compute, only to see the message again for an hour. Then I tried the reinstallation again, but the same thing happened. I tried running chkdsk /r after booting from a recovery CD, but after that completed and I restarted, the same problem
 occurred. How can I finish booting into XP and correct this hang up?

            Thanks but I already tried this, and when I rebooted the problem still occurred. I don't have an XP CD, since the PC only came with a recovery partition, do I downloaded the recovery console ISO online and burned it. That's what I booted from to run chkdsk
 /r

<h2>            regedit export from command line does not work for windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In Windows 7 Enterprise, I try to export part of the registry by using regedit from the command line, for example:<br />
regedit.exe /e myExportFile.reg HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office</p>
<p>This worked with Windows XP.<br />
For Windows 7, after the usual security confirmation,&nbsp;the command returns without error but produces no export file.</p>
<p>Can anybody help me?</p>

<p>The command still works in Windows 7 but because you spawned a new shell when running it under elevated privileges, the output file ended up in the System32 folder. You must therefore be more specific when specifying the output file location, e.g. like so:</p>
<p>regedit.exe /e d:\myExportFile.reg HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office</p>

    <title>External USB hdd not detected by Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dinkydoodoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            External USB hdd not detected by Windows 7</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I have a problem with access to my external harddrive. Well, it was not an external hdd by design since i took it out of an old notebook and installed it in an external usb box.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When i try to connect it to my home computer with W7HP sp1 (x64), its built-in led lights up but the device is not detected by windows (no sound notification and no new device in device manager). But it works without problems when i connect it at my workplace
 to a desktop pc with WXP and to a notebook with W7HB also. This is strange.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also tried to install additional usb ports into my home computer by means of an PCIX USB 3.0 card, but it produced the same result - everything except the external hdd worked on it. Not sure if its relevant but i'm using a motherboard with the nvidia
 nforce 550 chipset.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I even considered buying a new external hdd since i need the additional space, but i don't want to shell out money for it only to find out that it won't work either. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for Your help.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What happens when you connect the hard drive?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you get any error message?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you checked if the Hard disk is detected on a different Windows 7 Computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you see any yellow\red exclamation mark in device manager?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><strong><span>Try the steps from the&nbsp; link below</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>I would also suggest you to open
<b>Disc management</b> and check if the drive is detected there, here are the steps:</p>
<p>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1. Open <b>Computer Management</b> by clicking the <b>Start button</b>, clicking
<b>Control Panel</b>, clicking <b>System and Security</b>, clicking
<b>Administrative Tools</b>, and then double-clicking <b>Computer<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Management</b>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
</p>
<p>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>In the left pane, click <b>Disk Management</b>.</p>
<p>If it the hard drive recognizes in the disc management and if there is no drive letter assigned, I would suggest you right click on the drive and assign a drive letter and check
 if it helps:</p>
<p>c.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Right-click the drive to change, and then <b>
click Change Drive Letter</b> and Paths.</p>
<p>d.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Do one of the following:</p>
<p>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To assign a drive letter if one has not already been assigned, click <b>
Add</b>, click the letter that you want to use, and then click <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To change a drive letter, click <b>Change</b>, click <b>
Assign</b> the following drive letter, click the letter that you want to use, and then click OK.
</p>
<p>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To remove a drive letter, click Remove, and then click <b>Yes</b> to confirm that you want to remove it.</p>
<p>Refer this link for more information:</p>

<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>This issue can happen for several different reasons; driver instability, missing updates, missing hot fixes, Selective suspend and others. There is a KB article that walks through
 methods to help fix this. Hope this helps.</p>

<div><br />
<div>Thanks for Your advices. I managed to get it working in a different way.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem was in a poor quality USB extension cable. I replaced it with a new sturdy one and after connecting the hdd to it, it started spinning up and was promptly recognized by the operating system.</div>

<h2>            while installing windows 10 there was a power outage and upon reboot it reverted to windows 7.  &#40;The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation&#41; .</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the title suggests, while i was installing Windows 10, my pc was hit by a power outage. I was upgrading from windows 7 ultimate and really wanted the benefit of dx12 on Windows 10 as Im planning to add a video card supporting it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent hours wrestling with it to get it to download but it eventually did which took a long time because I dont have speedy net where I live.&nbsp; My pc restarted and the installation commenced. It even started up differently by loading files and then the
 win 10 logo appeared and the installation begun. Shortly after this, while it was installing there was a power outage and upon reboot it reverted to windows 7 (cant remember exactly but i remember the message (<strong>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS
 phase with an error during BOOT operation) . </strong></p>
<p>Now When i look in my computer it says my win 7 is not genuine...but before i attempted to download
<strong>win 10, it was.&nbsp; I am now blocked from re-downloading and starting over which i thought would happen .....heck i thought win 10 would be fine after the power outage.....(i thought Microsoft caters for such matters), but no. I now have 30 days to install
 a win7 key which i do not understand, why i have to do this? i already had a genuine one.Its really frustrating and im currently in college and have a boat load of important files on my pc and im afraid ill lose all my info.&nbsp; ....Any help would be
<em>greatly appreciated</em></strong></p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for such a prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in full panic mode and this info relieved me. However when following your advice I looked around on the internet and found a way of retrieving my windows 7 key but when i put it in it says my win 7 key is invalid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then gave me 3 options :</p>
<p>1_Buy a new key</p>
<p>2 Type a different key </p>
<p>3 Contact Microsoft to help resolve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I noticed typing in slui.exe&nbsp; 4 took me to the same options mentioned above.</strong></p>
<p>There was no option to select country, those were the only 3 options there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Also, if I do not manage to activate windows within the time limit, could I still be able to use Microsoft Word (create documents) or browse the web as this is essential for my current studies.
<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks once again for your response. I will be very much alert to any response posted for the next week or 2 ( unless an unprecedented power outage happens again :]&nbsp;&nbsp; )

            Hi dominick <br />
<br />
Is this your system drive or another drive attached to your PC? <br />
<br />
Are you intending re-installing Windows 10?

            Hi,
<br />if it is the second drive you may format it using command format D: /p:1 (change a D letter if needed).
<br />If it is a system drive you need to run such command (changing a letter) from recovery environment or booting from USB drive with Windows distributive files.

            Hello  dominickpenna1 
<br />Please follow these methods 
<br />Method 1 
<br />-Backup your system before doing anything. You should always backup important files before wiping (or erasing) your hard drive. Erasing your hard drive will make recovering your files challenging and you do not want to lose anything important.
<br />-Use DBAN. If your computer contained any sensitive documents, photos or information which could be used to steal your identity, you will want to use a more secure method of removing your data. DBAN (or Darik’s Boot and Nuke) is a commonly used, free program used to securely erase your hard drive.
<br />-Make sure your computer is set to boot from a CD. If it is not, follow these instructions
<br /><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Boot-a-Computer-from-a-CD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.wikihow.com/Boot-a-Computer-from-a-CD</a>
<br />-Type “dodshort”. When the computer boots from the disk, the easiest method to wipe the computer will be to type in either “dodshort” for a simple wipe or “dod” for something stronger (leave off the quotation marks for both). Both are the standard erasing methods for the Department of Defense and are very secure. You can use the interactive mode if you want more wiping options.
<br />-Hit enter. Once you’ve entered your preferred method, hit enter. You’re done: it will start wiping. You will, however, need to reinstall an operating system and restore your files. It will take a VERY long time. Don’t worry. It’s normal.
<br />Method 2
<br />Low Security PC Method
<br />Reformat the hard drive using the installation disk.
<br />Insert the disk into the CD-ROM tray. Reboot your computer. Watch carefully for a message to flash on the bottom of screen. This message will tell you what key you need to press in order to enter the Setup mode.
<br />Press the key indicated during the boot process and enter Setup. Common keys are F2, F8 or F11. Look for an option to boot from a disk or CD and choose it.
<br />Image titled Erase a Computer Hard Drive Step 8
<br />3
<br />Select the "Reformat hard drive" option when prompted.
<br />If you have more than one partition on your hard drive, the second one likely holds recovery information. If this is the case, you can leave that partition alone.
<br />If your second partition holds an alternate operating system, you may want to delete it.
<br />Image titled Erase a Computer Hard Drive Step 9
<br />4
<br />Follow all prompts pertaining to the "reformat hard drive" process.
<br />Choose the NTFS option for the drive's type.
<br />Choose either Quick or Normal, depending upon your reasons for reformatting.
<br />If the computer will be going to a new owner, choose the Thorough or Normal option for higher security.
<br />Also you can see steps by steps in this link below

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you've connected it to a USB 3.0 port. You can check by looking at it. USB 3.0 ports are blue while USB 2.0 are white, or grey.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's connected properly already, maybe the cable you're using is a USB 3.0 type.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Samsung sold its hard drive division to Seagate awhile back so you have to download the manual from them now. But here it is:

</p><p>If you scroll down to page 21 you'll find some troubleshooting tips. </p>

            Unfortunately all my computer ports are 3.0 but thanks for the troubleshooting tip. Have got a separate USB 2.0 port but that doesn't work either. Looks as though I will have to try re-formatting. Fortunately nothing on drive that not backed up elsewhere.
 Will let you know if I get it to work.

            <p>Hi Irene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing you can try before going the format route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hit Windows key + X to open the power users menu and click "Power Options" near the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you have the <em>Balanced </em>power plan, click the link to the right of it to "Change plan settings".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the next menu, click the link to "Change advanced power settings" underneath the buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, scroll down and expand the tree to "USB settings" --&gt; "USB selective suspend" and change "Plugged in" to
<strong>Disabled</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Apply/OK to exit and then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>USB selective suspend works by suspending power to the port when it detects that it's not in use. However, when the user connects a device to a port to which power has been suspended, it can take a few seconds before it's restored. On some external devices,
 this could lead to it detecting the port as inoperable.</p>
