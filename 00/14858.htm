                    <p>I've been working on this issue now for the better part of 6 weeks.&nbsp; Frustrating! I have set up account settings for MSN mail repeatedly, but with no result. An incoming server issue.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I followed your advice and went the EAS route.&nbsp; POP3 simply was impossible to configure here. Don't know why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked with a technician this morning who convinced me that the EAS route was the best way for me. She also restored previous files in a sort of archive fashion so that I would have that available when needed.</p>

<h2>            use VBA to set named range to only visible cells after filtering</h2>
                    <p>I would like to create a named range that only refers to the&nbsp;visible data after a table is filtered.&nbsp; As my code is now, I believe my named ranges are referring to&nbsp;all the cells in the column that have data,&nbsp;and not just the cells that remain visible after
 filtering.&nbsp; A subset of the code is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub TestRun()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim lCell As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim lFirstRow As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim lLastRow As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lFirstRow = 10&nbsp; 'the first row where I have data is row 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Sheet6<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lLastRow = .Range("C" &amp; .Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row - 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Names("CheckBoxControlsT").RefersTo = "=" &amp; .Cells(lFirstRow, "J").Resize(lLastRow - lFirstRow + 1, 1).Address(, , , True)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Names("BondAmountsT").RefersTo = "=" &amp; .Cells(lFirstRow, "C").Resize(lLastRow - lFirstRow + 1, 1).Address(, , , True)</p>
<p>End With</p>
<p>
</p><p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I would like to add some sort of "SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible)" option to the last two lines so that the ranges "CheckBoxControlsT" and "BondAmountsT" refer to only the cells that are visible after columns J and C are filtered, but I am not
 sure how to&nbsp;do this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            In SQL Sum&#40;Numeric&#40;x,x&#41;&#41; recognized as String not as Number BUG - Access 2002 to 2010</h2>
                    
<p>I build an application that runs on Microsoft Access Project (.ADP), and if you sum any Microsoft SQL Server Numeric(x,x) fied, the result under Access 2002 to 2010 will show as string, not as number.</p>
<p>This is a old bug that its not present on Access 2000, but in 2002 to 2010 its not solved.</p>
<p>How to reproduce:</p>
<p>1. Create a table with a field Numeric the size does not matter<br />
2. Create a view like<br />
SELECT SUM(FIELD) FROM MYTABLE<br />
<br />
If you open this in Access 2000 shows and you can order normally as a number, on the newer versions will shows as string, if you order will be ordered like a string.<br />
<br />
All my database use numeric fiels, and we sum a lot in views, I know that we can convert to another type, all the database, but this is not a sollution... Please correct this bug, we want migrate to Office 2010.</p>
<p>This bug occurs in any OS and in 2002 to 2010 Access versions.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<h2>            outlook e mail not working</h2>
                    I have 4 e mail addresses with Charter.net. They are all set up the same way. One of them, my main e mail, does not receive e mails. It seems to have something to do with other outlook accounts that may be on my computer. I have set this one up as the
 default and tried to delete any others, but still no luck.

<br />They are all set up the same way...............
<br />.......................and tried to delete any others,
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Can you clarify a couple of things
<br />
<br />#1 - Set up the same way means what exactly in terms of type of account (POP3, Imap etc)?
<br />
<br />#2 - "........tried to delete any others" - does that mean those were removed successfully or you ran into problems, and if so, what error(s) did you encouonter?
<br />
<br />Without knowing anything else, the generic suggestions would be (one or both) of the following depending on the account type
<br />
<br />#1 - If this involves a POP3 account, would first run ScanPST on the PST file associated with the account to eliminate any possible issues with the file which may be contributing to the problem. 
<br />
<br />#2 - Create a new Outlook profile and configure the account encountering the problem? Make sure that the new profile is set as the default for the profile for the next time Outlook is opened. Do NOT delete the existing profile in case you need to revert back to it.
<br />
<br />*** if this involves an IMAP account and you have folders labeled as "This Computer Only" (i.e. contact/calendar) with data in these folders, be sue to export these folders to a PST file as a precaution.

<p>#1 yes the settings are exactly the same on all 4 e mails. On my phone and in my computer. The phone does receive and send these e mails, but on the computer, it only works for 3 of the accounts with Charter. Not the main one though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are all IMAP set ups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I set it up again with the same e mail name etc? How would that work, since there is already one. I am very afraid of loosing my folders, etc. which I cannot get access to on my phone or through the web service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to delete any other outlook account I had on the computer, this worked one time, but then it went back to not working again.&nbsp;</p>

            Before proceeding with anything else - please be sure to perform backing up data in any "This Computer Only" folders to a PST file (if applicable) as previously noted (backing up = exporting the folders)
<br />
<br />With the above out of the way, suggest that you do the following
<br />
<br />#1 - With Outlook closed, create a new Outlook profile by opening the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app and configure the account that is having the problem so see if the problem persists. Do not delete any existing profiles and be sure to set the new profile as the default to be used by Outlook the next time it's opened
<br />
<br />#2 - You are not going to lose any folders since those are located on the server and Outlook will re-sync email folders with the server. What you are going to end up with are empty "This Computer Only" (i.e. contact/calendar folders).
<br />
<br />#3 - Everything else aside, it's not recommended that you maintain any data in "This Computer Only" folders since these do not get sync'd with the IMAP server. What you really want is for your contact/calendar to be contained in a PST file configured in your profile and making that file the default data file for the profile. We can deal with that portion once you know that the primary problem is resolved.

<p>Okay. I can do this. I have carbonite back up. If that is up to date, will it be a good back up for those contacts and e mail folders, just in case?</p>

            Re: Existing folders
<br />
<br />As already mentioned, your folders are maintained on the server. The local .ost file is a "mirror" of what's on the server so in terms of email, there's nothing to be concerned about. Whenever an Imap account is configured, a new .ost file is created and Outlook re-syncs the email folders with the server.
<br />
<br />What is of concern is the data contained in any "This Computer Only" folders as previously described.
<br />
<br />Re: Carbonite
<br />
<br />Have no experience with Carbonite backups but others have reported issues restoring Outlook data. Specifically as it relates to .ost files which may or may not be included in the Carbonite backup. .ost files can only be opened/used by the Outlook profile/email account that was originally used to create the file. As a general rule, "backing up" .ost files is a waste and as such a variety of backup programs do not include those files in their backups.

    <title>Internet Explorer flaw - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Internet Explorer flaw</h2>
                    <p><span>Related to the flaw/bug/</span><span>vulnerability</span><span>/scare with Internet Explorer. I’m in my 80s and the direct opposite of geek. All this talk of Flash Player; I checked the control panel and discovered I have 32 bit??? A shrug. I have
 no interest in games and never will. Anyway I opened it and discovered:</span></p>
<p><em><span>Local Storage (?)</span></em><span> may be used by websites to save data about my PC, such as viewing history. Tells me I can:</span></p>
<p><span>1—allow sites to….”</span></p>
<p><span>2--- ask me first…”</span></p>
<p><span>3--- block all sites from storing my data.</span></p>
<p><span>Merely on principle alone number 3 appeals to me. So can I check that and not have a negative effect on my PC?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Back to the flaw: I have Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 11. Regarding the subject of tech solutions (which scare me) and/or using an alternate to Int. Ex. both have given me a headache. Chrome and Firefox. Two mysteries, two shrugs. How does one switch
 from one to the other? I had trouble learning Windows 7 after XP.<span>&nbsp; </span>
i.e. I still can’t find <em>Add/Remove</em>. Is this what I have to do? Switch? And where do I learn how to move from Int. Ex. to another browser? Words of wisdom would be appreciated</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Martin,</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that what you want is a reply in clear and simple English rather than technical talk. Having been there myself I will do my best to help you. I am not by
 any means an expert. But I have learned quite a lot just by doing, researching, and asking questions, then doing hands on myself. There are a lot of things in reference to a computer that are often made much harder by the fact that (1) there is no one to teach
 you “hands on,” and (2) those who know computer language tend to speak that language rather than plain English, and it is a language that not all of us understand. So I will attempt to answer you at least in part from what I know I can handle.
</span></p>
<p><span>Okay, let’s handle the easy part first. I myself opted to go to another web browser while Internet Explorer is down. I have in the past, when I used a Linux operating
 system, used both Firefox and Google Chrome. Both are good. I like both. But I found that both of these slowed my computer down because they require more space and memory to run than do some others. Google has a reputation for tracking your on-line movements.
 It is true, I have experienced it many times. They say they do it to give you a better experience by bringing up websites you are more likely to want. What I found was that if I looked at something on-line, little ads from various places kept popping up for
 days on end trying to get me to go back and buy what I had looked at or shopped for. They were “reminding” me of what I had viewed. Frankly, that kind of bothers me, so while I like Chrome, I think they need to adjust the way they do things.
</span></p>
<p><span>Firefox is a good web browser, but my main complaint with it was that I found it to be slow. Again, I think that Firefox takes up more space and memory than I have to
 offer. Both browsers are good, both are popular, both offer a great deal. So you would not go wrong with either, but there are pros and cons with anything. I personally opted to install Opera. I was a little frustrated by when I first began using it yesterday.
 &nbsp;But today I had a chance to sit down and play with it and now I like it quite well. I found where everything was and that was all I needed. One feature you may like on Opera and Chrome and perhaps also on Firefox is what is called speed dial. Speed dial provides
 you with a homepage where you have a “tile” for all the websites you use most. You simply have to click on that tile in order to bring it up. This saves you on having to repeatedly type in web addresses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Adding a new web browser is quite easy. The main thing is to make sure that you go directly to the source rather than some other website in order to obtain the download.
 Let me see if I can provide some of those for you. One caution, while it is feasible that you could install all of these, I would not. Pick
<p><span>Mozilla Firefox can be found at &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/</a>&nbsp; You need simply to click on the green
 button on the web page that comes up. When the download starts, your computer will ask you at the bottom of the page whether you want to “Save” or “Run” the program. Click on “Run.”&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft will then ask you whether or not you want this program to make
 changes to your computer. Tell it yes, and the computer should install Firefox for you. When the installation is complete, you will be ready to use Firefox.</span></p>
<p><span>Google Chrome can be found at&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/</a>&nbsp; When the web page comes up you will see a blue rectangle which says, “Download Chrome.” Underneath that blue button it says, “For Windows 8/7/Vista/
 XP.&nbsp; Click on the blue button. When the download begins, click on “Run.” Tell Microsoft yes, that you want this program to make changes to your computer. The browser would be installed and ready to use when everything has been completed.</span></p>
<p><span>To obtain Opera go to&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.opera.com/computer/windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.opera.com/computer/windows</a>&nbsp; When the page comes up, you will see a blue rectangle
 that says, “Free Download for Windows.” Click on that box to obtain the Opera browser. As with the others you would click on “Run” to tell the computer what to do with the download. And then tell Microsoft “Yes,” when it asks whether or not you want this program
 to make changes to your computer. The computer will do the work and shortly you will have a usable new browser installed and ready to go.
</span></p>
<p><span>Since I am using Opera I can tell you a few interesting things to do to customize your browser, if you decide to choose Opera and are interested. Most of what you need
 will be found by clicking in the upper left hand corner on the rectangle that has a big red “O” and says, “Opera.” I will try to help you if you have further questions about customization.
</span><span>Today I added a “Do Not Track Me” extension and that has been fun to use. I also changed my settings to where the bookmark bar would show.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One word of caution, please do not be influenced by my choice. Decide for yourself whether you like Firefox, Google Chrome, or Opera, and enjoy using whatever suits you
 the best. You won’t go wrong with any of them. All three browsers are in the top five that are used by people. Your personal computer should be personal. It should contain what you prefer that works best for you.</span></p>
<p><span>As for your other question. I am not exactly sure where in your control panel you found the question about allowing sites to store data. I can guess and probably get
 close. But since I don’t know for sure I will give you a generalized answer. Normally the defaults are set to number 2. “Ask me.” You can do as you want on that. And you are free to say no each time the computer asks you. Or you can leave things exactly as
 you have them now on 3. I understand your desire to check 3. But if I understand correctly, you won’t be able to use some websites unless they can store “cookies” on your computer. It is possible for you, after a browsing session to go in and eliminate all
 browsing history and “cookies.” So you decide what works for you.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this will help you at least some. Please don’t allow Windows 7 to stress you after having been an XP user. I think you’ll find Windows 7 is pretty easy to navigate.
 Just play with it, and enjoy learning something new every day. It’s like anything else. Once you are familiar with the territory you’ll find it is much easier. Take care. Have a good day.</span></p>

            <p>Wow! A big thumbs up to you, Janice. Giving me so much time is more than generous. You must be the designated&nbsp;Angel for all us dummies. If I could send you virtual flowers, I would.</p>
<p>So, back to reality-- I downloaded Mozilla Firefox and I see the global icon at the bottom of my screen, so I guess it's official. I'm not sure what to expect but everything looks the same to me--no changes in appearance--mail, desktop, etc.&nbsp;To make certain:</p>
<p>I went to internet options--programs</p>
<p>saw default web browser</p>
<p>saw: "Internet Explorer is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>not</em></span> currently&nbsp;the default web browser."</p>
<p>saw a small <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">box</span></em> with a
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">check</span></em> <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">in</span></em> it, and next to the box it said:</p>
<p>"Tell me if Internet Explorer is not the default browser." So I guess it told me.</p>
<p>But there was no mention of Firefox. Am I set up properly? I thought I would have to uncheck something, but apparently not. Can I assume I'm running safely on the internet with Firefox?</p>
<p>Reassurance will be welcome. Thanks a mil.</p>

            <p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>Congratulations!&nbsp; I hope you enjoy using Firefox. It’s a good choice and I think having two web browsers is&nbsp; of benefit sometimes.&nbsp; Actually when I used Linux I had three at one time.&nbsp; They each had different functions for me, but it was a bit of overkill.&nbsp;
 Anyway, I’m glad to know that this worked for you and that you had the joy of installing it yourself. Hooray!
</p>
<p>When you have more than one browser, usually the last one installed, will be set as default. In other words that’s what the computer recognizes as your main browser. Truly, it does not matter which one is set as default. You now have both to use and you
 can go in and play with both to your heart’s content.&nbsp; If you do want &nbsp;Internet Explorer to be your default browser, that is pretty easily accomplished. Probably when you open up&nbsp; Internet Explorer it will ask you, at the bottom of the page, if you want to
 set Internet Explorer as your default. Whichever one you set as default, the other browser will inevitably ask you if you want to set it as default instead. &nbsp;You can just tell it “No,” and go on and use the browser, if you want to. &nbsp;Or you can change default
 every time you go into one or the other. I usually just tell my alternate browser “No,” and go on.
</p>
<p>Everything should look and function the same as before, other than that you simply now have another web browser installed.&nbsp; If you click on the symbol of the little red fox wrapped around the globe, Firefox should come up and you should be good to go with
 no further effort on your part required. </p>
<p>And just so you’ll know my viewpoint, there are no “dummies,” on the internet, even if others may think so. We all had to begin somewhere. We refer to ourselves as “noobies” (new users) or “beginners.”&nbsp; We all learn by sharing what we know.&nbsp; I hope having
 this success will encourage you to continue learning about your computer, and that you will have the same kind of fun with yours that I have been so blessed to have with mine. &nbsp;Have a great day and enjoy. Take care.</p>

<p><span>I’m glad to hear that Firefox is working out for you. I was reading back over our discussion and realized I’d been rude. Thank you for your mention of virtual flowers.
 The thought was nice and accepted, and you’re welcome for the help. You also have a good Spring and Summer. Yes, it has been a long time coming, it seems. But it’s always nice to see the wildlife and birds return and the earth begin to blossom afresh. Take
 care. Best wishes. </span></p>

            You should not change the extension on a file: that's the signal to the software indicating what kind of content is in the file.
<div><br />
<div>Instead, in Word go to the File menu and use "Open" to open the file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the dialog that appears, change "Enable" to "All files" so you can see the file in question.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Don't be too hopeful: the Word .temp files often do not contain the whole document, so you may not get the whole thing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What happened to the original?</div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t create local Notebooks even though Office 365 active</h2>
                    <p>I have been going round in circles with this all day. I want to run Onenote in Windows 10. I want to install the full desktop version, not run the Windows 10 pre-installed, lighter version. This is because I want to run the Microsoft Evernote to Onenote
 migration tool and its a prerequisite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I download Onenote from the MS website and run it. The first time it asks for an Office 365 account - if you don't enter the details, the install quits. I enter my Office 365 account details fine and the install completes. I can open and use Onenote notebooks
 on OneDrive just fine. Unfortunately I can not create local notebooks. The Evernote migration tool tries to create notebooks locally only - you can't change this setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to create a notebook locally manually, I get presented with the message "currently you can only create notebooks on onedrive. Activate an office 365 subscription..." I am only given the option to learn more or acknowledge the message which does
 nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go into account settings in Onenote I can see the account details, and see a message "product activated". Underneath I'm told the version is Microsoft Onenote Home and Student 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uninstalled, repaired the installed, tried the same thing on Windows 7 and Windows 8 VM's with no luck. Any ideas much appreciated as its driving me crazy and I'm about to give up on Onenote. &nbsp;(sorry have to choose Onenote 2013 for the category of this
 call as Onenote 2016 is not an option!)</p>

<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Ensure to save the Fix it file on the desktop and then run the file.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Once the Fix it completes then you may re-install Office 365 and check how it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may login to the My Account page on Office.com with the Microsoft account you used to register or purchase<span> to download Office 365.

<h2>            Downloading pictures to my computer</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hello,</p>
<p>My problem is that I accidentally broke my phones' glass (which also brakes the touch screen) and I have already a new phone, my last one is already quite old. I wanted to download my phones' pictures to my computer, but in order to do that I have to unlock
 my phone by tapping in the password.&nbsp;But my phones' touch screen is broken. Do I really have to pay a lot of money to repair the phone just to download the pictures to my computer? Is there an alternative for it? Can I somehow write the password in my computer
 instead?Thank you</p>

<p>Had a 6700 for a couple of years now and got the i760 last week.&nbsp; So far I love it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cables that ship with the device don't allow charging and syncing at the same time but you can get an all-in-one cable from pocketsolutions.com.&nbsp; It is irritating that
 Samsung insists on a proprietary connector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The device seems to be rock-solid.&nbsp; Faster thant the 6700 and the form factor is good.&nbsp; I love having the number key on the face of the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the only downside is that there aren't as many tools available for producing custom ROM's on the Samsung as there are on the HTC devices.</p>

<p>Hello.&nbsp; I bought a i760 from VZ almost 2 weeks ago now.&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp; It comes with a standard battery AND an extended battery in the new box.&nbsp; I have only used the extended battery, and mostly on standby. &nbsp;I am on day 4 of being on 24 hours a day, and I
 have dead on 50% bat life left.&nbsp; You can see that by tapping the battery symbol on-screen from the 'today' screen.&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp; My first 'smartphone', I had the LG 8300, and the battery life seems to be almost exactly as that one, with the extended battery.&nbsp;
 I got the phone onto my home network, and can browse the internet with that, and using Vista I can tether it to the included USB cable and transfer files around from phone to PC or vice-versa with the Mobile 6/Windows mobile center combo/Windows explorer.&nbsp;
 I have read that Windows Mobile Center replaced the Activesync software, with Vista, anyway.&nbsp; One thing, seems verizon did not include Windows Live menus.. altho surfing the way I do, the contacts through the phone messenger are syncing with my Live messenger
 on the PC.&nbsp; My blog with details for shuffling Live contacts onto the i760 with Mobile 6 :
<a href="http://sandman-xx.spaces.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.microsoft.com%2fMSDN%2femoticons%2femotion-1.gif" />&nbsp; It is NOT necessary to buy a data plan with the phone, and I didn't want it.&nbsp; Apparently that's a new thing to Verizon as well

<p>Anyway, I like it.. touch screen is the stuff, and like how overall quick it acts.&nbsp; Make sure you align the screen first thing.&nbsp; I went 15 minutes before I figured out why the stylus seemed to be touching one line higher than it was

<p>I have had a little time to play with the Samsung SCH-i760.&nbsp; I have not purchased it yet.&nbsp; It seems like a great phone.&nbsp; My biggest complaint is that it uses a non-standard connector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The people at Verizon told me that the new Verizon 6800 is going to be out within the next few weeks (they did not know the exact date at the store).&nbsp; I am going to hold out and take a look at this phone to compare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has any had a chance to play with the 6800 in their market or read any reviews.&nbsp; Any feedback would be appreicated.</p>

<h2>            Back to the regular world</h2>
                    <p>After over a year of installing TEP builds, I finally have thrown in the towel. Last weekend after installing one of the updates to build 10565, I could no longer open the mail app and my mouse began to act in a wonky manner. I tried the various recommended
 fixes to no avail, so I finally decided to do a clean&nbsp;install of the current consumer version which was 10420.&nbsp; This weekend I&nbsp;was upgraded to build10586.&nbsp; I am longer configured to receive any insider builds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am indeed thrilled with the speed and overall performance of the current Windows 10 build. All of the comments I have received from friends and acquaintances who have also updated to Windows 10 have been very positive. I upgraded my brother-in-law's laptop
 computer from Windows 7 last weekend, and he couldn't believe the increase in performance. His laptop has an Intel I5 chip so it runs very fast indeed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experiences with the Insiders builds (especially on the fast ring) have led my to believe that most of these new builds are quite stable, but they frequently release subsequent &nbsp;updates to these builds which are anything but and create all kinds of serious
 problems for many users. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My only remaining gripe is the inability of the mail app to create mail folders and to be able to select a range of messages without having to click on each one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just my experience for what it's worth. </p>

            As posted by Microsoft that it is BETA software and will have problems, as for not posting anything about your system and "thrown in the towel" doesn't help the program at all the reason for the preview was to find and fix problems before releasing it
 to the public, which I noticed that you have found to be very stable and this came by way of many Insiders and people from Microsoft contributing much needed info to fix the "wonky" problems.

 switch over to the internet for information and all of a sudden my word document is gone, not even open. This is continuous no matter how many times I try.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            See if there is an expired trial version installed alongside your full version. (The trial may have been added by Windows or by your computer manufacturer.) If you find a trial, uninstall it. Afterwards, you may have to repair your full version.

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our related team has been aware of this issue. The following is the summary of the current status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong></p>
<p>When loading any Office apps, users may experience errors and app closures. Specifically, users may see an error message that states: "We're sorry, but Office App has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly. Office App will need to
 be closed as a result. Would you like us to repair now?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Current Status:</strong></p>
<p>Our related team has been aware of the issue and they are still investigating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Workaround:</strong></p>
<p>As a potential workaround, users can run Windows update. If impact persists following updates, users should restart their Operating System (OS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ran</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Word crashes when dragging and dropping</h2>
                    When dragging and dropping a paragraph of text so as to move it, Word hangs and becomes unresponsive. &nbsp;This happens in normal paragraph. &nbsp;Not sure if also happens in tables because tend not to do this.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Mac OS Version is: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10.7.2 (Build 11C74)<br />
<div>
<div>My Word Version is : &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 14.1.3 (14.1.3) &nbsp;Build Version: &nbsp; 0</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This has just happened 3 times.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone got any ideas?</div>

            Once you apply the 14.1.4 update, Repair Disk Permissions then restart your Mac.<br />
<br />
Other possible factors include how much RAM is available at the time, use of Track Changes, as well as font problems.<br />

<p>This is not a big deal - I don't really NEED to access the other computers, but wondered if maybe a setting needs to be changed on my Win10 computer (Build 9841).&nbsp; The 2 other computers on the network can see each other's documents (read and write), so I'm

<p>My other 2 (Win7) computers use the same simple password - which is different from the Win10 computer.</p>
<p>I tried entering the Win7 password in Homegroup on the Win10 computer, but that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, found a password for Homegroup on the 2 Win7 computers - both those computers have the same Homegroup password - different than my log-on password.&nbsp; (I didn't enter that password, wonder how it go there?).&nbsp; Anyway, the Win10 computer liked that better,
 but gave me the following error:</p>

            With my other computers, as long they have usernames and passwords I can access anything that the local account (on that machine) has access to. Without password protected accounts I have no access (just like a local account with a blank password when
 trying to RDP to the machine.

<p>
</p><p>I can get into an external drive attached to one of the other computers on my home network.&nbsp; But the other two PC's, running Win7 require a password, but I'm not sure how to get to a screen to enter a password from this Win10 computer.&nbsp; The Win10 computer
 uses a different password than the other two PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this Win10 computer, how would I get to something to enter a password in order to access the drives on the other Win7 computers?</p>

<p>
</p><p>You should try set up a Homegroup on the Win7 and Win10 machines.</p>
<p>- look at networking &nbsp;in Win7, and in Win10 type Homegroup into search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you could look at mapping a drive (from within Win10's File explorer) to your external drive.</p>

            <p>OK, seems the actual difference between 9926 and prior builds/OS, is that the Group Policy for "Network access: Sharing and security model for local accounts" now defaults to "Classic" (previously the default on domains). &nbsp;I believe previously on workgroups/standalone
 it was "Not Defined" and therefore defaulted to "Guest" functionality.</p>

<p>I don't think this is correct, I just checked on my Windows 8.1 computer and that group policy setting was set just like it is by default in Windows 10.</p>

<p>MS pulled this rabbit out of its hat with the 9926 build&nbsp;with absolutely no communication about it.&nbsp; There is a registry patch that will get you back to what has worked for over 15 years.&nbsp; You can see it at this link:</p>
<p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/4e9f7b19-d820-4d30-98c5-cd96e6d57cda/build-9926-the-account-is-not-authorized-to-log-in-from-this-station-error-with-network?forum=WinPreview2014Feedback</p>
<p>but here's the registry patch from that thread:</p>
<p>"<strong>A fix for this issue appears to be setting HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\AllowInsecureGuestAuth (DWORD) to 1."</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;It works for me, and it doesn't involve a whole lot of dinking around with homegroups or any of the above suggestions.&nbsp; MS has said that they "missed the mark" with this surprise change in 9926, and promised to come up with something better in the future.&nbsp;
 You can read that thread here:</p>

<h2>            Despite I changed my Surface RT&#39;s display language from Chinese to English, Office RT is still display in Chinese.</h2>
                    <p>●This problem has&nbsp;occured since I upgraded my Surface from&nbsp;Windows 8&nbsp;to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>●I've&nbsp;restart my Surface so many times, but Office is still display in Chinese.</p>
<p>●Everything on Windows RT&nbsp;has shown&nbsp;in&nbsp;English, except for Office programs, since I&nbsp;installed&nbsp;English language pack.</p>
<p>●I'm not sure&nbsp;my Surface RT's&nbsp;default input method is Chinese or English and I don't&nbsp;know how to&nbsp;change&nbsp;default input method in Windows RT 8.1.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your experience with Office being in Chinese. You can change your settings, but following these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. From Start, swipe Right to left to bring up charms menu.</p>
<p>2. Choose Settings</p>
<p>3. Select the Keyboard icon. This is your default language. You can change it here if it's showing Chinese.</p>
<p>4. Select Change Pc Settings.</p>
<p>5. Select Time and Language.</p>
<p>6. Select Region and Language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From here, you can try changing the Country or region and see if that helps, if not, verify what language version of Office is installed. Check for Office Updates to see if there are any language packs available from Office Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>5. </p>

<p>Thank you for answering my question.</p>
<p>I have followed the steps you gave.</p>
<p>But problem is still remain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 2013 language pack FAQ says Office RT language pack is included with Windows RT language pack.</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/language-packs/microsoft-office-language-packs-2013-faq-faqs-FX102897395.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/language-packs/microsoft-office-language-packs-2013-faq-faqs-FX102897395.aspx</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And I have already set &nbsp;"match Windows display language" in Office language option.</p>

            Hi,&nbsp;
<div>I am so happy right now, because the problem is fixed.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Here are steps I tried:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Completely remove the English language pack.</div>
<div>2. Download it again. (must with a strong wi-fi signal and high speed internet connection. / a strong wifi&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>signal and high speed internet connection is needed when Windows is downloading the pack.)</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>3. Install the language pack. (Windows will automatically install the language pack after downloading, I &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span>remembered.)</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* I&nbsp;stopped using my Surface when installation is in progress.</span></div>
<div>4. Reboot Surface.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I guess the problem was occurred mainly because I downloaded and installed the language pack in a weak wifi signal environment, which may cause an&nbsp;<span>incomplete&nbsp;</span><span>language pack download.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>By the way, I restarted my Surface, not just signed-out and then signed-in my account, when installation was complete.</div>
<div><span>( I 'm uncertain whether this step is helpful or not.)</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>I greatly appreciate all your support in this matter, a<span>lthough the ultimate solution wasn't provided by you,</span></div>
<div><span>I think you are the one of the best answerers in this community, because I can feel your enthusiasm for helping others.</span></div>
<div>Wish you healthy and happiness every day.</div>
<div>Thanks a lot friends.</div>

<p>Hi MUHAMMAD UMAR BIN ABDUL RAZAK,<br />
<br />
Since Mendeley is disabled In word, I suggest you enable it first. After enable the Mendeley, if the problem still persists, you could contact&nbsp;<a href="https://service.elsevier.com/app/home/supporthub/mendeley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mendeley Support</a>.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &gt;File &gt;Options &gt;Add-ins &gt;Choose Template in Manage &gt;Go &gt; Check Mendeley and click Add &gt;OK</p>

            At a guess, you have to install an update for Mendeley. You will have to contact the manufacturer of that product.<br />

            Hi Jonathan,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused. 
<br />
<br />You can also download and install the latest definitions at the following link:

<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed. 
<br />
<br />Try this additional tips to see if they work:

            Hi Jonathan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can manually Update Defender:
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/update-windows-defender-manually-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/update-windows-de...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions</a>
<br />
<br />Are there problems with other Windows Updates?  If so 
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1809 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>The answer to your problem is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">surely</span> described in the previous posts. However,</p>
<p>if not, ensure that the Date &amp; Time are set correctly on your PC. The update servers</p>
