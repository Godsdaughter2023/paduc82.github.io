<h2>            There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made</h2>
                    I've been trying to reset my laptop MANY times, but it'll always tell me this "There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made", I really need to reset my laptop. Any solutions out there? I watched YouTube, searched for articles regarding it,
 but none seemed to help. Hope it'll get fixed!

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />If you have this problem, be sure to try these steps.
<br />
<br />Method 1: Perform a system file check
<br />- Press Windows Key + X to open Win + X menu. Now select Command Prompt (Admin) from the list. If this option isn’t available, you can also use PowerShell (Admin).
<br />- When Command Prompt opens, enter sfc /scannow.
<br />- SFC scan will now start. This process can take up to 20 minutes so don’t interrupt it.
<br />- If SFC scan doesn’t solve the issue, or if you can’t run SFC, you might have to use DISM scan. To do that, just start Command Prompt as administrator and run DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth command. Keep in mind that DISM scan can take more than 20 minutes, so don’t interrupt it.
<br />- Once the DISM scan is finished, check if the problem still persists. If it does, repeat the SFC scan again
<br />- If you still can’t reset Windows 10, type the following commands and hit Enter after each:
<br />cd %windir%\system32\config
<br />ren system system.001
<br />ren software software.001
<br />
<br />Method 2: Use a system restore point
<br />- Press Windows Key + S and enter system restore. Choose Create a restore point from the menu.
<br />- System Properties window will now appear. Click on System Restore.
<br />- Once System Restore window opens, click Next.
<br />- If available, check Show more restore points options. Now select the desired restore point and click Next.
<br />- Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the process.
<br />Once your system is restored, the issue should be completely resolved.
<br />- If no restore points are available, go to the Control Panel, search for Recovery, select Recovery, go to Configure System Restore and then select Configure and Turn on system protection to enable this option.
<br />
<br />Method 3: Disable reagentc
<br />- Start Command Prompt as administrator and run the following commands:
<br />reagentc /disable
<br />reagentc /enable
<br />- After running these commands, try to reset your PC again.
<br />
<br />Method 4: Perform SFC scan outside of Windows
<br />- Open the Start Menu and click the Power button. Press and hold the Shift key and choose Restart from the menu.
<br />- List of options will appear. Go to Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Command Prompt.
<br />- Now run the wmic logicaldisk get deviceid, volumename, description command.
<br />- List of local drives will appear. Find your system drive. Keep in mind that this is usually D outside of Windows environment. Now enter the following command: sfc /scannow /offbootdir=d:\ /offwindir=d:\Windows. Once again, the system drive might not be D on your PC, but in most cases it is.
<br />SFC scan will now start, so be patient and let it finish. Once the scan is completed, check if the problem still persists.
<br />
<br />Method 6: Run DISM scan outside of Windows
<br />- Boot your PC from the installation media.
<br />- Select the desired language.
<br />- Now click Repair your computer option in the bottom left corner.
<br />- Now choose Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Command Prompt.
<br />Enter dism /get-wiminf /wimfile:E:\sources\install.esd command. You should now see all system images available on the installation media. If you don’t see this information, try using a different letter instead of E: to access the system image.
<br />- Now enter mkdir d:\scratch.
<br />- Now run dism /image:d\ /cleanup-image /restorehealth /source:esd:e:\sources\install.esd:2 /scratchdir:d:\scratch /limitaccess command.
<br />If everything is in order, DISM scan should now start and repair your files. Once the scan is finished, check if the problem still persists. Keep in mind that this is an advanced solution, so be extra cautious and follow the instructions carefully.
<br />
<br />Method 7: Perform a clean install
<br />To do that, you need to create an installation media with Media Creation Tool. After doing that, boot your PC from the installation media and select your system drive. Follow the instructions to complete the installation. Once the installation is finished, you’ll have a clean installation of Windows 10 and the problem should be resolved. If you need to back up your files, be sure to look for Windows.old directory and restore the desired files.

<p>Hello, none of these worked. But the thing is, I didn't try Method 7, and that's because I don't have a USB big enough for it, or it's just that I don't understand the steps. I really need to get this fixed soon.. my PC lags because of the junk in it, and
 I can't locate all the junk, all I can locate is 100GB of stuff I actually use out of the 900GB..<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>your windows 10 activation key is Settings / System / About,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old Windows 7 files are in a folder called Windows.old on your C:\ drive, if you click on This PC and then C:\ you will see it.&nbsp; You can delete the old Win 7 files and installation backup files.&nbsp; This will also get rid of the contents of &nbsp;Windows.old
 folder on your C drive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The safest way to do it is to use Disk Cleanup. To do that right click on your C:\ drive and click on properties then click on Disk Cleanup.&nbsp; When Disk Cleanup opens then click on the&nbsp;Clean Up System Files button.&nbsp; It will take some time to scan the drive.
 Then check the Previous Windows Installations box and the installation backup files box.&nbsp; They should be very large and then click delete files and acknowledge the warning about deletion. Only do this if you are 100% sure you are keeping Windows 10 and not
 going back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not answer 3 and 4.&nbsp; I am trying to figure those out now also.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f123def-af92-4b21-9662-6487996d87d5" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3522802a-eba3-4b96-a0da-9f1164989673" /></p>

            Hi Genevieve.   I'm Greg, a volunteer and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />I would wait a few days which is sometimes necessary for WIndows Update to sort itself out.  
<br />
<br />If not you can manually download and install the Update from Microsoft Update Catalog:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Digital voice editor 3 installs on Win7, but won&#39;t run</h2>
                    I have installed the software for this Sony ICD-P620 digital voice recorder, many times on many different computers.&nbsp; It has always worked beautifully until the attempt to have it on my Windows 7 machine. I receive a message of successful install, but
 when I go to run it I get this message:<br />
<br />
Failed in starting the MSVoice.(0x000003f0): An attempt was made to reference a token that does not exist.<br />
<br />
and it will not open or run. It's stuck there. I even went to the website and downloaded a version made for Windows 7 with the same result.&nbsp; I really need this software to unload my hours and hours of recordings to prepare for my mid-term exam on Monday!

<p>Everytime I try to open Windows Security Center, I always get the same error message 'The Security Center Service Can't be started. And evreytime I try to turn Windows Defender on, I get the error "Windows Defander is turned off by Group Policy"</p>
<p>I have Tried everything I can think of and nothing works. ALSO When I try to delete a file 50% of the time I get the message that it requires Administrative permission, so I click and give it permision, bu then when I try again to delete the file, I keep
 getting the same message, that it requires administrative authorization.</p>
<p>It this possibly an error of a glich, or could it be because my computer is an HP Compaq, and the settings on EVERYTHING constantly kkeps changing on me no matter what I do.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;am running WIndows Vista Home Premium</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>you should try these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start the Security Center Service manually</strong> </li></ul>
<p>Click on Start, then Run, type in "services.msc". Scroll down the list and doubleclick on Security Center.&nbsp;Set Startup from Disabled to Automatic. Click "Start. Restart your computer and check if it's running.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start the .exe manually</strong> </li></ul>
<p>Right-click and 'run as administrator' on C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MSASCui.exe</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registry</strong> </li></ul>
<p>Search for the value <em>DisableAntiSpyware in:</em></p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender and delete that value, but make a backup first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have a file named "wscui.cpl" in Windows\system32 folder. If yes, try to start it, if no, you can copy it from another PC.</li></ul>

<h2>            Windows 10 FREE Upgrade Download</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been thinking of upgrading my Windows 7 pro (Dell) OEM sys to windows 10 pro so I dove in and accepted this fine offer only to find that the upgrade did not overwrite my entire system to windows 10 pro but left me with a OEM version not a full version,
 so my question is had the previous version (windows 7 pro (OEM) was there constrictions left behind protecting the OEM tag.</p>

            <p>Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Windows 7 Pro was preinstalled by Dell then you have an OEM licence.&nbsp; Your Windows 10 licence will also be an OEM licence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 or 10 functionality&nbsp;with OEM&nbsp; licences or&nbsp;with Retail licences are exactly the same.&nbsp; Both are "full" versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OEM licences are tied to the first computer they are installed on.&nbsp; So, for example, you cannot take your existing Windows 7 Pro or your future Windows 10 Pro and use your product key to activate another computer.</p>

            <p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.

 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

            No to the best of my knowledge you can't. The password is associated with the email, not the computer
<br />
<br />But yes you could use the same email account on 2 computers (with the same password.

            You can set up a Microsoft account using any email address, then use any password that it allows.  You said two passwords for two accounts so that sounds right, but one for each. 
<br />
<br />You can add any Microsoft Account to Windows 10 on multiple PC's, change it's password at the link to Manage Microsoft Account in Account Settings or online in the account settings.

<p>HI, Gregg,</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>You can set up a Microsoft account using any email address, then use any password that it allows. You said two passwords for two accounts so that sounds right, but one for each.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I've led you a bit astray, my apologies for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple years ago, they replaced a Win7 system (tower) with a W10 system (tower).&nbsp; Apparently they've changed passwords, but don't remember why.&nbsp; Based on what they do remember, and that is minimal, I believe they have an MS account on this computer.&nbsp; Since
 this computer is working fine for them, I have not taken a close look at it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months ago, a Surface Pro was purchased.&nbsp; The login was set up using with an MS account.&nbsp; Of this, I'm sure, as when I attempted to use the password I was given, it is refused and a message is displayed saying that I need to go to Live.*****.com to
 change the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, like a lot of Windows users, they did not write down all the answers they gave for setting up the account, so I've been unable to verify the account for recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>You can add any Microsoft Account to Windows 10 on multiple PC's, change it's password at the link to Manage Microsoft Account in Account Settings or online in the account settings.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have an old Dell with W10 on it, but I don't use my MS account for login.&nbsp; I use a local account.&nbsp; Off the top of your head, do you know of an excellent tutorial online for this?</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>The info is a help, and I don't give up easy.&nbsp; &lt;G&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The owners of these computers are definitely not computer literate, so what I say below will have info received from them, and may not turn out to be accurate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally, they contacted me because she could no longer sign into the Surface Pro.&nbsp; She gave me the login password as being xxxxxx2@.&nbsp; (This is the password she said should work, and it does work on the tower system.)&nbsp; And it didn't work.&nbsp; And I got the
 change password message I entered above.&nbsp; Research I read on the web seemed to indicate that if you could not verify ownership of the account, you're up the creek without a paddle.&nbsp; So I thought I would enable the hidden administrator account, and create a
 local account and see what I could learn.&nbsp; To my dismay and disgust, I learned you have to know the password to that.&nbsp; (More cussing of MS at my end.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Knowing that they had used a pattern for all of their password changes, I just started trying different combinations, and to my surprise I discovered the Surface Pro password is xxxxxx4$.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, she has access to the Surface Pro, apparently with the same status as before.&nbsp; But I took the opportunity to create a local&nbsp; Administrator account on the Surface so anyone after me may have some options if something goes wrong later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also have Gmail login issues which I have to solve, but won't ask that here.&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the desktop, everything seems to be working there, even Gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I need to find out how to tell if the login on the desktop is a local account or an MS account.&nbsp; How do I safely do that without screwing it up.&nbsp; Especially since Gmail works fine on the desktop, but she doesn't know the password.&nbsp; She is using Chrome,
 and it seems Gmail is autologging in though I can't find a Gmail password in the Chrome passwords info.&nbsp; For this reason, I don't want to do anything to the desktop that will close Gmail and then she cannot log back in to Gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to be a Microsoft Account, as there is an email address attached.&nbsp; It's the same email address as is used on the Surface Pro mentioned in an earlier message.&nbsp; But she does not use the same password to log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, it just gets more confusing to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the underlying cause of all this in user ignorance, and I have the same ignorance issue in a lot of cases.&nbsp; I wish MS and Apple would stop assuming a user comes to a new computer with a certain level of computer literacy, and that literacy is current
 and not X years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my dismay, I'm going to have to create an MS account from scratch on my Windows 10 computer, to see how the system works.&nbsp; I always use local accounts, as I have no need for cloud use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Unable to run  X3 Terran Conflict game in windows 7&#58; error 1275</h2>
                    
<p><strong><span><span>Original Title</span><span>:</span></span></strong><span><span><span>
 error 1275</span></span></span></p>
<p>i am trying to run the game X3 Terran Conflict on windows 7, it ran great on XP, however when i try to start the game i get a message that i have to be the administrator to run the program, i am the administrator, i even tried right clicking the icon and
 selected run as administrator, but get the same message followed by error 1275, this getting frustrating as i was told before i bought the system that XP games will run on Windows 7, i am finding out that is not the case as several other XP games will not
 run as well, how do i fix this problem, i'm just a gamer and not very computer savy. I also get a taggs drive is causing instability problems, i can't find it to remove it, how do i do that?</p>

<p>Don't&nbsp;say you are "just a gamer". You should be Proud to be a gamer!</p>
<p>Anyways, most XP games work fine, on doing a quick google search, one thing you might try is using a registry cleaner such as Ccleaner (two C's) and see if that helps. If it still doesn't work, try uninstalling the game, running the cleaner, then reinstalling.
 I'm guessing the reason this is suggested is there might be a registry key that may or may not be corrupted, that is blocking a driver from being installed when you install the game.</p>

<p>This has NEVER happened to me before!!! Please HELP ME! I have several term papers to write and need help!</p>
<p>Today, at about 8:30 AM, I turned my Lenovo Thinkpad t-60 laptop on. I'm running Windows XP with service pack 3 installed. Today, when I was checking my yahoo email, my computer blue screened. The blue screen didn't last long enough for me to take down the
 error info. It immediately restarted. It loaded the ThinkVantage screen at startup just fine, but after that the screen just stayed black. So, I hit the power button to turn it off, then turned it back on. Same thing happened again (blank screen). So, I powered
 it down and back up again manually via power button. I tried running it in safe mode, but it only loaded the first 3 lines...these were, in order from first to last: "multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS\system32\ntoskrnl.exe", "multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS\system32\hal.dll",
 and&nbsp;"multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS\system32\KDCOM.DLL". After the third one, it just wouldn't do anything else. So, I power-buttoned on and off, then restarted and hit F3 during the BIOS info screen. I went to the BIOS area screen and the "HDD
 Diagnostic Program." My computer finished the scan to 100%, and it said my hard drive was running at the correct speed/passed the test/reading.</p>
<p>So, I restarted, and directly after the BIOS screen, I hit my blue Thinkpad button on my laptop, which brought me to the Lenovo/Thinkpad/whatever Rescue and Recovery mode. I looked around through there, not really doing anything at all. After not finding
 anything helpful there, I restarted my computer and tried to restart in safe mode. This time, it gave me the choice of the OS: Windows XP Home or PC-DOC (or maybe it was PC-DOS...I don't remember). So, I chose the first (Windows XP)...the white text gave me
 a message that said something like incorrect pathway, settings, unable to read disk, or something....I really don't remember.</p>
<p>By this time, I had to get to my 9 AM class lecture. So, I powered down the machine via power button and left. When I got back around 10 AM, I turned my computer on and let the computer load past the BIOS screen...this time it actually got to the XP loading
 screen, and it made it to the Thinkpad fingerprint and password log-on. I logged on successfully to Windows in normal mode. The windows error reporting message appeared, and I reported my error to Microsoft. I opened the web page from the "more information"
 link in the box via Mozilla Firefox, but had to copy the url into Internet Explorer 8 so it could get to the page (b/c these pages are only viewable in IE, obviously). It said that it could not identify what caused the problem. The website told me to scan
 my PC for viruses, update windows, etc. etc. I noticed I had a windows update waiting, so I clicked it, click custom install, and installed the latest November 2010 security update. It update successfully (I think...I let my laptop sit while it updated, and
 once it was done it ceased to be visible in the windows update window). I opened IE and went to the windows support page, and had it scan my PC for updates. The scan reported that I had nothing to update and everything was up to date. I opened an Excel document
 that I had been working on last night, edited 1 cell in the file, then saved and closed the Excel file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I double-clicked the Malwarebytes Anti-Malware shortcut on my desktop to run a scan on my PC. However, my computer then blue screened again! Before I could take a picture of the screen or write down the error info, it restarted again. It would not
 load past the BIOS screen again (it would leave the BIOS screen, but just stayed blank)...so, I tried restarting it in safe mode 3 times: once in safe mode, once in safe mode with networking, and once in safe mode with command prompt. Again, it would only
 make it to the 3rd line of code, but no further. I restarted my pc, and tried to log on normally, but this did not work. I left my PC alone for another couple of hours, and then came back to it.</p>
<p>I turned it on, and it loaded normally into the windows log on screen. I logged on, then immediately took my 2 GB flashdrive and transfered my files from my homework/college papers folder to my thumbdrive successfully. I let it sit for a while, then all
 of a sudden it blue screened on me AGAIN!!! Once again, my laptop restarted from the blue screen before I could get the information from the crash. This last crash was a couple of hours ago. I went to dinner for about 2 hours, came back, and still can't get
 my PC to log on successfully to normal mode or safe mode. I'm going to go to the BIOS section/F8 section during start up to turn off automatic restart after a crash. This way, if I can get logged on to windows in normal mode successfully, I can get the error
 info. If I can do that, I will post the error info here. OTHERWISE, PLEASE help me!!! My laptop is my most important tool at college!!! I'm currently using the laptop of one of my good friends who lives next door to me in my dorm to post this, so I'll be checking
 this from his room. ANY/ALL HELP IS GREATLY APPRECIATED!!!</p>

<p>Well, I booted up my PC again today, with the help of a friend. We used a Vista recover CD to launch a command promp (as I don't have the XP rescue/recovery/install CDs since they are either at my house or I don't have them, as my dad bought this computer
 for me refurbished over Christmas break of 2007), ran a chckdsk or something along with some other things. When we turned the laptop off, and restarted it, it restarted in normal mode! We tried restarting it from there, but it wouldn't reload into normal mode.
 So, we put the same cd back into the drive, ran a master boot scan, completed it, then restarted it back into normal mode. While in normal mode, my antivirus (Avira AntiVir) found 2 infected files and quarantined them. Updated Avira then, and Malwarebyte's
 Anti-Malware as well. Ran a quick scan with MBAM, found nothing. Restarted, wouldn't start in normal mode. Popped the vista cd back in, ran a sector scan, everything turned out fine. Restarted it, and it booted regularly into normal mode. Restarted it several
 more times, all successfully booting into normal mode. We turned off the automatic restart option in case it crashed again, and restarted and tapped F8 to get to the advanced options screen. Selected Safe Mode, and it loaded successfully! Then, I ran a full
 system scan with Avira and MBAM, both finding nothing. Saved the logs, then restarted into normal mode. After that, I started looking around in my computer files to find the Applications Files folder under Documents and Settings on my C: drive.</p>
<p>Then, my laptop blue screened again. This is the only error message I got:</p>
<p>*** STOP: 0x0000007E (0xc0000005, 0x839BB1c4, 0xF7944B04, 0xF7944800)</p>
<p>HELP.</p>

<p>My friend came over, and we did the repair master bootrec etc. and started my laptop up again last night.</p>
<p>Then, we tried using PC-Doctor 5, but it had a java issue and couldn't open...so, we uninstalled it and downloaded it from the Lenovo website for my laptop build (thus effectively reinstalling it). We ran it, and the only test that failed was the Wireframe
 Line test. I received the following error message for the Wireframe Line test:</p>
<p>Error Message &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Driver has entered an invalid state 88760827.</p>
<p>So, we looked at my ATI graphics card driver, and realized that I had never updated it (it was using a driver from like 1.something in 2005 or so). So, we went back to Lenovo's website and downloaded the latest driver. Then, the computer blue screened again
 (just after it finished downloading...it was a pretty big file and took about 20 minutes) with this error message:</p>
<p>*** STOP: 0x0000007E (0xc0000005, 0x83DE51C4,&nbsp;0xF7944B04, 0xF7944800)</p>
<p>So, we repaired the bootrec etc. again via the command prompt from the vista cd, started it up in normal mode, and installed the driver just fine. Then we ran another PC-Doctor 5 scan, and everything passed.</p>
<p>We waited to see if it would blue screen again, and after 10 to 20 minutes, it blue screened with the following error message:</p>
<p>*** STOP: 0x0000007E (0xc0000005, 0x83c251c4,&nbsp;0xF7944B04, 0xF7944800)</p>
<p>I tried restarting it in normal mode, but again it would not load after the ThinkPad/ThinkVantage screen disappeared. I tried booting into safe mode, but again it wouldn't load past the 3rd line of code: "<span>multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS\system32\KDCOM.DLL".</span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 Startup Repair Infinite Loop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Startup Repair Infinite Loop</h2>
                    I know there are similar questions to the my own, but I feel mine is slightly different, and I desperately need help.
<br />
<br />
I have an Acer Aspire S3 with Windows 7 Home Premium OA and an Intel Core i3 processor.<br />
<br />
After installing a recommended Windows update, the computer restarted, but it did not boot. If I shut it down and press the power button, the Acer screen flashes for a second or two, then a Windows Recovery Error screen appears. It gives me the option of launching
 Windows normally or the option of a startup repair (recommended). I have chosen both of them and they eventually lead to the same thing. Launching Windows normally always results in the screen coming back to the previous one where I have to choose which option
 I'll take. If I choose the startup repair, it shows a black screen for about five minutes, then a stock wallpaper appears and stays for hours.
<br />
<br />
I have tired rebooting in all of the other modes (safe mode etc.) and none of them enable me to boot.
<br />
<br />
Could you please list the steps required for me to fix this problem, in a simple way? I am not bad with computers but I am not great either.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<h3> carter marshall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Crashing To Blue Screen IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</h2>
                    <p>I recently changed hardware in my PC and did a clean install of windows 10, but it has started crashing about every 10 minutes and gives the error IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL at the blue screen. I have checked for and installed all available driver updates and
 I have updated to my motherboard's latest BIOS. I ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic and it returned with no errors. I ran the Windows Driver Verifier following the instructions of&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">this</a>article.
 The verifier first returned an error with the SiUSBXp.sys driver, and later returned with one of my AV drivers. My computer's specifications are as listed below:</p>
<p>Motherboard: ASRock 970A-G/3.1</p>
<p>Processor: AMD FX-8150 4C/8T</p>
<p>Graphics: EVGA GeForce GTX 470</p>
<p>PSU: 750W OCz</p>
<p>RAM: 8 GB Team Vulcan DDR3 1600 MHz</p>
<p>Storage: 1 TB WD Blue HDD, 600 GB WD Black HDD, 64 GB ADATA SSD (Boot Drive)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same errors have been thrown even with changes in RAM clock speed. Any help is appreciated :)</p>

            Hi, Carter
<br />
<br />You could also check to see if there are some sectors of the hard drive damaged
<br />
<br />Take a look to the following link, there is a step by step guide 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-allinone-boot-cd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-al...</a>
<br />
<br />www.hirensbootcd.org/download/
<br />
<br />Process: 
<br />1. Enter your USB drive or CD
<br />2. Enter Dos Programs 
<br />3. Enter Hard Disk tools 
<br />4. Enter HDAT2 4.53 (Test/Repair Bad Sector) 
<br />5. Then auto &amp; choose your keyboard United states (or wait it will do automatically here) 
<br />6. Press Enter &amp; Press Drive level tests menu 
<br />7. Enter Check and Repair bad sectors 
<br />8. And now it will start, it takes a lot of time, so wait until it finished.

<p><strong>Am having the same problem.</strong><br />

<p>Think it's the DOG box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Failure to display security and shutdown options when CTRL + ALT + DELETE was pressed. If operating system does not respond press ESC or restart the computer by using power switch."</p>
<p>
</p><p>System has been mostly disabled since last Saturday. It was running WINDOWS 7 because it is a business computer at a small business, which works with mandatory programs from &nbsp;the State of Idaho, and will not run those programs at a higher WINDOWS level.
 Finally got it up and mostly running today, but keep getting this error when it hangs up on something, or we try to run task manager to see what it is trying to do. Back-restored to a restore from March 9th, then added IObit programs to try to regain pc functionality,
 and updated all out-of-date drivers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Remote Desktop Slow windows 10 1803</h2>
                    <p>After the upgrade to windows 1803 (I am using W10-Pro-64) I notice that the remote desktop gets very slow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I normally use RDP to connect to my other computers running windows 10 pro as well, when we turn on all computer the RDP works just fine very fast loading, but a few hors later the RDP gets very slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>eventually (after 3 to 5 minutes) it connect but the response is slow as well.</p>
<p>the only way to fix this problem is to reboot the source computer, then it works just fine. (the problem comes back after couple of hours)</p>
<p>we are using regular windows 10 computers all in workgroup.</p>
<p>any of you have any ides how to fix this issue?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Backspace and Enter Buttons are not working - Windows 10 1709 build - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nccgrov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backspace and Enter Buttons are not working - Windows 10 1709 build 16299.248</h2>
                    <p>As several (many?) people have reported in the past month or so, the backspace and enter keys on my HP laptop (just bought it in December so it's not an old laptop) have stopped working.&nbsp; The Enter key works on the number pad but not the main one.&nbsp; I have
 done the Filter Keys adjustment that was suggested in several places<strong>. At first, it worked as a fix</strong>. Then the keys started working intermittently. Now I'm at the point where the keys aren't working at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, when I reboot my laptop, I am unable to enter my password to even get into windows unless use the number row and the enter key on the number pad, because my keyboard doesn't get enabled even when I hit the NUM LOCK button. However once I'm logged in
 to Windows, then the NUM LOCK works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What other setting might I need to look at? It's maddening.&nbsp; I did try the "hold shift for 30 seconds" trick that I saw mentioned in another post on this forum and that didn't help anything. Right now, my backspace and enter keys have just started working
 again intermittently, as Windows 10 finally finished starting up (I had just rebooted my laptop). So it seems to me that some piece of software that is loading up (slowly!) when I first start Windows might be interfering with those keys and maybe even all
 the time since my keys still aren't working properly. I've also experienced that they will work great and then, after having been on the laptop for a while, they will stop working altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that wouldn't explain why my NUM LOCK key doesn't work when I first reboot. It's maddening. I have no updates to install expect for an Intel update from October 2017 and an Intel Bluetooth update from Dec 2017&nbsp; that my laptop keeps saying that it can't
 install without giving me a reason why.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since many people are reporting the same problem (44 "me too!" on the last post I read about that issue, dated Feb 27 2018, I believe), I'm thinking it's definitely NOT a problem with the mechanics of my keyboard but a software issue somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions that won't involve reinstalling Windows or something inane like this that always gets suggested and never ends up being the solution?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Also, can we please NOT lock those threads when a solution has NOT been found?&nbsp; It'd be nice to
 be able to expand on someone's post who's having the same problem without having to retype a whole new post.&nbsp; As for the forum, I hope it's the right one. If not, let me know if I should post this somewhere else.</p>

<p>Thanks to both, sorry for not having replied earlier, I thought that I would get notified of replies via email. Before i saw your replies, I found an article on ComputerWorld (https://www.computerworld.com/article/3259933/microsoft-windows/get-the-february-microsoft-patches-applied-unless-you-re-using-win10-fall-creators-update.html)
 that stated that patching Windows in February if you had the Fall Creator Update caused trouble with USB devices and also built in keyboards and more. I followed the link in the article to the Microsoft article dated yesterday that said they had released patch
 KB4090913 that should fix those problems.&nbsp; I had to prompt my laptop to manually install the Intel updates to be able to see the "Check for Updates" button and my laptop is now downloading the patch. I will report back whether it worked or not and if no, I
 will try your suggestions. It's slow going because I'm in a hotel and I might need to leave soon so it might be a while before I can come back to this thread. Keeping my fingers and toes crossed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks again to both!</p>

<p>Good morning, well after I applied the latest patch yesterday morning, my laptop seemed to work great once again.&nbsp; As I used it, though, the problems started to reoccur intermittently and last night I was back to having the same problems all over again.&nbsp;
 I turned off my laptop overnight, restarting it this morning and same thing: num lock not working when laptop is restarting *(until I log in and then it works fine), backspace and main enter key not working.</p>
<p>I just did the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran troubleshooter. Didn't see a keyboard option so picked Hardware &amp; Sound and Configure a device and left "apply fix automatically" checked.&nbsp; It said it had applied a fix although didn't say what (I took screenshots of the troubleshooter report) and that
 I needed to restart my PC. Then I did a search for Keyboard troubleshooter, found it and ran it. It said couldn't find anything to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I restarted the laptop: still same problems as described yesterday and this morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I updated the keyboard driver. Restarted the laptop, same problems are still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help, I am going to move on to Andre's suggestions to see if those might work.</p>

 users. <br />
<br />
Cause <br />
This issue occurs when the Windows Update servicing stack incorrectly skips installing the newer version of some critical drivers in the cumulative update and uninstalls the currently active drivers during maintenance.

<br />
Power on and off your computer three times <br />
On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment

Reboot. </blockquote>
<p>Good morning. So when I got to the DOS screen, my laptop was showing the X drive and saying it was the boot drive. I'm really not familiar with DOS. I typed dir d (shoot, I just realized that I forgot the colon) and then it didn't do anything but repeat
 volume in drive X is boot, etc.&nbsp; but again because I didn't type the command right.&nbsp; I think I'm going to wait until I'm home next week to ask my husband to do this part for me since he's much more familiar with DOS. I just don't want to unwittingly screw
 something up really badly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, since I installed the <span>
KB4090913 patch yesterday, should I then still look for the latest installed package (which then might be 3/7/18) like you said or the one before (between 2/13 and 3/7) or do it for both?</span></p>
<p>

<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the
<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />

1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

    <title>Dangers of doing a clean boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pc_confused  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dangers of doing a clean boot</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; When I boot normally, the only thing I open is Device Manager, and Device Manager shows I have 105 Processes running, 1616 Threads, 46542 Handles and usually about 100% utilization.&nbsp; When I boot in Safe Mode, again the only thing I open is Device Manager,
 Device Manager shows I only have 30 Processes running, 435 Threads, 11207 Handles and about 2% utilization.&nbsp; From what I've read on the Internet (and you know if it is on the Internet it has to be true Ha Ha..) a clean boot may help me troubleshoot my system,
 to see what is being the hog.&nbsp; When I look in the Startup section, I only see eight items enabled.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; I am running an old Dell Optiplex GX280 with only the Intel(R) Pentium(R), 4CPU at 3.2 GHz with only 3 GB of Ram, but that is about the maximum that PC can use.&nbsp; It shows it is a 32-bit OS, x86 based processor and with all of the updates, weather I wanted
 it or not, Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; I was wondering what are the dangers of doing a clean boot?&nbsp; I've read where Clean Boot only boots the essentials (almost like booting using Safe Mode).&nbsp; What happens to all the other items that may be required to run my system?&nbsp; Buying a new PC might
 solve this, but this PC is still working for what I use it for.&nbsp; Just running all of those processes, threads and handles, is bogging down the speed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; I've run Norton Security in Safe Mode, but it hasn't found anything.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This will help eliminate software conflicts that may have occurred when you update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot what conflict
 is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. To know more about clean boot, kindly click this

    <title>Clearing Old User&#39;s Data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wpalpham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clearing Old User&#39;s Data</h2>
                    I got this Xbox One X for Christmas a few years back, and I got it pre-owned. Apparently the previous owner did not wipe it, and I cannot access any of their data to remove it manually. The only option that I can clearly see is to wipe the console, but
 that would take my data with it. Is there any way to clear that person's data while preserving my own? Any reply is greatly appreciated.

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to clear the console of another user's data that you cannot access, besides trying to remove the account, would be to reset it. More here: https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults . I would suggest this,
 so you have a clean slate to work with, that is your own. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an Xbox Live Subscription, all of your game saves will be stored in the cloud. All game DVR clips and screenshots that you have taken, will be deleted, so it will be worth uploading content to your OneDrive, or Xbox Live if you'd like to keep
 anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, if you play Final Fantasy 15, the photos Prompto takes are also linked to the Game DVR/capture system Xbox uses, so if there are any major system changes, like a master reset, these will be corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can preserve your installed games, and once your console has been reset to factory defaults, and you sign into your profile, your game saves will be retrieved from the cloud, when you launch any game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further advice, please search Xbox.com, where there are many support articles that can answer most questions. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>

<p>It seems to be related with 2 step authentication on sign in, although I don't use that and also have problems with not being able to send messages I am guessing it is related.</p>
