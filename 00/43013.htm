    <title>Wifi problems with new Windows 10 installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clam2011  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi problems with new Windows 10 installation</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new computer and have Windows 10 installed. I'm having difficulties with my wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network Adapter: TP-Link TL-WN881ND</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having no problems with my wifi on any other device aside from this new computer that has Windows 10. When I start my computer, wifi seems to be working fine (even great). However, after a period of time, wifi shuts off and it says "No internet access
 or Limited Access," even though it is saying it is connected to the wifi network.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is frustrating - I initially had a TP-Link TL-WDN3800 and had the same problem but even more consistently. In particular, after the first installation of the adapter, internet works great. However, once i turned off the computer, I lost connection and
 never got it back (always saying no internet access). As a result, I exchanged this router for the WN881ND (because I saw on TP-Link site saying it was compatible with Windows 10) - but, it seems same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done research online and I am aware it seems many people are having similar issues for Win 10. Any tips/advice on what I can do to try and fix this issue?</p>

            <p>I took Method 1 and it did say 'driver was fixed' and I also updated the network drivers and my network adapter driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, issue is still there - the most recent time, I was online for about 20mins and then the internet shut down - I was still connected to my router but it said 'no internet'. However, my internet was still working fine on all other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I have tried 2 TP-link routers and both have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any other ideas?</p>

    <title>Running programs from external hard drive with admin approval mode on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willicpp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Running programs from external hard drive with admin approval mode on</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>to take advantage of new Windows 10 (64-bit) features, I have recently switched off admin approval mode for the non-build in administrators (my 3 PCs). To prevent trouble, I have made a few changes: Local Security: Allows elevation of programs installed
 in non-secure directories. Furthermore, I have added all my Administrators to the Power Users group which has replaced the Administrators group as owners of all partitions and their files (including C drives). Furthermore, the Power Users group has been granted
 Full Control everywhere. &nbsp;In other words, even without elevation, I should be able to delete every file I own how long it is not locked or protected against manipulations (Virus protection software).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until now, I hadn't had any problems but with Code::Blocks (I only temporarily needed it)It refused to run, even with run as administrator (even if my account hadn't belonged to any group, it would have had full control). The only way to make it work was
 to use run as: build-in-administrator. But Code::Blocks is no longer a concern of mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And with installers from USB drives (only worked when using run-as build-in administrator).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My real problem has to do with an external 2-TB Toshiba hard drive. For my last vacation (where I didn't have access to my desktop PC), I had installed some games and other programs that wouldn't fit on my laptop's hard drive to that external HDD (Just for
 temporary use). Back then, before I had turned on UAC for admins, there hadn't been any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During these Christmas holidays, I wanted to use those programs again. While there have been upgrades to new Windows insider versions, I am still using the same user account with the same hardware. But the problem is that the only way to execute those programs
 is by using the run as command (run as Administrator)</p>
<p>
</p><p>initial permissions:</p>
<p>owner: Power Users (my user belongs to this group)</p>
<p>Power Users: Full Control</p>
<p>Administrators (my user belongs to this group, too): Full Control</p>
<p>Users: Read and Write</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st change:</p>
<p>owner: Power Users (my user belongs to this group)</p>
<p>Power Users: Full Control</p>
<p>Administrators (my user belongs to this group, too): Full Control</p>
<p>Users: Read and Write</p>
<p>Everyone: Full Control</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd change:</p>
<p>owner: Everyone</p>
<p>Power Users (User belongs to this group): Full Control</p>
<p>Administrators (my user belongs to this group, too): Full Control</p>
<p>Users: Read and Write</p>
<p>Everyone: Full Control</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3rd change:</p>
<p>owner: Everyone</p>
<p>Power Users (User belongs to this group): Full Control</p>
<p>Administrators (my user belongs to this group, too): Full Control</p>
<p>Users: Full Control</p>
<p>Everyone: Full Control</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4th change:</p>
<p>owner: Everyone</p>
<p>Power Users (User belongs to this group): Full Control</p>
<p>Administrators (my user belongs to this group, too): Full Control</p>
<p>Users: Full Control</p>
<p>Everyone: Full Control</p>
<p>NameOfCurrentUserAccount: Full Control</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I gave up on changing the permissions and tried something else:</p>
<p>I used the free space on the external hard drive to create a new partition, but this time I didn't use NTFS but exFat to get rid of permissions entirely. Then I copied over a program and tried to execute it. The same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This caused me to use me to use Local Security Policy to turn off Admin-Approval mode. After the reboot, everything worked like a charm and still does to this day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I may add, that both my old Laptop (upgraded to Windows 10) and my DEsktop PC (Windows 10) can't run installers residing on an USB drive either, unless executed with the run as build-in-Administrator command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there aren't any modern / UWP apps that are better than their WinAPI counterparts (the new music app has the useful ability to remember where an audio-book has stopped but iTunes has that ability, too) or are just shortcuts for using a browser, I will
 switch back my PCs to their former settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make this run as built-in-Administrator viable for more than installers and very rare occasions, I would have to use a hard link to create a single AppData directory which is way too much trouble as since Windows 8, functionality in the notice bar Internet,
 volume) and ,from Windows 10 ,on the start menu (won't open) can way too easily be&nbsp;broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not using the home version of Windows but I am also not a member of a domain. So if the problem can be solved by using group policy I am fine with that. Registry hacks and thirs-party programs are fine also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The short version is: How can I run installers and programs from USB connetected storage decices (thumb drives and external HDDs) without either fully diabling the UAC, diabling it only for admins or using the built-in-Administrator (either by directly longing
 in as this user or using the run as command?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message is the following:</p>
<p>Windows cannot access the specified device path, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>UPDATE 1: I found the problem:</strong></p>
<p>I have found the source of the problem: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>MultiPoint Connector</strong></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For whatever reason, MultiPoint Connector does prevent running programs from external HDDs or flash drives. It does not matter if the programs&nbsp;are ordinarily installed there or if they are portable instances.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>In case anyone has the same problem:</strong></p>
<p>1. You need to open "Programs and Features." On Windows 8.1 and 10 press Win+X and select it. On older Windows versions go to control panel and then select it. Search will probably work, too.</p>
<p>2. Select "Turn Windows features on or off" (it's on the left).</p>
<p>3. Look for "MultiPoint Connector".</p>
<p>4. Unselect it.</p>
<p>5. Press OK to confirm changes. Maybe you need to reboot (I can't remember).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Something useful:</strong></p>
<p>For non-home-version-users-of-Windows:&nbsp; open "Local Security Policy" (search would be one way, another would be to look under Administrative Tools); go to "Local Policies"-&gt;"Security Options"-&gt;"Only elevate UIAccess applications that are installed in secure
 locations" -&gt; Disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>In the case you'll actually need this feature, you have, as far as I know, only four choices:</strong></p>
<p>1. Activate the build-in Administrator&nbsp;account (their are plenty of tutorials on the web for that ever since Vista came out). Make sure to assign a password for the build-in Administrator. Login in to your ordinary user account. If you'll need to run a program
 from external storage, press shift + right click. Then select run as. Enter Administrator as username and the corresponding password. Be aware that run as has the same effect as if you were actually login as that user and then start that program (there is
 only one set of user data, so it is not suited for multiuser environments)</p>
<p>2. Activate the build-in Administrator account and login to that account.</p>
<p>3. Deactivate UAC for administrator accounts (for home versions it's probably a registry hack). For non-home-version-users-of-Windows:&nbsp; open "Local Security Policy" (search would be one way, another would be to look under Administrative Tools); go to "Local
 Policies"-&gt;"Security Options"-&gt;"User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode" (it's fairly at the bottom of the list) and change "Enabled" to "Disabled".</p>
<p>4. Deactivate UAC for all user groups: Do the same in 3 but do not select "-&gt;"User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode" but "-&gt;"User Account Control: Detect application installations and prompt for elevation". Disable it and reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should keep in mind that a lot of Windows 10's new feature depend upon UAC being activated (even if it is just silent mode). If you don't need those, I would recommend you to restore the old Windows Photo Viewer. There are .exe and do it yourself tutorials
 on the Internet.</p>

            <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Kindly try the methods provided below and let us know if the issue persist:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Check to see if the file has been blocked by Windows</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the blocked file and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>General</strong> tab, click <strong>Unblock</strong> if the option is available.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Disable antivirus software</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">You can check to see if your antivirus software is blocking a file by temporarily disabling it, and then try to open the file. If you have to temporarily disable your antivirus software, you should re-enable it as soon as you are
 done. If you’re connected to the Internet while your antivirus software is disabled, your PC is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>1) I am aware of the unlock option. I had already checked that before posting my question and I have re-checked it a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>2) I tried it and it didn't work which&nbsp;isn't surprising. When using the built-in Administrator, turning UAC off for all Administrators or turning UAC off completely&nbsp;for all user groups, all programs will run perfectly without any problems and without changing
 any settings of the antivirus software. By the way, I am using Windows Defender for this PC (my old Laptop) in combination with Windows 10 Pro(64-bit). This PC hasn't joined any Domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any group policy that prevents running programs from external drives while UAC is active? Apart from not elevating programs from non-secure locations which is disabled.</p>

</p><p>You should keep in mind that a lot of Windows 10's new feature depend upon UAC being activated (even if it is just silent mode). If you don't need those, I would recommend you to restore the old Windows Photo Viewer. There are .exe and do it yourself tutorials
 on the Internet.</p>

<h3> david haywood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player missing songs after updating from default library&#42;&#42;&#42;BACKHAND SOLUTION&#42;&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    <p>There are songs in my music library that WMP just does not recognize. It will play them when selected in the library, but doesn't show them in WMP.</p>
<p>I've tried playing them, then try to "ADD TO", doesn't work.</p>
<p>In music library (yes, it's set as default) highlight the missing song, click on "File", click on "Add to Windows Player", doesn't work.</p>
<p>Tried click and drag from the library to WMP, got the "ADD TO" window, but it didn't.</p>
<p>Tried clearing all the cache files. No help. Turned WMP off, and then back on in "Windows Features" (requires a comp. restart each way), no help.</p>
<p>SO........Whenever I downloaded, ripped, copied, or whatever music to WMP, I also backed it up on an external hard drive. Whenever I happen across a missing song in WMP, I open my music folder on my XHD, locate the song, and click and drag (make sure the
 window says copy, not move!) it to the corresponding album, artist, whatever in WMP. As easy as kissing the baby.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOOO....Don't wait till you have 6000 albums (or 600 ,or 6) of music to go back through. Verify each song of every download, rip etc. is in WMP,</p>
<p>your default Music Library that WMP updates from, AND your external backup. The extra time will be worth it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS; In lieu of an XHD, you can create another Music Folder in "Your Documents" or wherever you want it to be, to use as a backup. An XHD is better though. You may even be able to have WMP recognize this new folder as the "Default Music Folder" to update
 from.</p>

<p>Hi - what you have suggested is pretty much all OK but I think what you are discussing goes back to a flaw (or over-design) in the WMP library structure in Windows 7. It
<strong>is</strong> possible to restore items in your default music folder&nbsp;that are missing from WMP's library -&nbsp; by using media library restore - you can request the whole library is restored or just deleted items (in this case 'deleted' means from the WMP
 library - it will not - understandably - restore files deleted from the PC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>WMP's library in W7&nbsp;was prone to accidental corruption because there is a separate library folder and location folder. If an item is moved or deleted in the explorer library (but not the file location) the WMP library will be messed up. This has been modified
 in W10 so it is less likely to be a problem.</p>
<p>This is the correct method to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">restore the WMP library</span> which will renstate any files that are in the selected library location (usually Music - or My Music in W7) Follow the settings path shown here... (if top
 tool bar is not showing r-click at the red arrow head and select tools from the dialogue box) - This completely empties the library and rebuilds it without affecting files.</p>
<p>But it is indeed a good idea to have copies of music (and all other personal files) on an XHD!</p>
<p>Cheers, Ric.</p>

<p>I receive the following message everytime I boot up The Catalyst Control Center is not supported by the driver version of your enabled graphics adapter.&nbsp; Please update your ATI graphics driver or enable your ATI adapter using Displays Manager.<br />

            Hi tcmh,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />
<br />
First, please remove your tuner card, we will concentrate on fixing the video card first.&nbsp; Then temporary disable any security software you might have.<br />
Once you remove the tuner card, boot into Safe Mode with Networking and remove the ATI software driver from Programs/Features in Control Panel.&nbsp;
<br />
Reboot the system into Safe Mode with Networking again and download the software driver for your video card from ATI website.&nbsp; Follow the installation instruction below.<br />

<h2>            SQL Standard Core Based License</h2>
                    <p>I have a server with 32 cores. I need to purchase SQL Standard 2014 for this server. SQL Standard 2014 supports maximum of 16 cores. Is there any way of utilising all of 32 cores of server.</p>
<p>For eg. If I purchase 16 core license and install 2 instances of SQL Standard on the server. Will both instances use same 16 cores or different 16 cores.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also 1 question is if I can install multiple instances of SQL on same server machine with single license.</p>

<h3> choglidite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logitech G5 Mouse settings won&#39;t save.</h2>
                    
<p>I've got Win 7 Prof X64. I've been working with Logitech support now for almost 3 months on why my G5 mouse setting won't save after a reboot. They have had me load 5 different versions of SetPoint and make every system change they could think of. They even
 sent me a new G500 mouse, which has the same problem. After a reboot, I have to open SetPoint and close it, make no changes, and all my settings start to work. SetPoint is in my Startup menu &amp; the KHALMNPR file is set to not load.</p>
<p>I loaded the same software to my laptop, Win 7 Home Premium, and it works fine. This tells me it's got to be a setting in Win 7. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
Are you able to save setting for other application or program?</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong>Try changing the setting in safe mode, then reboot to safe mode again to check if setting are saved.<br />
If the settings are saved in safe mode then, you may try performing clean boot.</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 2: </strong>You may try creating a new user account and check if the issue persists there.<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it works in a new user account then you need to fix the corrupt user profile. You may visit this link for the steps:<br />

<p>I have just started get a similar problem with my U-Verse. I was always using stereo. So, I don't know about your surround sound issue. The problem I am having is that the audio quality is terrible. If I skip the Xbox One and go right into the TV with HDMI,
 it is fine. But, though the HDMI on the Xbox One the audio is choppy. I've had the Xbox One since launch day and this has just started in the last couple weeks.</p>

            Your post has nothing to do with Windows Update.<br />
<br />
Unlike WinXP and Vista, Win7 doesn't include a default Mail Client.&nbsp;[<em>What were they thinking?</em>]
<br />
<br />
You will have to install one (e.g., MS Outlook; <a href="http://download.live.com/wlmail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Windows Live Mail</span></a>; Thunderbird) <strong>and then</strong> set it as your default for Mail in the CUSTOM&nbsp;(<strong>&lt;=important!</strong>) section of&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-default-programs-using-Set-Program-Access-and-Computer-Defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Set
 Program Access and Computer Defaults</span></a> before any <strong>Send To</strong> or
<strong>MailTo</strong> functions will become available.<br />
<br />
You'll find support for Win7 Mail Clients in this forum: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7network/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            &#40;Check disk&#41; Unspecified error occurred &#40;766f6c756d652e63  3f1&#41;</h2>
                    <div>I seldom have problems with my computer but am compelled to post this today as the "old" thread pertaining this error is like 2 years old now. &nbsp;I got the following error now for the last week or so:</div>
<div><br />

<div>[IMG]http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i31/corbind/chkdiskerrormessage766f6c756d652e633f1on8-7-12.jpg[/IMG]</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's a desktop computer where I have iTunes installed and have a Microsoft Wireless Natural Multimedia Keyboard. &nbsp;The error seems to occur only when I'm listening to my iTunes on the computer (always) and hit the media key on the keyboard to skip forward
 or backward on a song. &nbsp;Then the blue screen pops up with and ANNOYING constant beep sound. &nbsp;Then it eventually goes to the restart screen with all black and does a check disk and gives me the error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It reboots fine and everything works for a couple of days then it happens again. &nbsp;I've tried to manually do a chk dsk but it won't let me as a sector is bad (shared I think it said?). &nbsp;So I'm here asking for your generous help to make this go away and
 let my computer do a check disk at will and this problem to go away.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm EXTREMELY hesitant to uninstall iTunes in that I have 11,000 songs I've meticulously gotten from my CD collection. &nbsp;So if I lose my music collection I've lose a tremendous amount of time and money. &nbsp;So not sure what to do next....</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any software changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<br />
Method 1: <br />
You can solve some computer problems by checking a drive or drives for errors. For example, you can check your computer's primary hard disk to fix some performance issues, or you can check an external hard drive if it's not working properly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Follow the below steps:<br />
<br />
<br />
a. Open Computer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Computer. <br />
b. Right-click the drive that you want to check, and then click Properties.<br />
c. Click the Tools tab, and then, under Error-checking, click Check now. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select Automatically fix file system errors. Otherwise, the disk check will report problems but not fix them.<br />
<br />
To perform a thorough check, select Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors. This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on the drive itself, and it can take much longer to complete.<br />
<br />
To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both Automatically fix file system errors and Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors.<br />
<br />
d. Click Start.<br />
Refer the below link for more details:<br />
<br />
Check a drive for errors<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</a><br />
<br />
Method 2:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue may be related to drivers. You may have to download install the latest display and graphics drivers to fix the issue.<br />
<br />
To download and update driver, you can use the following methods:<br />
<br />
a. Use Windows Update. You might need to set Windows Update to automatically download and install recommended updates.<br />
<br />
b. Install software from the device manufacturer. For example, if your device came with a disc, that disc might contain software that installs a driver for the device.<br />
<br />
c. Download and update the driver yourself. Use this method to install a driver that you download from the manufacturer's website. Do this if Windows Update can't find a driver for your device and the device didn't come with software that installs a driver.<br />
<br />
<br />
Refer the below link for more details on the same:<br />
<br />
Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If Windows can't find a driver for your device, and the device didn't come with driver software, you can look for a driver on the device manufacturer's website. Driver updates are often available in the support section of such sites.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you find the updated driver, follow the installation instructions on the website. Most drivers are self-installing—after you download them, you usually just double-click the file to begin the installation, and then the driver installs itself on your computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Refer the manufacturer’s website for latest drivers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Method 3:<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, boot into safe mode and check if the issue exists.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If the issue does not occur in safe mode, it indicates that one of the services or startup items may be corrupted and maybe causing the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To troubleshoot the issue, you may have to put your system in clean boot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Check the below link for more details on clean boot:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<br />
Note: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 is corrupting all PDFs. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 is corrupting all PDFs.</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new ASUS tablet running Windows 8.1. My issue is that it cannot deal with any .pdf documents that are received on it.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I set up my mail account on the Mail tile. From day one, every time I tried to open a .pdf attachment with the default Reader tile, regardless of who sent it or where it came from, I received an error message "Can't open this file. There's a problem with
 the file format."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then downloaded the Adobe Reader Touch app and set that as the default. Trying to open .pdf attachments in that resulted in a similar error message "The document cannot be opened because it is not a valid PDF document."<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I then downloaded Adobe Reader XI on the desktop and tried saving my documents from Mail to the desktop first and then opening them. For each and every one of them, regardless of the source, I get the error message:<br />
</p>
<p>"Adobe Reader could not open (document name) because it is either not a supported file type or because the file has been damaged (for example, it was sent as an email attachment and wasn't correctly decoded.)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now deleted both the default Reader tile as well as Adobe Reader Touch, leaving only Adobe Reader XI, and still nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incredibly, this problem is not restricted to Mail. The exact same issue is happening with the many PDFs I've saved to my OneNote account. Each time I try to open one I receive the same error messages from the apps and Adobe Reader. If I try to open up a
 PDF from OneNote in another source, I get the error message "This file is currently opened in another application. Close the file in that application and try again." I then have to go into Task Manager and shut down OneNote and all the tiles and software I've
 used to try to open the .pdfs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I am able to open any PDF document on this tablet is if I first put it into OneDrive on my main laptop- which completely defeats the purpose of having bought this tablet.&nbsp; And as with Mail, there's no point to using OneNote if I can't access
 many of the resources on it from the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter. That did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same ESET antivirus account set up on both the tablet and the laptop, and I obviously don't have this problem with the laptop. I don't have these problems at all on my laptop, and never have. I tried temporarily disabling the firewall (!) on the
 tablet but that did not fix the problem.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the PDF files are getting corrupt while downloading the attachments in Mail app. Also, if the file association for the PDF file types is corrupt, you may find such issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to download a PDF file using an internet browser and check if you are able to open it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, follow the troubleshooting methods to troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to temporarily disable Eset antivirus program and check if it helps.
</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Important Note: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruse and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable the antivirus software. If you
 have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue still persists, proceed to the next method.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Run SFC scan and find out if it scans and fixes corrupt system files.

            <p>Thank you for writing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I tried opening PDFs received in Mail as well as those stored in OneNote using both Firefox and Internet Explorer. Neither worked. (Opening PDFs in these browsers does work if I click a link on a web page - the issue here is that anything that seems to
 come via my Microsoft account is corrupted on this tablet only.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I temporarily disabled my antivirus and firewall. That did not fix the problem and the same issue happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I ran the SFC scan. It said "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) I have changed the default application for PDFs about twenty times now between Reader, Adobe Reader Touch, Adobe Reader XI, Firefox, and Internet Explorer in my attempts to get simple, basic PDF files to open on this tablet. It is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, after doing all of this, I have just run a test by emailing a .pdf document to myself from the laptop to the tablet. Again: "This document cannot be opened because it is not a valid PDF document." I am right back where I started.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing a quick update on the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have&nbsp;<strong>Asus Data Security Manager&nbsp;</strong>Installed on the tablet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are scenarios wherein the&nbsp;<strong>Asus Data Security Manager&nbsp;</strong>has restricted users to save or open PDF files. &nbsp;If you have the application installed and you already have the setup for the same, I would suggest uninstalling the application and
 monitor the status of this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            Simple steps and your .pdf file can be restored.<br />
<br />
1. Navigate to the location with the corrupted PDF file. Right-click on it and select&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"Rename." Type any other file name and hit "Enter." Sometimes, a simple rename can&nbsp;<br />
<br />
troubleshoot corrupt PDFs.<br />
<br />
2. Make sure your Adobe Reader is in working condition. Open any other PDF files on your hard&nbsp;<br />
<br />
drive to make sure the problem is not originating from your Adobe Reader. If it does,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
reinstall Reader from Adobe's website for free (see Resources).<br />
<br />
3. Update Adobe Reader. Launch Adobe Reader from the Start menu under "All Programs." Click&nbsp;<br />
<br />
on the "Help" tab and select "Check for Updates..." Follow the on-screen prompts to complete&nbsp;<br />
<br />
installing the updates. Try re-opening the PDF file.

<h2>            Windows 7 and 10 -- desktop icons unresponsive</h2>
                    <p>For the last 5-6 weeks, we have a problem where the desktop locks up, but ONLY the desktop.&nbsp; Taskbar, system tray and start menu all work fine.&nbsp; Desktop icons do not respond to left or right clicks.&nbsp; Right-clicking the desktop itself also does nothing.&nbsp;
 Desktop shortcuts work fine when accessed by browsing to the folder in an Explorer window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Environment:&nbsp; 350+ nodes on a peer-to-peer network with a mix of Windows 7 and Windows 10 clients.&nbsp; Both versions are affected.</p>
<p>Around 15-20% of users report this problem.&nbsp; For some, it occurs multiple times per day. Others report it happening 2-3 times per week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Killing and restarting explorer.exe temporarily resolves the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Killing all IE processes also temporarily resolves the problem.</p>

Except this problem is happening on both Windows 7 and Windows 10.&nbsp; I don't know the exact ratio, but most clients on the network (and most experiencing this issue) are Windows 7 machines.

<h2>            Can&#39;t Install ANY Fonts in Windows 10</h2>
                    Every time I try to install any font on my computer (windows 10) it wont let me, a error box comes up that says "The requested file [font location] is not a valid font file." I have downloaded very popular #1 fonts off trusted, reliable websites to make
 sure I wasn't just getting all corrupted fonts somehow, but it still gives me the same error. After doing some research I tried (please note that these font have been extracted from their zip file) 1. Dragging the font directly in the windows Fonts folder
 2. Putting it in the root directory and right clicking and selecting install. Then at this point I was fed up so I did some more research and with my findings I assumed it had something to do with permissions or security so I enabled the windows Administrator
 account and tried the two methods listed above, nothing worked. This happens with every font I've tried (around 50) a lot of them being downloaded from different places. I've used TTF fonts and OTF fonts, I've tried running them th

<h2>            Windows 10 Temporary Account keeps recurring</h2>
                    <p>I have recently been assigned a temporary account by windows 10 meaning I am unable to sign into my regular account on my laptop where all my documents, photos, drivers etc. are stored.</p>
<p>I've taken instruction from you tube and managed to find my way into deleting the temporary account and renaming my normal account. (Windows+R / Regedit / Local Machine /Microsoft / Windows NT / Profile List etc.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, instead of my proper account being restored, I have been faced with yet another temporary account in its place...thus I find myself trapped in a loop of recurring temporary accounts.</p>
<p>Any advice hugely appreciated!!</p>

<p>Many thanks for your help, I appreciate it very much. I followed your advice very carefully but unfortunately in this case, I'm still coming up against a temporary profile. Hoping my normal profile is still in there somewhere.</p>
<p>Any further actions appreciated but if not, huge thanks again.</p>

            Hi keneveleth
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar)
<br />
<br />Click 'This PC' on the left
<br />
<br />On the right, do you see your DVD Drive
<br />
<br />If you insert a Disk into that drive, can you see the files on that DVD?
<br />
<br />If you do not see that drive or the files on that drive, please let me know
<br />
<br />If you can see those files, you need to download a Media player that can play DVD's, because Windows 10 does not natively support DVD playback
<br />
<br />Click this link to download the VLC Player, that is totally free and will play just about any media file:

<br />When you insert that Disk, does the DVD drive icon change?

<h2>            Set virual memory in Ematic 1 GB 10 inch tablet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Ematic EWT932BL tablet with keyboard with Windows 10 installed. It has only 1 GB of RAM so obviously it must be frequently accessing the "virual memory" on the "C" drive which is flash memory. There is about 15 GB of space on the C drive. I use
 another drive (an SD card) for storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would be the optimal size range of the "paging file" or should I "let Windows automatically adjust it. Typical use for this little system is surfing the web using the included Edge browser. Sometimes it stalls and is unresponsive for some time while
 completing a task.</p>

            <p>You should let Windows manage it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a tablet with 1GB RAM - I am not surprised with poor performance. &nbsp;;-) &nbsp;When many reviews (the GOOD ones!) start with things like, "<span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">It's obviously not
 fast or supported well by the company that makes it..." - I wouldn't expect much out of it - but it'd work in a pinch or for small tasks (web surfing, etc.)</span></p>

            <p>I'm not sure the &nbsp;amount of RAM is so important when there is, as in my tablets case, a SSD. With a SSD, the virtual memory is likely nearly as fast as the RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, this cheap little tablet works pretty well with its 1GB of RAM for the limited purposes of surfing. . As I stated, the only occasions when it stumbles are in multitasking and moving files from the SSD to an SD card..</p>

<h2>            Touch screen doesn&#39;t work sometimes when I try to close tabs</h2>
                    So, my touch screen works for scrolling down and all that. But, when it comes to shuffling tabs, closing them, opening them , the touch doesn't respond to that. I just updated my PC so it can't be that.

</p><p>Try using Narrator (Win+Ctrl+Enter). &nbsp; Narrator will put a blue box around whatever it thinks you tapped on and then say "double tap to activate".&nbsp; Fortunately (usually) we can do the double tap anywhere; e.g. it does not have to be precisely on target.
 &nbsp; Alternatively, try using the Magnifier.&nbsp; Magnifier can make bigger targets for you to tap on, in any of its modes.&nbsp; Or just learn to use some keyboard equivalents, e.g. to close a tab you can press Ctrl-w.</p>

            no, I won't go through all that hassle. I just need to know why I can't use my fingers to close a damn tab.

</p><p>It may not be precise enough.&nbsp; However, on the Surface Pro you would have an electronic stylus to use, so that would be a better choice if there is no keyboard or mouse.&nbsp; Alternatively, in Windows 10 FCU we finally have something that is analogous to the
 old Tablet PC Touch Mouse called Touch Screen Touchpad.&nbsp; You can show that by enabling the Taskbar button for it and tapping on that.&nbsp; Then you will be able to see, move and use a mouse pointer to do things that require extra precision but using only your
 fingers.</p>
