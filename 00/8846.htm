<h2>            Duplex printing problem</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an Intel NUC5PPYH and I cannot have a flawless duplex printing. I am currently running Win 10 Pro 64 bit built 1703. Whenever I try to print a 2-page document, created on MS Office 2010 Word, I end up with a sheet of paper where the front page print
 does not 100% overlap the print on the back page. Lets say that the front page has 32 lines of words typed and the back has also 32 lines of words typed. In an ideal situation, the front print (i.e the first 32 lines) should overlap the next (back) 32 lines.
 In my case, printing of the front page starts lower than usual (4 lines lower to be precise) whereas the back page printing starts normally at the top of the page, thus I am having a sheet of paper where if you place it under any light, you could see that
 the 2 printings (front &amp; back) do not overlap. Sorry for my english, this is the best way I can describe the problem, treat the document in question as an x-ray and place it under normal everyday lighting. Every paper has some degree of transparency.</p>
<p>I am using the default settings in MS Word, margins, spaces etc are used as is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was facing the same problem when running Win 10 Pro 64 bit built 1607. I updated to built 1703 hoping for a fix. My printer was an HP DeskJet Ink Advantage 4535 AiO, which had automatic 2-sided printing and was connected to my NUC through usb cable. I
 had to return it to the store. I have also used a Samsung Multifunction Printer Xpress M2885FW which also had automatic 2-sided printing, connect it through usb, the problem still persists.</p>
<p>Moved my NUC to a place where there was another HP printer which also had automatic 2-sided printing, unfortunately, problem persists.</p>
<p>I have also converted the aforementioned 2-sided file to a PDF, still facing duplex error.</p>
<p>I have also uninstalled Win 10 Pro and installed Win 7 Ultimate 64 bit. I didn't solved the problem.</p>
<p>While running built 1607 (Win 10 Pro 64 bit) I also used MS Office 2007 and 2016 Pro, faulty duplex printing continued. I am currently on built 1703 with MS Office 2010.</p>
<p>Purchased heavier paper (120gr instead of 80gr), thinking that it may be a roller issue (or whatever mechanism is used to grab the paper), didn't solved it either.</p>
<p>I have also installed Libre Office and used it for printing only documents that were created in MS Office and magically the problem was solved! Used Libre to open other files created under MS Office, and printing was fine.</p>
<p>Lastly I have also emailed the above document to a couple of friends that I knew they had printers with automatic 2-sided printing, asked them to not change any Office parameter and print it. 2-sided printing was fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to a solution.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Dear Anna Bon</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the same issue exists even when trying to print other Office Word documents, i tried several .docx files, even converted one to a PDF file, but the issue still exists.</p>
<p>As far as your second question is concerned, my printer did support automatic duplex printing; every printer that i have used in order to identify and solve this issue, supported automatic duplex printing, as this feature is very important to me. Manual
 printing is fine though. My HP AiO had the latest drivers installed. I had to return the HP AiO to the store, please bear in mind that i currently do not have a printer, i am searching for one that could work with my Intel NUC.</p>
<p>Did read the links provided, unfortunately it didn't solve the issue.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greg</p>

            Thank you for getting back to us. If you have tried different Word documents and printers with the same issue, it is possible that there is something wrong with the Intel NUC5PPYH that you are using. Kindly try printing your documents directly using the
 printers that are not connected to Intel. Also, we suggest that you contact Intel support to check which printers are compatible and can be used for duplex printing.
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            activation problem after upgrading mother board</h2>
                    <p>I put in a new mother board and booted in the latest insider preview.</p>
<p>Windows automatically installed the new drivers, rebooted and everything worked fine but now windows says it is not activated.
</p>
<p>Should I run&nbsp;&nbsp;slui.exe 4 and call or what? </p>
<p>I have tried changing the product key as posted in other posts but nothing has helped.</p>
<p>I am running a dual boot system with windows 8.1, that windows updated when I booted into it,&nbsp;and runs&nbsp; as activated. I would have thought the 8.1 would have done the same thing and not activated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible? &nbsp;Rows 3,5,6 have values in them that makes it impossible to use the normal XIRR(B2:B7,A2:A7,.1) arguments.</p>
<p>So the problem is how to replace B2:B7 and A2:A7 with B2,B4,B6,B7 and A2,A4,A6,A7. &nbsp;I guessed I could do it with a Range definition (just guessing), but it is a lot of work setting all of the Ranges up. &nbsp;Wanted something simple that I could just enter manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am trying to do is track IRA performance, annually by year -- so rows 2,4,6 would be annual contributions while rows 3,5,7 would be annual Y/E values, with a XIRR at each Y/E point in the list (i.e. 3 different XIRR calculations in the above list).
 &nbsp;Hope I haven't made this too confusing.</p>

<h2>            N91 hard drive</h2>
                    i know this is a bit if a dumb question seeing as the phone has not been released, but does anyone have a clue what sort of hard drive this phone will use? i mean, if it is like a 2.5" one then it can be removed and replaced with a larger one right? even
 if its a 1.8" hdd this can be removed to. think about what you could replace it with, a 40gb hdd? that would be sooo cool

            I think its supposed to me some sort of microdrive, I was thinking along the same lines as u but then you would have to get hold of special tools and even then the drive may be soldered in, all sorts of things could go wrong rendering u with a 500£ piece

            I dunno, if it is soldered in it would be tricky and i guess ur soldering isnt up to the standard of those fancy robots that do all that kind of stuff<br />

and theres always the chance the fone wont recognise a bigger hdd not to mention if u go anywhere near the fone with a screwdriver the warranty goes out the window

<h3> entegy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot get ActiveX textbox to go transparent</h2>
                    
<p>I am programming this on Office 2007, but using the PPT format and the slide show is played on Office 2003.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have ActiveX text boxes whose BackStyle property is set to 0 - fmBackStyleTransparent, but when the slide show plays, these text boxes turn opaque.</p>
<p>I do manipulate the text of the text boxes via VBA, so I tried forcing the BackStyle by setting it to fmBackStyleTransparent again after the manipulation is done, but while the slide show is playing, these text boxes will not keep a transparent background.
 Help?</p>

<p>Short answer: Yes and No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, depending on how you bought Office 2007 in the first place, you may have the right to transfer the installation to the new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, not with a 15 digit "<em>product key</em>". All office product keys are 25 characters long, typically written by MS as 5 groups of 5 char separated by hyphens.
</p>

</p><p>When you bought Office 2007 online, it is most likely that you were given a "Medialess Licesne Kit", MLK type license. This license was sold online without the installation disk.&nbsp; It was cheaper than the "tradional" boxed CD retail version.&nbsp; As well as saving
 money by not including the installation disk, MS saved money by making the license terms more restrictive. This type of license can only be installed on one computer and the installation is permanently tied to that hardware. No transfer allowed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, I don't think you will be able to install on the new machine because you do not have the correct product key and because you probably have a license type that does not allow transfers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many ways a computer can "die". If the old HD is still good, you could get a technician to connect it to another computer, and then run a (free) tool to extract the Office product key from the old HD so you can try to use it to install on the new
 machine. </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>PS: </strong></p>
<p>Office 2007 is going "Off support" / "end of life" in October this year. That means MS will no longer provide ANY updates for it. That will make it an ongoing security risk on your computer. This is probably a good time to look for a new version of Office.</p>

            Hi satyamthakur
<br />
<br />It depends on which version of Office is installed on your laptop, some versions of Office do not include MS Access
<br />
<br />Open Word
<br />
<br />Go to File - Account
<br />
<br />On the right, which version of MS Office is reported there?
<br />
<br />If that is Office Home and Student 2016, that version does not contain MS Access, it only contains Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote

            hi mate, have you checked that you don't have anything like a screen protector or case blocking the proximity sensor? also try performing a soft reset, and ensuring that you are up to date with the latest firmware for your device, and you are up to date
 with the latest Nokia system app updates from the Store.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In column C you have formula like this</p>
<p>
</p><p>='D:\EXCEL SHEETS\Texas Two Step\3000 Draws with Stats and %\[2Step Numbers Book Stats&nbsp; (3,000+).xlsx]#1A-E-O'!S1554</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because we don't have access to that folder and file we can't tell what's in those cells but other formula tell us that the workbook is expecting there to be numeric data&nbsp;so what I did I changed the formula to numbers and when I did that all the formula
 in column BR evaluated correctly and also the SUMPRODUCT formula you're having troubles with in Column BI evaluated correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I therefore believe that the formula that is importing the data above is not returning the correct data type. As previously noted that data must be integer numeric data and if not your formula will fail.</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using outlook 2011 for Mac and I was able to send my newsletters created using HTML without any problems. Then my itchy backside decided to upgrade to Office 365 and viola all sh***t hit the fan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I cannot send my newsletter in HTML anymore. Each time I copy and paste my HTML file displayed over browser the image displaced on the outlook 365 message body is all screwed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Microsoft Technical Support in Malaysia and they tried every way and could not solve my issue either. The tech support then asked his 2nd level and this is what the answer was "this issue I have please to refer to the Microsoft Community to resolve"
 and they closed my ticket No 1347341740. I just could not believe my ears when he said that. They are suppose to know their product and they are relying on you guys in the community. This I will deal in another way later.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I need someone out in the community to help how to go about sending out my HTML newsletter in best and easiest way. Need step-by-step instructions please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help...guys...I am sure there must me a way....</p>

            <p>To be fair, the MS Support technician did you a favor by referring you to a community of fellow users of Office. They can answer questions like, "How do I switch from plain text to HTML when composing an email message." When it comes to working with content
 in a scenario such as yours, it's not something they've ever tried to do. They're utterly clueless. At least you got a technician who knew her limitations and steered you in the right direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing the version information of 15.24. You are up to date and have Office 2016. Office 365 is the name of the subscription program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your build of Office, Microsoft Word is the composing software inside of Microsoft Outlook. All of Word's features are still not available to the Outlook interface. For most people this doesn't matter, but for creative composing this can be limiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the time being (meaning the next few rounds of updates), until the interface is more robust in Outlook, I suggest building your messages in Microsoft Word itself. Use Web Layout view in Word. Once you have your document just the way you like it, use
 File &gt; Share &gt; Send HTML to insert the document as an HTML body in an Outlook message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even in your current build of Outlook you now have precise control over the sizes of objects. Select an object and then press Command-Shift-1 while composing a message. The Format Picture pane displays. In the Format Picture pane click the Picture tab and
 you'll find height and width settings under the Crop heading (even though these settings don't have anything to do with crop). You can even drag the Format Picture pane and have it float if you prefer.</p>

<p>Hi LizLevi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Most of the operating system files are owned by the <strong>TrustedInstaller</strong> to prevent a process that is running as an administrator from automatically replacing the system files. You can refer to the
<strong>Changes in security identifier's functionality</strong> section at the bottom part of this
<strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Hi, thank you for taking the time to offer assistance.&nbsp; I do appreciate it.&nbsp; I think I have found an answer to the reason why this happened.&nbsp; From Acer, I found an article about Meltdown and Spectre Security Vulnerabilities.&nbsp; I am pretty sure I have Spectre
 Next Generation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This information was about the post:&nbsp; Recently discovered security vulnerabilities known as Meltdown, Spectre and Spectre Next Generation. These industry-wide vulnerabilities impact many modern processors, and allow malicious code to force a processor into
 allowing access to protected data in the system memory (RAM).&nbsp; We are working closely with our processor and Operating System suppliers to address the issues, and we will release the needed firmware updates to reduce the risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Spectre Next Generation (Spectre-NG) issue consists of two different vulnerabilities. Side-Channel Vulnerability Variant 3a: Rogue System Register Read – CVE-2018-3640, and variant 4: Speculative Store Bypass – CVE-2018-3639. These vulnerabilities may
 allow an attacker to obtain access to sensitive information on affected systems.</p>
<p>Acer is working with Intel to provide updates to resolve this vulnerability. Updates will be posted below as they become available. Additional information on Spectre-NG can be found at
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-3640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities. As a result, we have delayed the release of updates for these impacted models, so they are not currently shown in the table below. We will continue to update this page as new information and updates become available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of right now there is not a firmware update for my computes or phones.&nbsp; This is very frustrating, but I am waiting to hear for a solution. &nbsp;<span> I also wanted people to know that once the virus is in, it installs a program called kangru and
 controls your phones also.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a problem with Windows computers since January.&nbsp; I was very hurt by the way I was treated by Microsoft Technicians, the Technician and Management at the Microsoft Store and the Chat Technicians.&nbsp; When I suggested that there might be a virus
 in the bios, the technician at the store told me that was only being worked on at NASA and why would someone target me?&nbsp; It was all in my head and they had done all they could do for me and I should try another operating system.&nbsp; Telephone support told me
 they would no longer take my calls, I was crazy and hung up on me.&nbsp; Chat told me to give up all of my accounts but they were not there to help just individuals with their accounts.&nbsp; When I tried to make a copy of the transcript, they erased it and disconnected
 me.&nbsp; You would think the way technology changes daily, that someone working in that field would be more open minded.&nbsp; Helping people isn't that what they get paid for?&nbsp; I hope all I have been through helps someone else.&nbsp; Now I still have to get the firmware
 updates, reinstall windows and hope it works. As of right now everything I own is infected.&nbsp; I have lost all of my technology and almost my mind.&nbsp; There should be some kind of restitution for that.</p>

<p>Sorry Liz, but as already mentioned by the Microsoft Agent Donna above, I can see a perfectly normal explanation for everything you described in your original post above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also see that you are reaching for an explanation to what are often confusing effects of the normal operation of the Windows operating system as it exists today and so finding a potential "answer" that suits your preconceived notion that a "virus"
 is involved, no matter how likely that might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I'm not a Microsoft employee myself, only another consumer user of Windows systems with a deep past supporting them in education (all levels), business, government and individual consumer users homes.&nbsp; That background includes performing security
 vulnerability scanning and analysis of financial and other&nbsp;business networks, as well as reviewing and testing organizations and their employees for risk analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading your most recent post shows most clearly your technical confusion regarding the intricacies of the operation of a modern computing system.&nbsp; You've found one of the most potentially dangerous and also confusing sets of computing system vulnerabilities
 currently known, but completely mistaken what the information you've found online truly means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's not at all surprising, since even with my background, understanding the complex relationships between these new vulnerabilities of Meltdown and Spectre and how they each relate to various manufacturer's processors and even just my own computers and
 phones has been highly confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, what you've completely misunderstood is that these particular vulnerabilities related to Spectre, though a potentially high risk, have not yet been successfully attacked within the Windows or any other processor/manufacturer realm that I'm aware
 of.&nbsp; The problem here is that you are relating the existence of a vulnerability to malware (a virus), which are two entirely different things, with one only potentially leading to the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So though you feel hurt by those in various support positions attempting to help you and then finally giving up and throwing up their hands, possibly recommending that you go buy something else, that's just a symptom of their own exasperation.&nbsp; Understanding
 such highly technical information is difficult enough for those with some education or training, attempting to explain these to someone like yourself without any such background is next to impossible.&nbsp; This is especially true since most people who are adept
 at understanding technical systems aren't well versed in dealing with people, regardless if they've been forced into that position by the nature of their jobs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not going to say that you must entirely drop the idea of using Windows, though that's a potential solution, but since all modern computers are really just as complex and not easily understood in depth, that's only workable if you choose to ignore this
 technical garbage as most consumers today have chosen to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, you'll need to decide whether you can learn to listen to what little valuable information others are trying to provide, since it's really your fear that someone is trying to "hack" you that's causing your problems and not any real technical issue
 that anyone here or in Microsoft support elsewhere can actually resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The modern computing world is highly technical and impossible for even those working within it to fully understand everything, so most choose to "black box" the portions they don't need to deal with.&nbsp; For example, someone working in software may simply assume
 the computer hardware is a black box and choose not to learn anything that's not absolutely necessary about it., while someone working in app&nbsp;support may assume the entire system is a black box, while learning&nbsp;only the particular apps they are responsible
 for in order to aid customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of consumers, as I've already mentioned, most assume the entire device is a black box, choosing to learn only the most basic operation of both the apps and the visual portions of the operating system they must use to start them.&nbsp; This is a completely
 valid and workable method for those not wishing to dig any deeper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are unfortunately trying to explain some set of apparent problems you've had by leaping to conclusions, so you need to back up, start over and explain the original items that caused your concern.&nbsp; Jumping into assumptions with no real knowledge simply
 leads to more problems, which is where you now find yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So decide what your path will be and stick to it to find success.&nbsp; Only someone with many years of technical background can even think of trying to make assumptions and even then the results may end in failure and the need to start over without them.&nbsp; I
 know, it's happened to me many times and I've got nearly 40 years history working with computers even before the IBM PC first came on the scene.</p>

<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>new to ovi maps. I have loaded uk map and paid for the licence so I have turn by turn navigation. I am off to India in september to do a charity event called the rickshaw run wich means driving 2500 miles across india in a tuk tuk. Anyway have downloaded
 india maps but I cant view them. Do I have to wait till I get there before I can see them on my 5800 express. cheers guys</p>

<p>&nbsp;Firstly, Nokia maps are free so you shouldn't have had to pay for a license. Also, if you have downloaded the map for India you should be able to view it no matter where you are in the world because they are viewable in offline mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;What version of maps do you have on your 5800, and what firmware version are you running?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ray, firstly thanks for the quick response. I know the maps are free but if you want turn by turn navigation with voice I thought you needed to purchase a licence . I have just downloaded the latest nokia suite and done a full software update. in that
 it tells me my nap version is 3.01(32) where can I see my firmware level. Sorry for the silly question but new to this phone. Again cheers m8</p>

<p>To view India maps.. first Zoom out till you see the Globe..Then swipe across (so that the Globe rotates..) and bring India in the view..Then Zoom-in.. Or search for a place in India (say..Mumbai) and it should come up..</p>

<p>As Farby has stated, maps v3.06 is the latest and gives free navigation. &nbsp;How much did it cost for the license? Maybe you can get a refund from Nokia.</p>

<p><span><span><strong>Hi andiste,<br />
</strong>1. Do you get any error when the download stops?<br />
2. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
3. Do you remember making any changes on your computer?<br />
<strong>Step 1: </strong><br />
Disable Antivirus\Firewall temporarily and then check for the issue.<br />
Note: Please make sure that you enable the antivirus software\firewall after performing the test to keep your computer protected.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Turn Windows Firewall on or off:<br />
</span></strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
You may also put the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists.<br />
a. Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />
b. Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />

<strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.<br />
<strong>Regarding Windows Update, run Windows Update Troubleshooter.</strong><br />

            hi thanks for your reply...i have tried disabling virus software aswell as my firewall...im using windows firewall because when i use 3rd party ones it messes my config up. iv had this problem since day 1....they dont always stop but more often than not
 they do..id say around 80% of the time....usualy it wouldnt bother me because i have been using a 3rd party download manager due to this problem but when i try to download windows updates it automatical uses windows download manager i tried the safe boot option
 and again same problem persists, my friend had a pirate copy of windows 7 ultimate and he gets no problems at all but obviously he cant download windows updates. iv noticed on numerous forums that tis is a typical problem and doesnt seem to be a solution so
 to be honest i think im going to invest in a mac due to the lack of virus's and maintenance problems. Iv even been on microsoft live help website and they tell me i will incur a charge due to my id key registring as bought from acer wh

            You can't sync your Zune device with Groove unless your purchased the songs. The DRM used is not compatible with Zune. If you are just talking about the pass and not the Zune device, there is nothing you need to do it should just transfer over when you
 open the groove app.

            <p>You will still sync your personal music collection to your Zune Players via the Zune desktop software as you have always done. The difference is that the Zune Music Pass and Zune subscribed music is no longer active or available....the Zune music subscription
 service has been permanently discontinued - so you will no longer be able to listen to subscribed music on a Zune Player. The Groove Music Pass is not compatible with a Zune Player and Groove subscribed music cannot be played on a Zune Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want a Groove Music Pass you need to go cancel it, which you can do by contacting Microsoft Support. I initiated a chat session with Microsoft Support last month,&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us?xr=footnav#4:0:3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">via
 this web page, </a>to stop my old Zune Music Pass since I have no interest in the Groove Music service.

<h2>            Randomize slides without repeating&#63;</h2>
                    Sorry if this is a simple question, but I don't use PP much. Is there a way without scripting to randomize slides, but not have any of them repeat? What about having 1 title screen, then the rest repeat? Thanks for any info!

</p><p>
</p><p>I just found a way to get all the new features of OneNote to work on my tablet by disabling the trust center. However, now I am unable to sync my notebooks, and OneNote does not even let me sign in or anything. How do I fix this?</p>
