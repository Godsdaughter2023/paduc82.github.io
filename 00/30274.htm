<h2>            Photo app doesn&#39;t scroll photos with Google drive folder</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, I have just come across a problem where the photo app does not have a scroll button when I open up photo folders from Google drive. When I open photos from other folders the scroll to next photo button is there. This is really frustrating as the
 majority of all my pictures are saved in Google drive! Why is the app not working with this folder and what can I do to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to this the photo app doesn't display photos from Google drive folder when I select it as a source folder in settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

            <p>The Photos app appears to work with everything that I initially synced from Google Drive. But when I later added additional photos, they're never recognized by the Photos app. If I go into the Folders view in the Photos app, the new subfolders never appear,
 no matter how many times I hit the refresh button. And double-clicking a photo in the folder in Windows Explorer pops up that one photo, but the arrow keys don't work to page through my photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's so different about Google Drive that it breaks Photos so badly?</p>

<p>That doesn't really help though as you cannot delete or edit photos in the slide show settings...</p>

<h2>            Our terms of use are changing email from Microsoft</h2>
                    I got an email from Microsoft concerning Our terms of use are changing - I AM DISABLED and count on my computer for 95% of my communications with doctors, insurance companies, specialists, nurses, advisors, relatives, etc. etc. - Because I have almost
 NO cognitive ability left I spent almost an HOUR trying to find the right person to complain to in that in SMALL letters it stated at the BOTTOM of the email

I filed a complaint with a supervisor after getting jerked around for over 50 minutes chat, etc. - I can only set up for 10-15 minutes at a time - I FINALLY got the complaint filed and email confirmation - Why in GOD's name can't they be smart enough to put
 that statement at the TOP in BOLD lettering - I won't be around this world much longer and am trying to get my computer squared away for my wife that doesn't even know how to turn it on before I'm gone - As with most people today ALL of our banking, etc. HAS
 to be done by computer - WHY does MICROSOFFT keep making it harder and not easier? GOD help us all and may GOD help Microsoft find more people with common sense!!!!!!!!!!!!

            I complained they way they sent the email it self and how it was constructed - In VERY small letters at the bottom of the page was what I asked a question about one particular sentence&nbsp;- A LOT of information that NO normal person I know has the time to
 read, etc. Simple and to the point it was NOT - I have to blame my brain problems but it still could have done MUCH simpler and when trying to get helped being jerked around for an hour caused me personally so much frustration I can't describe it before I
 got an actual honest answer - WHY should ANYONE have to go through what I did regardless of my health problems - Excuse my rant but just maybe someone from Microsoft will take it seriously! I've used&nbsp; all Microsoft OS and email software, not counting other
 software programs&nbsp;as I was self-employed&nbsp;since my first computer MANY years ago - Their reps are all nice and try but taking an hour and sent to other reps and given wrong phone numbers, etc.&nbsp;to get a simple yes or no

            It's good to know even with all my health problems I'm not the only one that wondered what it was all about - I feel bad enough because of 4 brain treatments my cognitive skills are basically almost gone but It makes me SOOOOO frustrated and after ALL
 the time I spent on phone and on line even though setting at my computer for 10-15 minutes is my physical limit I found out this - DO NOTHING and everything remains the same as far as All you Microsoft product updates, etc. - Again I ask - WHY can't someone
 with common sense be in charge of composing emails that you don't need an IQ of over 130 to be able to understand! Sorry again for the rant!

            <p>I honestly don't know what you're complaining about.&nbsp; What is the "simple question" that you didn't get answered?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received the same email -- I imagine that everyone who posts in these "Microsoft Community" forums did as well, because to do so one must have an Microsoft account -- and it seems perfectly straight forward, with no small print at all.&nbsp; The statement about
 agreeing or cancelling was in the same font as the rest of the message.&nbsp; See the image below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes some sense to tell you what the changes are about before telling you that you need to accept them or leave.&nbsp; I can understand why you might prefer that notice at the top in bold, but that's a matter of style, not substance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, changes to Microsoft's terms of use with respect to its "Microsoft account" has nothing whatsoever to do with your banking, your insurance coverage, or your medical issues.&nbsp; It only applies to services from Microsoft.&nbsp; There's absolutely no
 reason that you need to use <strong>any</strong> of Microsoft's services -- but pretty much any other entity that provides similar services (e.g., email, "cloud" storage, Internet searching) will have similar "terms of service."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your email looked like the image posted by gchq_fox, then something is wrong with your email program, and you should ask for help with that in a forum concerned with whatever email program you use.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Searching the web I can see that the answer is driver 16.8.1.0 but this does not exist on my pc so I cannot rollback to it. I can't find it available anywhere on the web either.</p>

            <p>Hi Roberto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to update the driver software from the device manager and then check for the compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)Open Device manager<br />
2)Go to Network adapter<br />
3) Right-click on your Broadcom NetXtreme device<br />
4)Update Driver Software<br />
5)Brows my computer for driver software<br />
6)Let me pick from a list of device<br />
7)Broadcom Netxtreme 57xx Gigabit controller (Microsoft)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The problem is that when I do this there are no other drivers to select from. Odd I know, but nevertheless the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm looking to find where I can find other drivers so that I can do the procedure you describe. Any ideas?</p>

<br />
and here &lt;http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/replace-notepad-with-notepad2/&gt;<br />
<br />
and got all tangled up.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not sure if I have all of the permissions back in order. <br />
<br />
This is how they are now for the System32 folder: (Path) Computer&gt;Local Disk (C:)&gt;Windows&gt;System32&gt;rightclick Properties&gt;Security tab&gt;Advanced&gt;Owner tab&gt;Current owner&gt;User<br />
<br />
In the Change owner to(box): Trusted Installer is not listed. What is listed is Administrators (XXXX\Administrators) and User (XXXX).<br />
<br />
If I click on edit (I'm in the 'Advanced Security Settings for System32 box') a new box appears (the owners tab) that states "You can take or assign ownership of this object if you have the required permissions or privileges."<br />
<br />
Current owner. User(XX-X\XXX)<br />
<br />
A radio button below this area (Other users or groups) brings up a box entitled "Select User or Group", below that is "Select this object type:&nbsp; Clicking radio button 'Objects types' brings up another box that has 3 check boxes Built-in security principles,
 Groups, and Users:<br />
all three boxes are checked. Click cancel&gt;close that box out. Back to the 'Select User or Group' Type in Trusted Installer hit OK and a box with a red (warning) white X pops that states "An object (User,Group,or Built-in-security principal) with the following
 name cannot be found: "Trusted Installer". Check the selected object types and etc....... Close that box what the ____(?)<br />
<br />
I want to get all permissions back to default. I should have never messed with this until I was thoroughly skooled.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, I cannot get notepad++ to install and permissions for my Systems32 folder are all sideways.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Now please don't take offense, but I don't understand puteringlish, I'm just an old farm boy from the mid-west.<br />

<p>Hulu Does not show in my apps and features. Here is a screenshot showing location services are on.&nbsp; I think I accidentally clicked no when the popup came on to let this website track me. Now I want it to track me, but can't get it to. Is there a way to reverse
 that no? I have turned on location services in general and also for Edge which is the browser I am using. I did find Hulu somewhere in settings and turned it on, but still no luck.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unless your computer has a GPS chip, Windows has no idea where it's located. Instead, Windows can only guess where it is, based upon what it knows about how you are using your computer. Those guesses are often comically wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The better thing to do is to establish a default location for your computer, like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start menu -- Settings app -- Privacy -- Location -- Set default location</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if your computer moves around with you - if it's a laptop - Hulu only needs to know what country you're in.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like you have tried quite a few steps already, but I would recommend a full power down of the console followed up by a reboot as I don't see that listed yet, and many times this will resolve the issue :)</p>

<p>One thing it could be is a region lock. In order to download it, your account region would have to match your physical location and you would have to be in a region where the game is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is not the issue, you would want to contact support for a refund. There have been several people reporting the same issue lately. http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</p>

</p><p>I have a Toshiba satellite&nbsp;C50 series with windows 8.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have only had the laptop 3 weeks, I have not changed any settings that I know of until I encountered problems either.&nbsp; I have a wireless router what has this laptop, another laptop with vista, 2x mobile phones and sky hooked up to it all via wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is only this laptop&nbsp;has all of a sudden started to not recognise &nbsp;the wifi no matter what room im in, one minute it will be connected then all of a sudden not and then the router name will not appear in the wifi list, or it pops up then suddenly
 disappears, however if I can catch it before it gets again I can click connect and it does 1 of two things it either says can not establish a connection or flashes up as connected then I will loose visibility of the router name in the wifi list again.&nbsp; it
 has to be also noted that it will randomly connect to the wifi and everything is ok again for a while anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So a few things I have tried </p>
<p>
</p><p>turning wifi of and on again will sometimes randomly show the wifi name again but soon disapeers</p>
<p>turning flight mode on and off same as above</p>
<p>I have tried the ipconfig/flushdns</p>
<p>resetting the tcp/ip stack</p>
<p>disabling IPv6</p>
<p>resetting the router</p>
<p>direct cable (worked fine)</p>
<p>disconnecting all the other wifi connections (still didn't work)</p>
<p>stopped my laptop going into sleep mode still the same</p>
<p>all these did not work </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>now I don't mind the advanced settings so any help would be much appreciated, </p>

            <p>Hi Mikey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are able to connect through wired network there might be issue with wireless network drivers. Follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to install the latest wireless network drivers from Toshiba support site.
</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Follow the suggestion from this article. These steps can help if you can’t connect to Wi-Fi, you have limited connectivity, your connection signal is weak or drops intermittently, or you can’t find a network.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge locked.</h2>
                    <p>For two days when I click Microsoft EDGE, a window appears and says we are blocking you from connecting to the internet as you have a virus on your computer. &nbsp;Call Microsoft immediately at 855-356-0576. &nbsp;You cannot close the window, you have to shut off
 the computer and start again. &nbsp;I can use google chrome which I almost always do. &nbsp;This is the second time this has happened. &nbsp;I assume this is a scam, but it has me locked out of edge entirely. &nbsp;Someone help please. &nbsp;</p>

      For Edge:<br />
      <br />
      User Scott_Ki has provided this solution.<br />
      <br />
      ************************************************<br />
      <br />
      When this happened to me, I closed Microsoft Edge using the Task
      Manager.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Then in the search bar next to the Windows 10 logo on the bottom
      off the screen (I call it the "Cortana Search"), I typed in
      google.com and hit enter.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Microsoft Edge opened up with a new tab for Google.&nbsp; You can see
      the offending site still opens in a tab that doesn't have focus.&nbsp;
      Click the "X" to close Edge. Do not click on the offending site
      tab or it will get focus again.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When Edge closes nicely, it won't "Restore" the sessions and the
      offending site tab will be gone.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Pro, Windows 7 Pro WorkGroup C&#36; Access Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryan4264410  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro, Windows 7 Pro WorkGroup C&#36; Access Issues</h2>
                    My home network consists of two Windows 10 Pro PCs and a Windows 7 Pro PC. &nbsp;Prior to updating (11/27/15) the Windows 10 Pro PCs to Version 1511 (OS Build 10586.14) I was able to access the Windows 7 C$ share without being prompted for credentials. &nbsp;All
 PCs are in the same workgroup and the user accounts and passwords on each PC are identical. &nbsp;Now after updating the Windows 10 Pro PCs to&nbsp;Version 1511 (OS Build 10586.14) &nbsp;I can't connect to the Windows 7 Pro C$ share without entering credentials. &nbsp;Before
 the Windows 10 update I did not need to enter credentials. &nbsp;After I enter the credentials I can access C$ on the Windows 7 Pro PC. &nbsp;If I reboot the Windows 10 Pro PC I need to enter the credentials when accessing the Windows 7 Pro PC. &nbsp; I am thinking something
 changed on the Windows 10 Version 1511 (OS Build 10586.14) &nbsp;update since this was working. &nbsp;Any thoughts?

            I am not using the Home Group Feature. &nbsp;The post indicated I had just installed the most recent Windows 10 fixes which seems to be why the Work Group Sharing using C$ on the Windows 7 Pro PC quit working. &nbsp;This question is not about the use of Home Group.
 &nbsp;The reason I use C$ is to support some scripting.

<p>
</p><p>I'd like to upgrade my Toshiba Satellite s55-a5375 to Windows 10 Professional 64-bit. I want to make sure my programs are compatible since I use my computer for game design. I cannot get the Get Windows 10 icon to appear and have tried all of the ideas posted
 here. I also worked with a MS tech to get Windows 10 upgrade to appear in Windows Update. Is there a master program compatibility list or do I have to contact ALL of the developers? Yes, I have a lot of stuff on my computer. Help would be awesome. I've tried
 contacting MS support 3 times and have been disconnected 3 times. -_- Thanks!</p>

</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, emails, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords,
 custom dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

In this article, we take a look at backing up your files, specifically, we look at backing up manually. Recent versions of Windows include File History, which was introduced in Windows 8.0 in 2012 but based on my personal experience, it is not as thorough as Windows Easy Transfer which is no longer available or supported. A manual backup is also handy for migrating your personal files to a new PC or an important way to ensure your data is kept safe."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">How

<p>If we are discussing the Microsoft Store, Yes....mine still says "label created" &amp; as method it says "UPS Ground". And the console releases in 24 hours. I really hope everything is on track as I preordered this thing in June.</p>
<p>I just don't understand what the deal is with Microsoft Store order processing. For month's we had to stare at our X1 Day One confirmed preorders with a "backordered status". That finally goes away a week ago, and we are sent a tracking number and order
 confirmation email! Yeah! Now the tracking has been showing "UPS Ground, Label created awaiting pickup" as the shipping status for 6 days now!
</p>
<p>I am sure this has to do with a special arrangement they made with UPS to deliver these to certain areas on certain days and the consoles are sitting somewhere in specific region (1 day, 2 day, 3 day) holding paddocks. Just my guess.</p>

<p>They've successfully received the payment on Monday, so that has to count for something. There is one Depot near my house so it could be shipped tonight for tomorrow's release &amp; delivery.</p>

</p><p>1. What software are you trying to install?</p>
<p>2. What is the make and the model number of the computer?</p>
<p>3. Which build version of Windows 10 are you using?</p>
<p>4. Is your system connected to any domain network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can try a few steps and check if we can fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Fix problems that block programs from being installed or removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer this article on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17588/windows-fix-problems-that-block-programs-being-installed-or-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix problems that block programs from being installed or removed</a><span> to automatically repair issues that block you from installing or removing programs.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, follow method 2.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2: Perform a clean boot and try.</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering or not. Refer this article on
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>Note: Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality while in a clean boot environment, however that functionality will return
<p><span>If the issue persists, follow method 3.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3: Unregister and re-register the Windows Installer.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> together to open <strong>
Run</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type <strong>MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER</strong> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Open <strong>Run</strong> and type <strong>MSIEXEC /REGSERVER</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. It may look like nothing occurs. Try installing the software.</span></p>

<p>Uninstall it (and all other Apple products) using the Revi Uninstaller TRIAL version - make sure you do the extra/aggressive scan and reomve any leftovers it finds.</p>
<p>You can uninstall the trial afterwards - may even use the product to do so, ironically.</p>
<p>Restart the computer.</p>

<h2>            How to stop the W10 upgrade - Fix-It please</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft have produced this article - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3080351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3080351</a> to allow people with W7 and W8.1 to stop the&nbsp;forced/recommended change&nbsp;to W10 should they not want to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, whilst MS have produced all the instructions to manually allow you to stop the upgrade, there is no Fix-It in the article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems odd to me. It gives you the information to stop it, and then encourages possibly 'novice users' to edit the registry. When a simple Fix-It would circumnavigate this need and allow those who don't want W10 to stop it quickly, easily and safely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So please MS, do the complete job and give the article a Fix-It.</p>

    <title>Random text bug - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Random text bug</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've been having a problem for some months now with things happening to the text I write, first of all chunks of text disappearing on notepad after saving and adding new text, now I'm stuck with a bug that randomly causes extra letters or numbers to
 be written e.g. 2 becomes 22 or 3 might become 33, as well as adding keys next to the one&nbsp;I typed e.g. typing S or T &amp; getting SA and TR or two of the same letter or missing out letters, then other times it most usually misses out numbers e.g.&nbsp;this is what
 I'm getting right now&nbsp;right here if I go along the top row&nbsp;123457890, -you see it missed out the six, if I do it again&nbsp;1234567890 -that time it was fine but it keeps randomly&nbsp;missing out 6, 8 &amp; 9, sometimes 0&nbsp;then more rarely it does the opposite &amp; misses
 out earlier numbers such as&nbsp;2 or 3, one time it kept putting the letter o instead of 0 which&nbsp;proves its up to something strange,&nbsp;other times&nbsp;it keeps not responding when a number is pressed so it might take 8 presses for it to work &amp; then its fine again for
 a minute then does it all over again, it also happens with my right side number pad but happens with different numbers and happens much less often. The most worrying thing that makes you wonder if its a virus was once one day only&nbsp;when typing in a password
 it kept redirecting the text from the password box to the web address box as I typed a number in the password so before I noticed I had typed my password as the website address &amp; pressed enter meaning someone could potentially see it &amp; obtain it. As you can
 see its nothing to do with the keyboard &amp; it changes either every day or&nbsp;every few seconds doing different sets of bugs, then some days it hardly does it at all or different after re-starting.</p>

<p>Actually, that's clearly a keyboard issue, though exactly what's causing it and whether it's early symptoms of a hardware failure or instead a problem with supporting software such as drivers, some component of the operating system or other interference
 isn't as clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since keyboard contact scanning works across rows and columns, with groupings of several keys both across and angle wise (e.g. o and 0 in the same column) down the array, your descriptions fit these physical concepts precisely.&nbsp; That's why this is clearly
 somehow related to the keyboard, it's just&nbsp;not clear the true cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could also be something as simple as a modifier key like a Shift, Ctrl or Alt key causing flaky input, which could interfere with proper input, but by the description I would more suspect something within the array or keyboard scanning hardware beginning
 to fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've mostly had such issues due to liquids being spilled in the keyboard, which often occur days later as the sugars or other components of the liquid begin to dry and cause keys to stick.&nbsp; However, this again doesn't seem to explain issues with adjacent
 keys, since this typically results in problems with only the affected key(s) themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what seems most likely is either something metal physically moving around within the keyboard or as mentioned above early signs of a hardware failure randomly affecting only portions of the keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you didn't specify the type of PC, I'll just state that the easiest way to confirm this is to temporarily replace the keyboard with another, though with a laptop that may not always work, since the built-in keyboard might still interfere with an external
 one attached via USB.&nbsp; However, that's always worth a try as the quickest way to prove the problem is either physical or at least&nbsp;somehow related to the current keyboard device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, these problems almost never have anything to do with malware, though since they are supported by software including drivers and the operating system itself, flaky interactions with these by other software of any sort can contribute to such unexplained
 operation in rare cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd always try the simple explanation first though, since as hardware ages such problems can seem to come out of no where, even with hardware that up until that point had been rock solid in its operation.</p>

<p>Personally&nbsp;I would have said it was windows updates to blame but the thing is&nbsp;I never updated it before this happened and&nbsp;I have updates set to manual in my control. On the other hand I'm convinced some sort of updates are being forced onto my computer because
 for years now when theres windows updates it keeps turning off my antiviruses and hard drive space dissapears at the same time.<br />
This text problem is set up very much like a bug with rules to its patterns to you&nbsp;make you think something is wrong with the keyboard when its not. It will do one set of things a certain amount of times then go on to the next and keep changing but do certain
 things more than others. </p>
<p>Although I only mentioned this problem with the keyboard certain websites functions are becoming erratic along&nbsp;just like&nbsp;this keyboard thing. For example, postal buttons not working on specific websites, shop sites checkouts permananly never working, auction
 sites are some days only showing pictures for exactly 11 out of 200 lots. One day it was randomly changing the prices of listings I had changed and put them on other ones that I'd not even touched and every single day it shows the auction pictures in the wrong
 position intermittently. I checked on a fresh unused computer also with windows 7 up to date &amp; it also had the problem with the auction pictures in the wrong places which proves microsoft messing things up for that because I've contacted all these sites many
 times. Most of these bugs were mainly happening only on explorer and all of these bugs seem to be set to deliberately interfere with anything to do with money &amp; businesses.</p>

<p>Ok, I just tried a USB keyboard, so as&nbsp;the laptop&nbsp;had started doing the old pattern of not typing certain&nbsp;numbers unless you press it a certain amount of times (and I can&nbsp;guarantee you it is not a physical error causing it such as sticky keys) I was able
 to press those keys on the USB keyboard although it still doesn't mean much because I can press the same key on the right pad&nbsp;(unless they start going wrong as well) I did notice however that on the USB keyboard when filling in a password&nbsp;the text went from
 lowercase to capitals by itself without me touching it.</p>
<p>Something long-term&nbsp;is definitely interfering all round with&nbsp;my computer mostly on money /number related things, and its proven from where things don't work on explorer that its probably Microsoft behind all of this.</p>

<p>Before you claim there's no problem and its all to do with sticky keys from me dribbling on my keyboard or whatever and abandon my post after taking it out of the category I put it, how do you explain this too; when I go to said auction site where this bug
 tried to type my password into the address once&nbsp;I also&nbsp;sometimes get diversions after clicking absolutely nothing&nbsp;which takes the page to malicious sites claiming to be Microsoft ordering me to click on something to save the computer within x amount of seconds
 which is obviously trying to install something like ransomware. It only happens at their site and after contacting them many times they say its nothing to do with them &amp; they say&nbsp;everything that usually goes wrong is because explorer is dodgy &amp; useless.</p>
<p>I may not be an IT technician but I'm not an idiot, all these interferences are either being created by Microsoft to work on their&nbsp;systems &amp; explorer... or is it a virus? there's&nbsp;never&nbsp;anything actually&nbsp;wrong with this computer itself &amp; I can prove that
 by running Linux on it.</p>

<p>As I said its windows 7 &amp; its a laptop so the keyboard is on it, the make is irrelevant and I never said I had not been updating Windows, I said I had not done anything such as download the newest update when some of these things start happening&nbsp;but its
 always as if when I'm being pestered to download&nbsp;new updates someone's trying to make everything go wrong -such as Avira used to completely switch off years ago &amp; since I changed to Avast the behaviour shields turn off when I get new&nbsp;notifications of windows
 updates. Yes Service Pack 1 installed, yes Windows security is updated, yes I have MalwareBytes (&amp;&nbsp;it shouldn't be recommend because it steals the registry keys to paid for programs). I said already I use Explorer 11, I also test the webpages that are not
 working on other browsers where they usually do work. No I don't do peer-to-peer file sharing &amp; never have done on this computer.</p>
<p>After all that you say "If you're convinced that your system is infected, go to ONE of the following sites, read the "before you post" - No I wont, please don't tell me to go&nbsp;away on wild goose chases.&nbsp;I'll come here if I want to as Microsoft are to blame
 for explorer &amp; windows and I already searched the net for these problems</p>
<p>"And, finally, when you have some time, read through these articles:&nbsp; Answers to common security questions - Best Practices" -yeah, that's basic stuff anyone with common sense understands already.</p>
<p>Look here; is this ebay&nbsp;playing games&nbsp;with me or Microsoft? Its&nbsp;stacked&nbsp;towards Microsoft, I'm even getting popup warnings from Avast every time I sign into outlook.
</p>
<p>As I say even on completely different fresh computers explorer is messing up the same type of things that all seem to be linked to the overall sets of bugs.</p>

<p>So, rewind to the question I asked and read it properly and we are going through&nbsp;possible answers one by one (not just your opinion, because one persons claiming its not a virus &amp; your contradicting that telling me to go away to malware removal sites instead).
 Someone else with more knowledge might know the cause &amp; I have already searched the internet for answers &amp; cant find anything similar.</p>
<p>There is still some thing causing random patterns of text bugs. The last few days it has changed to omitting six, eight and nine a couple of times when testing it at the beginning of each start up, then afterwards working perfectly or randomly&nbsp;starts taking&nbsp;nine
 attempts to type&nbsp;one of those&nbsp;numbers.&nbsp;But as I&nbsp;say&nbsp;these patterns keep&nbsp;changing week to week.&nbsp;It seems to me personally more like a bug&nbsp;linked to other bugs designed to&nbsp;cause trouble&nbsp;rather than technical faults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been no problems occurring when testing the&nbsp;laptop &amp; keyboard booting up with Linux which eliminates the first suggestion that it may have been caused by physical fault. For the process of&nbsp;elimination&nbsp;to work&nbsp;I will require suggestions to be continued.</p>

<p>Personally, I don't think that the behavior you describe is related to malware.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had thought that it was a hardware problem of some sort, but if the symptoms don't appear when you are running Linux, then you're correct:&nbsp; it isn't hardware.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, you write that you have experienced similar symptoms on a "a fresh unused computer also with windows 7 up to date."&nbsp; For the sake of argument, I'll assume that the Windows 7 installation on this "fresh unused computer" was either pre-installed
 by the computer's manufacturer or was installed from different media than was used for your original computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that nothing was installed on the new computer but Windows, that would suggest that the problem is neither malware nor an interaction with some software that is installed on the original computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, now you've eliminated malware and any software you've installed on the original computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never come across symptoms like yours, either as a result of malware or Windows corruption.&nbsp; If your symptoms were somehow caused by Windows, surely there would be reports of others with similar symptoms.&nbsp; I've never seen any such reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any other ideas, but if you think that the problem is malware -- and it seems that you do -- my suggestion is that you go to one of the specialist forums I gave you so that experts in dealing with malware can give you a more definitive answer.</p>

                    <div>Hi new to the forum. I have a toshiba windows 7 laptop and when i turned it on today the laptop hasn't be able to get past the Windows Resume Loader and I dont know why. I looked up the question and saw others were able to fix the problem but they didn't
 leave any details on how they managed to fix it and also I am not really a computer knowledgeable person so if someone could list a step by step process on how to fix the problem that would be great, thanks.</div>

            The key to your problem might lie right here: "So when in doubt, shut it down :) and turn it on again (a techno phobics answer to everything)" and here: "'windows resume loader'". Shutting it down is fine but it has to be a proper shutdown. When you see
 the "Resume" message then you did not turn off the PC but you put it to sleep (=hibernation). To really turn it off, do one or all of the following:<br />
<ul>
<li>Press the power button for 10 seconds. </li><li>Unplug the power cord (if this is a desktop PC) </li><li>Remove the big battery (if this is a laptop) </li></ul>
<p>If this fails then a System Restore might fix the problem. Do you have a Windows installation DVD? A Windows Repair CD? If the answer is No to both questions then you<strong>must</strong> burn a Repair CD now! It's done via the Control Panel / Backup and
 Restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how I fixed it:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Connected my external USB DVD drive and booted the Windows 7 disc. You’ll also need a USB key with your BitLocker recovery key if you encrypt your drive.
</li><li>Access the recovery options and bring up Command Prompt. </li><li>You need to delete the hibernation data (<em>hiberfil.sys</em>). This is a protected file; however, and it is not easy to delete even at the administrative recovery command prompt. Change to the drive letter for your hard drive. You’ll then need to enter
 the following commands:<span><br />
<br />
<code><font>takeown /f hiberfil.sys<br />
icacls hiberfil.sys /reset<br />
attrib -h -s hiberfil.sys<br />
del hiberfil.sys</font></code></span><br />
<br />
(Those commands are necessary since by default even the administrative user doesn’t have access to modify the file).
<p>
</p></li><li>Reboot the machine. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The system will then boot normally (but without the hibernation data, it’s a cold boot, so you’ll lose anything you had running when the system originally hibernated)
</p>
<p />

<li>Settings Flyout </li><li>JavaScript Popups (Alert, Prompts etc)</li><li>Make a Web Note</li></ol>

<p>I click the THREE DOTS to access the settings flyout. It has basic settings. I then click the Settings Menu Item. Error is thrown, dwm.exe crash and restart. The Full Settings Menu is visible, but when I click, the buttons from Basic Settings are clicked
 instead, even though the Full Settings Flyout is visible. But this works okay if I use the TAB, SPACE and ARROWs to navigate between them.

            <p>Hello, I have exactly the same problem in my hp pavilion laptop with win 10 64 bits. I have nvidia graphics card GTX 960M (I don't know if it is important). But the problem occurs only with the microsoft edge window, no other window has any problem with
 menus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I click on the X to close multiple tabs, the screen goes black with a white square in the left upper part, wmd.exe crashes and screen recovers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed, the fly-out menu which apperas when I click on ... is unusable, clicking on settings crashes wmd.exe again, and then when I click in the options in menu it responds doing other thing: open page to print, goes to adblock, open a new inprivate window.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certainly this behaviour makes the browser almost unusable. I have tried firefox and it works perfect in my in 10 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you encountered any solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my account was the only account with Administrative privilege, I added new Local user account with Administrative rights, removed my Old account and then added it back again. It is working fine
 for many days now. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just be careful with your User data and settings</p>

<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile microsoft delivers a solution I will use your workaround, since it works in spite of funcionality is losen. Is it expected a fix for this or I will have to manage to fix the problem by my own?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why this problem occurs?, is it related to corrupted data in microsoft web browser?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I delete the cache in windows shop with command Wsreset, could I expect to solve the problem?, or it is not related?</p>

            <p>I was talking with Microsoft Support Representative for hours. Even they had my computer over Remote Sharing. They tried to Restore Health of the system. But the System showed OK.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then they said, I need to reinstall OS (Windows 10). I said NO. Then I tried User Account Remove and Add Way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason behind the problem is unknown.&nbsp;I logged the problem in the Windows Feedback (Insider Feedback). No response from Microsoft. Cannot say is it due to the Data Corruption in Edge, since Restoring Edge did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WSRESET will revalidate your App Installs/licenses, it did not help me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend to Remove and Add your user account. When doing so you get the option to Keep Your Data under user Profile. which you can manually copy back to new Fresh Account.</p>

<h2>            Registry change and cannot enter recovery console</h2>
                    <br />
Ok, I made some changes in the registry via the recovery console from windows xp recovery disk.<br />
When I was in the recovery console, I used these command <br />
<span><b><br />
<span><b><br />
cd \windows\system32\config<br />
ren system system.old<br />
cd \windows\repair<br />
copy system c:\windows\system32\config</b></span> <br />
<br />
And now, I have a multiboot, which consist of windows home edition and microsoft windows home edition.
<br />
<br />
When I boot the computer, I get this error:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
stop: c0000218 {registry file failure}<br />
The registry cannot load the hive (file):<br />
\systemroot\system32\config\software <br />
&nbsp;or its log or alternative.<br />
It is corrupt, absent, or not writable<br />
<br />
Before I had no problem getting into the recovery console because it had no password; Now, I can't get into the recovery console at all. It asks for the administrative password and I usually just push enter and I am in the recovery console but now When I push
 enter, it gives me: type the administrative password. I push enter three times and it reboots. I wanted to change the error in the recovery console but now It seems I can't. Is there anyway I can get around the Administrative password so I can use the recovery
 console? I have a lot of files in there that i need and I don't want to reinstall Windows xp.<br />
I have windows xp operating system on a dell inspiron 1300. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks<br />

            Why did you do that?<br />
<br />
What you ended up doing was copying the original registry CONFIG file from your original XP installation (there are 5 registry files) to your current configuration - never a good idea - so you need to undo it.<br />
<br />
Sure - try the "<i>I will never suggest it in my life</i>" KB307545 and see how far that gets you, but you can't login to the RC, that won't help you much will it.&nbsp; KB307545 has a place in the world but not here.<br />
<br />
What you should do it boot on a Hiren's Boot CD and put your old stuff back (since you know where it is), or you can use their Registry Restore Wizard - or see how you get in with trying KB307545,&nbsp; Maybe you will get lucky.<br />
<br />
I would start here:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
Like many third party programs you might install, the ImgBurn installation defaults to installing things you probably don't want installed on your system in the form of extra Internet browser toolbars or may make other adjustments to your browser.&nbsp; You don't
 want to install any of that so you have to pay attention during the installation.<br />
<br />
When clicking through the installation screens be sure to pay attention to the screens and always choose a Custom install and UNcheck the following (or any other things like it):<br />
<br />
UNcheck:<br />
<br />
Install the AVG toolbar and set AVG Secure Search as my default search provider<br />
Set AVG Secure Search as my homepage and newly opened tabs<br />
<br />
Choose custom installation again and UNcheck the following:<br />
<br />
Uncheck:<br />
Install QuickShare<br />
<br />
There could be other things too.<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
From Hiren's you could also browse you HDD and manually see if you can get through KB307545 file rename, delete, copy process, but that is alot of trouble and they already have a tool in there to do that for you.<br />
<br />
From the Hiren's HBCD Menu, choose Programs, Registry, Registry Restore Wizard and it will show you all your current System Restore Points (each RP has a copy of the registry for that RP). and go back to a day when you think your system was working okay.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Since the listed RPs are sorted by NUMBER and not by date, be careful to look at the dates of the RPs offered and not necessarily the number of the RP - so don't accidentally chose RP9 when you really need to choose RP90 - so be sure to pay attention to the
 dates.<br />
<br />
Unless you are absolutely 100% sure what you are doing, never choose "Original Installation Settings".<br />
<br />
Note that the Registry Restore Wizard is not equal to an XP System Restore.&nbsp; Only the XP registry is restored.<br />
<br />
You may start with the most recent Restore Point prior to the incident and if that doesn't work, go back to the next most recent one, etc. and keep your fingers crossed.<br />

Okay, I did what you ask. I still have the multi-boot and now, instead of the SOFTWARE error, I get a SAMerror, like this:<br />
<br />
stop: c0000218 {registry file failure}<br />
The registry cannot load the hive (file):<br />
\systemroot\system32\config\SAM <br />
&nbsp;or its log or alternative.<br />
It is corrupt, absent, or not writable<br />
<br />
How ever I can now get back into the recovery console.<br />
<br />
What do I do to recover fro the SAM issue and multiboot.<br />

<h2>            Condemned Criminal Origins xbox 360 backwards compatible. Elevator issue. </h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys, I'm playing Condemned Criminal Origins through backwards compatibility. I'm at the section in the library, where you find the crowbar in the server room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I head to the lift that the gang runs into.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I press the button to call the lift (elevator) the doors open, and the only option I get is to press the button to goto the basement . I press the button, and nothing happens. I've looked on YouTube at the same section of the game, and when they get in the
 elevator &nbsp;they get to press the button for the first floor. It's this something that I'm doing wrong, or is this an impassable bug in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards&nbsp;</p>

 So hold the Power button to force shut down. After 10-15 minutes, I press the power button and laptop open/start but screen remain black, No cursor or logo instead complete black. It was running windows 8.1 pro. I tried to follow the tutorial I find regarding
 this to solve the problem. I disconnected all the Plug and remove Battery. And Hold power Button for a minute. Remove and Place the RAM 2/3 times. Uninstall the Display driver so many time even With Display Driver Unstaller Software. Tried : netsh reset or
 something like that. Tried Advance Recovery Method. Tried to update BIOS. After all this, I then install a fresh copy of Windows 7 Ultimate 64Bit. Then Do all the necessary updates. Also tried the Above stuffs on Windows 7 also. 2 Weeks later, My Windows updated
 itself to Windows 10 Pro. I tried all the above stuffs again. But Failed. So I'm now connect a VGA cable with my Monitor to do my stuffs. Everything fine or as it is in Monitor display. By the way, I changed the Display Resolution Setting As per my Monitor
 Recommendation.<br />

So that's every details of the problem and my trial. Looking for a solution. Thanks<br />

    <title>Windows not displaying text in certain programs and task manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathanupchurch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows not displaying text in certain programs and task manager</h2>
                    <p>I'm on prerelease build 18272; the below happens sporadically. The issue often kicks off when I try to open excel. When this happens, when using the open / save as dialog, the icons have no text. Some desktop icons are missing text, and as you can see, the
 text is missing from the Adobe Acrobat tools window, the task manager, and excel. I would tell you what my GPU is, but neither devices or speccy are showing text, and I can't remember what it is. It's something like an nvidia 670m. I'm running an ASUS Zenbook
 Pro. I think I'll be pulling out of the prerelease program if even basic things like being able to display text can be compromised.

            HI.
<br />
<br />If your computer begins to feel buggy and you notice problems during boot, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) command-line utility to check the integrity and replace any corrupted or missing protected system files with a known good version.
<br />
<br />When SFC is unable to fix the problem, chances are the utility was unable to get the necessary files from the Windows image, which might have become broken. In this situation, you can use DISM to repair the Windows image (.wim), which then it will allow you to use the System File Checker to fix any issue with your Windows 10 installation.
