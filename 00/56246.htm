<h2>            Computer does not recognize printers</h2>
                    <p>Recently, my computer (using Windows 7) did not recognize any of my printers: HP LaserJet 1505 and HP Officejet Pro 8500 A909g. The problem was solved by rebooting the computer. Now that is no longer a solution. I tried restoring to an earlier date and that
 worked once. Is this problem a printer issue or a Windows problem? Any solutions?

            <p>Thank you. I went through the various fix-it solutions before contatcting the Community. I then re-installed the HP 1505 andnow both HP printers work properly.</p>

<h2>            Green Controlers</h2>
                    PlayStation just came out with a pretty neat "Alpine Green" controller and it made me want to make a green Xbox controller.&nbsp; There's the electric green and the military green but is anybody else in awe that we can't create a controller that's at least
 Xbox's primary green color?&nbsp; I don't like either of the two options that are provided and thought this would be an obvious color that's missing.

            Yea they should make a green like that that's already prefabricated. Maybe you can get that color in the xbox custom controller store.

            I'll disagree with the thoughts on the Alpine Green controller - I personally dislike it but each to their own.&nbsp; As for a green controller, Design Labs is a good place to start, but it'd be a great shout if they did a stock controller with the OG Xbox
 controller S see-through Xbox styling, that'd be sweet!

<p><span>Hi RedX11,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you said you have cleaned the skype for business cache, please make sure you have completely cleaned it, if not, please follow the steps below to have a try again:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a. Please sign out the skype for business and delete your sign-in information on the skype for business client and close your client.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>b. Navigate to<span>&nbsp;
</span>%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync<span>&nbsp;
</span>please delete the sip_ profile name folder.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>c. Delete all files in the Tracing folder, but don’t delete the Tracing folder itself.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Please restart your skype for business and check if it can make any difference.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, I noticed you said you have Eset Smart Security in your windows 10, please temporarily close it before you joining the skype calls and then check if the issue disappears. By the way, you can try to upgrade your
 office version and see if it can make any difference. If other office apps are available computer like outlook, word, please open it and navigate to File &gt; Office Account &gt; Update options and try to upgrade it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On another hand, if another computer is available for you now, please configure your skype for business account to another computer and then check if you got the same scenario as before. Please share the result with me to
 narrow down this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists on your computer after you tried the suggestions above, I’d like to collect some more information for further investigation:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The latest version of your skype for business client, please take a screenshot about it to me.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I wonder when you got kicked out from the skype for business calls, do you receive any error message? If so, please provide the full error message to me, I will do some more research for you, thanks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Oliver</span></p>

I installed windows vista on my pc but it was not working properly, so I installed it again.&nbsp; Now when my computer boots up it goes to windows boot manager where there are two window vista operating systems.&nbsp; The first one is OS(C) Data D, and the second one
 is OS(D) Data C.&nbsp; First, why does my computer go to the windows boot manager instead of going directly into windows vista.&nbsp; Secondly, how do I delete the windows vista version that I do not want, and get the one that I do want to go into window vista without
 going to the boot manager?

            <p>Hi BertieBarfield,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest way to remove an entry in the Windows Vista Boot Configuration is to use msconfig.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To launch msconfig:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Start</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the Search text box, type msconfig</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Launch msconfig by selecting it from the search results above the search text box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After system configuration is launched:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to the Boot tab</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select the boot entry you want to delete.</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the Delete button and then click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Make sure to be logged in to the Windows Vista partition you want to keep when performing these steps so you don't delete the good installation by
 mistake this will cause data loss. </p>

    <title>Java Won&#39;t Install- Windows 7 x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ahicks66  say:</h3>
<h2>            Java Won&#39;t Install- Windows 7 x64</h2>
                    <p>Greetings! I have stopped using my Windows 8.1 desktop computer because it is virtually useless -- and as such, I've had to rely on my Windows 7 laptop for everything. Sadly, my Windows 7 machine is being a nuisance as well...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Machine in question is a Sony Vaio laptop, model VPCEB47GM. It has an Intel i5 @ 2.67 GHz, 8 GB RAM, 64-bit machine running Windows 7 Professional x64 Service Pack 1. All Windows Updates are current, with weekly virus scans and twice-weekly malware scans.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine works flawlessly and has done so since Day One. Can't say enough good stuff about the hardware, and this machine was my first Win7 computer and it never crashes. Unfortunately, once Java reached Version 8, everything went down the toilet. NO
 version of Java 8 will install. Both the online and offline installers hang in the background. Neither 32 nor 64 bit builds will work. I have been unable to install Java ever since Version 8 first rolled out. I ignored it as a minor inconvenience at first,
 but since my Win8.1 box spends 50%+ of CPU cycles doing Windows Stuff in the background for months and I haven't been able to resolve that issue, I need to have my Win7 machine fully functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I need Java, you may ask? For one reason only: to play Minecraft. Minecraft's standalone executable ships with a stripped-down Java that runs properly through the installer, but gameplay is ridiculously slow (0-2 fps when playing, 8-12 fps when paused).
 This seems to be specifically a bottleneck with the onboard GPU, and the common workaround is to use a separate launcher and an optimization mod that has worked successfully until Java updated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a list of what I have tried up to this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Updates are current as of 10/26/16.</li><li>System File Checker (SFC) reports no problems.</li><li>Java 8 Release 111 online installer loads and hides dormant in the background using no CPU.</li><li>Java 8 Release 111 x86 offline installer loads and hides in the background doing nothing.</li><li>Java 8 Release 111 x64 offline installer does the same thing.</li><li>Creating a new user profile with Admin privileges did not help.</li><li>Performing a "Clean Boot" does not help.</li><li>"Run as Administrator" does not help.</li><li>Java support pages offer no help.</li><li>Java is not in the Control Panel.</li><li>Microsoft FixIt for programs that won't install/uninstall doesn't help either.</li></ul>
<p>If anyone can advise or suggest things I haven't tried, I would gladly give it a shot. Thank you in advance!</p>

            <p>I may have posted prematurely... I have just fixed the Java issue and both the x86 and x64 versions have installed successfully. I will post my solution below in the hopes that others can benefit from what I discovered!</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Perform a Clean Boot to an account with Administrator privileges.</li><li>Download <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Revo Uninstaller</a> and uninstall each program that uses Java. Delete all files and registry keys associated with the programs you are uninstalling.</li><li>Download&nbsp;<a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Piriform CCleaner</a> and delete all remaining registry keys that are associated with Java and Java-based programs (including all Minecraft-related programs like World
 Painter, etc).</li><li>Finally, download&nbsp;<a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/mcafee_consumer_product_removal_tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">McAfee Consumer Product Removal Tool 9.1.142.0</a> and uninstall any failed McAfee installations that were botched
 - apparently, in my case, un-checking the bundled McAfee junk in the online Java installer was ignored as McAfee was partially installed (I have never used McAfee on this machine and it was not bundled/pre-installed from Sony).</li><li>Reboot (Clean Boot)</li><li>Download the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Java Offline Installer Packages</a> from Oracle's website. In my case, since my PC is 64-bit, I downloaded the 32-bit
 version AND 64-bit versions.</li><li>Install the 32-bit version by right-clicking the executable (EXE) file and selecting "Install with Revo Uninstaller Pro" from the context menu. (Revo makes a log file of installations using this method, I used it merely for diagnostic purposes if it didn't
 work.)<br />
</li><li>After installation is complete and you have verified installation on Java's test page, install the 64-bit version the same way you did in #7 (only applies for 64-bit installations and even so, is optional).</li><li>Double-check Java is in the Control Panel, re-enable your normal startup programs, and enjoy!</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps everyone out. Some of the steps may have been unnecessary, but it worked for me. For all I know, it could have been the botched unwanted McAfee install that was the whole problem. I just tried a handful of possible solutions all at once!
 :-)</p>

    <title>How do I get round Windows 7&#39;s file permissions&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I get round Windows 7&#39;s file permissions&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
Just been trying out the Windows 7 RC,it appears that Microsoft have made the security system a bit too **** retentive.<br />
<br />
I've set Win7 up with me as the Administrator,I have the only user account on the operating system,so logically I should have Administrator<br />
Access to all files,okay,so last night I tried dragging files from one folder to another,I get a pop-up message saying that "I need Administrator Permissions to complete the task",or something like that,it asks me if I want to continue,I click on the "continue",and
 then I get a message saying<br />
"Access Denied",even though I am the Administrator,I go through the process of setting the file and folder permissions to give me access,everything looks good,then I try dragging the files again,with the exact same results,it seems like the Operating System
 is totally ignoring the settings.<br />
<br />
This is an absolute royal pain in the you-know-what to try and sort out in Windows 7,Windows XP is far more user friendly in this regard.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think Microsoft need to seriously rethink this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that,I am liking Windows 7,compatibility issues seem to be fixed,I can run XP software,some of my hardware only have drivers written for XP,but I seem to be able to use them,I couldn't do this in Vista.

<p>I too have been frustrated but here is&nbsp;how I am solving the problem after reading this forum.</p>
<p>Right click on folder and choose properties.</p>
<p>Choose security tab and click on advanced.</p>
<p>My permission choices indicate that "everyone" is in deny status.&nbsp; So I choose "change permissions" and remove everyone.</p>
<p>Then I select the Owner tab and click on "edit".&nbsp; My current owner shows SYSTEM as owner.&nbsp; I make the owner be my user account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I have access to the folder.</p>
<p>This is a very tedious process because you must go to&nbsp; the lowest level of folders and change them all.&nbsp; I have tried doing the highest folder in the hierachy but it does not change all the children folders.&nbsp; SO you must do make the changes folder by folder.&nbsp;
 Wish I had an easier way but I don't.&nbsp; I hope this process helps.</p>

            Have you tried adjusting the User Account Control settings to medium? Click Start, type UAC<br />
<br />
Also, which locations of the system are dragging files from? Are these personal or system files?&nbsp; Was this a upgrade or clean install?

            Try Handbrake. Its free, converts almost any format,&nbsp;and has presets for devices including the iPod. The software can be a little intimidating at first but its easy once you get the hang of it. It also has a tremendous amount of user control if you want
 to customize your videos.&nbsp; Video conversion takes a lot of processing power, meaning the faster the CPU, the faster to video conversion. A&nbsp;slower CPU will work. It'll just take a longer time, possibly longer than the video.&nbsp;

            Hi Trish.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Re-register the Settings menu from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If that's not enough go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />If that's not enough and you have other serious issues you can do a Repair Install:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-repair-windows-10-using-in-place-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-repair-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>I really don't know what's happening around and what sort of protection is being given to the OS. I have been using Windows 7 for years and had never faced&nbsp;this problem in it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A week ago when I visit some sites, I was redirected to <a href="http://play.leadzupc.com/?m=0AYEMAINSTREAM916&amp;a=6429617693405480977&amp;pubid=3304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>etc... etccc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found that it was a Browser Hijack and gone through the solutions offered to remove it. I can see no extensions&nbsp;installed in&nbsp;Edge / Chrome / Safari. But all the browsers behaved in the same fashion.&nbsp; I looked for unknown software installs and found none.
 Without luck, I cleaned up my hard disk, re-installed windows 10, downloaded 4GB TON of updates and got it alright.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 5 days since the last re-install, today I can see that coming up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I supposed to do? Reinstall again? or Wait for a patch ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: I haven't installed or used any 3rd party software / cracks etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Wishes for your Efforts to Fix it</p>

            Hi The
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />For clean install, you can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<p>Hello The Pool Commish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you like, you could reset Windows 10 using the method in the tutorial below. It will wipe everything and reset Windows 10 back to default.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4130-reset-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4130-reset-windows-10-a.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unable to reset, you could do a clean install instead.</p>

            Hi The
<br />
<br />That screenshot is of a folder on your hard drive with the files form a Windows 10 installation USB plus a couple more, you will not be able to use those, because you need to create a bootable USB installation flash drive and you cannot do that with those files . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 Pro at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Pro) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>Windows 1709 update replaced user account settings, apps, etc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heedy-l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 1709 update replaced user account settings, apps, etc</h2>
                    <p>It seems to have generated a new user account in place of my old one, maybe because I have the OS on C:\ and most files on D:\ ?? I can login to the laptop without problems but
<strong>none of my settings, apps, logins etc are there</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I navigate C:\Users there are two listed (above public) when there should only be one</p>
<p>example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laptop</li><li>Laptop.Name-Brand</li></ul>
<p>One is my user name "Laptop" while the other combines my user name with the computers name "Name-Brand"</p>
<p><strong>C:\Users\Laptop</strong> does not contain a \desktop folder or music, pictures, videos but the \downloads folder links to the right location because its within the C:\ drive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>C:\Users\Laptop.Name-Brand</strong> contains all the expected folders but they are all empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I navigate to D:\ there is one folder with my user name and one program files folder containing a single programs information.</p>
<p><strong>D:\Laptop</strong> contains the 4 folders missing from <strong>C:\Users\Laptop</strong> (desktop, music, pictures, video) with all the files in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open file explorer and click on the Downloads quick access link the folder is empty, so I can assume that the update created this Laptop.Name-Brand account folder for whatever reason and that is the one my Microsoft account logs into. While I could
 copy the folders into this one and recreate my desktop shortcuts it doesnt solve the problem of my settings or missing apps and login accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have access to the store, mail app, twitter etc even when searching for them directly. The programs I downloaded do not appear in the directory at all - as if they were never installed. When opening the start menu, the right panel is spaced as if
 my usual tiles were still there but only actually has the Microsoft office apps. I cannot preform a recovery as it asks me to remove my Microsoft account via
<em>Settings&gt;Accounts&gt;Other People</em> despite the fact this is the only account on the laptop. There<em> is
</em>a Windows.old folder in the C:\ drive created yesterday when I ran this update ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not encounter an error message during or after installing, when I check the update history this is the name of the one I installed:</p>
<p><em>Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems (KB4041994)</em></p>
<p>There is no further history listed, probably all because this older information is within my
<em>real</em> user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I force my system to use the proper user account folders and remove this blank useless "Laptop.Name-Brand" account file? I can only assume doing that will return the functionality of my apps, logins etc. I did notice when I restarted my laptop again
 today that the Netflix app along with 3 other basic apps have returned, but this was after several restarts yesterday (including an attempt to uninstall the update which didnt work because the system just reinstalls it again anyway) so I dont think restarting
 it every few hours is going to solve my problem either.</p>

            Better hurry up Microsoft, this is not a sole case, it has being occurring to me in 3 different computers, I believe it started with build 16273, and by the time MS updated to 17010 I had so many different accounts, I did a clean install to one of my laptops<br />
and decided to go again with Windows Insider Program, to find that the latest update did the same thing (17025), very frustrating and still no answers by MS, at least to my best of knowledge.

            Same problem here. 3 different computers with the same issue after this update. The real problem is that it messed up the work computers. All the files moved to a different account, all the software need to be reactivated again, completely mess.

            Hi Robert,<br />
<br />
The original poster provided several concerns, we would like to know if you are experiencing the same exact issue. If possible, can you provide the complete description of your concern so we can provide the best solution to you?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, you may perform a clean boot. A <strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. Check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and follow the steps under How to perform a clean boot.<br />
<br />
We'll keep an eye out for your response.

<p>(My English not good, hoping you'll understand)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem like you, after searched in the internet, i found a solution here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Insider-Program/Windows-10-Version-1709-KB4041994-User-settings-Issue/td-p/112788</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copy here for you:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
"""" From your desktop, type cmd in Windows search box, right click on “Command Prompt” from result, and select Run as administrator option.<br />
#1. Type the comand below in Command Prompt:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<code>wmic useraccount get name,SID</code></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
and press Enter to execute it.<br />
#2. It will list all of the username and its SID. Find your old account, and make note of the SID which is next to the name. For example, the SID of my old account is S-1-5-21-237214570-1361833723-</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Press&nbsp;<strong>Win + R</strong>&nbsp;from your keyboard, type&nbsp;<strong>regedit</strong>&nbsp;in Run box, and click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;button to open Registry Editor.<br />
#3. Navigate to the location in the left side:</p>
<div style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<pre>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\</pre>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Under the&nbsp;<strong>ProfileList</strong>&nbsp;folder, click on the the actual SID which you have noted in the above step.<br />
#4. Go to its right side pane, double click/tap on the&nbsp;<strong>ProfileImagePath</strong>&nbsp;string.<br />
* Its value data is the original full path and name. Make note of the full location like C:\Users\original-username. Then change original-username to the new name for your current account, and click OK button to save all. """"</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I followed to the step #4 and i edited the link in&nbsp;<strong>ProfileImagePath&nbsp;</strong>to correct&nbsp; with my old user file.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
For ex:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
My old user file: C:\Users\Nghia</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
My NEW user file that Win10 1709 created:&nbsp;C:\Users\Nghia.MRWINDY</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
So, in step #4, I changed the link from NEW to OLD (I erased text ".MRWINDY") and then i close all of them ==&gt; sign out and log in again ==&gt; IT'S WORKED, I'M SO HAPPY NOW, HOPING YOU CAN FIX YOU PROBLEM.</p>

<p>Thanks BR/Nghia Vo for passing along that advice</p>
<p>
</p><p>This saved my bacon. Was worried I'd have to copy paste everything from old account folder to new one.</p>

<p>Same issue here.&nbsp; My main computer has been unusable now for over three months because of this update mess.&nbsp; I'm not a techie and have no idea what to do to return my old desktop so I can use this PC again.&nbsp; I have searched and located the old desktop file,
 but have no idea how to retrieve it.&nbsp; The update changed no only my old account's interface, but created a new account as with the above complainant.&nbsp; While I was able to get rid of that new account, which not only gave me a brand new blank desktop, but removed
 all my numerous applications' shortcuts so can't use them anymore.&nbsp; My mail client, Thunderbird, also disappeared and had in install a new copy on the new user account, but now I have two Thunderbirds on this SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is a SIMPLE way of getting back to where things were before the catastrophic update fiasco?&nbsp; I tried to do a system restore, but it had no dates to before this last update to which I could move back, even though the computer used to have a number of
 dates prior to the update in December of 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, there must be many others in this predicament.&nbsp; Cannot understand why MS doesn't check these new updates out before sending them into the field without such serious bugs.&nbsp; I have a lot of my money tied up in this machine, which was rendered, literally,

<p>BTW: The 1709 update fiasco must have given me TWO new accounts, because I removed one of them, yet my old desktop did not return, leaving me with this blank one as in the new account I just deleted.&nbsp; Also, my motherboard company keeps flagging me to register
 the "new" motherboard, even though it was registered some five years ago when I first built this PC, so this machine is behaving as though everything is brand new on it!&nbsp; AND - one of the new accounts cannot be removed, since it won't even let me highlight
 or select it for removal?</p>

<p>Hopefully you did not delete your main account and it is still somewhere there.</p>
<p>The answer from Nghia Vo earlier in the thread should resolve your problem in most cases.&nbsp; Only delete an account after you have fixed your problem, simply deleting the offending account will not fix the issue.&nbsp; It also provides you with a framework if you
 end up having to copy between the two accounts</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found that if I simply forced a log-on to the old account, still there but slightly different from the new one I was back where I started - another PC and another time. Needed to go into mail box and user accounts&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Update Caused Typing Issues &#40;Jumping cursor...moves my text to another line while typing&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>I have had this Laptop (HP Pavillion dv2550se, Vista Home Premium,&nbsp;Intel Centrino) since Jul07,&nbsp;and I absolutely love it.&nbsp; I have had Dell Inspiron, and IBMs in the past, and this HP is by far my favorite between the 3.&nbsp; I have had only&nbsp;a couple&nbsp;minor
 issues with it though, and my first issue started in Nov08.&nbsp; It was the most aggravating problem too&nbsp;-&nbsp;
<b><span>the jumping cursor issue while I am typing.</span></b>&nbsp;<i><span> I have the touchpad, and i'm not the type who "accidently" hits the touchpad while typing, so get that out of your head
</span></i></span><i><span>J</span></i><span>&nbsp; I consider myself a fairly experienced computer user, and used to assist in IT support (very light support!!)&nbsp;at a previous job.&nbsp;
<span>I first had this same exact&nbsp;cursor problem in Nov08, and after many restless evenings, it ended up being that the&nbsp;the
<span>I first had this same exact&nbsp;cursor problem in Nov08, and after many restless evenings, it ended up being that the&nbsp;the
<b><span>Intel Matrix Storage Manager </span></b><b><span>(iata86env.exe)</span></b> driver had to be updated.&nbsp;
<b><span>It fixed the problem in Nov 08</span></b>, no more jumping cursor.&nbsp; YAY!&nbsp; I was so relieved.&nbsp;
</span>Now, 4 months later, the jumping cursor is back.<span><br />
</span><br />
The jumping cursor (for lack of a better description) makes your computer automatically click somewhere else on your page.&nbsp; On internet pages and while i'm typing in ANY program (Outlook, Word, Yahoo Email, etc.)&nbsp; It will move my cursor/typing randomly to a
 different paragraph or line and continue with typing my&nbsp;text&nbsp;in that area instead of the line where I was originally typing.&nbsp; It's the most frustrating thing, because if you're a fast typer like me :)&nbsp; you don't always need to look at your typing because you
 type super fast and have minimal typos.&nbsp; BUT because this thing just decides to occur at random times every 5-10 words or so, you have to constantly "find" where the cursor moved you too (back to the beginning of that sentence or to another paragraph on that
 page), then delete the text you just added, click back to where you originally were, and start over again.&nbsp; It's an endless cycle.&nbsp; A nightmare.<br />
<br />
<b><span>Anyway, fast forward to this week and it started happening again.</span></b>&nbsp; I just figured I needed to update the Intel Storage Manager driver again, and so I did to their most current version 8.7.&nbsp; But this time it didn't fix the issue.&nbsp; I did every
 possible driver update and software update&nbsp;you can imagine (Intel's website, HP's website, Windows website, Trend Micro scans, etc).&nbsp; Spent maybe&nbsp;12+ hours on this darn thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I then saw an Intel support page listing known issues with Vista and Intel Storage
 Manager (posting was dated like last year or something) and it recommended using an&nbsp;<u>older</u> Intel Storage Manager driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I decided to roll back my updated driver on Intel Storage Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows didn't list that as an option on my driver properties
 (it was greyed out), so I went to intel's page to find the previous driver that I installed in Nov&nbsp;(iata86env.exe) and they didn't even have that one listed.&nbsp; Anyway, so I used the restore point vista created a couple days ago&nbsp;from when&nbsp;I updated my Intel
 Storage Manager Driver, and that still didn't correct the issue.<br />
<br />
<u>I ONLY finally corrected this week’s&nbsp;issue when I ROLLED back to my restore point&nbsp;created&nbsp;just PRIOR TO
</u><b><span>WINDOWS</span></b> LAST AUTOMATIC UPDATE on <b><span>2/28/09</span></b>.&nbsp; I then disabled my automatic windows updates preventing future downloads and updates.&nbsp; I would like to stay current with my windows updates though but am not interested in
 going through the jumping cursor problem again.&nbsp; Does anyone know what was specifically updated with windows update on or around 2/28/09 that would cause this issue?&nbsp; I’m not willing to do future Windows updates until I know this can be resolved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks so much!! </span></p>

            I don't know if this will help anybody, but so far so good with me.&nbsp; My husband just reinstalled vista after wiping my hard drive.&nbsp; I have a dell inspiron 1501 laptop that's always worked just fine until this weekend when we reinstalled the vista.&nbsp; Now
 i've had the cursor thing going too and it's driving me nuts!&nbsp; I just found this online at another site.&nbsp; Tried it and it's working.&nbsp; Nothing's jumped in the last two emails I've typed or this message!<br />
<br />
- also, try Control Panel -&gt; Mouse -&gt; Pointer Options -&gt; and uncheck "hide pointer while typing"<br />
<br />
What I did was go there and uncheck everything in a box.&nbsp; Now we seem back to normal!<br />
<br />
Hope it helps!

            Hi ang0620k,<br />
<br />
Since you have a good restore point to return to, you could try loading the updates one at a time and reboot between each one.&nbsp; That would identify the culprit.&nbsp; Do a custom install with Windows update and it will list what is pending.&nbsp; Also keep an eye out
 for driver updates that may be trying come down also.<br />

<h2>            How do I bypass Windows Anytime Upgrade to do an upgrade with a prepurchased version of Win 7 Pro.</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop win Win 7 Home on it&nbsp;and I purchased a DVD with Win&nbsp;7 Pro, yet when I try and do an upgrade, I'm told to use the
<em>"Windows Anytime Upgrade"</em> that's installed on the laptop.&nbsp; My choices there are to purchase Win 7 Pro or Ultimate OR to enter my license key from a purchase.&nbsp; The license key that came with the DVD I bought does not work (even though it is a good key)
 with "<em>Windows Anytime Upgrade"</em>!&nbsp; I can install (I know, I've tried) the full version of Win 7 Pro from the DVD but that's a disaster because then I have to reinstall everything else again (programns,, drivers, etc.).</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!</p>

            Because when you are using volume license media, Windows 7 Home Premium cannot be used as a qualifying product. In fact, if you reimaging computers with Windows 7 KMS or MAK licenses, the PC must either have Windows 7 Professional OR Ultimate OEM/Full
 Retail installed to qualify to use the volume license Windows 7. Volume License versions of Windows 7 are upgrades, not full versions.
<br />
<br />
Try this work around. If you have access to a Windows 7 Professional retail upgrade or full version retail key, use it for Anytime Upgrade on the laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium, don't activate.
<br />
<br />
When the Anytime Upgrade completes, convert the license to KMS or MAK using the following method:<br />
<br />
Click Start, type: CMD<br />
Right click CMD<br />
Click Run as administrator<br />
At the command prompt, type the following:<br />
<br />
slmgr -ipk xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx (allows you to replace the current product key with the specified)<br />
<br />
Press Enter on your keyboard<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt, restart the system, attempt activation through KMS server which should be done automatically or normal Internet Activation if you used the MAK key.<br />
<br />
If you used KMS, please note, you must meet the thresh hold of 25 machines, if you use MAK, and activation is not work, open the command prompt with Admin privileges and try the following:<br />
<br />
slmgr -ato<br />
<br />
this will force activation, you can try it if you used KMS. <br />

            <p>Hi Jundi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome Microsoft Community and we are happy to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the description of this issue, it looks like you are unable to access “Your acconts” in Windows Store as you get an error message asking you to sign in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would ask few questions to get a clear picture on this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
2) Is this issue specific to a particular app?</p>
<p>3) What is the exact error message that you get whne you try to&nbsp;install the apps?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check with app troubleshooter and then try to update the game:</p>
<p><br />
“<strong>What to do if you have problems with an app</strong>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on “<strong>Apps Troubleshooter</strong>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a>
</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will suggest you to check for sync the game app licenses with your PC. Please refer to the link below and look for the section” Sync the app license”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<strong>What to do if you have problems with an app</strong>”</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the methods above do not help, perhaps, deleting Windows Store cache memory might resolve the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to clear Windows Store cache and then try to access “Your apps”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow the steps below to clear Windows Store cache memory:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) On the desktop screen, press <strong>Windows and r</strong> key to open run box.<br />
</p>
<p>b) Type <strong>WSReset.exe </strong>and hit enter.</p>

    <title>Have to run game as administrator which causes my logitech setpoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrlarkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Have to run game as administrator which causes my logitech setpoint software to not respond.</h2>
                    Ok, there are some games that I can only play if I run them as administrator.&nbsp; I'd like to be able to just run them with no problems.&nbsp; Second, when I do play my games (run as admin) my Setpoint software for my Logitech G5 mouse stops working and my settings
 for my mouse don't work as they are supposed to in Setpoint.&nbsp; I also use Ventrilo voice server to communicate with my friends, which complicates things more.&nbsp; I have found the following will work, but it is RIDICULOUS that I have to go about it this way.<br />
1] run game as administrator, then alt-tab out to desktop.<br />
2] run ventrilo as administrator, then alt-tab out to desktop.<br />
3] then run setpoint as administrator, then alt-tab&nbsp;back to game.<br />
everything works as it did before in winxp at this point.&nbsp; but it is insane that I must do this if i want to play my games!&nbsp; First, i don't understand why i have to run the games as administrator all the time...I completely trust my games.&nbsp; Secondly, Setpoint
 loads when windows7 starts, so when I want to play my game, I have to close setpoint, and follow the process listed above.<br />
<br />
Help!

            Yes that is the right thing to do for Windows 7. The step 2 described by Shinmila H. is for Windows Vista. UAC has changed and the "Use User Access Control (UAC) to help protect your computer" option does not exist anymore in 7.<br />
<br />
Also if you'd like to keep UAC on, you might be able to get around your problem by switching the Setpoint utility and Ventrilo to Administrator mode automatically.<br />
<br />
1) Open the Start menu, click on All Programs, go to the Startup folder to locate the Logitech Setpoint shortcut<br />
<br />
2) Right click on the shortcut then on Properties and go to the compatibility tab then check the box "Run as administrator".<br />
<br />
3) Locate your Ventrilo shortcut or executable and do the same (right-click==&gt; compatibility==&gt; Run as administrator).<br />
<br />
3) Restore UAC back by switching the slider up one or two notches then restart the computer and check if everything works<br />
<br />
My guess is that any game you run in administrator mode will refuse the input coming from any software that does not have the same privileges. The tip above works for me with Setpoint but I'm not sure about Ventrilo (not using it).
<br />
<br />
Step 2 and 3 above will just perform automatically what you perform by ALT-Tabbing to desktop.<br />
<br />
Otherwise if you don't care at all about having UAC on, just keep it disabled.

                    <p>Microsoft sent out an update for windows 10 about a week ago since then&nbsp;I have had nothing but problems.&nbsp;The upper numbers 1 thru 4 and my space bar quit working so I &nbsp;contacted Microsoft and they tried to update my laptop again and we spent over 4 hrs.
 working on this problem to only have it not work in the end. I finally had to contact Toshiba, pay them $150.00 and they repaired the issue that had been caused by Microsoft in the first place.
</p>
<p>This is a well documented issue that Microsoft has been having.</p>
<p>I think that Microsoft should refund the cost of my repairs or anyone else that has had the same issue due to their mistake.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one controller modification for disability </h2>
                    I'm a xbox 360 player with some disabled fingers on my left hand-they don't respond quickly or with much strength. On my xbox 360 controller, I had a guy from eBay mod a 360 controller for me that added a cap(button) on the inner right handle that allows
 my right ring finger to fire my left trigger button. I was hoping and praying he could do the same-add and extra button to the inner right handle where my right ring finger rests to fire LT and if possible one where my right middle finger rests to fire LB(
 or the two could be switched in what they fire). The guy tells me this extremely distressing news, "Hey, just an update... saw a new video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG0L_xJfFro) which gives a really nice view of the inside of the XBox One controller.
 The good news is, they are indeed going with a PCB design instead of a thin film design, so that's a definite plus. Unfortunately, we get a really good look at the new triggers around the 3:15 mark and they've done away with all the

<p>I had this done as well for just swapping the left and right triggers and analog sticks. Wish I would have gotten the extra button put in for using melee though. It's hard for my right hand to push down on the right analog click.</p>
