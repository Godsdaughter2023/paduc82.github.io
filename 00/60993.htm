<h2>            Higher Gamerscore</h2>
                    
<p>I'm just wondering how all of you got SOOOOOOOO high gamerscores!? Like I've seen some guys(and girls) who have like a MILLION gamerscore. I think&nbsp;it is because they play more games but still!!! I don't have a Windows phone so that doesn't help either!!
 Please give me some tips on how to raise my gamerscore!</p>
<p>zanedrummerdx</p>
<p>PS. Don't recomend games rated Mature, too young to play them:)</p>

<p>Hi zanedrummerdx. As you can see, My score is pretty low as well. In my freetime, I love working on my gamerscore, So I know where your coming from. Anyway, I have found that by having a play schedule, Like play AT LEAST 3 hrs. during weekdays, And 7 or
 8 on Saturdays [ I don't play on Sundays] I can unlock acheivements fairly regularily. Like the person before my said, I really only play to enjoy the game, The story, Characters and weapons etc. So plugging away regularily on your games and gamerscore is
 probably the only "Legal" Way of doing this. </p>

<p>Well Paradigm As I do want easy achivments, I do enjoy actully playing the games althouth I want to prove that I'm good at playing the games but achivments and gamerscore are kinda inportant to me.</p>

    <title>MMORPG - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arkham99  say:</h3>
<h2>            MMORPG</h2>
                    
<p>I know that this topic has come up before, but as I've been making the transition back to PC Gaming this summer (sorry, but ONE's not for me) I can't stop wondering about how excellent a MASS Effect MMORPG would be.&nbsp; I've dabbled with 'Star Wars : The Old
 Republic's MMORPG recently, which BioWare did an absolutely bang-up job on, but all the time playing it I still keep thinking "man, if this was only MASS Effect".&nbsp; Alot of the groundwork is all ready there for the first&nbsp;trilogy was ported for PC, the Universe
 has grown to the point where they could please every player here, whether its the Explorer, Shooter or perhaps, most importantly, the Role Players from whom this series was built from.&nbsp; 'StarTrekOnline's very successful MMORPG continues to turn in profits
 which fuel very regular additions (such as May 2013's 'The Legacy of Romulus')&nbsp;to a true&nbsp;Cadillac of MMORPGs, they even use EA's much hated "gambling" system of 'Lock Box Keys' to which you hope for "ultra-rare" items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'SWTOR' hasn't quite measured up to expectations commercially (I believe that the servers for Australia were shut down earlier this year), but had they poured their creative juices (and financial resources) that they did for 'SWTOR' into a MASS Effect MMORPG,
 I think that the results could've been much different.&nbsp; I never played the first two 'Old Republic' games and so wasn't all that interested in 'SWTOR's MMORPG, I love 'Star Wars' but the series has kinda drifted from me over the years and one of the reasons
 is the oversaturation of "Spin-Offs" that have turned up.&nbsp; Many were disappointed upon completion of the MASS Effect trilogy, and for a number of different reasons.&nbsp; How many complained about the lack of exploration after the first game?&nbsp; How many expressed
 disappointment&nbsp;at not being able to visit the Elcor &amp; Hanar/Drell homeworlds?&nbsp; Customizing our characters in ME3's Multiplayer was one of its great charms, but they really only allowed us to get our toes wet here&nbsp;for the detailed customizable options of a
 good MMORPG menu could make&nbsp;EVERY character look truly unique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playing both 'SWTOR' &amp; 'STO' recently has been most refreshing, the community is for the most part completely focused on playing "in-character" and the chat rarely has strayed away from the game like it does so many times when playing XBOXLive's MP games.&nbsp;
 If&nbsp;BioWare were to commit long term to this direction, I see nothing but positives ahead, opportunities for their young up and coming developers to "experiment" with smaller assignments that contribute, and the best stuff always comes from the young and very
 eager to please.&nbsp; ME3 made a fortune from 'Packs' during its heyday, I see no reason why a MMORPG couldn't do the same, all they need to do is simply expand on the universe that's all ready there, let us actually&nbsp;command one of those massive Turian ships from
 a detailed bridge instead of just viewing it in a cutscene or artbook, y'know it's probably just as well that they don't do this for I wouldn't get anything else done in life...:-)</p>

<p>I think anything that is different would not be accepted by the ME community. Taking ME in a different direction may be cool in theory but it wouldnt really be ME anymore. I suppose I would have to see it before I would be sold on this idea. Plus the market
 will be flooded &nbsp;with massive multiplayer games. I would hate for ME to become just another victim of a trend.</p>

<p>Mass Effect has the potential for being a good MMO but if a huge franchise like Star Wars is forced into Free to Play so quickly it is unlikely that ME could manage any better.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>BAD2020 is spot on. The MMO market on the PC is flooded at the moment and it requires something truly special to make a mark. With Mass Effect's main pull being the strong main story, I'm not sure how they could bring the MMO sensibility to that.</p>

<p>Edit: If you are getting back into PC gaming then check out the latest Humble Bundle
<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.humblebundle.com/</a>. It's from EA and you can get eight great games for as little as $5, including titles such as Battlefield 3 and Dead Space 3.</p>

<p>I've come across some pretty good deals on the PC lately, but that Bundle is up there for sure.&nbsp; One of the reasons the market is flooded at the moment is that there's a ton of money to be made from a really well done MMORPG, and there's a few reasons why
 'SWTOR' "failed" that BioWare themselves are certainly aware of.&nbsp; Firstly, the membership prices at launch were some of the most ridiculous that I've ever encountered, it's no wonder that the game eventually turned into 'Free-To-Play' for NOBODY was gonna
 bite at that price, no matter how good the game was, it was simply out of reach.&nbsp; Secondly, as I hit on briefly earlier, Star Wars has branched off into so many different directions that only the die-hards will pour cash into 'TOR', they've repeated themselves
 several times over&nbsp;to a demographic that is built from the movies, not the video games.&nbsp; If it were to ever work for MASS Effect, they need to learn from the mistakes made with marketing 'TOR' and COMMIT to the project long term.&nbsp; The market, as saturated
 as it is, could work for ME should they support the game regularly with community events and new add-ons, this is why 'StarTrekOnline' has had such a long run and is in better fiscal shape than ever, there's no doubt that a sizeable investment would be required
 to get&nbsp;ME off the ground but the results could be magnificent, BioWare did a splendid job on crafting 'SWTOR's MMORPG and that experience could definitely benefit the MASS Effect universe...:-)</p>

<p>Also one of the biggest problems with SWTOR is that there is NO Endgame content. When a MMO goes F2P as fast as SWTOR did, it's dying. Even World of Warcraft, which dominated the MMO scene for some time, has now gone F2P and it's numbers have dropped from
 around 10 million to about 6 million. The only MMO I'm waiting for, comes out in 11 days and that's been tailored from the ground up to be a subscription based MMO as well as for the casual gamer (I've been in the beta for awhile and it IS worth it).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A MMO based off of ME... that's been asked numerous times in the past on the BSN (and other forums) and has always degenerated into a flamefest etc. Honestly, I don't think it'd work well if at all, due to how heavy story wise it'd be... yet, so far this
 MMO I'm waiting for (based off of what I've played so far) DOES seem to work. If that succeeds which I honestly see no reason why it shouldn't, then PERHAPS a ME MMO 'could' work..</p>

<p>Wasnt it you that said and I quote "If it aint broke dont fix it"?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Sure, I've used that cliche many times before, but I'm not sure how it applies here.&nbsp; I'm not saying that they should abandon their NextGen plans for MASS Effect and throw everything into a MMORPG, but if they're gonna continue to expand their horizons as
 they have in recent years, such as that App thing they tried, I'm just saying that there's a lot of potential here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone can try out the 'Free-To-Play' 'SWTOR' MMORPG, as long as their PC can run it (another one of its faults is that many CAN'T run it)
 and easily imagine an ME counterpart of its calibre made by the same developers, I'm not saying that MASS Effect is broken at all, even with the "original endings"...:-)</p>

<p>You can make a ton of money from an MMO but even Star Trek Online went free to play very quickly. It and Star Wars: TOR show a &nbsp;huge brand is no guarantee for success.</p>

<p>The problem with that model is that you can never allow a true resolution to a story line or you instantly lose your player base, a problem TOR had when it first switched to F2P with folk only playing for the main story.</p>

<p>While Mass Effect certainly has a rich enough universe to make an MMO, I'm not sure it is going to be able to draw in players when Star Wars and Star Trek failed to do so.</p>

<p>Some MMO's are very successful... WoW for one... even Final Fantasy XI Online (which paid for it's development completely in the first 6 months of play) and that's been very successful for over a decade... though it IS dying now, thanks to a BS mini expansion
 which has unbalanced the game completely.</p>

<p>StarTrekOnline is still&nbsp;growing&nbsp;since the decision to go 'Free-To-Play' (Perfect World International had more to do with that than Cryptic Studios) and you can even download the game from Steam now.&nbsp; The game is nowhere near "dead" status, it took forever
 for my son to download today's weekly update (which featured many new weapons) once server maintenance finished the 507MB addition&nbsp;while many were trying to patch their game at the same time.&nbsp; While 'SWTOR' is clearly on the decline, this is not the case for
 'STO', the community is far bigger and well networked&nbsp;from player to&nbsp;the developer (test server 'Tribble' &amp; dev blogs)&nbsp;while the game continues to grow.&nbsp; Their model of building from the grass roots up&nbsp;has evolved into something special that appears well&nbsp;poised
 to continue for many years...:-)</p>

<p>You fail to see what I think. Then again you also failed to believe that game difficultly is part of a play through, so I shouldn't be surprised.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I'm not complaining about the size of updates, I had ones that size regularly while playing City of Heroes. Simply put it is how you are going to pull people in.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If brands that have 30 to 40 plus years of history behind them have trouble pulling in players, then Mass Effect is going to need something more than it has to make it as an MMO. If Kiingon and Romulans aren't a draw for paying customers then Turians and
 Krogans aren't going to be.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Free to play requires that you never have any true resolution or people stop coming.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Honestly sit back for a second and think of what truly unique that Mass Effect could bring to MMOs. The only thing would be the story and as TOR has showed us you have to keep sacrificing that to ensure people keep coming back.</p>

    <title>sfc &#47;scannow issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kodydagley  say:</h3>
<h2>            sfc &#47;scannow issue</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to fix an Acer laptop for a friend and I'm having issues with the sfc /scannow command. It's running Vista Home Premium 32-bit. I have no idea what Service Pack it's running (or even if it is running a Service Pack) as I can't boot into Windows.<br />
<br />
It was working fine yesterday. How it started is she uninstalled 3 pieces of software from Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel. She got sucked into a $600 for two-year contract with some remote-help company in California called Omnitech and she called
 them to cancel her plan and was removing the software.<br />
<br />
All she did, as I said, was uninstall their software from the Control Panel. Upon restart, she received a BSOD and called me to look at it. It BSODs no matter what I do now. The machine won't boot normally into windows, it won't boot into Safe Mode (same BSOD...won't
 boot into ANY safe mode, with Networking, Command Line-only, or otherwise).<br />
<br />
I have booted into the machine's System Recovery Options on the factory recovery partition by pressing F8 and selecting the "Repair Computer" option to get a command line. I've run a ChkDsk which completed and now want to run an
<b>sfc /scannow</b>. When I start the command line, I am on drive X:/ which is the recovery console drive, so I switch to C:/, then run the
<b>sfc /scannow</b> command.<br />
<br />
...BUT when I run the <b>sfc /scannow /offbootdir=C:\ /offwindir=C:\Windows</b> command on her C: drive, all I get is an error saying "Windows Resource Rrotection could not perform the requested operation."<br />
<br />
I'm logged in as her account (which I am pretty sure is set as an Admin account) because I can't log into the normal Administrator account, she has no passwords on any account that she remembers, but if I select the Admin account as I log into the System Recovery
 Options and hit enter with a blank password, I just get an error that that account is disabled.<br />
<br />
Any ideas how to get the sfc command working....? I really don't want to have to do a full format as she has a LOT of stuff on here and doesn't know exactly where all of it is, so it would be a lot of hunting and copying for backup for me :/<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be looking at a reinstall as the problem started while uninstalling the Software from a Company that used Remote Access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: bold">Note:</span> During the process, all data stored on your computer will be overwritten. This means all your files, such as email and photos, will be erased. Therefore, we recommend making a backup of all
 personal data before starting the recovery process..</p>
<p>Use the following steps to start the system recovery:</p>
<ol>
<li>Restart the computer. </li><li>When the Acer logo appears on the screen, press the left <span style="font-weight: bold">
Alt</span>, and the <span style="font-weight: bold">F10</span> keys. </li><li>If you are prompted with a Microsoft Windows boot screen, press the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Enter</span> key. </li><li>After the Acer eRecovery Management application has loaded, select your restore type.
</li><li>Read the notice, and then click <span style="font-weight: bold">Next</span> when you are ready.
</li><li>Click <span style="font-weight: bold">Next</span> to begin the restore process. The restore can take anywhere from 10 minutes up to an hour.
</li><li>Once the restore is complete your computer will load Windows and start installing your drivers and software. Your computer may reboot several times during this process. After everything is complete your computer will be like it was when you first purchased
 it.</li></ol>
<p>If the steps above do not work, you will need to use recovery media to restore your system. If you do not have a set of Acer Recovery Media, you may
<a href="https://store.acer.com/store?Action=DisplayDataValidationServicePage&amp;Env=BASE&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;SiteID=acerna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><b><span>Saving your files:</span></b></p>
<p><span>You can pull the Hard Drive and put it in a USB Hard Drive Enclosure &gt; plug it into another Computer &gt; and attempt to read and copy over your Data that way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Or, you can download Knoppix &gt; make a Bootable disk from it &gt; Boot into your System with it (IF your Hardware is all working) &gt; and copy your Data from the Hard Drive that way.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Taskbar can add icons but not remove them</h2>
                    I can easily add an icon to my taskbar in Windows 10 but then I cannot remove it or any other icon.&nbsp; Help says to right click and delete.&nbsp; That does nothing.&nbsp; A right click and the delete key doesn't either nor does highlight and the delete key.&nbsp; Bug or
 wrong method.&nbsp; Frustrated!

            <p>Hi right back,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First, Thanks for the detailed answer.&nbsp; Having tried all three options, I still couldn't remove a icon in Windows 10.&nbsp; The folders provided the pin option but did not provide an unpin option. I could easily add and move icons on the task bar but could not
 remove them or move them to the desktop as in Windows 7.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After a reboot, that installed new updates, I still couldn't get a pop-up with a right click on the app on the taskbar.&nbsp; However, I widened the task bar to see all pinned apps and magically the pop-ups worked as "pop downs" and I could unpin them easily.&nbsp;
 After that, the minimized taskbar would give me the popups with the unpin option.&nbsp; I suggest anyone with this problem install the latest updates and the problem should be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your efforts.</p>

            Hi, nicolecino 
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC
<br />The System File Checker tool built into Windows can scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a file has been modified, it will automatically replace that file with the correct version. Here’s how to use it.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow 
<br />

<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<p>Hi Nicole. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />
Run a full scan with the most powerful on-demand free scanner Malwarebytes: <br />
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>. In the Scan Settings first set it to include scanning for Rootkits.
<br />
<br />
Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean. <br />
<br />
Check for any remainders in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, and also in each of your browser's Extensions, Home Page settings, Search service or Add-On's as shown here:
<a href="https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-Account/How-To-Disable-Plugins-Add-Ons-Extensions-In-Multiple-Browsers/ta-p/19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-...</a><br />
</p>
<p>Then check for damaged System Files: <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a><br />
If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a><br />
</p>
<p>If the rogue program remains it should have it's threatening elements removed by now, but let me know and I will help you surgically remove it if it still will not Uninstall in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.&nbsp; For example you can Take Ownership of it's
 C:\Program Files folder to delete it which will get out most of it including registry keys:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Add "Take Ownership" Option in Files and Folders Context Menu in Windows - AskVG</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to keep Malwarebytes as an on-demand scanner then you can turn off its Real Time trial version in it's Settings &gt; Account Details tab.
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<p>I suggest looking into how to remove a trojan virus as I am doing now. I did a google on this and found your thread and then found a site that lists this same program as the 5th one done
<br />
<br />
http://software.sonicwall.com/applications/gav/index.asp?ev=v&amp;v_id=7115<br />
<br />
<br />
MalAgent.J_63121<strong>MalAgent.J_63121</strong> is a Trojan. A Trojan is a program that pretends to have a valid use, but in fact modifies the user's computer in malicious ways. Trojans do not replicate or spread to other computers.<br />
<br />
Thats from that link above.<br />

I am looking into how to remove it now myself</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span>If the external drive is detected by Windows
 then you will need to check the computer`s BIOS (Basic Input/output System) settings and make changes accordingly. Refer the computer`s manual that came along.</span></p>

<div>Windows directory = D: \Windows</div>
<div>AutoChk Run = 0</div>
<div>Number of root causes = 1</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Root cause found:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Startup repair has tried several times but still cannot determine the cause of the problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All my test performed were all successful.. I still don't know why I can't use my computer. I have send this problem to windows &amp; still waiting for it to be solved.. Need help soon hopefully. Thank you.&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>You may try the steps from the following link and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Vista or Windows 7 no longer starts, and the Startup Repair tool does not fix the problem</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934540</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try logging into advanced startup options and check if you can get to boot into “Last Known Good Configuration”.</p>
<p>The Advanced Boot Options
screen lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer and pressing the F8 key before Windows starts.</p>
<p>Last Known Good Configuration starts Windows with the last registry and driver configuration that worked successfully. For more information, refer the link below:</p>

<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.</li><li>Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.</li><li>Press a key when prompted to boot from the DVD.</li><li>Select "Repair PC" from the menu.</li><li>Select "Repair" when prompted.</li><li>Select System Restore when prompted.</li><li>Set Windows back to a point when Windows still worked.</li></ol>

If you lack experience in PC maintenance then you need to ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you. He/she will know how to get into the BIOS and change the boot order. He/she will also know how to get a Windows Repair CD (which is absolutely essential when
 repairing a PC). There are three options:
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Burn one on another machine.</li><li>Borrow one from a friend.</li><li>Buy one here: http://systemdiscs.com/</li></ul>

There is no difference between burning one on some other machine or getting a repair shop to burn one for you, as long a it is for the correct bus width (32 or 64 bits).

This is why I wrote "Burn one on <b>another</b> computer". Note also that attempting to repair this type of problem without extensive repair experience and without having an Internet-connected PC nearby is unrealistic. You might just as well pull the plug and
 perform a destructive Factory Restore (which will erase all your data, forcing you to retrieve it from your external backup medium).

<p>
</p><p>In addition to that you may want to reach the local authorities if they are distributing your content without your permission. You can block them and they probably will loose interest in you, but if they commit any felonies, the authorities are the ones
 that will act against them; Skype cannot be the Police. But they will co-operate with them if needed, to protect you.</p>

            Can you try a different keyboard?
<br />Do you have number lock on? If so turn it off.
<br />Can you activate the onscreen keyboard?

<h2>            Can you use Backup Windows Iso like a System Restore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My computer crashed 2 days ago. It happened in such a way that I couldn't access my system restores. It wouldn't boot up period actually, which was a problem.</p>
<p>The main reason I want to know if it can be used like a system restore is because I don't want to lose my file applications next time.

<p>In the Pictures folder right click the Screenshots folder and under the security tab set the HomeUsers group to have full access rights to the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you might get an error when saving a photo using the Camera app. If so, do the above to the Camera Roll folder in Pictures as well.</p>

<br />
My computer was giving me the same error for a long while and I finally got it resolved. I left it alone for quite a while as I don't use Outlook Express (OE), but the error would still pop up when I rebooted, or on the rare occasion when I tried to open a
 .vcf file, which was associated with the Windows Address Book (WAB).<br />
<br />
I had looked into all the suggestions I could find but nothing helped. From the troubleshooting suggestions I'd read, it seemed that in my situation the WAB was perhaps not working due to corrupted or missing file(s) (or registry info, I don't know). I thought
 that I could just re-install OE (if even through Add/Remove Windows Components) but I read repeatedly that OE can't be re-installed without re-installing XP, and I wasn't going to re-install XP just to resolve this one error dialog especially when I don't
 even use OE.<br />
<br />
Somewhere online I read about fixing some OE errors by using the msoe50.inf file in c:\windows\inf. That didn't fix the error on my system, however it made me think that perhaps there was a similar thing one could do for the WAB itself. I looked in the inf
 folder and found a wab50.inf file, so I went through the process with that file and that resolved the error! Here's a quick rundown of the process:<br />
<br />
* Open the Run dialog, either by clicking "Start" and then "Run..." or by pressing (on the keyboard) [Windows key] + [R].<br />
* In the Run dialog, type c:\windows\inf and then click "OK" or press [Enter]. The folder should open. (Note: The inf folder is hidden, so if instead of using the Run dialog you want to navigate to it using Windows Explorer, you'll first need to go to Tools
 &gt; Folder Options... &gt; View, and select the radio button next to Show hidden files and folders, then click [OK].)<br />
* Right-click the file wab50.inf and click "Install" from the pop-up menu. A Files Needed dialog will pop up saying that the Windows XP CD-ROM is needed. Insert the CD if you haven't already.<br />
* In the Copy file from: box type d:\i386 (where d: is the drive letter of your drive that has the XP CD inserted) OR: Click "Browse..." then navigate to the CD drive and then to the I386 folder on the CD and click the "Open" button.
<br />
* Click the "OK" button and the installer will copy various files from the CD onto your system.<br />
* Remove the CD from the optical drive.<br />
* Restart Windows.<br />
<br />
This process worked for my system, and caused no problems. However, I do not use OE so I do not know what changes (if any) this process makes to settings, identities, mail, the address book, etc. Back up your info before attempting.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<h2>            Installing a Genius Camera Eye 310, on a computer with windows 7.</h2>
                    I want to install a Genius Camera Eye 310, but I can not. It said that there is an error, after the computer looks for the driver on internet.&nbsp; The automatic actualization is on. How can I do to make it work. We have tryied on differents ports but it does
 not work neither of them. It sounds when you connect it to the port, but it does not recognize it when we want to open it.&nbsp; Help us, please.

<h2>            Root cause found&#58; Boot critical file D&#58;&#92;Windows&#92;system32&#92;DRIVERS&#92;tmel.sys is corrupt</h2>
                    <p>We happily upgraded to Windows 10 on our desktop, but regretted the decision as we later found that our Sage Accounts software was no longer compatible.&nbsp;&nbsp;We followed&nbsp;the&nbsp;on screen instructions&nbsp;to return to Windows 7 which ran smoothly and the desktop was
 returned to the original Windows 7 format.&nbsp; It was only after logging off and returning the next day that we have encountered problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we turn the computer on, the operating system cannot boot and it results in a black error screen, entitled Windows Boot Manager.&nbsp; It says:</p>
<p>Windows failed to start.&nbsp; A recent hardware or software change might be the cause.&nbsp; To fix the problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Insert your Windows Installation disc and restart your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Choose your language settings, and then click "Next."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Click "Repair your computer."</p>
<p>If you do not have this disc, contact your system administrator or computer manufacturer for assistance.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status: 0xc000000f</p>
<p>Info: The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried rebooting through the disk drive using the windows reinstallation CD.&nbsp; Start up Repair and System Restore (to a safe point in time before the corruption - 9Aug2015) have both failed.&nbsp; Start up repair - Diagnosis and repair details states that
 2 root causes have been found:</p>
<p>Boot critical file D:\Windows\system32\DRIVERS\tmel.sys is corrupt</p>
<p>Boot critical file D:\tmel.sys is corrupt </p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot manager generic failure 0xc000000f</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, (we know - how stupid!)&nbsp;we didn't make back-ups of our files, so it's now a case of damage limitation.&nbsp; We would really prefer not to have to format the hard drive or revert back to factory settings.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your advice would be greatly appreciated. </p>

            <p>Hello Annie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you are experiencing the error 0xc000000f while Windows fails to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main cause of this error, is most likely a corrupted boot sector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I would suggest you to follow the below steps and check if it helps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect all other peripheral devices except for the mouse and keyboard.</li><li>Check the boot order from BIOS to make sure your PC boots from the hard drive and not from any other non-bootable discs next time.</li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Insert the installation media and see if the following suggestion helps, if any how the boot manager is missing (although chances are less).</span></span><span>
<br />

            <p>I ran into this issue and was in a repair loop on a Windows 8.1 Ultrabook, I had to make a USB boot disk from a Windows 8 ISO because I didn't have a USB DVD drive to connect to this Ultrabook.&nbsp; Be sure to use something like Rufus and make the disk use GPT
 for UEFI, at least that was required for me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After that&nbsp;I chose F12 on a Dell system to boot the USB disk, chose repair,&nbsp;got into troubleshooting, advanced, command prompt and entered this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No </p>
<p>
</p><p>prevents the computer from trying to automatically repair so you can actually see the error code, aka "Blue screen of death"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine said c:\Windows\system32\DRIVERS\tmel.sys was the problem child.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the disk and the file was not present, luckily I had a Windows 10 laptop with Trend Micro Officescan loaded that I just copied the file over to the USB drive and then to c:\Windows\system32\DRIVERS.&nbsp; Once that was done the system booted without
 issue.</p>

 power cycled multiple times, doesnt help. Sometimes i can play for an hour, sometimes barely 10 minutes. It is plugged into the wall, have tried multiple outlets with same issue.</p>

<p>Hi Sgt Bear Scat,</p>
<p>I know you said it's well ventilated but go ahead have a look at the link below. Is the Xbox sitting on top of something else, or is something sitting on the Xbox? Also move the power supply to a well ventilated place if it is not already. It does have built
 in fans, but it can overheat as well.</p>
<p>If your console consistently shuts down automatically due to ventilation problems, even after the console is free from clutter and no vents are obstructed, your console will need service.</p>
<p>You can<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> request a repair </a>from the Xbox Online Service Center. Console registration is required to service your console.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t let me get rid of a local administrator account</h2>
                    <p>So I recently got my laptop repaired and when&nbsp;I was logging into my account I saw that there was a new account, so&nbsp;I try to delete&nbsp;it, then next thing you know&nbsp;is&nbsp;my laptop won't let me&nbsp;delete it! There is no delete option for the profile and&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't know
 why there isn't.</p>

<h2>            Useless product</h2>
                    <p>How can a company like Microshite allow such junk out of it's door..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is the biggest heap of shoddy coding since... Windows 8.1 and continually crashes, doesn't recognise drivers and is a triumph of style over substance...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I alone in thinking they are simply taking the mickey?!</p>
