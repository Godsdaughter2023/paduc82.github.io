<h3> yonnybujosa  say:</h3>
<h2>            How I can empty the Recycle bin when it doesn&#39;t show up on the desktop or in any place else</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 7 Home Premium, my hard disk is full and when I delete some files to make space it naturally goes to the recycle bin, but the problem is that I cann't see rhe recycle bin to be emptied. It doesn't show up if I click the start buttom and
 type desktop icons, either. When I do that I only get an icon with the same name I typed (desktop icons), so the desktop icon settings&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">dialog box</span>&nbsp;doesn't
 show up, therefore, if I click that icon I only get to the desktop, but the recycle bin isn't there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, trying to use an alternate way to empty the recycle bin, if I click Start, then All Programs, then Accessories, and lastly click the Command Prompt, it doesn't show up either.</p>
<p><br />
If I cann't find a way to empty the recycle bin, I think another way would be deleting some files with an option to be permanently deleted, without goinng to the recycle bin. However, I don't know the way do do this yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone could help out with this issue.</p>

            Thanks for your reply. I should have been more specific: I have Windows 8.1 Pro which features a kiosk mode called Assigned Access. The issue is that to use Assigned Access in windows 8.1 Pro MS dictate that the app you use MUST be installed through the
 Windows App Store (btw does anyone else find this strange?), which the application I'm using is not. I searched through the windows app store looking for a sandbox type app which would allow me to run my application, but nothing like that currently exists.
 I'm hoping someone can help me get around this, and help me to run the time clock application I use run in Assigned Access.

<div>I cannot see a reason for the restriction, that Assigned Access is not available for other applications. My opinion is, that a (not cheap) Pro Version of Windows 8 should enable users to get 'Pro' features.</div>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Repair Loop of Death and Restore Points Created After Complete Reset Are Missing</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p>Hopefully someone can help me with this. I don't want Microsoft to reply with scripted responses either. Please read about&nbsp;my problem and THINK about it before trying to give me a generic answer that never works for any one. Safe mode does nothing, automatic
 repair does nothing. </p>

<p>gigabyte z77-d3h mobo</p>
<p>(not sure if bios is updated)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I upgraded my pc to 8.1 about two weeks ago. Every thing was just fine until a week ago. I was&nbsp;browsing the internet in&nbsp;Internet Explorer desktop mode&nbsp;and my pc froze, gave me the BSOD with a :( that said there was an error and had to restart. Then the automatic
 repair loop began. Automatic repair, scanning drive c: for errors, diagnosing your pc, etc never worked. And it was a toss of the dice as to which screen I would see after each reboot.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I created an 8.1 usb boot drive on another 8.1 pc. Attempted to boot from the usb to reset the pc. Took may attempts....it kept saying the drive was locked, or there was an error and no changes were made. I ended up trying to run SFC and ChkDsk in command
 prompt from usb boot drive. I think it worked because it finally let me do a reset of the pc. I chose to do the thorough reset that made it like a new PC again in case you were going to sell it to someone else. I figured this reformatted the drive before installing
 windows....still have not found out if this is 100% or not. After the reset, I manually created a system restore point. The restore point was created before I even installed any drivers or windows updates. I wanted a point to work from in case there was a
 certain driver that was causing the issue. I then began installing the windows updates and video card drivers. I restarted the computer after each install to see if it sent me to the auto repair loop. After I got most of my programs installed and had no issues
 with restarts I thought I was okay.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyway...I got two days out of the pc after the full reset. I think I might have been installing a game in Steam when the pc froze and sent me to the BSOD with the :( . I seem to remember the error being something about Bad System Config. And guess what,
 auto repair loop again, varying between failed automatic repairs, failed diagnosing, scan and repair drive c: that appeared to do nothing, etc. Booting from the 8.1 usb drive, I attempted a system restore. Guess what? Restore Point disappeared! Same issues
 again trying to reset the pc...varied between drive being locked, or just plain error during reset no changes were made.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I then decided to run SeaTools for DOS from a boot disk (hard drive tool from Seagate). After a Long Test (2 hours) it came back as passed. So I think I can rule out faulty hard drive. At this point, since I had already performed a thorough reset/reformat
 of the drive, I went for the basic reset that would take less time. After the reset I found that not all of the windows apps had installed...I read that this meant Windows did not install correctly. So again, I did a basic reset. Finally, it appeared all the
 windows apps installed and it looked okay. I created a restore point, again before installing any drivers or windows updates. This time I made sure that I had enough hard drive space reserved for the restore points. My hard drive is a 1TB with 90% free space,
 and I reserved 5% of the drive for restore points. The restore point I created was approx. 1.6 GB.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Again, installing things one at a time, I restarted after each and checked after each restart to see if my restore point was still there. It was. So I was pretty happy at this point. I thought I was good to go. I started installing some games through Steam
 but did not play any of them. I woke up this morning and decided to turn on the pc and start installing more games through Steam while I did some stuff around the house. Came back to wake up the pc and check on the progress (monitor was in power saver mode,
 hard drive light was still active)....and found a frozen pc. After many futile clicks and ctrl-alt-del I got the BSOD with the :( again. I remember seeing the Bad System Config error in there as well. Restarted to auto repair loop again. I attempted to boot
 with usb drive to reset YET AGAIN and it is telling me there was an error and no changes were made to the pc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am not doing anything until I figure out what's going on. The pc is currently booted from the boot drive at the advanced troubleshooting screen. I must be doing something wrong. I will list a few details about my experience below.</p>
<p>-I do not have any external hard drive connected</p>
<p>-I am not dual booting with any other OS</p>
<p>-Cmd prompt with admin rights&nbsp;(before&nbsp;windows boots)&nbsp;shows drive C: as system reserve with 350mb and drive E: with 931gb ,both NTSF. This doesn't seem right. I feel like windows should be stored on a separate partition from the rest of E:</p>
<p>-Everything I read about resetting and reformatting a hard drive for a clean install with windows 8 only shows it being done with a boot disk or drive. Am I doing something wrong? I feel like windows is not giving me a complete disk format like I thought.</p>
<p>-At different points between failed resets I was in cmd prompt with admin rights, both in and out of windows running SFC and ChkDsk...found errors that said would be fixed next reboot, or did not find any errors at all. I am thinking those errors were never
 fixed because it kept going back to the auto repair loop.<br />
</p>
<p>I will be checking this thread very regularly so any help would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if I forgot to include any information. I have already spent 20+ hours trying to get my pc to stay in a stable usable condition.</p>

            <p>Having seen a number of BSOD errors on computers at our place and reading your note, it is probable that the BSOD occurs after the game installation through Steam-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A search says that there are three possible problems: faulty memory (RAM), a faulty hard drive, or a program that’s damaged your registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First thought--</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 is a the latest from Windows so the games might have compatibility issues too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**Check if the games are compatible with this OS. That will review this-program that’s damaged your registry. A new version might help as well</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**Plus check is you have installed any registry cleaning and optimizing programs. If any, uninstall them
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BSOD will make a dump file on the hard drive, either on the root of C: or in C:\Windows\minidump,
</p>
<p>then see this page to analyse the dump file.<br />

            <p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>I did not mean to let this thread go for so long...here is where I am at now.</p>
<p>I kept trying to do a OS repair from the 8.1 boot disk...after talking with cyberpowerpc they instructed me to do a complete reinstallation from disk of Windows 8.0. I was already fully backed up so no big deal. Things were looking good until it was set
 to format the partitions before installation. I forget the error, but it would not format the drive.
</p>
<p>This could have been because of my poking around the cmd prompt using Diskpart trying to reformat it from there. I thought that was the only way to do it since reset and repair were not working from the boot disk.&nbsp;I ended up with a raw formatted&nbsp;drive after
 the cmd prompt failed reformats (kept getting I/O errors&nbsp;and such). So this might have been why Windows failed to install.</p>
<p>Either way, cyberpower was convinced it was a hard drive issue or ram. I ran SeaTools for DOS long test and drive passed. I pulled ram and booted with only one piece at a time to check them, and booted properly each time (at least got me to the advanced
 repair screen). I figured it was a false pass on SeaTools so I got another hard drive.</p>
<p>After successfully installing windows 8.0 I added the supposedly failed drive as a slave (SATA). From within windows I was able to successfully format the drive in NTFS. I have not run SeaTools on the drive yet, but windows seems to think there are no errors
 or problems with the drive. For the time being I am storing backups of movies and music and playing them back from that drive to see if there are any issues. So far so good. And no, this is not my primary backup...have another in locked in a firebox and an
 external drive as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish I had seen this post before I installed windows again. I would imagine any logs are gone from the last crash.
</p>
<p>I like the idea about Steam being the issue...And I am pretty sure that is where my problems started. I have not had any problems with Windows 8.0 so I will not update to 8.1 for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I do not run any third party software other than Logitech drivers for peripherals, and Steam for games. I only use windows defender and do not have any registry cleaners, or antivirus&nbsp;etc installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your input. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you get a permission error when you try to move the drive?</p>
<p>2. Who is the PC Original Equipment Manufacturer?<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not advised to move the recovery folder.&nbsp; Recovery drive is a special partition on the hard drive used to restore the system in the event of problem.&nbsp; If you move the&nbsp;recovery contents, it will stop working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi <span>BW1029,<br />
<br />
The error code 800cccd1 can be broken down to 2 causes: <br />
<br />
1.Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – check with provider if it is required or not.<br />
2.Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.<br />
<br />

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>recently I try to setup my company's &nbsp;10 security policy, one of the key setting is minimum password length</p>
<p>
</p><p>in "Local Security Policy" ==&gt; Account Policies ==&gt; Password Policies,&nbsp; there is an parameter "Minimum password Length"</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the explain section, it says&nbsp; the range is 1 to 20,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but when I try to set the parameter as 15, it&nbsp; has error ,I even try in command line, same error and messages says it is not support this value (15),&nbsp; I try several numbers, seems not support more than 14 (both in GUI and command lines)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>is this bug? or anything I did wrong ?</p>

            I do not know why this should not work on your machine but you can reset your password like so:<br />
1. Click Start.<br />
2. Type the three letters cmd into the Search box.<br />
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter<br />
4. Click "Run as Administrator".<br />
5. Type the following command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "%UserName%" xxyyzz {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Replace xxyyzz with the password you wish to use)<br />

<h2>            Running Simply Accounting Version 9.0 &#40;from 2002&#41; on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new computer running on Windows 10.&nbsp; I tried re-installing Simply Accounting Version 9.0 (2002) and found out it is not compatible with the new version of windows.&nbsp; The program was running fine on Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I bite the bullet and force myself to buy a new version of the software (now called Sage Accounting), is there any way I can get this old program to work on my new computer?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone is wondering why I am using a 16 year old accounting program, I never needed the annual payroll updates, and for my accounting needs Version 9 worked just fine, thus avoiding the cost of buying those annual updates.<br />
</p>
<p>If I am forced to buy the new Sage Accounting software, I am not ever sure I will be able to convert my data file from the 2002 software to the present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any suggestions.</p>
<p>

            You can try to run this in compatibility mode.
<br />Right click on the program icon &gt; Properties &gt; Compatibility tab &gt; Check Run this program in compatibility mode for &gt; Choose the right OS say Win 7 or 8 or 98 or XP &gt; Apply and OK
<br />
<br />(In above you can also choose Compatibility Troubleshooter on this application and follow on screen directions)

<p>Even if you manage to install the program and get it up and running, the chances that a 17-year old program will work successfully on Windows 10 are slim. In addition, your program is not able to handle today's security threats. It's really time for an up-to-date
 accounting program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a license for an earlier version of Windows that is not being used, you can create a virtual machine in Windows 10, install the older version of Windows in that virtual machine, and then install your program in that earlier version of Windows.
 That will work better than compatibility mode in Windows 10.</p>

            If Narrator only activates in Minecraft, it is not Windows Narrator. There is a setting in Minecraft that activates a voice and sounds. Look at the help files for turning it off. Or check at the Gaming Forum as suggested..

    <title>Question about notification of contact detail changes. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> celestia_99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about notification of contact detail changes.</h2>
                    <p>I know this is probably a silly question but I fail to find the answer because my own Skype 'home' is always unavailable so I can't check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, Skype home unavailable is not the problem here, I'd like to know if profile picture changes show up in my contacts home (or 'feed' going by FB terms). Would my contacts see 'x has changed her profile picture'? I know it use to do this (or still does?)
 with status/mood updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if yes, is there a way to turn this off? For privacy reasons I don't always my contacts to go through my whole list of previous pictures/moods but instead it'd be nice if they could only have access to the current by viewing my profile information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. Answers are much appreciated.</p>

<p><br />
As I indicated, be observant and figure out what is happening.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may decide that it is occurring because of malfunctioning hardware, e.g. one of your Touch drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW that is what has happened to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have decided to do without multi-touch at least
 when I am using multiple monitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That &nbsp;leaves me only with pen support (besides mouse as input pointer devices) but much fewer spurious interrupts that W8 seems unable to handle gracefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could go back to DOS days, e.g. just run&nbsp; Task Manager and use it to kill explorer.exe and start up whatever else it is that you run.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was first trying Vista, I used to do that when all its quirky usability and broken functionality
 (especially Windows Search) became too much for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; }</p>

Good luck</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently built a new computer, with windows 7, decided I might as well upgrade to windows 10, meaning of course my installation disk, which is for windows 7, wont help me repair it.&nbsp;error code 0xc00000d appears whenever i try to boot the machine, and it
 asks for an installation media I don't have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see on the forums that you can create these media, but if I do, will the fact that i would have to create this on my old machine, with a different activation key, mean that my new pc won't take it? Although it's fairly new, I have a couple days work on
 there that is not yet backed up and I would really rather not have to redo it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have stated that you&nbsp;got a locked hard drive error, I would suggest that you perform the following&nbsp;steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Insert the <strong>USB/DVD </strong>tool that you have created for Windows 10, open
<strong>Windows Recovery Environment </strong>as explained in the above post.</p>
<p>2. Click on the <strong>Repair my computer </strong>link, on the <strong>Install Windows
</strong>Page, this will open WinRE.</p>
<p>3. Click on <strong>Troubleshoot&gt;Advance Options&gt;Command Prompt</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Then type the following command in the window.</p>
<p><strong>Bootrec.exe</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bootrec/fixmbr</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bootrec.exe/fixboot</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bootrec.exe/RebuildBcd</strong></p>
<p>5. Restart the computer and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Regarding the concern, there are modem settings that may need to be <em>modified</em> to limit the bandwidth that can be used while downloading stuffs. In this way, even if there are downloading-apps (<em>including software-updater and Windows update</em>)
 that are running in the background, it will not harm your browsing experience. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, it would be best to contact your <strong>ISP (Internet service provider)</strong> to guide you on
<em>how you can manage the flow of Bandwidth</em> across your modem settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is normal to experience a slow<em> Internet Browsing Experience</em> when there are apps that downloads things in the background, that includes Software updates.

<h2>            Windows Mail App</h2>

    <title>Overwatch Voice Chat &#34;Muted&#34; Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> f3ar i medicate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Overwatch Voice Chat &#34;Muted&#34; Issue</h2>
                    <p>If you get in a came and out of no where everyone is muted and you can't unmute them, I recommend leaving and re-joining voice chat. If that doesn't work it means Blizzard has banned you from voice chat for a moment. If that is the case then you have to close Overwatch re-open it and try again. This helped for me and many others. I am sure Blizzard is working on a fix as soon as possible. Until then, use this. Thanks!</p><p>-Ambassador Vecxl</p>
