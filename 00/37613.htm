<h2>            Can&#39;t delete an item from quick access which was already deleted</h2>
                    <p>I have an a video file which I had deleted. Now I am trying to delete that file from quick access but it doesn't delete and an pop up opens from explorer.exe saying that file name is too long.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reinstall the original file. It opens up perfectly (without saying file name is too long). But the quick access file doesn't link to this file. It&nbsp;just simply says that file name is too long.</p>

<p>I have seem to forgotten my 4-digit passcode to log onto xbox live with my account. Is there any way that I can possibly reset that or receive that passcode.</p>

<p>Yes there is a way to reset it.&nbsp; You'll be resetting your xbox to factory settings to do this.&nbsp; I know the procedure to do this but there is a combo that you put at the end but that combo varies on your serial number.&nbsp; You'll have to contact MS to figure
 out what combo will work for your xbox.&nbsp; <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us/#0:0:7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
What Verachi is suggesting is only to be used if you've setup a family settings passcode for your console. To reset the passcode you set for your Xbox LIVE account simply delete your profile (profile only), and download the profile again. This will clear any
 sort of 4-digit passcode you had previously set on your account to login.<br />

<span>I am posting this information in the hope it will help someone who might run into the problem that occurred recently.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>I am posting this information in the hope it will help someone who might run into the problem that occurred recently.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But first, let me quickly describe the home network:<span>&nbsp; </span>One Dell Precision 490 (16GB) FreeNAS server running the latest 9.2.1.4-Beta release, one HP Envy h8-1420t (16GB RAM) Windows 8.1 Pro (64bit) PC, one Dell Inspiron 530 (4GB RAM) Windows
 8.1 Pro (32bit) PC, one SiliconDust HD HomeRun Prime 3 TV-tuner network devices with a CableCard plus a Cisco (Cox Communications) tuning adapter, plus other computers and devices that are not material to the problem situation.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Both Windows 8.1 Pro PCs have Windows Media Center installed and both units had no trouble connecting to a SiliconDust HD HomeRun Prime network device on the home network.<span>&nbsp;
<span>Both Windows 8.1 Pro PCs have Windows Media Center installed and both units had no trouble connecting to a SiliconDust HD HomeRun Prime network device on the home network.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The WMC units were working fine until I upgraded my FreeNAS server to version 9.2.1.4. (I did not make the connection at first that this event is what triggered the problem.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>About 2 days after the FreeNAS upgrade,I noticed that WMC could NOT find the SiliconDust network turners. I followed SiliconDust’s<span>&nbsp;
</span>10-point troubleshooting guide “Windows Media Center reports NO tuners found when trying to complete TV setup.”<span>&nbsp;
</span>Everything checked out ok.<span>&nbsp; </span>Running the program (as administrator)</span></p>

</span>The results were identical when we started up WMC on the second Windows 8.1 Pro PC.</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I reported my problem to Microsoft Support and<span>&nbsp;
<span>I reported my problem to Microsoft Support and<span>&nbsp;
</span>got up to a “level 2” technician.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once he learned that the problem manifested itself on 2 computers, he was convinced that it was a network problem of some sort.<span>&nbsp;
</span>He suggested contacting my cable provider (Cox Communications)<span>&nbsp; </span>
and re-install and re-activate the CableCard HD HomeRun Prime network tuner. If that did not clear the problem, he suggested trying to refresh one of the two PCs. If neither option worked, we would get back together later.</span></p>

<p>
<span>The SiliconDust network tuner re-install/re-activation with Cox did not clear the problem.<span>&nbsp;

</span>I then prepared to refresh my 32-bit PC because it had very little 3rd-party software installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But my first attempt at the refresh failed because I had not attached the removable drive with the refresh image.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>But before I made another attempt at a “refresh,” I remembered that I upgraded the FreeNAS operating system just before my WMC problem occurred.<span>&nbsp;

</span>[Note: Previous upgrades of the FreeNAS operating system had no impact on WMC.]<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I then experimented by disabling SMB/CIFS services on the FreeNAS server.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With CIFS down and after the<span>&nbsp; </span>64-bit Windows PC was restarted,<span>&nbsp;
</span>WMC could find the network tuners and proceeded with setting up the TV tuners.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(It looked like the previous setup information was lost.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After WMC seemed to be working properly on this PC,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I restarted SMB/CIFS services on the FreeNAS server and re-established my network shares. WMC continued to work properly after the CIFS service was started. I rebooted the PC again and WMC continued to work.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Now,<span>&nbsp; </span>I started the second (32-bit) Windows 8.1 Pro PC to check its WMC status.<span>&nbsp;

Now for the second time,<span>&nbsp; </span>I stopped SMB/CIFS services on the FreeNAS server and then rebooted this Windows PC.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As before, this PC’s WMC could NOW find the network tuner and it needed to go through the TV setup process again to bring in live TV channels.</span></p>

            I have NEW information to add to this saga.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rebooting the FreeNAS server recreates the problem. WMC cannot find the HD HomeRun tuners on the network.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the 64-bit PC that had an iSCSI drive enable to record TV, I also had to disable iSCSI services
 along with SMB/CIFS services and remove that drive as a recording option before WMC found the network tuners.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, it seems that the booting of FreeNAS 9.2.1.4 does something to Windows Media Center on both Windows 8.1 Pro pcs that cause WMC to not find
 the network tuners. &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Is MicroSoft Skype aware that there are still a large number of users using perfectly functioning Apple iOS devices with hardware capped at iOS 9.3.5? &nbsp;Has MicroSoft decided to end support for iOS9.3.5 thus alienating this user base from the Skype community?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm shocked and disgusted with Microsoft for updating the Skype app so that it won't work on millions of peoples iPad's !</p>
<p>
</p><p>....we didn't even get any warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do Microsoft think that we can all afford to just throw out our older iPads and buy new ones, simply because they want to update their apps ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps, with all the millions they make, they would like to buy us all new iPads, so that we can still use their apps !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talk about poor customer care....maybe its time to avoid Skype and look for a replacement !</p>

<div>As a workaround, Skype for iPhone can be used on an iPad with iOS 9.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>1. On a Mac or PC install older iTunes 12.6.5 supporting AppStore:&nbsp;</div>
<div>https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208079&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>2. 'Purchase' the Skype for iPhone by downloading it in iTunes. Make sure to login in iTunes with the same Apple ID as on iPad.</p>

<div>3. Open Skype for iPhone in AppStore on iPad via this link:&nbsp;</div>
<div>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-iphone/id304878510</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. Select 'cloud' icon to install Skype for iPhone. AppStore will prompt that iOS 10 is required and will offer to download an older version.</div>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this - it worked for me, mainly because I have locked iTunes at 12.6.5 because they removed so many useful features from their later versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the Skype version downloaded is Skype for iPhone which is a tad more primitive than the last working version of Skype for iPad that was running on iOS 9.3.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to link to the older iOS 9.3.5 compatible version of Skype for iPad?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<h2>            Settings app closes when I click on Apps &#38; Features in System...</h2>
                    <p>Today I wanted to remove an app, so I opened "Settings", clicked on "System" and then clicked "Apps &amp; features", at which point the app flashed briefly, then closed. Very annoying. It was working fine yesterday. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, how
 do I fix it? I haven't installed an update between using "Apps &amp; features" to remove an app yesterday and this morning, when it refused to work.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Installing Windows 10 on a PC that is infected with malware</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to fix a Windows 8.1 laptop that has been badly infected with malware.&nbsp; Attempts to clean it have pretty much failed and so I've decided to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My preference would be to go straight to Windows 10.&nbsp; However, the <em>How to perform a clean installation of Windows</em> section of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install?ocid=ms_wol_win10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install?ocid=ms_wol_win10</a> says that to upgrade to Windows 10 for free, you need to use the Upgrade this PC now option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean that I'm going to have to reinstall Windows 8/8.1 and then upgrade to Windows 10 in order to do a clean install of Windows 10?&nbsp; Or is it possible to go straight to Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However in the same amount of time it takes to download that option, you can choose the second option "Create Media for another PC" to make bootable flash or DVD media to keep for any needed repairs or reinstall, and can
 be run from Desktop to Upgrade.&nbsp; <strong><span>This media also gives you an extra option to "Save Nothing" during the Upgrade which overcomes&nbsp;Upgrade choking on corruption or bloated factory installs
 and gets as close to a superior Clean Install as an Upgrade can get.</span></strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />

                    <p>Original Title: cant delete pictures because windows 10 claims there open in&nbsp; LockScreenContent Server</p>
<p>
</p><p>the title pretty much says it all, i cant delete pictures every time i try this is the exact message i get &nbsp; "The action can't be completed because the file is open in LockScreenContent Server" &nbsp; which it is most definitely not open anywhere its not even
 connected to the stupid lockscreen at all, this is yet another reason why windows 10 sucks, to much hidden BS that screws with you</p>

<h2>            I cannot download and install updates unless I upgrade to windows 10.</h2>
                    I recently restored my pc back to factory settings, which brought me back to windows 8.1. I did this all because my built in microphone was not working well with windows 10. Unfortunately, when I go to windows update, it wants me to upgrade to windows
 10 but it wont let me cancel the upgrade. I went into "Show all available updates" and checked all the updates, but when I clicked install, it said downloading windows 10, even though there were absolutely no windows 10 updates checked. All I want to do is
 install updates for my windows 8.1 system. I'm hoping that there is a fix to this because I'm not going back to windows 10. Thank you.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a034a6f0-2acf-49de-8587-e563ba90fb0c" />

            <p>Hello Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description, you do not want to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This can be done if the update which is responsible for this icon is either uninstalled from your system or if it is hidden. So, first I would suggest you to uninstall
<strong><span>KB3035583</span></strong> update and then hide it. Hope this would resolve your issue. in future if you want Windows 10 just install this update and you can upgrade to Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To check if the updates is already installed:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open <strong><span>Installed Updates </span></strong>by pressing <strong>
<span>Windows key + X</span></strong>. Select <strong><span>Control Panel </span>
</strong>from the list, clicking <strong><span>Programs</span></strong>, and then, under
<strong><span>Programs and Features</span></strong>, clicking <strong><span>View installed updates</span></strong>.
</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>Click the update <strong><span>KB3035583</span></strong> that you want to remove, and then click
<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>. &nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer to the below mentioned steps to hide an update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><span>Window key + X.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Select <strong><span>Control Panel </span></strong>from the list.</span></li><li><span>Under <strong><span>view by </span></strong>option select <strong><span>large icons</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>And then click either <strong><span>Windows Update</span></strong> or <strong>
<span>Microsoft Update</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Now click on <strong><span>important updates available </span></strong>(recommended).</span></li><li><span>Click to <strong><span>clear</span></strong> the check box that is next to the
<strong><span>KB3035583</span></strong> update.</span></li><li><span>Expand the <strong><span>KB3035583</span></strong> update that you want to hide, and then click the "<strong><span>Don't show this update again</span></strong>" check box.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong><span>Review</span></strong> and <strong><span>install</span></strong> updates.</span></li></ol>

            Thanks for the reply Ashish. I checked my updates and it says that I have not yet installed the KB3035583 update. I am still unable to install any update whatsoever due to this notification. If I check all the updates that I want to install, which is a
 big amount because I factory reset my laptop back to Windows 8.1, it automatically downloads Windows 10 and tries to install it. I hid the KB3035583 update just in case, and I have no other update checked in both the Important and Optional update sections.
 Even with nothing checked, it still wants to download the new operating system onto my computer (2,845.9 MB download on bottom right). Again, thanks for the help.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed15a549-1fe8-42da-b539-a16bac7c1241" />

            Hey guys, I'm back. I guess no one had a fix for this, but fortunately I got them to download. I'm not sure what happened, but it doesn't show me the option to download Windows 10 anymore. When I went to install the updates, the percentage stayed on 0%
 so I let it go overnight, and it worked. Problem Solved. Thank you.

            Hi Espiritu,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. I understand that you are unable to connect to the network. I’ll certainly help you with this.</div>
<div><br />
Are you trying to access the computers shared on the HomeGroup? If yes, try the following methods and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let's try running the <strong>HomeGroup Troubleshooter </strong>and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
To run the HomeGroup troubleshooter, follow these steps.<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows key </strong>and type troubleshooting in the search box.<br />
2. Open <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>and click on <strong>Network and Internet</strong>.<br />
3. Tap or click <strong>HomeGroup</strong>.&nbsp; You may be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice.
<br />
4. Click <strong>Next</strong>, and then follow the instructions on your screen.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If that does not help, Clear the “<strong>PeerNetworking</strong>” folder contents and
<strong>restart </strong>the computer.</div>
<div><br />
Browse through the following location and delete the folders inside, PeerNetworking.<br />
<strong>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking<br />
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also refer: I can't create, join, or use a homegroup</div>

            <p>Hello Azaruddin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, I tried what you suggested but here are the steps in which I found what you were suggesting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. After pressing windows key, no "troubleshooting" result came up. I typed Control Panel instead and found troubleshooting there.</p>
<p>2. I didn't want to make my office network private thus making a "HOME GROUP" option for me to connect. THERE'S NO HOMEGROUP in the office. No one created a HOME GROUP and we just connect to computers via the old school method of connecting to the same network.</p>
<p>3. Now, my current connection is private, how do i make this public again?</p>
<p>4. I can solve the problem by restarting every time. If you're going to give me a solution that will totally change how my computer will access the network, then I won't have any of it. It's just irritating that I have to restart every time to solve my problem.
 I get a 5~10 min window that I can access my network before the network cuts me off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not helping.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already took it out as a private network by deleting the Wlan directory. I had to disable first the wlan in services.msc then i had to restart and login to the network wifi. This time, i assigned it as a public network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of that network mess, I had to restart before I even logged in to the network. And that gave me my new 5 min window. This time around, I couldn't print, saying "access denied". But I can access the network and files shared by my colleagues. My only
 recourse was to restart the printer spool in the services.msc. And I left the windows explorer that's connected to the network open. I opened a new one to browse files, etc. My theory is to have my pc "connect" to the network by leaving a window open. I know
 it doesn't make sense but it's working as we speak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess it's a little glitch with windows 10. Anyway, I was able to figure this out on my own, with that WLAN Auto Config solution from another person - I guess that helped a lot to refresh my network settings.</p>

            <p>update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still can't access printers and files on my network, but I can see the computers. As I stated earlier, when I connect to the network for the first time, I can freely access printers &amp; files, then after 5 to 10 minutes. I can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the computers on the network, so I don't really think connection to the network is the problem. I see my computer on the network too. But when I click on a computer that I want to access the printer, it gives me this error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows can't access \\(pcname)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network. To try to identify or resolve the problems, click on Diagnose</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error: 0x80070035</p>
<p>The network path was not found</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it strange that I can type now here, but can't access the local network, which means I have internet but not lan - which supposedly should be on the same network. Is there something wrong with one of my protocols? Should I reinstall tcp/ip or something?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click further to "Diagnose" I get this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems found</p>
<p>&nbsp;file and print sharing resource (pcname) is online but isn't responding to connection attempts</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same problem i find will all computers on my network. I'm open to any suggestions you may have but please, I don't have a home group and I'm not looking to add one.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, until now, no one has an idea how to solve this problem. I can confirm that other computers on my network can see mine and they can even access my files. I, on the other hand, can't access anyone up to now. Why does it work for my peers but
 not my computer? Is there something that I can refresh or maybe stop a certain service then start it again? It's happening everyday. Now my solution is put the file I want to print on my shared folder then the computer that has a printer access my shared folder,
 open the file and print it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone think of a solution asife from the one given above?</p>

            <p>Hello Gary Gambrel, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like you have some malware infection on your computer. <br />
It is called My Web Search and usually comes when you install some free programs. You don't even know it is installed except for the message you see on your screen.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you don't have an Antivirus installed, I suggest you install Microsoft Security Essentials which is a free download from Microsoft. It will take care of malware, virus infections and spyware. It updates automatically without you having to do a thing.
<br />
<br />
You can click here for a link to download Microsoft Security Essentials. <br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. <br />
<br />
<br />
Marilyn<br />

<h3> lukeusherwood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resizing Application &#40;UWP&#41; Windows is broken</h2>
                    <p>SYMPTOM: I resize a window larger, but only the Window border grows larger. The size of the painted area stays the same.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Happens on multiple UWP (Windows-10style) "apps" such as <strong>Settings!, sticky-notes</strong>,
<strong>photo viewer</strong>,.<br />
</li><li>Happens on <strong>two </strong>very different 64-bit Windows 10 computers:
<ul>
<li>Dell XPS 15 laptop with 4k monitor running Intel embedded graphics. (Since an upgrade, I believe)<br />
</li><li>Desktop with HD monitor running Nvidia GeForce 1060 graphics card. (Newly purchased &amp; installed Windows 10 ISO.)<br />
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p style="text-align: left">Only workaround is to resize the window to the desired size, kill it using ALT+F4 (usually the "red X" isn't visible) and restart. Needless to say, this is very inconvenient.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows version on the laptop: Windows 10 Pro update 1703 (10.0.15063 Build 15063)<br />
</p>
<p>One screenshot is in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/resizing-window-applications-broken/a0a7fff5-fc68-4e10-bd8b-98eeb8b4efb7">
this (locked) question</a>. Surely this is a windows bug, no? Any solutions to it? (I would prefer not to upgrade to a later update just yet, on advice from my IT department &amp; I heard that I'd lose Paint!)</p>

                    <p>Whenever i uses my integrated web cam horizontal line appears on the screen. In starting i assume that it may be due to the flicker reduction so i decreased it and the same problem appears again. I also try to solve this by changing the screen refresh rate
 .Issue appear in both high,medium and low light.When it comes to hardware i run a online diagnostic test everything seems good.Now i cant figure out that it is a hardware issue or a software .I also reset the settings of the camera.Lines flow all over the
 screen .</p>

                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Just updated as well, and thought I would finally give the windows 10 start menu a go, and not use classic shell. But I'm unsure whether my&nbsp;start menu is broken, and I should do a clean install.<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><ul>
<li>I can drag a tile from the start menu to the desktop, but I can't drag a desktop icon to the start menu so it becomes a windows 10 tile icon?</li><li>I can right-click a tile and pin a shortcut to the taskbar, but again, I can't right-click a shortcut from the taskbar and pin it to the start menu.</li><li>When dragging tiles around, I have to wait before the animation is done until I can start the next drag.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I only have two options, large square or small square. Wasn't there a time, where you could have wide and tall and huge tiles? Or does that only works for apps :/? (I don't use any windows 10 apps)</li><li>I can't rename a pinned shortcut?</li><li>And is there still no option to add custom images to icons and make them look nice?</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><br />
Have Microsoft not had 4 years with these new "tile icons"? And it is till this bad?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The only way for me to pin a program to the start menu is by locating it in the programs list in the start menu and drag or right-click to pin it. I use multiple versions of the same program, but the programs list in the start
 menu only shows one, so how on earth to I add a shortcut to the other versions then?</span><br />

<p>
</p><p>We appreciate that you shared your experience about Windows 10 Start menu. At the same time, we'd like to advise you that the features of the Start menu have limitations in terms of customizing the tiles and pinning them from the taskbar and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although your Start menu is not broken, we still highly encourage that you post your feedback using the
<strong>Feedback Hub</strong> on your PC to let our developers know of what needs to be improved and what we can potentially add to it's feature once we roll out the next patch.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards. </p>

            <p>I think your error is saying a corrupted file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From NTStatus.h</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>//<br />
// MessageId: STATUS_INVALID_FILE_FOR_SECTION<br />
//<br />
// MessageText:<br />
//<br />
// {Bad File}<br />
// The attributes of the specified mapping file for a section of memory cannot be read.<br />
//<br />
#define STATUS_INVALID_FILE_FOR_SECTION&nbsp; ((NTSTATUS)0xC0000020L)<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ifyou poke -1073741792 into calculator and convert to hex it becomes FFFFFFFFC0000020 (ignore the Fs it a 32 bit status code in a 64 bit memory width).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <i>Control Panel</i> (and select <i>Classic view</i> in the left hand pane) choose
<i>Problem Reports and Solutions</i> (type problem in Start's search box), go to <i>
Problem History</i>, right click and choose <i>Details</i> for more info. <strong>
Post those details here. </strong>The <em>Fault Module Name</em> is the important information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem affects Control Panel press <strong>Winkey + R</strong> and type
<em>wercon</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to know the file name as you can't start SFC.</p>

<h2>            Trouble with Central America Spanish keyboard setting</h2>
                    <p>Impossible to find</p>
<p>
</p><p>My physical keyboard is Spanish for Central America. Two options on Windows 10 are given. Option 1 is "<em>Spanish</em>". Option 2 is "<em>Spanish Variation</em>".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With both options, when I type, the output is incorrect with many keys. When selecting those options, the computer does some changes with the keyboard setting; but, none of them match. many keys are mixed up ... impossible to edit my work accurately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the On Screen Keyboard with both options. There is no match between my physical keyboard and the OSK with both options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It s a&nbsp; new laptop . The change I had to do with the laptop was to reinstall Windows to get the English version of Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 English version needs to be updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do&nbsp;&nbsp; .... i .e. I cannot find the interrogation sign</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need assistance</p>
<p>

<p>I originally seen two other identical errors yesterday after my Xbox Live profile&nbsp;mysteriously disappeared from my Xbox 360 and I tried to Download it. I eventually checked to see if was my Hard-Drive by pulling it out and using a USB thumb-drive, but it
 didn't work either way. I then checked with Xbox 360 support and was on the phone for nearly 3 hours and they had me try many different things but none of them worked (sadly). And so I decided today that I would try it again and it ran much longer into the
 download, but it disconnected with a different error code:</p>
<p>80151911</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I decided to Google it to see if anyone else had a error like this, and I have not seen anyone else with an error like mine. And I was wondering if anyone else received this error, and if you guy's had any idea how to fix it.</p>

<p>Hey mate, try deleting your profile from your console (profile only), then clear your cache three times in a row one after the other. After that, then try and re-download your profile and see if it works.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If that doesn't work have a look through your HDD and see if you can find any corrupted profiles/files and delete them from the harddrive and try to redownload your profile again.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>You can tell a file is corrupted as it will be indicated with a yellow bar or triangle can't remember exactly, but it's indicated by something yellow on the file!</p>

<p>Also, my profile never appears in the first place, I have cleared the cache numerous times (I have even reverted back to a previous update) I have also gone through and cleared all corrupted data, as I have said, I spent three hours on the phone with one
 of Microsoft's specialists to no avail, but figured it wouldn't hurt to ask others.</p>

            <p>Hey there Reaper!<br /><br />Do you know anyone with an Xbox 360 console near you that would let you try downloading your profile onto their console? If you are able to perform that test, it'll give us a hint as to whether the issue lies with your profile or your console/storage device or perhaps your network.<br /><br />Let us know how that goes and we'll work with you from there! ^_^</p>

            Hi Aeri,<br />
<br />
Are you referring to the technology of showing the contents of one video display device on the screen of another device at the same time? For example, sending the screen contents of a computer, smartphone or tablet to a TV.<br />
<br />
If this is the video mirroring you were pertaining to, Windows Media Player doesn't support this feature.<br />
<br />
You may want to check third-party providers that supports this kind of video rendering.<br />
<br />
If you have other concerns, don't hesitate to get back to us.

            <p>Hi K-Moth,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you would like to recover a deleted folder from your Windows Live Mail. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that retrieving your folders in Windows Live Mail is not available. What you can do is to check your emails in web and try to recover them. However, based from what you have stated, it seems that you alreadry tried to recover your deleted
 emails from Outlook.com and nothing was there. Outlook.com will recover as many messages as possible and put them in your
<span>Deleted</span> folder. If you don't see the deleted messages that you wanted, it means they are permanently lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><font color="#000000">If some of your messages are available only in Windows Live Mail, then there's no way for us to retrieve them. To prevent this from happening again, I suggest that you back up your files.<span>See
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">How do I import and export email, contacts, and calendars with Windows Live Mail?</span></strong></a></span></font></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you are using POP account, please check if the setting to leave a copy of the email on the server is selected. To do it, click on mail account in Windows Live Mail, select Properties, then Server, lastly Delivery. If the option, ‘should not
 be set to delete email from the server’ then there should still be a copy of the emails available on the server. If not, those emails are unfortunately gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to these steps on how to recover lost or deleted emails in Live Mail:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Remove the account from Windows Live Mail.<br />
1.1 Right click on the account as displayed on the folder pane.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1.2 Click <font><b>Remove account</b>.<br />
1.3 Confirm the action by clicking <b>Yes</b>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Add the account again.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
3. Right click on the account as displayed on the folder pane.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
4. Click on <font><b>Download all folders</b>.</font></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
5. Wait for Live Mail to download all your folders and email headers.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
6. Check if all your folders have been downloaded. If it does, proceed to the next step, if not go back to step 1.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
7. Press on <font><b>F5</b> on your keyboard or click on Send and Receive button to synch all your emails to Windows Live Mail.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note: The option will not take effect to lost/deleted emails. This is a preventive measure to avoid losing emails again.</span></span></p>
</span></font></span></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><font color="#000000"><span>Should you have further questions, please let us know.</span></font></span></span></p>

            <p>Hello Charla, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delayed response on your inquiry. I understand that you have lost a folder that contains important messages on Windows Live Mail and you want to get it back. Let me help you with your concern.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As what Alden mentioned on his post, the specific folder that you are looking for on Windows Live Mail cannot be recovered only the contents inside of it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually, messages that have been deleted on your mail client would still be available when you access your account using the web browser. You can also check for this path in order to find you emails on your hard drive:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Storage Folders\Deleted Items</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the emails&nbsp;are no longer available on your server through a web browser, there is a slim chance of recovering the emails that you are looking for.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know about the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

    <title>Anyone have problems with sales tax not changing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oni of truth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Anyone have problems with sales tax not changing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So essentially the problem is that I'm getting charges 9% sales tax and not 7%. I use to live in Alabama (9% sales tax) but live in Florida now (7% sales tax). I've lived in Florida for 5 years now and my Xbox has only existed in Florida and when I moved I changed everything associated with my profile to Florida. Still in these 5 years I havr only been charged 9% sales tax. I talked to Microsoft rep online and they told me we have nothing to with how much is taxed and to talk to local government to figure it out. Seemed like a cop out and they just wanted to end the convo quickly. Has anyone had this problem? I imagine people move around a lot and taxes are different, right?</p>

            <p>Microsoft has issues with how they deal with sales tax I do not believe that they even read the dam tax codes that they are collecting taxes for if they did they would find a lot of problems I am sure.&nbsp; I dealt with them all the sudden out of nowhere started charging me a sales tax unlawfully I might add.&nbsp; To date they are not able to fix the problem so I would say you may never see a change unless Microsoft finds a way to fix their problem.&nbsp; I would imagine that your local tax code has something in it in relation to the resolution of your problem I would research it and then contact customer support through online chat as best I found in my troubles for getting this type of issue at least looked at.&nbsp; If unsuccessful look up Microsoft Financial code of conduct and advise them of the fact that they are violating your local tax laws.</p>
