<h2>            Graphics not rendering properly&#63; Solution&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>For years now I've worked in the gaming retail industry. &nbsp;I talk to gaming fanatics across all systems about many different topics, but one keeps coming up...</p>

<p><em>"Sometimes my graphics look like they didn't load properly, if at all."</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;Understandably, when a new and exciting game hits the shelves this day in age, everyone is sure to be hyped to play it. &nbsp;For instance, when
<em>Gears of War 3</em> came around, I couldn't get enough of it. &nbsp;The developers and publishers want you to have the best experience with that game, as do all of us ambassadors and above. &nbsp;One of the biggest features to deliver that experience are the graphics.
 &nbsp;Next generation consoles such as the XBOX 360 should always give you beautiful and crisp graphics, but sometimes... they seem to fall short.</p>

<p><em>"Can I fix that?!"</em></p>

<p><strong>Yes, you certainly can!</strong> &nbsp;The XBOX 360 offers a great solution. &nbsp;<strong>Simply installing your game to the hard drive!</strong> &nbsp;When a game is installed, it will allow content to load much faster, graphics will sharpen almost instantly
 and the overall flow of game play is seamless. &nbsp;It also causes less wear and tear on your disc drive, which is something I think we can all appreciate! &nbsp;This is how you install a game to your hard drive!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Step 1:</strong></span> Insert the game you wish you install into your disc drive</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Step 2:</strong></span> Go into the game details. &nbsp;It should be the "<strong>Y</strong>" button for pre-Metro dashboard update, and the "<strong>X</strong>" button for post-Metro dashboard update.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Step 3:</strong></span> Once you into the games details, there should be an option that states "Install game to hard drive". &nbsp;Click that!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Step 4:</strong></span> Wait the time period [generally anywhere between 5-20 minutes] for the disc to install. &nbsp;Once completed, you're good to enjoy that game the way it was meant to be played!</p>

<p><strong>Be aware</strong> that most games average anywhere between 3gb - 6gb install size on your hard drive.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;If you're using the 360 Slim Arcade console, you'll be unable to install your game as you only have 4gb of room.</span> &nbsp;20gb internal hard drives and up are applicable to install a game. &nbsp;Also bare in mind that if a
 game is installed on your hard drive, that the game is <strong>REQUIRED</strong> to be in your disc drive while playing for licensing purposes. &nbsp;Piracy is bad, kids.</p>

<p>So there you have it! &nbsp;Install your favorite and/or most played games next time you have a chance. &nbsp;If you weren't having graphical issues, installing your game will at least decrease load times as well as save your disc drive in the long run! &nbsp;ENJOY! :)</p>

<p>Note that not all games require the installation in order for the graphics to load properly. &nbsp;Games I've noticed with this issue within the last 6 months or so have been Dead Island, Gears of War 3, Halo Anniversary and Skyrim. &nbsp;It's understandable, especially
 with Gears of War 3 and Skyrim, that the game needs to be installed first. &nbsp;If you wrap your mind around everything that your console is attempting to load at once... it's quite a bit.</p>
<p>Regardless, installation makes your console operate under better circumstances which will prolong its overall life.</p>

<h2>            Explorer and &#34;StateRepository State Repository Service&#34; causing extreme loading times on folders with Images.</h2>
                    <p>Hello people,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a fairly well spec'd PC and windows (10, creators update) runs on a SSD and lately windows struggles opening/displaying/managing folders with lots of images in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just trying to Delete an image or even create a folder In the folder in question causes the folder to hang, a green loading bar and 40%+ CPU usage from the above mentioned processes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm usually pretty adept at solving issues like this purely by googling or good 'ole know how - but this has me stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not running 3rd party antivirus or anything special/funky in the background (gaming pc, so keep background processes to a minimum).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a fairly fresh (less than 3 months old) install of windows too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More than happy to answer all questions as best as possible to get to the bottom of this, maybe someone can think of something I haven't already tried troubleshooting wise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            I'm running Windows 10 Pro , build 1709 . I have tried uninstalling programs , reinstalling Windows , creating secondary accounts .<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;The end result is the same , everything is FINE , right until I try to browse ANY folder with Explorer . At that time , Windows State Repository starts to consume 50% CPU or greater . Explorer will go unresponsive for a long period of time . The longest
 I have let it run , when trying to view a documents folder with roughly 500 documents of various types , but no media ( no pictures , music or video files ) that took 9 minutes for it to recover and display files . Tried to delete a SINGLE file , and the system
 took nearly 3 minutes to delete it , but did NOT refresh the page . I did a manual refresh of the page , and the file was deleted . All of this took place on a system that was fresh reinstalled. No other programs at all loaded yet .

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
You can perform a clean boot to isolate this concern. A clean boot will help eliminates software conflicts that occur when you install a program, update, or when you run a program in Windows 10. For instructions, you may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to normal startup mode.<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Service host: state repository service was consuming up to 60% of my 8700k, slowing my computer down. When clicking URL's in Mumble, the URL's wouldn't load (or even start the browser) for 1-2 minutes. This seemed to increase the CPU load of state repository
 service. Same issue when clicking searching results on Bing or starting file downloads in Microsoft Edge. The website would hang for a minute or two before loading the page.&nbsp;Chrome does not have this issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#40;Error 1935&#41; An error occurred during the installation of assembly.</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to install MS Flight Simulator X Steam edition but couldn't launch the game due to it not being able to install certain programs. I've suspected it might be Microsoft installer. I used a .NET framework repairer and it said something about
 Microsoft installer ran that and it said it fixed it but it didn't. And this doesn't only apply to Flight Sim it also happened when I was trying to install MS Visual C++ 2008 as seen in the photo below. Please help i'll put specs down below.</p>

<h3> rar-er  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 10586  - FOUND FIX for system error 1231 bug &#40; network shares broken, missing machines on network, etc &#41;</h2>
                    <p>OK, this was puzzling for a while, after update to build 10586, cannot see anything else&nbsp;in WORKGROUP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NET VIEW gives error 1231 !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Discovered that this new Windows build has magically become CASE SENSITIVE to machine names!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF you have missing shares or completely disappeared machines on your LAN, make sure their machine names are not mixed-case. If they are mixed case, rename them to ALL CAPS and then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem SOLVED, they will no longer be invisible on your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just posting this for the benefit of anyone else who may have machines that are ping-able, and have good&nbsp;&nbsp;DNS name resolution, but it seems that NETBIOS resolution is 'somehow' broken, even though it is properly enabled. What I&nbsp;discovered today was that
 somehow the latest Win10 build has become slightly CASE-SENSITIVE - and this breaks the old NETBIOS standard going back to antiquity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So rename your "invisible" shares or machine names to UPPER-CASE, and they will magically appear on your WORKGROUP again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, feel free to send me my bug-finder's bounty-hunter check&nbsp; :-)</p>

            <p>Finally found the fix. Works on two machines so far. <br />
Problem was Linux box is not visible.</p>
<p>Solution: On Linux box limit samba to SMB1. Add the following line to smb.conf under
</p>
<p>[global]</p>
<p>max protocol = SMB1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart samba on Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 10 run: </p>
<p>
</p><p>sc.exe config lanmanworkstation depend= bowser/mrxsmb10/nsi<br />
sc.exe config mrxsmb20 start= disabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made it into a batch file and run as administrator.</p>
<p>restart windows computer and the linux box appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said it works on two so far will now run it on my other Win 10 machines. The Windows 7 PC's don't have the problem.</p>
<p>Just modifying the registry is not sufficient you must limit the protocol to smb1</p>
<p>Update: </p>
<p>Fixed all 4 Window 10 machines including insider preview one.</p>
<p>Machine names and case seem irrelevant. I use HOME-NET for workgroup.</p>

                    Bought this ASUS a week ago. &nbsp;Asked to update, watched it work up to 100% and now it's been stuck saying "working on features 100% complete don't turn off your computer". &nbsp;It will not do anything. &nbsp;No buttons or suggestions on this site have worked. &nbsp;Need
 to print out my resume a job for an interview tomorrow and really don't want to explain this situation as why I can't. &nbsp;Need help immediately.&nbsp;

 Yes think it's time to go to Apple! I filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<h2>            I want to hear Stories&#33;</h2>
                    What's up, Ladies and Gentlemen. I just want to start a post where people can share their amazing gaming stories because I like listening to people's stories.So let's post all the fun times we've had with the hobby we all love. I'll start off. Some of
 my favorite moments in my gaming life have been in Black ops 2 zombies. Specifically, when we created our initiation ceremony on Die Rise. The Ceremony is simple. Trap the initiate on the elevator and get them killed by being crushed. Or if that doesn't work
 you get the sliquifier&nbsp;(<span>I</span>&nbsp;think that's what it's called) and lube up the entrance to the elevator and get them to fall in. We've made many a friend angry with this but we have initiated ALL of our friends lol.

            The best story from me was when my squad got eliminated at the 4th place mark and I was able to respawn them and we scavenged what little supplies we could and we got revenge on the last squad. The vindication from that moment was euphoric!&nbsp;

<p><strong>GEARS OF WAR</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah baby!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally defeated Raam!! One of my first games I played on Xbox. Bought my Xbox 360 about 7 years back and a colleague suggested I buy this game. Low on cash, I went and bought a "pre-played" game. Could not wait to get home and start this game. When I
 got home I installed the game and started it up. Jammed a few nights and just could not put my controller down.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Well, until I came to the very last mission...To defeat Raam. One ugly character. Got so angry from constantly dying, I put my controller down and switched of the console and TV before I had no TV or controller left. A few months went by, and I decided to
 upgrade to the Xbox One. So Gears of War became backwards compatible and I was stoked. I decided to try and defeat Raam once again. Guess what......Controller was put down and everything was switched off once again.</p>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>After a few weeks, I was browsing through my game collection and saw Gears of War and thought to myself, Raam is dying tonight. I Died about 8 times (got super irritated once again) so I then decided to watch some YouTube videos on how to defeat this ugly
 dude. I Then noticed that I can switch my weapons(duh...forgot this from not playing it that often anymore). So I closed YouTube and and went straight back in and Raam was defeated. I was super chuffed with myself. Now it's on to Gears of War 2!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming players!</p>

<p>I have one that I like to bring up with my wife every once in a while, way back before we were married. We used to play a game City of Heroes together, pretty much all the time, which if you've never heard of it it was a superhero-based MMO. Be forewarned:
 this is not an Xbox-related story, so I'll be a little more descriptive with terms and such (especially since the game has been shut down for a few years now.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, like I said my wife and I used to play this game often. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I played as a Defender, a hero whose primary purpose was to buff/heal other heroes on my team. My primary (most powerful) powers were Empathy (healing and endurance buffs, player revives) and my secondary was Power Blasts (ranged blasts... of power[?]),
 with a flying/teleporting travel powers as well as a few other additional team buffs from the power pool sets. Basically, I was one of the only Defenders most people knew that could solo, which was pretty fun.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife went a different route and played as a Fire/Power Blaster, which was a ranged damage dealer that specializes in DoT. Of course, because Blasters were ranged fighters, but they weren't really great up close. (Many players called them "squishies,"
 after how easily they could be taken out if you're not careful.) Since I was the healer, I'd basically spend most of my time healing/reviving her when we got overrun by melee-centric baddies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time, I would be playing on my PC in one room, while my wife (then girlfriend) would be playing on a PC in another. It wasn't practical to move said computers next to each other at the time, so we relied heavily on the in-game chat feature to communicate
 with each other and with our team mates. Communicating was easy: hit enter on the keyboard, type what you want to say, then hit enter again to send the message. Obviously, you didn't want to hit enter while you were trying to hit command keys during a fight
 (such as the ever popular R key, which made you run/fly forward until you hit it again), but for the most part it was pretty intuitive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, enough set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One time we hooked up with a small team of heroes that were going to take down an Elite Boss (a pretty difficult type of boss) which was surrounded by some smaller Bosses and LTs (difficult and slightly less difficult targets.) Our group had spent a lot
 of time clearing out the mission of enemies, leaving us with the small group of bad guys that were not only one level higher than us, but also included the AV. We knew it was going to be a tough fight, but we had a good team and if we played our cards right,
 we could make it out in one piece.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea was that I (as the defender) would buff everyone's healing and endurance rate, while running my Leadership powers to further buff their damage and accuracy. Our tank (I'm sure you get what that's supposed to be) would run in first in order to attract
 the aggro from the Elite Boss, then every other melee character would run in while my wife and I would hang back and deal damage/heal from afar. We just had to wait to recover from our last fight while some of the more important buffs recharged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, out of nowhere, it happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly, from the other room, I can hear my wife start yelling. "No! No! Stop! No, stop!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, her hero suddenly lurched forward, running straight at the group of (rather deadly) villains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our team watched in a rather stunned silence, watching the squishy blaster run head on into the EB. It didn't take long for us to figure out what happened when a chat bubble appeared above her head, reading: "Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsssssssadadsaddassaddassddasasddasdasdas!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The EB was not amused, and neither was his little posse. She had all of their attention now, and she knew it. They all turned to the poor, unfortunate blaster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She realized she had mad a horrible, horrible mistake. Out of pure desperation, she managed to chuck a single fireball at the EB, which burst pathetically against his head. It probably only tickled him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The group of villains all fired back. There was no way to win... at least, not as a lone blaster. A split second later she was down, and the villains went back to standing around looking menacing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately for the rest of us, who had managed to resist the urge to run in after her, the villains remained blissfully unaware of the rest of our team. It took a moment, but the first word to break the following silence was a "Huh" by one of our teammates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Well, that's one way to do it." said another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying not to laugh, knowing exactly what had happened. Meanwhile, my future wife is in the next room, cursing at her keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I quickly teleported her hero out of mess of bad guys and revived her, and our team eventually went in an avenged her without further losses or problems. But we all had a good laugh about it the time my wife did a Leroy Jenkins.</p>

            &nbsp;We do need the actual DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
If you are overclocking stop.&nbsp; (chances are if you dont know if you are, you are not)<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.<br />
<br />
The procedure:<br />
* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the copy.<br />
* Please upload them to a file sharing service like Skydrive or"Rapidshare" and put a link to them in your reply.<br />
<br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.<br />
<br />
Please also run MSinfo32 and upload the output as well.<br />

            I think it is extremely <i>unlikely </i>that you are going to be able to send any dump files, but do see how that works out for you.<br />
<br />
I think it is extremely <i>unlikely </i>that you will be able to boot in any kind of mode.<br />

I think it is extremely <i>likely </i>that if the MS Answers forums would prompt for a little information when a new question is asked, you might be done (or further along) by now.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately,the MS Answers forums does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know next to nothing nothing about your system.
<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
If the system was working okay yesterday, what do you think happened between yesterday and today?<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Lifecam Cinema Install Issues on Win7</h2>
                    
<p>OK. I usually have a hold on this type of stuff, but this is driving me insane.</p>
<p>I install the software. I plug it in when it says to. It installs the drivers....but one of them does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Lifecam Cinema - Installed Correctly.</p>
<p>Cinema - Microsoft Lifecam - Failed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The camera is listed in my devices, but it doesn't work with anything at all, not even it's own software.</p>
<p>Um, please help me. I've uninstalled, rebooted, re-installed, rebooted, and it's the same thing every time.</p>
<p>I've downloaded the latest version from Microsoft. Same thing.</p>
<p>I've tried every USB port. Same thing.</p>
<p>I'm using an Intel DP43TF board on a home built rig. I only have a Razr Naga Mouse and an Apple Slim Keyboard plugged into the USB ports.</p>
<p>I'm at my wits end and I'm about to throw the thing away. Please help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>a. What exactly happens when you try to use Microsoft Lifecam Cinema?<br />
b. Do you get any error messages?</p>
<p>I suggest you to run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and check.</p>
<p>If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer
 was installed correctly.</p>
<p>To know how to run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter, refer the below link:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If nothing helps, temporarily turn off User account Control (UAC) and then try installing the software again check.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Control Panel-&gt;User Accounts-&gt;Switch UAC On/Off-&gt;UAC.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clear the checkbox which says - Switch UAC On/Off-&gt;UAC<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer and check if the issue persists or not.</p>
<p>Note: Do enable it once you are done.</p>
<p>Check for bangs in device manager. (To open device manager, click on start and in the search bar, type in as devmgmt.msc and hit enter.)</p>
<p>You may also try connecting that webcam on different computer and check if works there. This is to make sure that your webcam is working.</p>
<p>Troubleshoot installing Intellipoint, IntelliType, or LifeCam software<br />

<div>If you're looking to get answers to questions like that from</div>
<div>Microsoft, you've come to the wrong place. This is a support forum</div>
<div>where you should come for answers to "can I...," "how do I...," and</div>
<div>"what should I do in this circumstance" types of questions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are almost all just Windows 7 users here, people who are willing to</div>
<div>help others when they can. There are a few Microsoft employees here</div>
<div>too, but they are essentially doing the same thing as the rest of us</div>
<div>non-Microsoft people--helping others when they can.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So if you've got a complaint, take it someplace where you can address</div>
<div>Microsoft directly.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 to Windows 10 RDP not functioning correctly.</h2>
                    <p>For a little while now I have not been able to RDP functionally to the windows 10 machines in our office.&nbsp; My home machine has Windows 10 pro 64 bit as do the machines I am having issues connecting to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The connection is made and sometimes it will show me the desktop on the machine I am connecting to but whatever I do see is just a frozen picture.&nbsp; Even mouse clicks are getting through.&nbsp; If I click on excel to open it, it does open I just can't see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have several machines still running Windows 7.&nbsp; I can remote into those just fine.&nbsp; If I remote to a Windows 7 machine and use that to remote into the windows 10 machine it will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am at the office Windows 10 to Windows 10 works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried lowering the experience level and not using local printers and changing turning off bitmap cache.&nbsp; I have looked to see if my firewall was stopping it and don't see anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>When I drag'n'drop a folder - with files (and maybe folders) in it from one folder to another, and the destination folder has files with the same name as the source windows 7 presents me with an 'action selection panel' that allows me to have all the files
 in the source location that have&nbsp;the same names as those&nbsp;in the destination location to be copies with new names assigned so that I can then check later for the files being actual duplicates, or different content with&nbsp;what were the same names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WINDOWS 10 "FILE EXPLORER" &nbsp;does not present a similar option.</p>
<p>

            I transfer from USB linked handheld computer and in windows 7 I always grabbed the 3 files cut them from the linked computer and pasted them in my desktops appropriate folder. &nbsp;If they had the same name it would give me the option to save both files now
 I get only 2 options 1. Overright or Skip?????? &nbsp;And because of the stupid permission issues with 10 it will not let me rename them on the linked computer either so I have to copy them to another spot rename then move????

            <p>Do you have a decide for each file individually option - and if so, does it take you to a two column list of old and possible new files - if so, there should be tick boxes at the top of each column to tell windows 10 to keep all old files and rename the
 new ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The auto number facility is useful for keeping a historic trail of file versions, int'it!</p>

            A dialog box listing duplicate file names will appear asking you if you want to save the existing file or the newer one. If you select both files (existing + new one), windows will save both by adding a suffix number to the newer file.

            <p>It's not just the extra keystrokes that's so annoying. It's having to wade through two different dialogs where one used to suffice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More keystrokes and more confusion. And the options presented in the first dialog box aren't even consistent. If only one file is being moved the needed option says, "Compare info for both files." But if multiple files are being moved it says, "Let me decide
 for each file."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Huh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two dialogs need to be condensed into one which is the same every time, as it was in previous iterations of Windows. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p>

<p>This happened back in 2016 and no one had access to my account back then. I contacted Xbox Support and they said this must be a glitch, we'll remove the game. And so they did remove it but I didn't realize the game was never removed from my TrueAchievements
 account (I also contacted TrueAchievements support and they said they&nbsp;force scanned my account and the game kept appearing).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I calculated my&nbsp;Gamerscore and obviously it still includes 45G extra.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how to contact Xbox Support now because the option to chat with a support agent is not available anymore and I can't call them because I am not in US or Canada.&nbsp;<br />

article</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you agree with the author? Personally I don't - I feel Mass Effect series, the story is gripping and the characters are unique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;What are you views and thoughts?</p>

<p>i agree that there's not enough role-playing, but that's it. i really enjoy the characters and how they personally see the universe, i like the dialog tree, though there are a few things that could definitely make it better.the story and universe history
 is fantastic, definitely one of the best, if not the best, created this generation.</p>

<p>Honestly, the game itself doesnt appeal to me at all, and it never has.... the series just feels "done" already to me. Mass effect 3 is nowhere near the top of my want list, but i will give it a shot when it drops in price.</p>

<p>I agree with part of the list;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't find the repetition much of an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The characters are fine, it's more the way the game is structured in terms of communicating that is an issue (see below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dialog trees are horrible, it feels so artificial. (Then again it could be worse, it could be DA2). And won't it be great with Kinnect when you can read a sentence, then say a sentence and then listen to your character say a sentence based (roughly)
 on what you just read and said! Yipee! /sarcasm</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story, well, the world is definately good, my biggest issue on that front is the whole "Hey, we're humanity, aren't we awesome" *strokes ego for the rest of the game* thing. Also Mass Effect 2 was no where near as epic as Mass Effect 1, the first game
 felt like you had a universe for a playground the second felt like you had a continent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Role-playing in the series, well the dialog tree is too rigid and artificial for real role-playing and the QTEs are pretty much the antithesis of roleplaying. The customisation is lacking. Not much of a fan on that front.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've certainly enjoyed both of the previous ME games but I won't be buying the third straight away (partly because I'll probably still be playing Skyrim).</p>

<p>[/quote]Only Mass Effect 2 is lacking in RPG elements. Bioware clearly stated in their Game Informer article that they are "bringing back the RPG"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, Whoever wrote that is clearly a moron. I could type up a long winded 5 reasons why I'm not looking forward to MW3, but that would just be an ignorant waste of time. The bottom line is, some games appeal to certain people, and some games don't. Only
 an idiot would try to convince people not to be interested in a game their looking forward to.</p>

<p>It seems that Bioware's interpretation of bring back RPG elements is a weapons customisation set-up like Obsidian had in Alpha Protocol. To be honest that turned out to be little more than cosmetic in how it operated, so hopefully that wont be the case in
 Mass Effect 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bioware have also said that Mass Effect 3 is going to be more action-adventure-y than Mass Effect 2

http://www.computerandvideogames.com/312681/mass-effect-3-will-be-more-action-adventure-y-than-me2/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bioware have burnt a lot of the faith I used to have in them. I just hope with the increasing focus on action, they don't end up sacrificing the strong story telling they are known for.</p>

<p>Hiya, MB_1966_lx!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from Xbox Forums Team here to assist with the issue. It sounds like you'd like to adjust the setting on the child account. To help with this issue the first thing to do is to make sure we are signed into the parental account at our
<a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Website</a>. While signed into the parent account you can then adjust the child's settings under the Family tab. For more information regarding this issue here is a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/security/cannot-change-my-privacy-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Hi Ganesh, my previous reply does not seem to have gone through.
<div><br />
<div>First, Thanks for responding to my help request.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My situation is as follows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. I purchased this desktop about a month ago, with Windows Vista (Home) Basic, pre-installed.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;sp1 and ap2 not installed. Its a ACER Core (2) Duo, 2.33 Ghz, with 2GB RAM. ( X-86 based 32 bit)</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. In windows update (history), nothing shows up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. When I press un-intall an update, on Up-date history screen, the following updates have been done.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.6 Kernal mode driver framework v1.7 (KB950051)</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. &nbsp;I have tried Auto trouble shooting method, Fix IT, without success, even though it did report about&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; reparing windows update components and changing data locations.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. I am on a wireless connection, (via a dongle) and for the moment have no option to get a wired &nbsp;connection. My connection seems to fine, as I can go to any site.</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. I have tried and re-tried Windows update many times , but always comes up with above error.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;And I have change settings to Auto Update on a daily basis.</div>
<div><br />

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;7.7 SSL enabled sites can be connected.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;7.8 I am not SURE about whether a file or a program is preventing loading up windows update.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;7.10 System file checker did not report any corrupted files.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;7.11 DLL's NOT Regitered.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;7.12 Windows Installer set to Manual start up. BITS, WorkSTN and Windows update set to auto start.</div>

<h2>            Skype Live Chat</h2>
                    <p>I am now officially fed up! For 3 days now I have been going around in circles trying to resolve an issue with Skype. I have asked a question in the community and received no answer. I have tried to contact Skype customer services and am not able to do that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the link that allegedly is supposed to allow you to contact customer services it tells me the service is not available and I cannot for the life of me find how I am supposed to be able to contact live chat!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really disappointed with the current set up and it is not my usual Microsoft experience! Meanwhile I am unable to speak with friends using Skype and am no closer to resolving the issue!</p>

<p>Hey Dave</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too am stuck in a sucky Skype loop &nbsp;where there is no real customer service. I suddenly cannot log in to my Skype account via the app but I can log into my account in a browser, but can't make free calls with my contacts...huh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, best to you. I hope you get through.</p>

<p>Hi Paul</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your best wishes, as of this moment still getting nowhere and no response from the community after 6 days! It really is a shocking state of affairs!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did contact Microsoft support who are very good in my experience but they are not apparently able to do anything regarding Skype! I am due to speak with a friend tomorrow and have no idea if Skype is going to work correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really poor customer service and I have to say Skype was much better before Microsoft bought it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you have had more luck than me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best Dave.</p>

<p>HI Paul and Dave,</p>
<p>Seems like an epidemic with Skype. I have even tried constantly to call tech support but lo and behold their line is always busy, and I mean always. I haven't tried to call out today, but was able to call friends a few days ago. I hope I still can because
 I've paid for Skype # and have lots of credits left. This issue caused me to miss an important delivery the other day because the driver couldn't find my place and tried to call me 15 times; I had no notification from Skype and no incoming ringtone. The company
 cancelled my order, they did refund my money but charged me the $5.00 tip the driver should have gotten upon delivery. This is insanity, I hope they straighten out their issues soon.</p>
<p>Best of luck to us all, joy</p>
        </p>

</p><p>I would be even more miffed if I was paying for Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have heard back on the Community and have tried their suggestions I was due to use Skype today but my friend was not available, I am next due to speak with another friend on Sunday, so fingers crossed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to you too!</p>

            Well I was able to call out, thankfully yet still no incoming ringtone. I dove back into that vicious circle again,this time went to settings, logging: diagnostic on and then&nbsp; did the recreate thing so they (someone) could "capture" it, not sure if it
 worked since I could only recreate it by calling my Skype phone from my brother's cell phone. I hit submit anyway and was guided to the feedback hub or something like that. Clicked on one of the comments that sounded similar to mine and lo and behold, a moderator
 had actually replied to this person's question. I left a reply explaining all this all over again and hope for a productive answer from support or the moderator or ??? Anyways if you haven't been there suggest you give it a try, wouldn't hurt, but its my last
 thread of hope with them. Sorry if sounding sour, I will survive ) Take care and good hunting&nbsp; :) joy

<p>I tried speaking with my friend this morning and was unable to make the call! I have left a reply with the person who contacted me from Skype to update them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all their suggestions and have got absolutely nowhere! I have asked if there is some way (like Microsoft Helpdesk) that I can actually get someone to check my connection and my Skype set up but have not heard back yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is obviously a major issues with Skype! I am due to make another call on Thursday with another friend but have resigned myself to the fact that it will not happen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you have got your problem resolved!</p>

<p>Hi All,&nbsp; This is not just a "Skype for Windows 10", issue.&nbsp; I am running Skype on windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last month Microsoft has again re-scripted Skype addin in and taking out components, (eg spell check).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Late last year one could chat with a technician, now all one gets is a runaround only to end up chatting to a robot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has confused my Skype account, (I have had for 6 years), with my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot update my Skype details not can I get technical assistance from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shame on you Microsoft!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am relieved that I am not the only one having problems! While I concede that I am not the most computer literate person in the world, I am not a complete idiot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now received a reply from someone asking me to run a programme and forward the results to them, which I have done, it will be interesting to see if this produces results!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is frustrating is that it was working fine until about 2 weeks ago and has now ceased to function. Microsoft Helpdesk are not able to assist with Skype issues, so we are all apparently stuck in limbo!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you get a resolution to your problems soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best Dave.</p>

            I upgraded to the new 7.37.0.103. Now half of my favorite contacts inly sow up in the "recent" column but not in mt "contacts" list. I can't move them back. When I click a name in "recent" it will only "remove from favorites". This is a mess.
