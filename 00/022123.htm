<h2>            Excel 2010 not releasing memory when copying and inserting rows</h2>
                    <p>OS: Win7 32-Bit</p>
<p>HW: Fujitsu T901 Laptop, Intel Core i5 vPro, 4 Gb RAM</p>
<p>Excel 2010 - I have a spreadsheet with a lot of vlookups and when I copy and insert rows the memory usage keeps going up untill Excel crashes with message "Excel cannot complete the task with available resources.Choose less data or close other apps." or
 "Excel ran out of resources while attempting to calculate one or more formulas.As a result these formulas cannot be evaluated".</p>
<p>I would copy&nbsp;say 20 rows at a time and insert them between existing rows. Excel takes about 3 minutes to insert the rows (obviously it needs to re-calculate references) after which I save the sheet. I would do this a few times keeping an eye on the RAM usage
 which steadily goes up and eventually crashes when the usage get close to 3Gb. I have NO open applications other than the normal&nbsp;background processes which is not using a lot of memory.</p>
<p>Before the sheet is opened the RAM used is sitting around 1.2Gb and after opening the sheet it sits at 1.45Gb.</p>
<p>After copying and inserting the 1st 20 rows the RAM usage sits at 1.96 Gb</p>
<p>After copying and inserting the 2nd 20 rows the RAM usage sits at 2.46 Gb</p>
<p>Inserting&nbsp;the 3rd 20 rows the RAM usage goes up to 2.97 Gb after which Excel crashes.</p>
<p>Excel is closed after which RAM usage drops back to 1.2 Gb.</p>

<p><span>The problem is that Excel does not release ANY memory, it just keeps grabbing more and more memory untill it crashes with lack of resources.</span></p>
<p><span>Even tried clearing the clipboard after every copy and insert but it does not seem to help.</span></p>
<p><span>Looks like I may need to go 64Bit, add loads more memory to releave the symptoms but this will not address the cause though.
</span></p>
<p><span>One would expect that Excel should be releasing memory when done with a task.&nbsp;A good way would be for it to release the memory&nbsp;at the point of "saving" the sheet ? but it does not&nbsp;do so, only&nbsp;releases
 when Excel is closed (obviously).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Tried a normal sheet and included only one vlookup in a signle sheet. No problem inserting lines, memory usage stays contstant.</p>
<p>The original sheet with the problem has no macros included but has many vlookups between sheets (for cross references)&nbsp;as well as arrays and other formulas. The spreadsheet is quite large 13Mb !</p>

            A 64 bit Office installation is supposed to handle that large data.<br />
Since a new relatively small workbook is working fine, i would suggest you check the same file on other systems and see how it works,<br />
Something in the file is taking up the resources even after a particular work is done. Check if you could narrow it down a little.<br />

<h2>            MS Access 2007 - Sharing a database across multiple international users</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>Hi All,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New to the forum but couldn't find a previous question on this after searching the site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have created a database for the first time and created the relevant relationships and forms to enter the data. I now want to share the database with multiple users located in different countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this I have split the database - providing front-end forms/queries and back-end data. I am trying to work out how to centralize the data so everyone will edit the same database. According to Microsoft site there are three ways of doing this a Network
 Folder, Sharepoint Site, Database server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am new to this and being a small company we haven't got a VPN/WAN (as it would need to be an international network folder), Share point site or database server currently. I am happy to invest in one of these three but I just wanted some advice on what
 would be the best way to go about it (not particularly too concerned about a high security level just ease of use and collaboration).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p>SharePoint would probably be the easiest, since its WEB based so anyone with WEB access can get to it. However, it might mean rewriting your application since WEB based apps can't use VBA. Or you could use a hybrid, where the shared data is in Sharepoint
 lists but you use Local front ends to link to them.</p>
<p>Using a network folder or database server would involve having a WAN or VPN for people to connect to. There is another option using a Citrix or Terminal server. But that might require a WAN or VPN as well. There is another discussion on this:</p>
<p>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/addbuz/thread/4f67f2ca-cacf-4e7f-9d4c-9ac2a244d77d/</p>
<p>that you might want to look at.</p>

            <p>If you migrate the DB into SharePoint, then you have two ways to update the data using an Access 2010 front-end:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; An Access <strong>client</strong> application, which stores the data in local Access tables and automatically syncronizes them with the SharePoint back-end.&nbsp; The client apps can use client forms and VBA like a normal Access app.&nbsp; It can also tolerate
 slower connections over a WAN.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; An Access <strong>web</strong> application, which runs in a browser and doesn't need Access installed on the PC.&nbsp; These are limited to web-safe forms built with Layout view, and can't use VBA, only macros.&nbsp; There are other limitations too - you would
 want to research this new method before you jump into it.</p>
<p>Another option is to use a SQL Server back-end database, hosted by a provider or SQL Azure.&nbsp; Then connect an Access app to it over the WAN.&nbsp; The Access app needs to be well optimized using client-server techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've written a PowerPoint presentation
 on that.&nbsp; It's called "Best of Both Worlds" at our free J Street Downloads Page:</p>

    <title>How do I write or edit equations with Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donedberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I write or edit equations with Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac version 15.15&#63; There is no insert equation option.</h2>
                    <p>Using PowerPoint .pptx files generated on my office mac in PPT for Mac 2011 on my home Mac running PPT for Mac version 15.15.</p>
<p>I was attempting to edit existing equations by double clicking the equation box. Instead of the box opening as it does in PPT 2011, I get an error message saying
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"One of the following errors has occurred. </p>
<p>- This file isn't supported by PowerPoint</p>
<p>- The linked file is not available</p>
<p>- The app you need to open this file isn't installed."<br />
</p>
<p>I checked to see, there is no "EQUATION" in the&nbsp;"Insert" "Object" menu. </p>
<p>So how do I edit or insert equations in existing presentations? </p>
<p>Is there some way I can install some sort of equation editor? Shouldn't this be built in to the PowerPoint application?</p>
<p>How do I solve this problem? please advise. very frustrating.</p>

            <p>I truly understand your frustration, but don't shoot the messenger :-) I have absolutely nothing to do with the decisions Microsoft makes... nor do I agree with many of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My reference to Office 2011 is that the version includes both the <em>new</em> Equation machinery as well as continued support for MS Eq. Ed. 3.0, so if you still have access to Office 2011 you can edit the existing equations with it. For some time it was
 possible to download Office 2011 from your Office 365 Account Page as Rohn007 suggested, but I believe that option has been discontinued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional to that, Windows PPt should still provide support for the older equations. I believe that some of the Open Source software such as LibreOffice may be able to as well.</p>

                    <p>Upon invitation, I installed <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Office 2016</span>, but found that "Code Two Public Folders" no longer works. This would ordinarily be no problem, because they likely would have a compatible version some time in the future.
 It is an important Outlook add on and is more important to me than any changes that&nbsp; the new version of Outlook offers. Then I noticed that you have
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">no provision to revert back to the 2013 version</span>.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I am sure people trying Office 2016 are surprised about this</span>. Luckily, I was able to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">restore my computer with an image backup</span> that I made just before the trial was installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(By the way below there was no choice for "Outlook", so I had to arbitrarily chose something - hence "Word'.)</p>

            <p>Another problem is with IMAP accounts, many are finding that they cannot delete emails. Clicking on the X icon or pressing delete does nothing. And deleting items from the deleted folder cause an error message "Sorry, something went wrong. You may want to
 try again"</p>

            Hello JGeorgeP,<br />
<br />
I would like to let you know that we have already released the update to CodeTwo Public Folders which now supports Microsoft Outlook 2016 (the only limitation is that the Syncing Master must not be installed on the machine running this version of Outlook).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To download the latest version of the program, please follow this link: http://www.codetwo.com/public-folders/download?sts=5503&nbsp;<br />

If I understand correctly - does this mean that Syncing Master is still incompatible with Outlook 2016? This seems to still restrict CodeTwo Public Folders use. In that case, my wife (client) can use Outlook 2016, but I have to use Outlook 2013 (Syncing Master
 and client). That means waiting for a full compatibility. Then again, I might have misunderstood.<br />

            Hello JGeorgeP,<br />
<br />
Yes, you’re right.<br />
<br />
Due to some changes in Outlook 2016, it is not possible to install the Syncing Master along with this version of Outlook. The best solution in this case is to move the Syncing Master to another machine: http://www.codetwo.com/kb/moving-codetwo-public-folders-server-to-another-computer/?sts=5503.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, there are two specific and unofficial scenarios that you may try and in which the Syncing Master may work:<br />
<br />
1 – if you first install the Syncing Master alone and then install Outlook 2016<br />
2 – if you install the Syncing Master together with Outlook 2013 and then upgrade Outlook 2013 to version 2016.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Although it may work for you now, we cannot guarantee it will not stop working at some point in the future.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here you can learn more (in the Installation of the Syncing Master section): http://www.codetwo.com/userguide/public-folders/installation.htm?sts=5503.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Have you tried using another USB, USB port or PC to isolate the issue? You can also try to reboot the phone first and then connect it to the Zune software. Aside from updating your PC driver, have you tried the other steps provided on this link:

<p>If you include the chapter number in your caption, numbering will restart with each chapter.</p>

<p>Without the chapter number, numbering is continuous.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/complex_documents.htm#Caption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Insert a Caption - Complex Documents</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It is possible to include the chapter number without restarting, but not just using the dialog.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The numbering is actually set in a SEQ field. You can edit the field to remove the restart switch.
</p>
<p>You would want to remove the \s 1 switch at the end of the field. This assumes your chapters are numbered in level 1.</p>
<p>You can toggle display of field codes using <strong>Alt+F9</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the code for a Table caption which restarts numbering at each chapter.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88385c47-6f08-4254-9293-44cc154e4dd2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88385c47-6f08-4254-9293-44cc154e4dd2" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the same caption with the restart switch removed.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73f56fe1-31a2-485d-9682-78d82dcd073a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73f56fe1-31a2-485d-9682-78d82dcd073a" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>Then toggle back. Captions with chapter numbering but without resetting the numbering cannot be automatically inserted. The coding for each caption though is identical. Once you change one, you can copy and paste it to replace others. Otherwise, you would
 need to modify each caption's fields.</p>
<p>

    <title>Search buggy for imported emails in Outlook 2016 for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theorist9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search buggy for imported emails in Outlook 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Outlook 15.25 on OSX 10.11.6. &nbsp;The search is giving me two problems with email from a POP account that was stored on Entourage, which I've imported into Outlook using Emailchemy via a synthetic IMAP server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The search is unable to find some imported emails. &nbsp; I was trying to find all emails to and from a colleague, let's call him "Steve" ("Steve" was not in the email address, rather I was relying on the fact that his name appears as text in the body of the
 emails, e.g., "Hi Steve"). &nbsp;In Sent Items, I entered "Steve" into the search. &nbsp;The search was only able to find emails I had sent him
<em>after</em> I'd done the import. &nbsp;I.e., the emails I'd imported were invisible to the search. &nbsp;Same with emails he sent me, when searching the Inbox. &nbsp;Oddly, when I searched his company name (which is in the email header), it was able to find those emails.
 &nbsp;I tried searching based on other text from the body of those emails that was unique to them, and the search still didn't return those emails. &nbsp; &nbsp;I've not noticed this problem with any other imported emails, just those to/from Steve. &nbsp;I then checked Apple
 Mail (I had also imported my Entourage emails into Apple Mail, via mbox files), and it had no problem locating the emails to/from Steve via a text search for "Steve". &nbsp;So why can Apple Mail find them, but Outlook can't? &nbsp;And why just these imported emails,
 but not others?<br />
<br />
2) Sent Items has a problem with this type of search:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have another colleague whose email has the name "Business". &nbsp;To search for all emails I've sent him, I go into Sent Items, order them by "To" and search for "Business." &nbsp;Then I can scroll down and see all the emails to him grouped together. &nbsp;While there
 are hundreds of emails I've sent him, they're supposed to be ordered chronologically within Business, which would make it easy to scan through them &nbsp;-- except that Outlook isn't properly adhering to this chronological order: the new emails I've sent (from
 within Outlook) are actually out-of-order with those that had been imported. &nbsp;See attached screenshot showing how the emails are ordered; the new emails, sent in late Aug 2016, are highlighted in red. &nbsp;They are buried within the imported emails from 2011!
 [Also not sure why the 11/26/11 email is below the 11/14/11 email, but that may just be a fluke having to do with the import; but, regardless, the new emails should not be at this point in the list.]</p>

 it still can find them based on text that's in the Subject line, just not text that's in the email body.]</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">It also didn't fix the non-chronological ordering of newly created emails relative to imported emails (Apple Mail doesn't have this problem.)</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>I also noticed that the draft emails imported into Outlook 2016 via IMAP, in addition to having non-searchable bodies, aren’t editable, while the drafts imported into Apple Mail via mbox are. &nbsp;To make them editable and searchable,
 I need to hit forward or send to create a new email, and then save that as a draft, after which I can delete the original uneditable draft.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Also, I should mention that some of the imported emails are searchable, others aren’t.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Here's the other unusual thing: Before reindexing the hard drive, I was able to find the emails using the Mac's Spotlight search (Spotlight found them in the Outlook 15 Profiles folder, which is where the emails for Outlook 206
 are stored), as well as some corresponding .olk15MsgSource files. &nbsp;[I just couldn't find them by searching within Outlook 2016 itself.] However, I was unable to open the emails, since when I tried opening them with Outlook 2016, I got the error message I've
 attached below.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Oddly, after reindexing the hard drive, Spotlight was no longer able to find those emails; instead, it could only find the .olk15MsgSource files corresponding to them.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Finally, adding insult to injury, when I do a subject-line search for some of these older imported emails (again, recall that the search does work for text in the email's subject line or in the email address(es) used*, just not for text in the email body),
 the search returns <em>two identical results for each email</em>! See screenshot below.</p>
<p>[*the search below would also find those two emails if I instead searched for "ncbi".]</p>

<h2>            Outlook search does not find any imported email messages</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using Windows Live Mail for a few years. The newest version 2011 causes a bunch of problems on my computer so I want to start using Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>I attemped to export my email messages from WLM2011 to Outlook. WLM constantly frose during this process so I tried exporting the email messages in smaller groups rather than all at once. This seemed to work but once imported into Outlook 2007, I discovered
 that Outlook was not able to find any of these messages using the search function. In fact, it does not appear that the email address associated with any of my imported messages was imported.</p>
<p>Is there a way to get email messages imported from WLM to be searchable in Outlook?</p>

<h2>            Help&#58; Cell alignment is off when opening the excel on other devices</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, when I work in excel on my laptop and send the file for my colleagues to look at, the resulting excel has all of its rows seemingly misaligned. I've included a screen shot of the problem below that my colleagues see, with row 12 showing what it's
 supposed to look like, and all the other rows showing how it actually looks like when my files are being opened on other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything looks fine on my laptop... so this has been mind boggling to say the least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any help from the community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

    <title>Email address corruption in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frederickgasoi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email address corruption in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>When I create an email address from the Contacts list or by typing in the TO field on a new blank email, the address is fine. &nbsp;When I open a contact and click on the "Email" icon in the "Communicate" group on the ribbon, the email that gets entered is corrupted
 - it contains the email address of the chosen contact, but also the email of another contact. &nbsp;When I look at all the email fields of all contacts, no such corruption is evident, and not every contact has this problem. &nbsp;Anyone have any ideas what causes this
 and how to fix it. &nbsp;See example below - Anne Bene is crosslinked to Marta Gasoi. &nbsp;Marta Gasoi is crosslinked to someone else.</p>

    <title>Need help resolving &#8220;This expression is typed incorrectly, or it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emerald77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help resolving &#8220;This expression is typed incorrectly, or it is too complex to be evaluated.&#8221; error</h2>
                    <p><span>I have an Excel worksheet that I import into Access.&nbsp; One of the column headings in the worksheet is called “Year/Month” and the cells in that column are formatted as
 “General”.&nbsp; The reason for this format is because I have entries like “2012/01”, “2012/02”, etc. (without the double quotes).<br />
<br />
When the worksheet is imported into Access, Access correctly interprets the aforementioned field as a Text field (@).<br />
<br />
I then have the following query:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SELECT [PID Name] AS PID, Sum([Total Hours]) AS Actual, [Year/Month]<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FROM All_Data_CMPM<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GROUP BY [PID Name], [Year/Month]<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HAVING ((([Year/Month])=[Year/Month (yyyy/mm)?]))<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ORDER BY [PID Name];<br />
<br />
When I run the query and am prompted for the Year/Month, and then input 2012/01 (without quotes), I get the following error message:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“This expression is typed incorrectly, or it is too complex to be evaluated.”<br />
<br />
If I re-run the query and input “2012/01” (with quotes), I still get the same error message.<br />
<br />
In an attempt to fix the problem, I re-formatted the “Year/Month” cells in Excel as “Custom” (yyyy/mm) and then re-imported the worksheet into Access.&nbsp; Access still interpreted the field as a Text field (yyyy/mm).&nbsp; When I then manually modified the field type
 in Access to be a Date field, Access automatically inserted a “1” for the Day in order to make the date a true (complete) date.&nbsp; This causes all sorts of upstream (and downstream) process problems which I need to avoid.<br />
<br />
Can someone kindly tell me what I need to do to make my query run successfully?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any assistance.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            All,<br />
<br />
After further investigation, I discovered the problem. &nbsp;I had set the format for the "Total Hours" (aka Actual) field in Excel to Custom (<b>_($* #,##0.00_);[Red]_($* (#,##0.00);_($* "-"??_)</b>). &nbsp;This format causes zeros to appear as a dash (which my company
 prefers).<br />
<br />
However, when I changed the format to simply&nbsp; <b>_($* #,##0.00_);[Red]_($* (#,##0.00)</b> where zeros appear as zeros, and then imported the data into Access, my query ran successfully as is.<br />
<br />
So while I thought the problem was related to the Year/Month field (given the error message I received as soon as I inputted "2012/10"), it turns out that the real problem had to do with the Total Hours field.<br />
<br />
And sure enough, when I look at the Total Hours field in Design view, I see that Access assigned it as a Text data type (all because of the dash) rather than as a Number data type.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for everyone's help. &nbsp;I sincerely appreciate it.

            <p>Hi Malaki,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry to point this out, but please read the terms of use and licensing EULA for MSE:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-tt/security_essentials/eula.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-tt/security_essentials/eula.aspx</a>&nbsp;and specifically note the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The software may not be used on a device running an enterprise version of a Microsoft Windows operating system.</li><li>The software may not be used on devices owned by government <strong>or academic institutions</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If installed on school computers, then it must be removed or the school is in violation of the licensing terms for using MSE.&nbsp; The school needs to uninstall MSE and use a different product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cannot assist you with MSE questions or problems when MSE is installed in violation of the EULA (and in any event, I'm not even sure I understand exactly what you mean by "blocks on school computers" anyway or what the problem you're having actually is
 or if it's due to MSE or networking or established security or group policies or what operating system you're using or how the network is configured or if you don't really mean they are in schools but mean you bought a school computer from the school for home
 use and it is somehow blocked in some way from doing something having once been a school computer - but blocked from doing what?).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If I've misunderstood the situation and it isn't a school computer but is now a home computer that was once a school computer (or something like that), then post back with an explanation along with answers to ALL the above questions including
 what security software is currently installed (all names of everything whether being used or not with exact versions).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck!</p>

<h2>            Charms bar disabled in Windows 10 Technical preview</h2>
                    I just installed Windows 10 Technical preview in my netbook. Charms bar is not working/disabled in my netbook. How to enable it? When I was in windows 8.1, charms bar was working fine.

            I hope Microsoft will add an option to use the top-right corner again for the Charms Bar, I really liked it. And I hope there will be an Option to go to the fullscreen startmenu without disabling the normal one

<p>
</p><p>I believe that using the mouse and moving to the top right / bottom right has been disabled however it still works with touch screens swiping in from the right&nbsp;or you can still use the keyboard shortcut of&nbsp;WIN + C</p>
<p>

</p><p>Charms will be changing in the future though nothing confirmed yet as to how they will be changing.</p>

    <title>Cutover Migration From Exchange 2007 to O365, Mailboxes and Public - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chadhic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cutover Migration From Exchange 2007 to O365, Mailboxes and Public Folders</h2>
                    <p>It's been a couple of years since I last did a cutover migration from Exchange 2007 to Office 365, and things appear to have changed. I'm hoping somebody can offer some advice!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, I performed a cutover migration of mailboxes. Once that was initially completed, I then did a public folder migration (serial migration, I believe, using New-PublicFolderMigrationRequest).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the public folders were completely migrated, I then did one final migration of the mailboxes (out of hours), and then switched everybody over to using Office 365 with the fully populated mailboxes and public folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just tried to do the same again, and everything was progressing as normal until I tried to follow the new method of migrating Public Folders (it appears the old method has been deprecated), and was presented with the error '<em>You can only have cutover
 or staged batches existing at any given time.'</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not ready to switch the users over to Office 365 as they will need their public folders to be present.</p>
<p>Therefore, I've deleted the cutover migration for mailboxes so that I can proceed with public folder migration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The public folder migration is currently occurring, and this is going to take a good few days. So once this is complete, how do I go about synchronising the mailbox data from the past few days?</p>
<p>Can I just set up a new migration batch to sync the changes from the last few days for mailboxes or does it not work like that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, the steps I took were as follows:</p>
<p>Sync mailboxes, Sync public folders, Stop mail flow, Finalise mailboxes, Finalise public folders, Cutover (ie switch MX, Autodiscover to Office 365), Start mail flow, Reconfigure clients</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps I've followed so far are:</p>
<p>Sync mailboxes, Finalise mailboxes (and delete migration batch), Sync public folders...</p>
<p>Am I going to be able to resync the mailboxes in a few days?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want no more than a day of downtime for the users, but unfortunately, both the mailboxes and the public folders are going to take longer than that to synchronise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

<p>An update for this for anyone who has a similar issue.</p>
<p>The job is now complete, and everything is in place within the necessary time period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the steps involved:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Create a migration batch for the mailboxes</p>
<p>-Wait for that to be fully synchronised</p>
<p>-Delete the migration batch</p>
<p>-Carry out a public folder migration using the steps found here:</p>
<p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-GB/library/dn874017(v=exchg.150).aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>-When you're ready to 'cutover', complete the public folder migration, and delete it when done.</p>
<p>-Set up a new migration batch for the user mailboxes</p>
<p>-This will carry on delta syncing, so should just take a short while dependent on how long it's been since the original batch migration was done</p>
<p>-Once that's finished, you'll have everything over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not as seamless as the serial public folder migration, but it still does the job.</p>
<p>The only issues I really noticed after completion were as follows:</p>
<p>1) Any user emails that were received before the end of the first migration, but completely deleted (ie removed from the deleted items and possibly the dumpster as well)&nbsp; between deleting the first migration and setting up the second would reappear - I guess
 the migration lost track of them and left them in the Office 365 mailbox. This hardly affected anybody, and only resulted in a few additional copies of email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Out of Office data isn't updated during the migration - the settings at the time of the creation of the first batch stick on the Office 365 mailbox. I'm pretty sure that this is a problem on migrations in general, though. Just something to watch out for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps somebody for the future.</p>
<p>

<h2>            win10 build 10159 no other updates why</h2>
                    currently operating win10 build 10159, then I lost my insider hub...which I understand is no longer available after 10130. But since then MS has released 10162 but may computer only updates Defender...when I do an update/security I'm told my win's is up
 to date. My question is why doesn't my win10 do an update automatically any more?

</p><p>You might also check "programs-Turn Windows features on or off" and see if "NetFramework 3.5 (incl....)" is enabled. Some insiders have had better luck updating when this windows feature is disabled during update.</p>
<p>After update to build 10162 is complete you can re-enable 3.5 if your pc needs it.</p>
