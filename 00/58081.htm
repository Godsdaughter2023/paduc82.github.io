<p>Hello Allen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you mean that Skype for Business will keep opening a new dialogue box when you start a new conversation with another contacts? For example, the conversation A and conversation B in the screenshot below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d56d148-b77a-4cde-a761-97012c336124?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d56d148-b77a-4cde-a761-97012c336124?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, it is a feature by design, and you can switch between different conversation tabs as you wish. If there is anywhere I misunderstood, please correct me. And you can also make an example and capture some screenshots for better understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<h2>            &#34;How&#34; choice of users when start and change back to classic logon when pressing CAD</h2>
                    <p>Just change to Windows 7 professional from Windows XP professional. In XP, I have a list of users when Windows starts and I can click on the user and type password. Sometime, I would like to sign on Administrator and it is not in list, I press Ctrl+Alt+Delete
 and the classic logon screen prompts and I could type into user name and password and go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows 7 professional, I could just find those "loginable" users. I cannot press C+A+D to classic logon and log on Administrator. My current method is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 professional</p>
<p>1. Logon as an user that has admin. right;</p>
<p>2. Go to administrative tools and enable Administrator;</p>
<p>3. Log off the user and choose Administrator to log in.</p>
<p>This is not convenient to me and I love good old days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good old days (Windows XP)</p>
<p>1. When the user list prompts (there is no administrator in that list); I press C+A+D and system change to classic logon</p>
<p>2. I type in Administrator in user and type the password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks all</p>

<span>Hi Barry, </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>To enable the classic logon style, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Login to your computer using an administrator account.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “secpol.msc” in the Start Search box and press “Enter.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Local Security Policy window, navigate to “Local Policies\Security Options.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double-click the policy “Interactive Logon: Do not display last user name" and change the setting to “Enable.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double-click "Interactive Login: Do not require Ctrl+Alt+Del" and change the setting to “Disabled.”</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “gpupdate.exe” in the Start Search box to apply the policy.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>However, please note that it is not recommended to use the administrator user account as your default user account. It’s advisable to use a standard account instead.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            The app was installed as a free trial on Feb,15 2016. The app was purchased today. I was facing this issue today when I already purchased the app. Here is a snapshot of the details of the purchase:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2a53cfc-82e3-4282-b37f-ac9d389ee0f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2a53cfc-82e3-4282-b37f-ac9d389ee0f8" /></a><br />

<h2>            Unable to do most things on windows 10 because keys keep opening windows shortcuts</h2>
                    <p>So this usually happens with video games, after playing 1-2 hours all the keys turn into shortcuts, for example. If I'm trying to move forward with 'w' it wouldn't allow me and it would open the (Windows + W) Shortcut. I found a way to stop this&nbsp;temporarily
 by pressing (Windows + Enter) But after I'm unable to use the keys C and H in any program, those keys just don't work and the only way I can fix this is by restarting the computer. I've had this for around 6 months but never worried about it but It's quite
 annoying when you're playing a competitive game and your team requires your help but you just stop moving and require to leave the video game because of a, annoying windows feature. Anybody know how to stop this from happening?<br />
<br />
I've searched on the internet but I don't know what this problem is called and why it happens, if I search something like ''All keys are shortcuts'' it always leads me to sticky keys which isn't the problem because I have that turned off.<br />

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
Some possible reasons why the keys of your keyboard are software conflicts, outdated driver, and keyboard settings.<br />
<br />
For us to isolate the issue, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any changes made to your computer prior to this issue(Windows updates)?<br />
</li><li>Are you using a built-in or external keyboard?<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, please check the following links:</p>

<p>I just installed Windows 7 (over Vista)on my inspiron 6400. The install went well (i think?). when I tried to install office home and student 2007 (or any other program for that matter) tells me I don't have enough memory. Heck, the computer is clean. It
 tells me I have 98gb of free space. However, when I tried to load the program it tells me I have only 85mb of space. Any thoughts? I thank you, in advance, for your time. i reposted this because my previous responder hit the reason for the low memory&nbsp;but his
 fix didn't work.</p>

            Windows 7 Installed On Recovery Drive (Or D: Drive)<br />
<br />
If Windows 7 was installed on the D: drive (or recovery drive) it was installed on the wrong partition - you will need to reinstall Windows 7 and make sure it gets installed to the C: drive where Windows XP/Vista currently is (if you are upgrading). The recovery
 drive is too small for a Windows 7 installation. Make sure to backup any important files. Some links to help you reinstall Windows 7 are below.<br />

<p>I, apparently, loaded Windows 7&nbsp;in a small recovery partition on my Inspiron 6400( clean install). Because of that, I have no memory in which to load any programming because according to my computer, I have no usable memory. A previous responder told me
 a fix but it's not working.&nbsp;Can anyone give me some answers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thx, Barry&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sounds like you installed Windows 7 on the Recovery Partition.</p>
<p>Click Start, right click Computer<br />
Click Manage<br />
Expand Disk Management<br />
<br />
Select the Recovery Partition<br />
Right click it, click 'Format'<br />
You will receive a Warning dialog, click OK to continue.<br />
<br />
The next step is to select your file system option, in this case, go with the default which is NTFS.<br />
The formatting process will now begin.<br />
Once complete, the drive will be displayed as a ‘Logical Drive’ in Disk Management.<br />
<br />
Right click the ‘Logical Drive’ in Disk Management, on the contextual menu, click the ‘Delete Volume’ option. Click ‘Yes’ when the warning dialog appears.<br />
The Volume you deleted will now appear as ‘Free space’, you will also notice that the disk icon no longer appears in the list of volumes.<br />
Right click the Free space partition, and click Delete, click Yes on the Disk Management warning that appears.<br />
<br />
<br />
The volume will now appear as Unallocated. (good stuff). Our next step is to merge back that unallocated free space with the system partition. Right click the System volume and click the ‘Extend Volume’ option on the contextual menu, click ‘Yes’ when the warning
 appears.<br />
<br />
A wizard will now begin that will guide through the steps to merge back the unallocated space with your system partition.<br />
<br />
The wizard provides a simple procedure to merge back the unallocated space with the system drive. Once you have selected the space, click Next, at the end of the wizard, you will see the amount allocated.<br />

            Is it possible for you to boot into Windows Vista? If you, simply reboot into it and run the upgrade again, then follow my previous instructions to merge back the partitions.

            Andrew and Trek, thanks but I'm still confused. Andrew, you are right but I tried your fix and when i right-clicked on the recovery drive, format doesn't highlight, therefore, it won't let me go any further.

<h2>            Windows 10 client doesn&#39;t load the print driver from the XP print server</h2>
                    <p>Hello dear community</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer #1</p>
<p>Windows XP home 32 bit</p>
<p>Canon PIXMA IP3000 connected via USB and shared</p>
<p>32 and 64 bit print driver installed on the system</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer #2 Fujitsu PRIMERGY ECONEL 100 S2</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro 64 bit Version 10.0.10586 Build 10586, upgraded from Windows 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer #3 Laptop Fujitsu<br />
Windows 10 Pro 64 bit Version 10.0.10586 Build 10586, upgraded from Windows 7 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>On #2 I can add the shared Canon printer from #1. The 64 bit driver is loaded from #1.</p>
<p>On #3 the shared printer is detected but adding the printer fails (error 0x00000bcb) saying that the driver has to be loaded. In the security log on #1 there are a number of logins from #2 but only one login from #3.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I install the 64bit XP driver on #3, the shared printer can be added but this is not the correct way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before #2 and #3 were upgraded to windows 10, the shared printer were never added to #2 and #3 so I don't know, if it works in Windows 7 on #3 and in windows 8.1 on #2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions: </p>
<p>- Why is #3 not loading the 64 bit print driver from #1 as #2 is doing?</p>
<p>- Is there any registry/policy definition preventing #3 from loading the driver from #1?</p>
<p>- Has something been overtaken from the windows 7 installation which prevents #3 to load the print driver from #1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>

            <p>No need to format if you want to keep your personal files and settings and installed applications. If you have a Windows 7&nbsp;Professional DVD, use the following utility to downgrade your installation of Windows 7&nbsp;Ultimate to Windows 7 Professional :</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/downgrade-windows-7-enterprise-to-ultimate-professional-or-home-premium-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/downgrade-windows-7-enterprise-to-ultimate-professional-or-home-premium-edition/</a></p>
<p>(I have tried this and it works)</p>
<p>Windows 7 Downgrader will let downgrade popular editions such as Windows 7 Ultimate, Enterprise, Professional quickly and easily. Once it downgrades, all you need to do is insert the Windows 7 installation and do a repair upgrade to a desired edition. Lets
 take a look at how to do it. </p>
<p><br />
Save the file to your hard disk and extract it. </p>
<p>Right click click the Windows 7 Downgrader executable and click Run as administrator.</p>
<p>As you can see, the Windows 7 Downgrader utility is quite simple. You have three options which will allow you to downgrade to any of three editions: Ultimate, Professional or Home Premium. Downgrading to&nbsp;Professional is useful if you are running Windows
 7&nbsp;Ultimate and would like release that license, but don’t want to go through the chore of backing up and install from scratch.</p>
<p>Once you have identified the edition you would like downgrade to, click it. You might receive error message, click Continue. Do not restart your computer. Insert your Windows 7 Professional installation DVD for the edition you want to downgrade to.</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Click Upgrade</p>
<p>What you are doing now is a repair upgrade. </p>
<p>To learn more about Repair Upgrades, please read the following:</p>

<strong>Notebooks.com</strong></a> </p>
<p>When the downgrade is complete, you should be successfully downgraded to the specific edition.</p>
<p>Proceed to activate.</p>

<p><strong>If you wish to do a clean install, simply do the following:</strong></p>

<br />
<br />
This will require a custom clean install of Windows 7 Pro. <span>
This will remove all your programs, but you can save your files and settings to external storage before doing so. You will have to reinstall all your programs after installing Windows 7.</span><br />

</p>
<p>
<span>1. Backup all your files and settings to avoid losing docs, photos, and other information. Windows Easy Transfer is a free tool to copy files (not programs) from your PC, and then transfer
 them back after you install Windows 7. If you don't want to use Windows Easy Transfer, you can copy your files to a USB drive, or CD/DVD. Note: Easy Transfer will not work when changing languages, or when going from 64 bit to 32 bit (it will work going from
 32 bit to 64 bit).</span></p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>2. Locate the installation disks and any associated product/license keys for all your programs because you'll need to manually reinstall all programs. If you downloaded some programs from the Internet
 you can redownload them. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>3. Put the Windows 7 disk into your DVD drive. A window should pop up starting the install process, when asked the type of installation do you want click Custom (advanced). Note: 32 to 64 bit requires
 you to restart and boot from the DVD. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>4. After Windows 7 is installed you can use Windows Easy Transfer (or another backup method you used) to restore your files &amp; settings, and use your installation disks to reinstall all your programs. Then
 you're done - enjoy Windows 7. </span></p>

<p>
</p><p>My problem is as followed:</p>
<p>- I couldn't connect the bluetooth mouse: <strong>Dell Travel Mouse WM524 </strong>
with my Surface Pro 3. </p>
<p>The system recognized the device but said "<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><em>Driver is unavailable"</em></span> on the Manage Bluetooth devices page in Settings/Devices. So, I couldn't connect it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried troubleshoots but didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone had the same issue and got it fixed?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking the manual that can be found on the support page of your mouse, your device is only compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows RT. Since you're using Windows 10, there is a compatibility issue between your mouse and your operating system
 that is why you're experiencing difficulties using your Bluetooth mouse. We suggest that you use a different Bluetooth mouse that is compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you have further queries, feel free to reply to this thread.</p>

<p>The OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) of your mouse is the one that develops the drivers for your device so that it will function properly on a specific operating system, You can contact the manufacturer of your mouse so you can check if they can produce
 or provide you a driver that will be compatible with Windows 10. To know how to contact Dell ( the manufacturer of your device), follow the steps

    <title>Need to Download Windows 7 iso, Invalid Product Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rnd53  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to Download Windows 7 iso, Invalid Product Key</h2>
                    <p>Short version:</p>
<p>I used the Product Key to validate my copy of Windows 7, no problem. But when I try to use the same key to download the Win 7 iso from Microsoft, it says "Error</p>
<p>The product key you entered is invalid or not supported by this site. Please contact Microsoft Support for assistance."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I get a Win 7 key that works for everything and all the time???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long version:</p>
<p>My motherboard died a month ago so I bought a new PC, but I have expensive software that won't run under Win10 (I tried), so I am trying Win 7. My copy of Win7 SP1, which I bought years ago, is for a refurbished PC. I am trying to install Win 7 on a PCIe
 SSD (NVMe) and the easiest way to do this appears to be with a USB stick. I found a tool on the Gigabyte site which will add the NVMe and USB drivers to an iso and make a bootable USB stick (my new mobo is Gigabyte). When I run the tool with the DVD I purchased,
 the build fails. I also tried extracting the iso and using that but it still fails. I figured it was because my DVD is for a refurbished PC so I tried to download the Win 7 iso from MS and it says error and fails (see message above). FYI, when I use this key
 to install Win 7, the key would not validate and I had to call MS to get it validated. (I can install Win 7 to an SSD or HD, but not the NVMe SSD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I just bought a new key for Win 7 on the internet so I can download the Win 7 iso. It activates my Win 7 without problems but when I try to use it to download the Win 7 iso from MS, it fails with the same old error message. So, where can I buy a key
 that works???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your help,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>That's what I used to believe, but not any more. The Gigabyte USB tool does not ask for my product key but the build fails. It takes 30 to 40 minutes to perform the build but I have tried it 4 times and it fails every time. The DVD came with a COA but it
 fails the build! I am reasonably sure the tool works (it was reported to have worked in the thread where I found it). The only thing I can think of is there is something wrong with DVD. Since this is a legitimate copy purchased from a legitimate re-seller
 and it doesn't work, then there must be other DVDs out there with the same problem. I don't want to take the chance of another legitimate copy which doesn't work. This is totally ridiculous! (Paying for legitimate copies which do not work - this is the future
 of MS, better to deny a legitimate user rather than allowing a pirated copy to work). If I download from the MS site, then I would hope to receive a 100% legitimate copy. (Sorry for venting my frustrations, I've been trying to do this for 4 days!). I have
 downloaded an iso from another site, hopefully there is no&nbsp;embedded&nbsp;malware. I will see if the USB Tool works on it.</p>
<p>

<p>Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what you are telling me is that when I buy an MS product, I can load it on one and only one piece of hardware for the end of time. So if that hardware ever dies, then I better plan on buying new software because the old software was only authorized for
 one and only one piece of hardware. This is, of course, absurd and the reason why my next computer will be a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand MS's desire to prohibit pirated software but it seems to me that I ought to be allowed to install, or re-install that software on any device I choose, provided I only install it and use it on one device at a time. So if my hardware fails, I
 ought to be able to install my old software on my new hardware. Incidentally, no other software has given me problems and it installs on the new hardware just fine. It is only MS that has created this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your informative answer. Now I understand what MS is trying to do.</p>
<p>

</p><p><strong>So what you are telling me is that when I buy an MS product, I can load it on one and only one piece of hardware for the end of time.</strong> So if that hardware ever dies, then I better plan on buying new software because the old software was only
 authorized for one and only one piece of hardware. This is, of course, absurd and the reason why my next computer will be a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand MS's desire to prohibit pirated software but it seems to me that I ought to be allowed to install, or re-install that software on any device I choose, provided I only install it and use it on one device at a time. So if my hardware fails, I
 ought to be able to install my old software on my new hardware. Incidentally, no other software has given me problems and it installs on the new hardware just fine. It is only MS that has created this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your informative answer. Now I understand what MS is trying to do.</p>
<p>

<p>I am not saying that at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In amongst this you have never said what type of license you have:</p>
<p>Retail, OEM preinstalled (Dell, HP, etc.), OEM System Builders, or Volume License key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refurbished PCs normally have OEM, but you have not said that.</p>
<p>And you don't say what type of license you bought either when you bought a "key" by itself, which I have since advised you against.</p>
<p>I can't go any further until you supply that information.</p>

<p>It was a PC I built from scratch and the Win 7 DVD says "for a refurbished PC." I was not able to use the product key on the COA to download a copy of Win 7. I also had to call MS to get a new key in order to install this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I probably did not buy a Retail License, I guess it was OEM. In the future I will stick to Retail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, the key I purchased also worked (i.e., activated automatically), but I do not know what kind of license it was. The good news is that I am up and running Win 7!</p>

<h2>            Uninstalled AVG, but icon is still active in systray</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded AVG plus their 24 hour Tune up.&nbsp; Computer went very slow so I uninstalled it, and installed Microsoft Security Essentials</p>
<p>The AVG icon is still active in my tasbar. 've tried to ininstall again but it won't go</p>
<p>&nbsp; My laptop freezes&nbsp; and I can't get 'add or remove programmes' to see if its still there.&nbsp; Down loaded games takes too long to come up and freeze for ages before changing&nbsp; scene and then stop altogether. If I can get the Task Manager to show at all there
 are multiple screens, but I have also been reduced to pressing the off button - wrong I know.</p>
<p>Can anyone help I'm getting desperate!!</p>

                    <p>Original Title: Windows 8.1 Pro Help</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Im having a really hard time trying to install Windows 8.1 to my laptop. An error messaged popped up saying, "The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error. Wibdows installation cannot proceed. To install Windows click ok to restart
 the computer, and then restart the installation." I did that but it keeps showing the error message and it loops over and over. I tried to find the problem and i think my conputer is missing a file. It was C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt. Is
 there anyway to fix this at all? I cant even get on to the internet from my laptop. It is a HP Pavilion dv7.

            I believe that i was trying to perform a clean install because i had a trial version of Windows 7 then i bought Windows 8. I managed to download the installation media of Windows 8 to a DVD-R disk. I tried the method you provided for the command prompt.
 I got a message saying "Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation." I think thats because the path is starting from X:\Sources&gt;

 the computer used one of these, I call them "temp" accounts it started one of these new user accounts.&nbsp; First I found which of these three accounts was the correct one I wanted to keep -and deleted the remaining two "temp" accounts that had a similiar name
 with an extension like 000.&nbsp; Then I logged off and tried to log back on using the one account I knew was good.&nbsp; Well the computer again created a new account, but it seems to be working better then the original one with the blue background.&nbsp; Why/how did I
 get these new accounts?&nbsp; How do I delete them and use the original account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>A profile can sometimes be created multiple times under various circumstances which results in &lt;username&gt;.000, .001, etc. This shouldn’t be
 a problem but if&nbsp;you really want to change it,&nbsp;you would need to first backup your files from the profile folder (Refer method 3 from the above post) and then: create a new temporary administrator account with a different name, login to that new account, delete
 the old account, then delete the old accounts profile folder(s), then you can re-create the old account and restore your data.</span></span></p>

<h2>            EA Battlefield 4 - You are too young to access online features </h2>
                    
<p>My EA Origin account and my Microsoft account both have my correct Birthday (I'm 34) but when I log on to play BF4 on my 360 it says I'm too young to access online features. I don't have any parental controls set, how do I fix this? EA seem to blame Microsoft
 for the problem...</p>

<p>Thank you, @Lord BaneJ !</p>
<p>There was me thinking that, as I had logged into Origin via my XBox my Gamertag and EA account would already be linked - how stupid!</p>
<p>Maybe EA could think of a less misleading error message for this issue?</p>

<p>Please check your Origin account that you created and make sure your date of birth is correct. If it isn't correct you will have to either change it from EA's website or contact EA directly.</p>
<p>You can try the following steps and let us know if it works:</p>
<p>1. Setup an EA/Origin account if you don't already have one</p>
<p>2. Download the Origin Client (do this even if you don't game on the PC!)</p>
<p>3. Logon to the origin client with the account you setup.</p>
<p>4. Click on the Friends button on the upper right hand side of the client window</p>
<p>5. Click on Add Friend or the small button at the bottom right of the pane that has the person icon with a + sign next to it</p>
<p>6. On the left side of the screen under Import Friends there is an Xbox Live emblem, click connect</p>
<p>7. Enter your Xbox Live/Windows Live information and Sign In</p>
<p>8. At this point your Xbox Live Gamertag should be linked to your EA/Origin Account</p>

<h2>            Windows Photos Not Working</h2>
                    After recent windows updates, windows photos has stopped working.&nbsp; I keep getting a remote procedure protocol failed error when trying to view a photo. After trying every published solution I could find online, I finally found the culprit to my problem.&nbsp;
 The problem goes away if I change my display adapter to use the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter Driver.&nbsp; However, if I switch back to any version of the actual driver for my display adapter windows photos stops working again.&nbsp; I have an Intel(R) HD Graphics
 530 display adapter in an HP ENVY Laptop.&nbsp; HP updates states that I have the latest display adapter driver installed.&nbsp; I currently have driver version 20.19.15.4360 installed.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated here Microsoft.

            Hi Shayne.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Photos app when it crashes.  Go to Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features and choose Photo app, then Advanced Options, then Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help re-register the app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br /> Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update.  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  There may be another besides Basic driver.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I found a solution, however, this needs to be added as a windows update.&nbsp; I downloaded the latest Intel HD Graphics 530 driver from Intel and tried to install it, but it said that this driver was not suited for my computer and to check with my manufacturer
 for the latest driver.&nbsp; I forced installed the driver anyhow and the Windows Photo issues went away.&nbsp; Everything appears to be working just fine.&nbsp; This driver needs to be included as a windows update to HP Envy laptops with Intel HD Graphics 530 adapters installed.

            Since you found the solution, you should send in feedback to the Windows Engineers. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + F
<br />This will open the Feedback app
<br />Submit a bug report and let the Windows Engineers know what is happening. They can liaison with the hardware vendor or implement fixes so by the time Windows 10 Redstone 4 is ready for commercial release in March 2018, it will have already been fixed. 
<br />
<br />You can reach out to key folks on the Windows Engineering team through Twitter

<p>Just to keep this updated for everyone that runs into the problem and needs a solution prior to Microsoft releasing an official update.&nbsp; If you have an Intel HD Graphics 530 display adapter, the following driver file will fix issues with the Windows Photo
 App.</p>

                    I keep getting "<strong> Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 (Definition 1.225.905.0) - Error 0x80070643</strong>" but I am unable to correct it. I don't know if this is a big deal or not - Windows Defender says it is up to date. &nbsp;I have
 purchased software from "Microsoft Partners" who all claim they have the fix. &nbsp;So far nothing works! I have read several of the fixes on the community pages, but those fixes haven't worked either. I am using Windows 10 Home version.&nbsp;

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would like to inform you that this error occurs when Windows Update file under goes corruption. To rectify the issue I</span></span><span> recommend you to reset the windows update component manually. Resetting Windows Update Components will
 fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Windows Updates quickly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please follow the below steps to reset the Windows Updates Components:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Press <strong><span>Windows Key + X</span></strong> on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Stop the <strong><span>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer </span>
</strong>and the <strong><span>Windows Update Services</span></strong>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>3. Now rename the <strong><span>SoftwareDistribution</span></strong> and
<strong><span>Catroot2</span></strong> folder. You can do this by typing the&nbsp;following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>4. Now, let’s restart the <strong><span>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</span></strong> and the
<strong><span>Windows Update Services</span></strong>. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the
<strong><span>ENTER</span></strong> key after you type each command.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;net start bits </span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>5. Type <strong><span>Exit </span></strong>in the <strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong> to close it and then restart the computer.</span></span></p>

<p>What an absolutely epic gamertag. I hope it doesn't get banned because you decided to show yourself on the forums. Which Worms game are you talking about, 1st or 2nd?</p>

<p>I agree with Mister Romero's Head, your name is outstanding and if I had a digital copy of Worms I would instantly help you get those achievements. Good luck to you, SCB.
