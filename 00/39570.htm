    <title>Windows Host process stopped working... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jayendee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Host process stopped working...</h2>
                    I continuously receive a message that say&nbsp; "The Host Process for Windows services stopped working and was closed.&nbsp; A problem caused the application to stop working correctly Windows will notify you if a solution is available."&nbsp; Why&nbsp; does this message continuously
 pop up.&nbsp; As soon as I close the box its usually followed by my volume not working , then am kicked of the internet. How do I resolve the problem? I have checked everything to figure out how to resolve it. I ran virus scan and Windows defender and all problems
 related to troubleshooting or problem solving. Can you help? I have added all of the updates. When I log off it sometimes takes a long time to shut down and to sign back on.&nbsp;

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right<br />
Click TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this<br />
is a quick reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check<br />
that).<br />

<h2>            Failed to restart your computer when trying to set my PC back to factory settings.</h2>
                    So i recently tried to reset my laptop to factory settings, but it says:<br />
<br />
Failed to restart your computer<br />
Windows can not restart the computer in Windows Recovery Environment to complete the restoration.<br />
<br />
Might sound weird, but that is exactly what it says. I have no idea what this means? Could i get some help :)<br />
Thank you. &nbsp;- Nicolai<br />

            <p>Try booting into the Recovery Environment again, then initiate a reset:</p>
<span>
<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>

 Win8 or 8.1.</p>
<p>I am aware that this process take time but am feeling somewhat left out or forgotten.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; As I amready to submitit is only asking if I have much earlier versions of Windows.&nbsp; No choice but to say 8.1.</p>

    <title>win7 64bit usb mouse driver issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikelee101  say:</h3>
<h2>            win7 64bit usb mouse driver issue</h2>
                    <p>i have 3 usb mice.&nbsp; all work fine on my xp machine.&nbsp; at least one of them has the windows 7 logo on the packaging.&nbsp; none work on my win7 machine.&nbsp; tried all of the usb ports.&nbsp; acer laptop-amd c-50-win7 64.&nbsp; here's what it does:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>plug it in.&nbsp; windows says it's searching for drivers.&nbsp; then it says it's installing the drivers.&nbsp; then it says driver installation failed.&nbsp; looking in device manager and the mouse will show up in Human Interface Devices or Other Devices.&nbsp; properties says
 that the device drivers' digital signature can not be verified.&nbsp;&nbsp;clicking on Update Driver&nbsp;gets me the message that "Windows has determined that you have the latest software already installed.&nbsp; No action is necessary."&nbsp; (or somesuch).&nbsp;&nbsp;it would appear that
 logitech and labtec&nbsp;don't make drivers for their mice anymore, they rely on the native windows drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>one thing i noticed is that when you plug in the mouse (or receiver on the wireless mice), windows appears to be searching windows update for the driver.&nbsp; i would think that would be fine, but i find it hard to believe that windows does not come with a mouse
 driver somewhere in the os installation.&nbsp; anybody know where that is and what it's called?&nbsp; if i can find that out i can at least browse to it during update drivers and see if i can force it to install something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any ideas would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; i've now spent pretty close to 5 hours over 3 days trying to get the simplest of all plug and play devices, a mouse for pete's sake, to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks.</p>
<p>mike</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; In answer to question 1, no.&nbsp; This is my only win7 machine, and we run XP at work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried your steps, but never found any options for mouse.</p>
<p>a-opened device manager</p>
<p>b-action/add legacy hardware</p>
<p>c-install the hardware i manually select from a list</p>
<p>d-unable to locate mouse in any of the categories on this list, so i went with show all devices</p>
<p>e-manufacturer (logitech) not listed.&nbsp; no mouse that i saw&nbsp;under any of the "standard" categories.&nbsp; also looked under "microsoft" to see if there was a generic mouse driver in there.&nbsp; there was a lot of stuff that i didn't know what it was, but nothing that
 said mouse or human interface device or anything like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did I take a wrong turn somewhere in there?&nbsp; Should it make a difference if the mouse is plugged into a usb port when I'm doing it or not?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you keep on getting this notification on your phone, you can probably check if

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Cortana</strong>. </li><li>Tap the <strong>menu button</strong> in the top left corner. </li><li>Tap on <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Turn off the <strong>Send notifications between devices</strong> option.<br />

Have you tried disabling in Settings&gt;&gt;system &gt;&gt;shared experiences. Make sure it is set to off.

            I have shared experiences turned off and I just got that notification three times in a row. And yes, I cleared notifications each time. Windows 10 is getting on my last nerve. I am switching to Linux! I should have bought an XBox because that is all Windows
 is good for, playing games.

<h2>            Windows 10 lags and freezes after new update</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I have a problem that has been happening intermittently for about a year. I updated a year ago and I would get these 5 second bursts of lag that would slow audio and the display. It would happen about once every few hours. I updated about 3 months
 later and it stopped. I updated last month and now its back, but worse. I've had to restart my PC twice today because it was so bad.

            Hi, CeramicTrauma
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<h2>            Bluetooth</h2>
                    <p>Howdy, folks!</p>
<p>&nbsp; So, recently, I noticed that I had no Devices and Printers application. This meant that I had no Bluetooth - which was a shame for me. I was going to connect my speaker to my computer. My operating system is 32 - bit, and I use Windows 7 Vista Ultimate.
 I've already tried looking in the services.msc file, only to see that I had no "Bluetooth Support Services". I've also tried running a command prompt as an administrator, and typing in the following command line -</p>
<p>
</p><p>"sfc /scannow".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it did say something about replacing corrupt files. I rebooted my system, and again, there was no Devices &amp; Printers, nor was there "Bluetooth Support Services" in my services.msc file. If anyone could help me, that'd be a huge favor! Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Someone.</p>

<p>Attempting connection to your computer. . . Shields UP! is now attempting to contact the Hidden Internet Server within your PC. It is likely that no one has told you that your own personal computer may now be functioning as an Internet Server with neither

 Facebook or Twitter as they are blocked from doing so.&nbsp;My other monitoring app confirms this.
<br />
<br />
But the weekly FS report will constantly show them as having visited Facebook and Twitter.&nbsp;For this week alone, FS shows my son as having visited Facebook 1,050 times and&nbsp;to&nbsp;Twitter, 300 times.&nbsp;This is totally wrong erroneous and absolute nonsense.<br />
<br />
I think it may have to do with the fact that other websites may have Facebook and Twitter links of some sort and the Family Safety app&nbsp;mistakenly record visits to these websites as visits to Facebook or Twitter.<br />
<br />
<br />
My recommendation&nbsp;is for people not to rely solely on FS to monitor their kids.&nbsp;In the meanwhile,&nbsp;Microsoft needs to&nbsp;fix this egregious bug or&nbsp;mistake&nbsp;in its FS app.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Cheers.

            <p>Is there any resolution to this issue yet? I have the same issue for all my kids - not too concerned because I am quite sure they aren't actually hitting these sites, but it is pretty annoying to have it show up as most frequently visited every week.
</p>
<p>My guess is that it is due to pop-up ads pulling content directly from the sites (so the filter probably shows "access" to the sites even though the click-through is technically disabled). Does this sound feasible?</p>

            <p>That's quite possible - for example, any site with a Facebook "Like" button will access Facebook for the code and image related to it.</p>
<p>If you look in the list of blocked pages at the web address it may help, for example there are several ways of adding a button but the addresses often have some indication of what they're doing or look like code:</p>
<p><a href="http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js</a></p>
<p>This one has a JS extension, meaning it's Javascript, not an HTML page.</p>
<p>Of course you can also visit the page yourself&nbsp;- if one of your son's mates pops up then he's caught, if it shows computer code or a like button image he's probably in the clear :-)</p>

            <p>This issue makes Microsoft Family Safety totally worthless in my opionion.&nbsp; The weekly report consistently says that 86% of my 9-year-old's computer use is on Facebook, which is totally false (I know for a fact that he has NEVER visited facebook, let alone
 86% of the time).&nbsp;&nbsp; I never even look at the reports anymore. I just delete them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The only useful thing about the report is that it has raised my awareness as to how pervasive facebook is!&nbsp; I think it is totally creepy that&nbsp;FB seems to be attached to EVERYTHING whether we use it or not!&nbsp; Ick!</p>

My daughters weekly report is also showing that she has attempted to access Facebook over 200 times in 1 week. I know for a fact that she isn't. It also show 40 attempted visits to Twitter. Again, I know she's not using twitter.<br />
<br />
Can't Microsoft fix this problem??<br />

            We have also seen high activity on sites like Facebook and Twitter. However, after looking more carefully, in our case those visits were blocked. It turns out that many, many other sites have links to facebook etc on their webpages which show up as separate
 visits in the Family Safety logs. As long as the visits are blocked, it does not necessarily indicate intentional visits to those sites.

    <title>HID-compliant Touchscreen Driver is not in Device Manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> micahpick  say:</h3>
<h2>            HID-compliant Touchscreen Driver is not in Device Manager</h2>
                    <p>A few months ago I purchased a new Toshiba Satellite E45-DW-C4210. When I got it home the touchscreen worked fine, but then I updated my computer and the touchscreen stopped working. I was annoyed, but have survived so far without touchscreen, so I didn't
 worry about it. However, I now have some situations where a touchscreen would be very helpful.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I opened the device manager and looked under Human Interface Devices, and "HID-Compliant Touchscreen) was not there.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I went to view and choose "view hidden files" and there was still nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked to see if there was anything listed under "Other Drivers" but there was not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted all non-functioning and/or hidden USB input devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is up to date on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the troubleshooter with no results.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I checked the Toshiba website for a place to download a new driver, but there was nothing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Feeling frustrated. -Micah<br />

<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, we would like to know when did you update your computer?</p>
<p>It's possible that the issue occurred due to the update. We suggest that you roll back to the previous build of Windows 10 update:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Start </strong>menu and select<strong> Settings</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> then click <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Click "<strong>Get Started" </strong>button under<strong> "Go back to an earlier build</strong>."</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on the result.</p>

            I am not able to "Go Back to an Earlier Build" because my PC was upgraded more than 10 days ago.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As I said, I have not had touchscreen in months, but it was not worth my time to deal with it, since I did not have a use for it. Now I do and am exploring if it is possible to restore touchscreen abilities.&nbsp;

 I Know That I can do this in the User Account Control but I would Like to leave it for some app and not use it for others. If there is a way I would very much appreciate knowing how.</p>

The feature to select which application will have the popup is not yet available. In User Account Control settings, you have 4 options available:

<em>Never notify</em>.</p>

<br />
Verify all cable are securely connected.<br />

If nothing important is on the hard drive, delete the partitions and create a new one, then try reinstalling.<br />

    <title>New 8 skype I downloaded as I got that support for the 7 version was - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New 8 skype I downloaded as I got that support for the 7 version was to finish, could not alter phone numbers, could not add phone numbers and worse the opportunity to add persons I knew not&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Yet again I tried new not very good version 8 and I cannot alter phone numbers, cannot delete phone numbers, and worse got a load of names to add that I knew not and do not want. In fact to alter the phone numbers I had to back date to version 7.41.0.101&nbsp;
 to alter some phone numbers. It apparently is not true that you are listening, you are not, If I am forced to go to version 8 then my use of skype will reduce until I find it is no longer a viable system for me to use!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So many have complained, is it because the masses are stupid and cannot handle this change for the worse and that MS can absorb those losses. I really do wonder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;This is the same problem on both my MS 7 and on my 10 computer so not a one off&nbsp; Who the ...is H.R., Melanie Bryce, Lucy King the first of a page full of those I do not even know!!!&nbsp; I have just&nbsp; these off my 7 computer</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/55c3ab28-7957-4690-83c8-280a1efd836f" title="Rogerinfrance">
<p>
</p><p>I apologize to know about your experience. We are always collating feedback and suggestions, this will be added to our list and forward to our developers. Also, you can now revert your Skype app to Classic Skype 7.41 as we will be extending this version,
 so you can use it for some time.</p>

            Hi Paul!<br />
<br />
Try this FixIt: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_firewall_diagnostic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_firewall_diagnostic/</a><br />
<br />
If that doesn't help, I suggest you download and run a FULL Scan with free Malwarebytes Anti-Malware:

Hope that helps!<br />
