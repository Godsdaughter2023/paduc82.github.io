<h2>            Phone won&#39;t download most recent email</h2>
                    Please forgive me if my query is a little vague, but I am trying to solve a problem for a friend who's only slightly more technically illiterate than myself. After a recent problem running Tomtom on his phone (which I think is an Orange SPV M600 running
 Windows Mobile), I ended up reformatting his 2gb memory card.
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Subsequent to this it was necessary for me to delete his Gmail account in his mail settings because they weren't working and setting it up again as a new account. However the email operation now
 seems to be particularly erratic, working one minute and then not working at all the next (where any email headers that were there have disappeared)</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Also it won't seem to download the most recent emails at all and no matter what I set in the option where you can choose how many days worth of email headers to get (where I believe the default
 is 3 days), it seems to only download the headers older than fourteen days and no emails more recent than this.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Since the date and time function have the correct details, I am a bit stuck on any other potential causes for this and the general erratic operation of the email function and it occurs to me that
 when I reformatted the memory card, some essential files or components might have been deleted at the same time. However I assumed that when I set his Gmail account up from scratch it would correct this but that doesn't seem to be the case.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Any assistance some kind soul can lend with regard to resolving this issue would be most gratefully received, as my pal has just gone out on tour with the theatre company we work for and he is
 absolutely lost without access to his email and as a result I am ending up having to check his Gmail for him on a daily basis. What's more, tomorrow will be the only day he is back in London and I can attempt to resolve the problem, possibly for the next month
 or so!</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>With my utmost thanks in advance in the hope that you might be able to offer some assistance but perhaps for the sake of ease of comprehension, it would be best to make as if one is responding
 to a six year old (although I wouldn't be at all surprised if there are plenty of 6-year olds who would appear technically competent by comparison to a techno-nincompoop lie myself)</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Kind Regards</span></div>
<div><span>Bernard</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>PS. I neglected to mention that his Gmail account was working perfectly on his phone before I reformatted the memory card and I assume with it being a new model phone from Orange that it is running
 WM6. I also neglected to say that I decided to reformat the 2gb mini SD memory card because the phone would freeze every time it was turned on with the card in situe and so he was having to take the card out to turn on the phone and every time he did this,
 all the saved info in his Tomtom application would disappear (favourites, home, warn when near options etc) and it was driving him &amp; me mad having to constantly re-enter all this info. So I made the assumption that the card must be the problem if the phone
 was freezing with it in and having reformatted it, I replaced only the files I knew to be essential for his Tomtom application to work, but I don't know if I should have also replaced other important files (I assumed the phone would create these from scratch).
 Sincere apologies for my longwindedness, but having searched for solution elsewhere, I thought I should try to pre-empt as many queries as possible</span></div>

<p>The reformatting of the card should have no effect on the gmail settings?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You indicated that "older emails" were able to be downloaded.&nbsp; Have you tried sending an email from your device then replying to it?</p>

            BTW, when you setup the gmail account, did it do it automatically or did you manually enter the information?

            In answer to your question it's POP3
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I went over to my pal's house this evening to drop some stuff off and while there, with it being my last chance to try and sort his phone for getting email, I checked to see if there were any
 responses to my query. After seeing your second question, having previously let the phone get the Gmail settings automatically, I tried deleting the Gmail account and starting again from scratch but by entering in the Gmail settings manually.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I didn't bother changing any of the account settings, as I thought I'd try and get it working first and so I left the "don't get mail older than" on it's default 3 days setting</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Having seemingly successfully set up the account manually, exactly the same happened as before, where the phone logs on and you can see it checking 307 headers but only one email header shows
 up temporarily in the inbox, but after checking all the headers this one email disappears (which might just because it was received on 16/09 and is therefore older than three days)</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>However sadly as before, no email headers which have arrived in his Gmail account over the last three days appear on the phone</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Also the phone will send emails successfully via his Gmail account. Although the one I sent tonight as a test from his phone has not appeared in my inbox but I believe this might be because I
 need to uncheck either the "requires authentication" or the "SSL" option in the account settings, as the emails I sent the other day as a test all appeared without any problem in my own inbox.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I also tried deleting a folder which had appeared on the SD card relating to email. Although I didn't really expect this to have much effect, as I assume it has only been created because the option
 to save email attachments to memory card is checked.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Although it seems too much of a coincidence that this problem only arose after I reformatted the mini SD memory card (but the truth is that I did not check the email prior so I suppose it is possible
 that the problem already existed without him realising?), I'm beginning to wonder if the issues are unrelated, as it seems to me that one could replace the memory card at any stage (eg. to upgrade to one with a larger memory capacity) and one would not expect
 the change to have any impact on one's email account (apart from one's email attachments being on the old card)</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I am completely baffled by this problem (but then that's not such a feat!) and unless one of you kind souls can come up with any suggestions as to how I could attempt to cure this problem, my
 only recourse is for me to spend hours on the phone to his service provider (Orange), first off waiting ages an eternity to get through to a human being, only then for this person to spend ages having me repeat all the steps I've already taken to set up an
 email account from scratch and when this results in exactly the same problem with no recent emails. for them to eventually suggest that there is no option but to replace the phone itself (again - as this is not the first time he's experienced aggravation with
 this model)</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Considering what a nightmare this will be setting up a new phone from scratch for him, I will be seriously endebted to anyone who takes the trouble to try and help me avoid such a scenario by
 making absolutely any reasonable suggestions</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Finally it won't be until Monday now when I'm having to drive down to Bristol for work and will be able to catch up with him again, but the one thing I didn't think of trying (although I am assuming
 the net results will be the same) was to check if the exact same thing happened if I put my own Gmail account settings into the phone instead of his ones.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Again my sincere apologies for the rambling nature of my response, but I am trying my best to pre-empt any further queries which might delay someone from making a suggestion. So my thanks for
 your patience in reading thus far</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Thanks a million</span></div>

<p>I have no question in my mind that the memory card is absolutely not related .... just happened to happen at the same time ... coincidence I guess.</p>

<p>Set up your gmail info and see if it works.&nbsp; I set up one on my device and it appears to work fine although I get very few gmails....</p>

            <span>Hey dude, <br />
<br />
I had the same problem on my phone, the deal with gmail is...u have to use IMAP to get the emails. So turn on IMAP at the settingspage on gmail, then set the incoming server to IMAP and change it to imap.gmail.com.
<br />
<br />
This fixes the problems with the dissapearing emails and the erratic receiving of mail.

            Zip the corrupt file (before you touched it), upload it on an online file hoster and post the download link here. Then we can take a look whether it is possible to restore some of the macros.

<br />No worries if you are not a Tech person. The DNS issue is expected to resolve today automatically so wait for another 24 hours and see if the message goes away. If that doesn't, we would explore other options which hopefully we should not.

<p>
</p><p>I personally am not that fond of the OneNote clipper. I don't think it formats the output well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use either the print command and then select "Send to OneNote" in the printer dialog or I use the Screen clipping command. &nbsp;The screen clipping icon is on the Insert tab or you can press Windows Key + N to open the Send to One note tool and select the
 Screen clipping command from there. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Import or Link data from an Excel file to Access 2007 database.</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting an error message when I try and Import data from an Excel spreradsheet. I have a macro set up wiith the RunSavedImportExport command and the error message seems to be sporadic and it shuts down the macro. The message reads as follows: "|"
 is not a valid name make sure that it does not include invalid characters or punctuation and that it is not too long". Neither case applies and there are no invalid characters in the name or on the tabs of the spreadsheet. I am only working with one tab on
 the spreadsheet and not multiple tabs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RunSavedImportExport will work properly several times and then this message is received. I delete the RunSavedImportExport instructions and rebuild them and they will work again for several times before returning the error message. I finally changed
 the macro and the Get External Data structure to Link to the data source (Excel) document and the results are the same. It&nbsp;does not seem to be the source of the spreadsheets as this has occured with Excel spreadsheets&nbsp;generated from&nbsp;different systems.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm not aware of any issues with the RunSavedImportExport, but perhaps you would want to&nbsp;consider using the TransferSpreadsheet action
 instead?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The TransferSpreadsheet action should offer you most of the options as the saved import.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet Method</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here's a vba sample:</span></p>
<p><span>DoCmd.TransferSpreadsheet acImport, acSpreadsheetTypeExcel12Xml, "Table1", CurrentProject.Path &amp; "\Table1.xlsx", True</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 OneNote won&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt ent  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 OneNote won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>I have been using the version of OneNote that comes free with Windows 10.&nbsp; I use a local Windows account, and I did not want OneNote (or anything else)&nbsp;automatically syncing to the cloud since I occasionally have proprietary and private info in my notes,
 so I disabled OneDrive.&nbsp; This has been fine for months, but yesterday OneNote asked me to sign in with my Microsoft account. I did not have time to stop what I was doing and think about it, so I cancelled out of that prompt which closed OneNote.&nbsp; Now OneNote
 will not open. The splash screen opens up, but it does nothing from there.&nbsp; It does not ask me to sign in or anything.&nbsp; I have tried opening OneDrive, and I have tried switching my Windows account to a Microsoft online account.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; I checked my OneNote
 online account, which only has the old notes up to the point I disabled OneDrive several months ago.&nbsp; I am willing to try to reinstall Windows 10, but first I need to back up my existing local notes, which I cannot find.&nbsp; I have checked
<span>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Onenote</span>, which was the OneNote 2013 local storage location, but that folder does not exist for this Windows 10 version apparently.</p>
<span>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Onenote</span>, which was the OneNote 2013 local storage location, but that folder does not exist for this Windows 10 version apparently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had this problem with OneNote not opening beyond the splash screen?&nbsp; Or do you know where the local copy of my notebooks are kept?</p>

            Thank you for the reply, but you misunderstand.&nbsp; I turned syncing off a few months ago, so my documents are NOT on my OneDrive account.&nbsp; The hard disk MUST have the data somewhere because the notes have to be stored somewhere before they are synced, especially
 since I can access them when I am not online.&nbsp; And I know how to uninstall and reinstall, but I want to figure out how to recover my local cache of notes first.

            Just to follow up, I never got a solution to this problem, and months of important notes are lost because of Microsoft's push to force people onto the cloud. &nbsp;I am now using Evernote, which keeps actual files on my computer regardless of sync settings.

    <title>Why would deleting hidden networks increase battery life&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why would deleting hidden networks increase battery life&#63;</h2>
                    I connect my Samsung Focus to a "hidden" network at work. When I clicked on the advanced setting my phone shows a warning of sorts stating "deleting hidden networks can increase battery life". I certainly like an increased battery life, but I don't want
 to broadcast the ssid of our work wireless router. Any ideas why this is the case?

            With a hidden network, the burden of the discovery falls onto the client (in this case the phone), so a phone must always broadcast, searching for the access point. Whereas on a normal network, the access point is broadcasting, allowing clients to discover
 it much faster and save power.<br />
<br />
Hidden networks are dumb. They provide no extra security and because of the constant broadcasting of the client, they can be revealed anyway. If you have this power, unhide the network and just make sure you're using WPA2 encryption, maybe MAC address filtering
 if you really want to. Your battery devices with WiFi will thank you.<br />

            Hi Joe,<br />
<br />
To better understand the situation, please confirm the following information:<br />
1. Ask the site administrator to check if the region of the site is correct via <strong>
Site Settings &gt; Regional Settings</strong>.<br />
2. Does the issue only happen to the <strong>Version History</strong> of the document? Is the time of last modified correct?<br />
3. Does the issue happen to all files or one specific file? Check if the issue occurs to another document library or another site.<br />
4. Does anyone else in your organization encounter the same issue?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I’d like to collect your account for further investigation via private message. You can access it via the link below:<br />

            Hi Joe, <br />
<br />
The situation may be caused by the different region and Time Zone on the computers and SharePoint Online. Our computers have their own region and Time Zone settings. SharePoint Online sites also has its own region and Time Zone settings. They won't influence
 each other. So when the time on your computer is 11:34 PM, the time in SharePoint Online sites is 12:34 PM. It may use the time zone which is 1 hour earlier than your computer.<br />
<br />
You may follow Jiaxing's suggestion to modify the Regional and Time Zone settings. For your personal OneDrive for Business library, you should be able to change it yourself (setting gear&gt;Site Settings&gt;Regional Settings). For the SharePoint Online team site,
 you can contact your admins to change it (if other users also use the same time zone as you).
<br />

    <title>Paste text into paragraph without changing format - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> goose66  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paste text into paragraph without changing format</h2>
                    In past Word versions, I have always pasted with "Paste Special-&gt;Unformatted Text" option.&nbsp; However, in Word 2010, pasting with the "Keep Text Only" option changes the formatting of the paragraph into which you are pasting to Normal, abandoning the current
 formatting of the paragraph.&nbsp; This occurs even if you paste just a few simple words in the middle of a sentence.&nbsp; All I can say is WTF?!?&nbsp; I have turned on and off all the "smart" cut and paste behaviors trying to fix this.&nbsp; I have always used&nbsp;"Paste Special-&gt;Unformatted
 Text" option because the default paste in Word '97 - 2007 never resulted in the text formatted&nbsp;as any normal human being would expect.&nbsp; Now "Keep Text Only" in Word 2010 falls into the same category, and those normal human beings of us out there are left with
 no cut and paste options!&nbsp; Is there anyway to utilize&nbsp;the old "Paste Special-&gt;Unformatted Text" behavior in Word 2010?

            <p>How is the formatting applied to the target paragraph?&nbsp; When I use Paste&gt;Special&gt;Unformatted Text, the text that is being pasted always takes on the font formatting of the target paragraph, whether that formatting is part of the Style assigned to the target
 paragraph or was applied to that paragraph by direct formatting.</p>
<p>That is also the case if the text that is being copied is formatted in the Normal style, with some other style that includes a font formatting other than that of the Normal style, or has font formatting directly applied to it.</p>

<p>In this particular case, the indentation of the paragraph is changed&nbsp;new tab stops are added.&nbsp; As I mentioned, this is the case even if a few words are pasted into the middle of the paragraph with no carriage returns.&nbsp; It happens whether I use "Keep Text
 Only" from the context menu or I invoke the Paste Sepcial dialog and choose "Unformatted Text."&nbsp; This is happening in all documents, although the commonality is that the&nbsp;documents all have&nbsp;numbered paragraphs.&nbsp;&nbsp;If change the paragraph to unnumbered and then&nbsp;paste
 using the same techniques into unnumbered paragraphs, it seems to work.&nbsp; However, I always use numbered paragraphs, and this worked just fine in Word 2007 using the Paste Special-&gt;Unformatted Text technigue, so it is definitely a new "feature" of Word 2010.</p>

            <p>I have the same exact issue and I must say; this is completely unacceptable.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This "feature" needs to be corrected in a timely manner.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>Here are the details of what I am experiencing:</p>
<p>I am not using a style sheet.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am using numbered paragraphs.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am in the 2nd sub-level of paragraphs (example: section 8.6 of my document).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The formatting of all 2 level paragraphs is consistent and of a desirable look.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The formatting has been manually applied (no Style Sheet).<span>&nbsp;
</span>I create a new text document; open it, type in 1 character (example "g"), copy the character, and paste it into the middle of a 2 level paragraph within my document.<span>&nbsp; Within each line of this paragraph, t</span>he "Hanging
 Indent" has shifted left.<span>&nbsp; </span>The "Left Tab" and "First Line Indent" have remained the same.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This, of course, is a change to the paragraph formatting and is not the desired formatting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say, this also not the reasonably expected result of the paste action.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I've reproduced this using; paste "Keep Text Only", paste "Unformatted Text", and paste "Unformatted Unicode Text".<span>&nbsp;
</span>All three options produce the same results.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>FYI: These are the only three paste options available for this scenario; "Keep Source Formatting" and "Merge Formatting" options are not offered to be in this situation, assumably because
 the character I am pasting contains no formatting.<br />
<br />
It's reasonable to say this "feature" is not dependent on retaining or merging formatting from clipboard text, but is actually a function of the paste action and/or paragraph formatting.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I must also mention I have worked extensively with Word 2003, and am new to Word 2010, and that I did not experience this "feature" when utilizing "Paste Unformatted Text" (both with and w/out
 a Style Sheet) in Word 2003.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Please Fix, or at least provide Work Around.

            <p>Chet_asdf, I tried to replicate your problem.&nbsp; I typed text using the numbering system 1...., 2......,</p>
<p>3....., 4..... and then an automatically indented 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, etc.&nbsp; (I don't understand why you say your numbering system is manually applied.&nbsp; I hope you used the Multilevel List numbering system in the Paragraph Group.)&nbsp; Then I created a new document
 and typed a word in a different font on it.&nbsp; Then I highlighted the word and clicked "Copy."&nbsp; I tried all three options -- Keep Source Formatting, Merge Formatting, and Keep Text Only --&nbsp;for pasting that word into my previously-typed text.&nbsp; As you found, none
 worked.&nbsp; None left the previously-typed text in the right format.&nbsp; Then I looked closely at the options
<em>below </em>the three little boxes containing the three above-mentioned basic options for copying.&nbsp; I clicked "Set Numbering Value."&nbsp; I saw two options, "Start new list" and "Continue from previous list."&nbsp; I clicked on "Continue from previous list."&nbsp; There
 is a preview of the level.&nbsp; I didn't change that.&nbsp; Then I pasted the word where I wanted&nbsp;it to go using the right-hand box, Keep Text Only.&nbsp; The word went into the right place, matched the format, and left the numbering levels and indents as they were.&nbsp; I
 hope this helps.</p>

            This is not the answer to the original post. &nbsp;The OP's problem--and mine, incidentally--is that he cannot paste text into his formatted document without destroying that formatting. &nbsp;The formatting in question is the indent. &nbsp;

<div>The responses talk in circles. &nbsp;Of course the formatting of the recipient paragraph will not be simple "normal." &nbsp; &nbsp;For anyone who makes and revises documents, this is a significant problem. &nbsp; I"m spending all my time reformatting every paragraph in which
 I paste text, which is almost every paragraph. &nbsp;How &nbsp;could paste text only necessarily mean to change the tabs and indents?&nbsp;</div>

            No, this has not been fixed. All of the mentioned workarounds in my other posts on this problem are from folks that don't understand the nature of the problem. Note that it only seems to affect numbered paragraphs, however. Any pasting of text into numbered
 paragraphs changes the formatting of the entire paragraph to the style of the paragraph, and ignores any previously applied formatting changes. It does not act as if you were simply typing the text into the paragraph, like one would expect.

            <div>Here is what I am noticing. I believe the issue has more to do with some (unknown to me) auto numbering/bullet feature. When pasting text into a numbered list word is trying to decide if it should create a new numbered item, a non numbered item (new paragraph),
 or to add it to the current numbered item.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
To clarify, when you say numbered paragraph you have to remember it is really just a numbered list where we have changed some settings to make it look like a paragraph. If we keep this in mind, then we might understand that the issue we are having may not be
 an actual issue. The issue is really a result of using a numbered list in a way it may not have been designed for.
<div><br />
<div>However I believe I have found a solution; or in the least a work around. The way I tell you to change the settings will only be in affect on a per document basis, but I believe they can be changed so they are defaults for all documents.&nbsp;
<div>
<div><br />
<div>First: Highlight one of your numbers, you should notice that all of the numbers are now selected.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Second: Right click on one of the numbers, then select "Adjust list indents".&nbsp;</div>
<div>Third: Change the "Text indent" to 0 inches.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now, when you paste text into the numbered list, select keep text only option. When you do this, the text will be pasted into the current item, and the indent will not be changed.&nbsp;</div>

            After much frustration trying to eliminate this exact issue, I resorted to requesting assistance from our top-notch IT team who promptly fixed the problem.&nbsp; Solution is a change of settings:<br />
<br />
Click the ‘file’ tab &gt; ‘options’ &gt; ‘Advanced’ &gt; scroll down to under the ‘cut, copy, paste’ section, and next to the ‘use smart cut and paste’ click on ‘settings’ &gt; check the ‘adjust paragraph spacing on paste’ &gt; ok &gt; ok
<br />
<br />
Plain paste away folks!!!<br />
<br />
P.S. If you are looking for a very simple app that pastes straight text from any app with one configurable key-stroke, check out http://stevemiller.net/puretext/.&nbsp; Used it for years ... great product. And it's free!!!

            While I appreciate your efforts, this does not resolve the problem described in the original post. In fact, I have "Smart Cut and Paste" turned completely off (I found that it is not very smart at all). This is a bug in
<i>NUMBERED PARAGRAPHS </i>which I use extensively in my work and rest assured I have tried every way to Sunday to fix it. It's just broken.&nbsp;The only way to make it work properly (and keep me from blowing my computer away with a shotgun)
 is to define paragraph styles and make sure your paragraphs match a style. If your paragraph formatting does not match a style, when you "paste as text" in the middle of the paragraph, the entire paragraph will revert to the parameters of the style to which
 it is assigned (usually "normal"). What makes it so darn frustrating is that the function itself is so simple: Why does "Paste as Text" just not insert the characters as if I typed them? Why is Word even monkeying with paragraph styles on a Paste as Text operation
 and why does the behavior seem to differ for numbered paragraphs?
<div><br />
<div>BTW, it's still broken in Word 2013, too. First thing I checked. Microsoft obviously doesn't check these boards for bugs.</div>

<p>My issue was on clean install and also upgrade with ISO from Release. It would take several attempts before finally logging in. It would remain logged in, not like your issue. This just started in the last two builds, possibly 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sign into my MS account via Apps, and allow it to sign in to all my Apps. It is an indirect method to use your MS account without ever having to use a password, which I do not require in vm's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, I am using my local account but I get the same benefits as if signed into my MS account. I hope you can see the difference.</p>

After the reset when sign in it gives different account options.

<p>You are missing the point, this is on a clean install, your issue most likely was due to corruption as you use WU to update your builds. That is why reset fixed your problem. Were you not already signed into your MS account, it was just an issue for you
 on FBH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using FBH to sign into my MS account, (Win10 then gives you the option to sign into all your apps). The system was just put online after doing an offline clean install. We are talking apples and oranges here.</p>
<p>I am still using my local account with MS account benefits, including signing up for Insider if need be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of curiosity, have you ever done a total clean install <em>offline</em>, wiping all partitions. It is different than upgrading a system, or clean installing
<em>online</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, what you are seeing after doing the reset of FBH is exactly what I see every time I sign into my MS account via FBH using my local account. You may have never seen this before.</p>

<h2>            Screen shot option in word doesn&#39;t work for the Adobe Connect Window</h2>
                    <p>I have the Adobe Connect classroom open. I go to Microsoft Word 2010 and select Screenshot and it shows me all the available windows. It shows thumbnail of all the windows available including the Adobe Connect window but the content of this window is not
 shown. I can work around this problem by using the screen clipping option and selecting the part of the screen where Adobe Connect window is open and this works fine. It is just that when I click on screenshot, I won't be able to get a picture of the Adobe
 Connect Window. Adobe Connect version is 9.1.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is no serious issue but just want to confirm if this&nbsp;is a bug or if it is something that I am doing wrong.</p>

    <title>Outlook for Mac Drafts Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andy1atkin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Mac Drafts Issue</h2>
                    <p>We have kind of a crazy bug that is showing up in our environment specifically with Outlook 2011 users.&nbsp; We use Exchange 2010 sp3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when our users save multiple saved drafts in Outlook for Mac, and then later on send one of those drafts, their client will merge two drafts together and end up sending Draft B, with all of the content of Draft B, but to the recipients specified
 in Draft A.&nbsp; In this situation both drafts disappear completely , and as far as Exchange is concerned, only one email is submitted which is the strange merged version, which is then routed as you would normally expect it to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other odd part of this bug is, when we later take a look at these merged messages, the headers look correct, as in the headers of Draft B show the originally intended recipients of that Draft B, and make no reference to the mistaken recipients that are
 'borrowed' from Draft A.&nbsp; We obviously can't do any analysis of Draft A in these situations as Draft A disappears completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I have two emails in my drafts folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Draft 1:</p>
<p>To: Todd</p>
<p>Subject: Hey Todd</p>
<p>Body: Hey Todd</p>
<p>
</p><p>Draft 2:</p>
<p>To: Andy</p>
<p>Subject: Hey Andy</p>
<p>Body: Hey Andy</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I send the first draft in this example, I will end up sending an email to Todd, but it will be an email with the subject line, body and headers of the other draft originally addressed to Andy.&nbsp; The hybrid email will make its way into the "Sent Items",
 the other draft will disappear completely.</p>
<p>It's almost as if the client is combining these two drafts together and then submitting a merged copy to Exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far it has impacted around 14 people in our environment, all using Outlook for Mac and all using drafts.&nbsp; Other common factors seem to include time and travel, as in these drafts would be created while on a plane, and then sent when landed, or created
 a few days prior to being sent, or created offline, and then sent later when online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is aware of this and working with us to try and figure out what is going on here, but as it stands we have been unable to repro this in any kind of controlled environment, and I was hoping that someone else may have come across a similar issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andy</p>

    <title>Help needed with Polycom VVX-501 on Skype for Business Cloud PBX - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Help needed with Polycom VVX-501 on Skype for Business Cloud PBX</h2>
                    <p>I am looking to deploy the Polycom VVX-501 to my company. We are completely on-cloud for Skype for Business, hybrid for Exchange, and ADFS/Azure AD Connect for authentication. Some of us have Azure Multifactor Authentication turned on (including me).&nbsp;I would
 like to deploy MFA to the company but that is another story. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone ships with UC version 5.4.1.17954. Because of Azure Multifactor, I am unable to log in unless I use an app password and then I have difficulty with the calendar. If I upgrade the UC software to the latest version, 5.5.0.20556 then I have no issues
 whatsoever (I can even use my network password!)&nbsp;except that the phone reverts back to 5.4.1.17954. To get around this I added option 066 Boot Server Host Name to DHCP and specified in the configuration file device.local.autoUpdateEnabled="0" and a custom.upgrade.server.url
 which installs the 5.5.0.20556 UC software. The phone will stay on the correct version for about a week or so and then it will downgrade. I unplug the phone and plug it back in&nbsp;and it upgrades again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a real nuisance. I don't understand what is telling the phone to downgrade. Any help would be appreciated.

    <title>Outlook not syncing&#47;receiving messages from email account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malcolmn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook not syncing&#47;receiving messages from email account</h2>
                    <p>My outlook has stopped receiving messages from my primary email account on ALL my devices, except for mails sent directly to my "Alias" at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. any message addressed directly to Outlook.com is received. There are multiple messages in the inbox
 at my main account (Can be seen on Webmail) but are not showing in either mail app or outlook.</p>
<p>This apparently started on Thursday 29th September, which is also the date of a major update to Win 10 BUT having rolled back the Surface Pro the problem is still there, so it seems the Mail server is causing this. However I can't find any problem in settings
 or anything else AND my account is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice please as this is a serious issue for me</p>

            <p>Help me out here, I am confused. I am using Outlook from Office 365 so are you referring to my Microsoft account? What has subsequently happened is that while I receive messages addressed to my outlook.com alias any mails I send simply disappear and don't
 get delivered either. I.e. don't get to Sent and don't get to recipient but go from Outbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I delete my account I can't re-create it with same password etc. and that's a problem.</p>

            This is not the issue. All was working fine with emails from both addresses being delivered to Office Outlook, UNTIL Tuesday 27th September when Microsoft changed Outlook.com. Outlook.com/Mail app is not collecting mails from external addresses and not
 sending any either!

            <p>Hi, after a lot of trying different things I think the problem definition is slightly different. Syncing calendar, contacts, etc. is OK as long as it's done&nbsp;in the Contacts at Outlook.com file. They are synced correctly with the Surface and phones, as are
 any mails sent to the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email. So syncing works OK. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that it's not so much a syncing issue as a mail app issue. It used to download all my emails from my personal mail address&nbsp;and they would appear in the "Inbox" of the mail app and hence into my Outlook (Office 365) on the PC and naturally
 also to the relevant devices like the Surface. The problem is that now it won't suck these mails into the outlook.com mailbox. If I add the account (mail) again it does indeed download the mails, but to a different "Inbox" in the mail app, but that doesn't
 sync. I tried linking the mailboxes from the 2 accounts, but still doesn't sync the personal mails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can obviously work around this, I currently download the personal mail stuff directly to Outlook and receive the Outlook.com stuff as well in a separate inbox on the PC. Anything I want to sync can be achieved by a "Rule" to forward the message to the
 Outlook.com mailbox. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this is not ideal and I would really like to try and get it back to where it was on 27th September!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>I understand that mail app is separate. I have always used MS Outlook on the PC but before the changes my POP mail was the primary account in the Mail app and the Outlook.com address was an Alias on my account. Before the recent changes all my mail from
 the POP account came through the Mail app. i.e all messages be it sent to my personal mail or directly to Outlook.com all came in to a single account in MS Outlook. Now it doesn't work like that. Sure I can get around it, I now have 2 email accounts in MS
 Outlook, but why can't I get it to work the way it was before? </p>

<p>From time to time the IMAP service responds with the error <strong>"User is authenticated but not connected"</strong> and denies the synchronization of the emails, for around 15-30 minutes. In this time I can not access nor answer my emails from the clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried from mobilenet and from fix wifi, but I get the same results. So it is independent from the connection.</p>
<p>I have found some hints that this is due to the "chatty client policy" of the cloud.</p>
<p>However this is not an excuse. I need my two clients for work, and I have a business package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I overcome this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p><span>Hello Galambos Róbert,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>May I confirm if you add your Office 365 account as IMAP type into Gmail and Thunderbird for Android client? If so, I would suggest you try remove your account from those clients and then re-add it back to
 check the results. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: Please back up your data before you remove it.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, to rule out mobile client problems, if it is convenience, please add your account into desktop client or Outlook client see if it can help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem persists, would you mind provide us a screenshot of the error message to help us understand your symptom more clearly?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>

<p>Hello Galambos,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply because I was off duty before. May I know what the type of the affected account(Office 365 for Business account or other account)? I understand the problem happens both in Gmail for Android and Thunderbird desktop
 client. Given the situation, you can try to add the account to Outlook desktop client to see if there is any difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the description, the problem may be related to the mail provider. It is suggested to contact your mail server for further help.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

</p><p>The affected account is an&nbsp;<span>Office 365 for Business account.</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately I have a Linux based system which is required for my work, so I can not try Outlook desktop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What do you mean by mail provider? I am using the official Office 365 cloud as mail provider:</span></p>

<p>Hello Galambos,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt reply. In order to narrow down the issue, I will send you a test account via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">private message</a>, which works fine on my side. Please add this test account to the affected desktop client via IMAP and see if there is any difference. Note: The test account will be deleted
 after the test. Please do not leave any personal information in the test account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I noticed that you mentioned it is due to the “chatty client policy”. Would you mind please provide an article for reference?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hello Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only provide some forum information what I have found:</p>
<p>https://github.com/mscdex/node-imap/issues/689</p>
<p>
</p><p>"...It is a Microsoft's mechanism to shut down chatty clients. The solution would be to login to this account less frequently..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that the server thinks that this is a chatty client, because I have more clients operation mostly from the same public IP address. (either mobile net, or through wifi)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the test account soon. But I have to configure it to both clients to produce the same environment.</p>

<p>Hello Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested 3 accounts simultaneously.</p>
<p>A) My original account where the problem occurs.</p>
<p>B) Your test account.</p>
<p>C) A test account created in our domain (like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these accounts are configured the same way in the client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My A) account produced the problem as earlier. (sometimes working sometimes not)</p>
<p>I have found that sometimes only some IMAP folders are not synchronized. For example Inbox is working fine, but for the Sent I receive the given error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your B) test account which you have provided, I have never encountered any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the newly created C) account which is in our domain. I never encountered any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(However there is a strange thing. For all of the accounts that in our domain (...@mycompany.hu) there is a strange behavior. The messages are automatically copied into the Sent folder by the server, and if configured in the client they appear there twice.
 This bug/feature just appeared earlier without any server modification, and as far as I know it is not settable on the server by us.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the result of my test is that, the problem seems to be account specific.</p>
<p>However we need to keep in mind that my account has a lot of emails, and the test accounts are quite empty.</p>
<p>My configuration is the same for all accounts, so the client seems to handle the IMAP correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we further narrow down the problem?</p>
<p>What possibilities do we have to find what causes this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regard,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<p>Hello Galambos,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt update. I have also searched online and found some similar reports that the problem happens to Office 365 accounts after they changed the password. The reason is that the password stored by Thunderbird didn’t update.
 Under this circumstance, the workaround is to remove the credentials in Thunderbird and re-enter the user name and password.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have any questions about it or it doesn’t work, it is recommended to also contact Thunderbird support for further investigating on it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<h2>            Double click to make a call, or at least remove the option to call actual numbers&#63;</h2>
                    Why was the double-click call feature removed? It was the most convenient way to make calls, and it was working just fine between 2003 and maybe 2017. And, if this is not possible (I already know it's not, so that's why I asked for the reason, because
 it seems like such an odd decision to remove it), then would it at least be possible to make the call button on the upper right part of the screen execute the Skype call directly, without prompting me to select whether I want to make a Skype call or a mobile/landline
 phone call? I only use Skype to make Skype calls, and it annoys me when I accidentally press the phone number instead of normal Skype call. I've been trying both the desktop client and the Windows 10 app version. Thanks in advance!

<h2>            Outlook doesn&#39;t show in Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to share a Calendar with myself in Outlook. I want to be able to see ande sync the same Calendar in Outlook on both my home and work compuers,<br />
<br />
I have Office 365 Pro Plus which should include Outlook. I have Outlook installed and working on both home and work computers.<br />
<br />
I can see that sharing calandars and calendar permissions are greyed out on my desktop installations of Outlook but I have spent ages reading fourms and from the answers there it seems that I should be able to share a calendar and set permissions in Office
 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the answers I can find tell me to log on to Office 365 and to click the calendar or Outlook app icons there, but Outlook doesn't show up in my apps on Office 365 and there is no Calendar icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks:</p>

<p>Do you use an outlook.com or office 365 Exchange online account? That is what outlook uses to sync calendar (and contacts, tasks) between computers.

<p>
</p><p>I have instructions at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlookcom/sync-calendar-contacts-using-outlook-com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sync Calendar and Contacts Using Outlook.com</a>&nbsp;to use outlook.com just for calendar and contacts while using
 pop or imap email.&nbsp;</p>

            You don't need to share your calendar with yourself  - just open the outlook.com account on the other computer. 
<br />
<br />If you need to actually share it with another account, you can send a calendar sharing invitation from the Outlook.com account. You can't share the calendar in a POP or IMAP account, only outlook.com or an exchange account.

<p>
</p><p>We unable to collaborate on Excel workbooks at the same time with co-authoring. When one user open the excel using desktop application, other user getting read-only and unable to edit. Is there any limitation on using desktop application for user to edit

<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Puteri,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the query.</p>
<p>I need to say that if we want to use co-authoring feature, we need to have an
<a href="https://products.office.com/buy/compare-microsoft-office-products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 subscription</a> and the latest version of Office.</p>
<p>You can get more information on the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/collaborate-on-excel-workbooks-at-the-same-time-with-co-authoring-7152aa8b-b791-414c-a3bb-3024e46fb104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Collaborate on Excel workbooks at the same time with co-authoring</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you try updating Office to check the result:</p>
<p>1. Open the Excel&gt;select File.</p>
<p>2. Click Account&gt;select Update Option&gt;click Update now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information for further analysis?</p>
<p>1. The all version of Office, as there are several users edit the files at the same time. (Click File&gt;select Account)</p>
<p>2. Can you edit the file at the same time before?</p>
<p>3. Check if all files meet the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Qing</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
