<h2>            Как изменить тег игрока xbox live на ПК&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Была создана Учетная запись Майкрософт примерно года полтора назад.<br />
После приобретения Windows 8 была активирована учетная запись на Xbox. <br />
Сразу по незнанию я не обратил внимания на тег игрока, но позднее когда решил его изменить оказалось, что уже поздно и только платно.
<br />
Я приобрёл&nbsp; Xbox Live Gold на один меся с надеждой, что активируется смена тега, но нет, купил 800 Points, тоже неполучается.
<br />
Проживаю на Украине. <br />
Приставки у меня нет, играю только на ПК в игры из магазина Windows, но тег игрока очень неприятный и очень хотелось его изменить.
<br />
Создавал ещё одну учётную запись и тег как мне нравится, но перенести тоже не смог - удалил.<br />
Очень Вас прошу помочь мне со сменой тега игрока.</p>

<p>Изменить тег игрока можно в двух следующих местах.</p>
<p>На консоли Xbox – если у вас есть учетная запись Xbox LIVE, вы можете поменять тег игрока Xbox LIVE за 800 баллов Microsoft Points -

<p>В Windows Live на ПК – если у вас есть учетная запись Games for Windows - LIVE, вы можете изменить тег игрока в службе Games for Windows - LIVE -

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might be due to system file corruption. I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Use System File Checker to repair damaged Windows files
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Use the System File Checker tool to repair damaged Windows files. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><span>Windows logo key + X</span></strong>,&nbsp;select
<strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin)</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Run the "<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>"&nbsp;command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt (Admin) and hit
<strong><span>Enter </span></strong>key.</span></li><li><span>Once it complete, try to install updates again to see if they work correctly.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about the System File Checker tool, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Run the DISM tool
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem continues, use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to fix Windows Update corruption errors. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><span>Windows logo key + X</span></strong>,&nbsp;select
<strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin)</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Run the "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image&nbsp;/Restorehealth" command by copy/pasting it into the Command&nbsp;prompt(Admin) and hit
<strong><span>Enter </span></strong>key</span></li><li><span>Once it complete, try to install updates again to see if they&nbsp;work correctly.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required
 to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source
 of the files. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do this, run the following command instead:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong>Replace the C:\RepairSource\Windows placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference

<h2>            KB3176493 and KB3172729 Windows 10 security updates messing with Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting rather fed up with this now.&nbsp; Every Win 10 update lately is causing numerous issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the security updates of 11 August KB3172985, KB3176493, KB3172729 happened today and the system rebooted, I cannot get access to the internet and keep getting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET and a flaming running dinosaur on every webpage and send/receive errors in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing happened with the updates in June.&nbsp; The only way to get web page access in Chrome and email access back into Outlook is to uninstall those updates.&nbsp; Something that Microsoft are doing in the background is messing with the firewall and/or proxy
 settings.&nbsp; What is intriguing is that I am not using a Windows based firewall at all, I'm using Trend Micro - so what are the updates changing that cannot be seen here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notwithstanding this, the Adobe Reader Update that is bundled with all the Windows 10 updates keeps changing the page setup to US sized letter paper instead of A4 when opening up a PDF to print (even though it says it is A4, once sent to printer it says
 load US paper size!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way this is going I will be turning off any updates altogether.</p>

<p>Similar Probs here:</p>
<p>MSOffice 2007: stopped working</p>
<p>MSOffice 2016: unable to finish install, always stopped at 95 %.</p>
<p>TCPView (sysinternals): stopped working, when operated from an account with admin privileges</p>
<p>Secunia PSI (Secunia): stopped working, - "unable to work, when there is a proxy present".</p>
<p>Some more issues with previously running programmes, that were gated out by ms firewall. (solved.)</p>
<p>and more ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I stepped back (go to previos windows version). This worked (happily).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Addendum: </p>
<p>My Acronis True Image Backup Program was removed without saying, without leaving a trace ...</p>
<p>I am annoyed. (My NAS with the Acronis Backup on it is still there.)</p>

            <p>Three updates loaded together August 11 2016:&nbsp; KB890830; KB3172729 and KB3176493 and resulted in my screen refreshing frequently and repeatedly.&nbsp; Upon going back to a restore point the problem ceased, but of course the updates are reloaded overnight!&nbsp; So
 I still have to endure a display incessantly refreshing itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment of writing I have "allowed" KB890830 to install alone, and the refreshing problem appears to be cured, so&nbsp; what's wrong with 3172729 and 3176493 Microsoft?</p>

            <p>KB3176493 and KB3172729 reloaded overnight. (No kb890830 here). </p>
<p>And everything seems to do its job now.</p>
<p>This means: </p>
<p>1. No more interference with Acronis True Image Monitor Program.</p>
<p>2. Tcpview leads to screen output, - also when run with admin rights.</p>
<p>3. Secunia psi does what it is meant for.</p>
<p>4. Microsoft Home and Business 2016 installs als desired.</p>
<p>5. Dragon Naturally Speaking running again as desired.</p>
<p>6. No previously installed programs (MS and non-MS) were stopped by ms firewall, (had been: stops without giving notice).</p>
<p>7. No more strange screen info about some proxy interfering with some net access (I could not identify, which programs were affected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only 2 things, different to the day before yesterday I see, are </p>
<p>1. that I uninstalled MS Office 2007 *before installing MS Office 2016*. So MS programs seem to interfere with other MS programs?</p>
<p>2. vlc media player can no longer be set as standard program for music and /or video. Although being in the list of optional choices. This is strange. There should be better MS-communication, which reasonable standards third party programs have to meet.
 "Not made by us" is not reasonable, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is helpful to some of you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I thought I'd turned off updates after the mess they made this week, but the darned thing started downloading and updating again yesterday. &nbsp;I think someone may have been listening because this time I'm getting no proxy/firewall error messages on web access,
 so maybe they fixed the update(s).</p>

<p>do you use more than *just one single* HDD on your PC? </p>

            <p>When my system updated on Aug 12 with KB890830, KB3172729 &amp; KB3176493 the immediate result was a number of problems with&nbsp;my laptop's performance:
</p>
<ul>
<li>web pages took eternity (30 sec) to load (whether using IE 11, Edge, or Chrome browsers), then similar delays in responding to Back button</li><li>sometimes browser wouldn't open or respond at all; ditto with pressing Start icon</li><li>keystrokes&nbsp;showed several seconds delay before taking effect</li><li>got frequent "Not responding" error messages when trying to open programs (Word, Excel), browsers, even&nbsp;Task Manager.&nbsp; If I waited long enough they sometimes opened, but not always</li><li>occasionally the entire laptop would freeze, necessitating as hard shutdown.</li></ul>
<p>Trying Windows' Troubleshooting functions didn't show any issues or resolve anything, and a virus scan was negative&nbsp;.&nbsp; I ended up re-setting the laptop to an earlier&nbsp;restore point and ran a free trial version of AVG's PC Tuneup.&nbsp; The 3 updates have since
 re-loaded automatically, and (knock on wood) the performance problems haven't re-appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting that my wife's Dell OptiPlex desktop downloaded the same offending Win 10 updates on Aug 12 with no problems. Her machine has a 320 GB SATA hard drive, while my Dell Latitude laptop has a 128 GB solid state drive.&nbsp; I noticed that Microsoft recently
 issued a notice that Win 10 may freeze after installing the Anniversary Update on systems with the OS stored on a solid-state drive</p>
<p><span>(</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-may-freeze-after-installing-the/5a60d75d-120a-4502-873c-8bfec65c82d0?page=1&amp;auth=1"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-may-freeze-after-installing-the/5a60d75d-120a-4502-873c-8bfec65c82d0?page=1&amp;auth=1</span></a><span>
 ). Although the Anniversary Update hasn't yet installed on my machine (&amp; I'm <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> looking forward to it...), maybe the issues I had with the 3 Aug 12 updates are associated with the fact that I've got a solid-state drive?</span></p>

<p>KB3176493 and KB3172729 (i.e.: this thread's subject) get delivered for Windows 10&nbsp; v.1511 and for Windows 10 v.1607 systems either.
</p>
<p>My posts of August, 13 solely relate to Windows 10, 64 bit, v.1511, i.e. after having stepped back from 1607.<br />

            <p>The only problem I am having is with my internet - it keeps randomly freezing certain websites and then they will work fine if I restart. It is infuriating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just uninstalled kb3176493 for the 3RD TIME! They should allow users to uninstall updates and not reinstall them until Microsoft are sure there are no bugs to screw up folks' computers. I thought that's what beta teams were for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah well, I have one night of uninterrupted internet until they get updated on my PC overnight...again!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 System Warning Dialog Boxes do not close - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark-abrams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 System Warning Dialog Boxes do not close</h2>
                    <p>* Reconnect your drive - Your File History drive was disconnected for too long. Reconnect it and then tap or click to keep saving copies of your files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dialog box will not close when clicking or tapping the red circle (X)</p>
<p>I&nbsp;connected the drive, viewed the files on the drive and attempted to close the warning dialog&nbsp;box.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>NO CLOSE</p>
<p>The box is at the lower right screen above the toolbar. It is displayed on the top layer and blocks the view below and controls below it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this occur with other system notices:</p>
<p>* The battery has 7% remaining, plug in your power cord or save open files ...</p>
<p>The dialog box would not close after the power cord was plugged in. </p>
<p>
</p><p>* Can't connect to OneDrive ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>After connecting to OneDrive - I still could not close the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to close the dialog boxes, was to shutdown the laptop (Yoga 11S - Windows 8 - upgraded&nbsp;to Win10) with the problem corrected so that it does not trigger the warning message.</p>

<h2>            Ipod Classic &#40;80gb&#41; &#39;USB device not recognized&#39; running windows 7</h2>
                    I have recently upgraded to a new laptop (acer aspire 5738G) running windows 7. I have successfully transfered my itunes library across and have installed itunes (x64) which is running fine. When i plug my ipod classic (80gb) into a usb port i get a message
 saying 'usb device not recognized'. I have managed to get it working once but when i did, i got an error meassge saying 'this drive could run faster' or something along those lines. I have tried other usb devices and all seem to work fine so i'm assuming its
 the drivers for the ipod or a compatability issue with 7 and itunes. I have uninstalled and reinstalled itunes, have reinstalled the usb drivers and have scoured the net for a fix but wo is still me!! I have waited patiently for a fix from either microsoft
 or apple but as yet nothing. It seems that this is a wide spread problem. Does anyone have any ideas as what was once a slighty annoying problem is turning into a right royal pain in the ****. Thanks in advance!

            I too have the same problem getting "USB not recognized" and I have the older IPOD classic (20Gb).
<br />
<br />
The problem started when I upgraded my home pc to Windows 7 Pro 32bit from Windows Vista. Currently, my iphone 3gs is recognized properly but not the 20Gb ipod on same iTunes 9.0.2. The device manager reports the 20Gb ipod as "unknown device"<br />
<br />
My home pc is a HP Pavilion Slimline s3620f. Tried almost everything:<br />
- reboot several times<br />
- reinstall itunes several times<br />
- restarted the itunes service several times<br />
- reconnect the ipod several times<br />
- tried the front and back usb ports<br />
- deleted that hidden sentinel file under c:/users/&lt;user&gt;/musci/itunes/ which I found as solution on other forum<br />
<br />
... still nada, zit, ala! <br />
<br />
Update: I found a workaround. Luckily, my classic ipod cable is a y-cable that comes with firewire in addition to the usb cable. Since my home pc has firewire port, Windows 7 now recognizes the classic ipod via that port, have a drive letter and itunes works
 on it as well.<br />

<h2>            Xbox One needs to add Google Chrome on the Dashboard not IE</h2>
                    
<p>Xbox One needs to add Google Chrome on the Dashboard not IE. IE is the worst internet service in the world the reason why it's still around is because most public offices and work places have IE. Xbox One should give us Google Chrome the best internet service
 out there.Plus IE is known for crashing a lot and it's easy to get hacked if you use IE just saying.</p>

<p>congrats on being a web designer/developer, you should know then Microsoft makes Internet Explorer so of course they are going to push their product...<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I know lets make a third-party make our snap on apps... yes that'll be great!<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you not think they are using IE so they have control over what can be snapped? only a few applications can be "snapped" such as Skype.. (Microsoft Owns Skype), DVR tool (Microsofts DVR tool), IE (guess what, Microsoft owns IE).</p>

<p>Chrome is a resource hog and is really overrated. Firefox though, I do agree that it will always be the top browser. IE is better than chrome now though.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to start the Windows Audio and Windows End Point Builder service.
</p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Press <strong>Windows key + R.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b:</strong> Type <strong>services.msc</strong> in the run dialog box and hit enter.</p>
<p><strong>c: </strong>Now look for services called <strong>Windows audio and Windows End point builder
</strong>and make sure that services are started and set to <strong>automatic. </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply on the same post, let us know the status.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Guru Kiran</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kelly,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community, the best place for all your Windows related queries.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, I understand your mouse works in the log in screen, but it does not work after logging in.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Could you answer few questions to understand the issue well:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which mouse is not working on your laptop, the mouse pad or the external mouse?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you try using another mouse?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the mouse?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There should be some driver problem.</span></p>
<p><span>So, I would suggest you to follow these methods to find out the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Run Hardware troubleshooter using keyboard.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to run hardware troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press
<b>windows key + W</b> and type <b>troubleshooting</b> and press
<b>Enter</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press the
<b>down arrow key</b> to select <b>view all</b> and press <b>
Enter</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press the
<b>down arrow key</b> to select <b>Hardware and devices Troubleshooter</b> and then press
<b>Enter</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press
<b>Enter</b> once again and run the <b>hardware and devices troubleshooter</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Update mouse drivers using key board.</span></b></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press
<b>Windows key + X</b> and select <b>Device Manager </b>by pressing the down arrow key.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press tab key and then keep pressing the down arrow key to reach
<b>mice and other pointing devices.</b></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Then press the right arrow key to expand
<b>mice and other pointing devices.</b></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the HID Compliant mouse.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press the key between
<b>Ctrl key</b> and <b>Windows key</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select
<b>Update driver software</b> using down arrow key and press <b>
Enter</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot your computer in safe mode and check if the mouse is working. Here is the link which says
 how to do it.</span></p>

            My mouse and touchpad just stopped working in the middle of using my computer. I was going through method 2 from above and there was no HID compliant mouse located under mice and other pointing devices. The only thing under the tab was a Lenovo pointing
 device. I wonder if I somehow uninstalled my mouse and touchpad?&nbsp;I'm not sure what I did if I did anything? Please help.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 on a Surface Pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericralph  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 on a Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>I am writing this post to express my extreme disappointment with Microsoft in regard to their execution of Windows 8/8.1 to Windows 10, particularly with respect to Surface users. By buying a Surface Pro 3, I was in essence buying into the ecosystem and
 touch-friendly UI of WIndows 8/8.1, something that Microsoft leaned heavily upon in their advertising and branding. I expected a tablet that was relatively effortless, smooth, and fast to use and that is more or less what I received. Windows 8's charms and
 touch accessible menus were effortless (for me) and highly useful. A single swipe right and I could access all the settings I needed while also being able to search for all applicable settings and open any app or program I needed. All of the settings were
 fluidly accessible and usable, giving me a large amount of control with just one or two gestures and/or touches. This functionality is central to any worthwhile tablet experience, and it provided the best of touch UI while maintaining the power and capability
 of full desktop Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This brings me to Windows 10. All of that previous design appears to have been inexplicably thrown out entirely while simultaneously failing in several aspects to provide a functional alternative to the charms bar and swipe-up settings menus in apps. This
 has very literally ruined functionality of several apps I use frequently, particularly Plex and Nook. On top of this, the previous settings provided by a simple swipe in from the right in Windows 8.1 have been gutted to the point that they are veritably useless
 and require long presses and fishing about a clumsy menu to change necessary settings, particularly granular brightness control (seriously, why??????), access to WiFi networks, a location setting that literally does nothing when pressed, and several other
 absurd and unnecessary changes. As well as these settings changes, the power menu has been moved to the opposite side of the screen and significantly shrunken for no apparent reason, making the process of shutting down or sleeping my Surface a ridiculous hassle
 when compared with Windows 8.1. The fact that the only way to reach that menu now requires hitting a single button that can be in four different places due to the fact that my Surface is indeed a tablet only serves to exacerbate this annoyance even further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have at least a dozen similarly disruptive annoyances I could go into detail on but the settings fiasco serves as a good example of the senseless design changes Microsoft has made to Windows in Windows 10. To create something extremely useful and then
 utterly remove it without any way to turn on those same features should a user want them back is foolish in the extreme and in my opinion alienates some of the most dedicated Microsoft fans, those who bought into the Surface ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To put it simply, I have been recently preparing to sell my Surface Pro 3 to buy a Surface Pro 4 when it is released, but my experience with Windows 10 is leading me to strongly reconsider my dependency upon the Windows ecosystem. For the same money as a
 Surface with reasonable specs, I could buy a Macbook Pro with similar specs. For that kind of money, there is simply no excuse to invest in an ecosystem that appears to be adopting a habit of making illogical design changes that are decisively and obviously
 disruptive to the user while providing no apparent benefits whatsoever.</p>

            This is so true and well written. Surface Pro 3 and Windows 8.1 was a truly amazing combination. After upgrading to Windows 10 and having to battle unnecessary menus and infinitely small icons that are allmost impossible to hit, I am&nbsp;somewhat&nbsp;disapointed
 with Microsoft and unsure about the way ahead.

            <p>I can see where everybody is coming from on Windows 10 and having a regular desktop and the small icons that go along with it because of the screen resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you guys know that you can scale up the image size so that everything is actually easier to get to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the center of the screen, right click and go to "Screen Resolution" and on the right side panel, there is a slider to scale up/down the image size.&nbsp; Here is mine set at 200%.&nbsp; Makes the whole thing easy to use.</p>

            <p>I used to have mine set to 150 % in Win 8.1. In Win 10 I see no difference: </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/size-of-elements-and-text/6c66f468-48a4-487a-829b-fde19749e51d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/size-of-elements-and-text/6c66f468-48a4-487a-829b-fde19749e51d</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But this must has to do with something that went wrong when updating my Surface.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So lets focus on whats new in Win 10&nbsp;like&nbsp;Action Center vs Charms. Charms worked very well on a tablet using my thumb, while the Action Center so far seems as an odd replacement, not at all thumb friendly and&nbsp;surely not giving direct acess to as much as&nbsp;Charms
 did and not contextual.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, that is all great but everybody on earth didn't like Windows 8 and thus, Microsoft created Windows 10 because everybody wanted Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They can't please everybody.&nbsp; It is one interface or the other.&nbsp; The plug will be pulled on Windows 8 in just a couple of years which will leave Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been testing Windows 10 on my Surface Pro 3 since build 10130 and never had a lick of problems out of it.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 was good also and I never had a problem with it but I can adjust to any kind of interface put on a computer.&nbsp; I also have Linux
 systems and also a Mac, iPad, and an Android tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With some changes, you will lose features because the Charms Bar menu and the slide out task bar where Metro UI features which has been removed from the desktop.&nbsp; You will notice that Metro UI apps have a frame around them.&nbsp; That is called a 'runtime window'
 so that the app can run on a different desktop other than the START screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can bring back something that looks like a START screen by grabbing the sides and top of the menu frame and expand it to full screen if you wish.&nbsp; It will stay that way until you manually change it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, bottom line, everybody hated Windows 8 (I was not one of them) and that is how Windows 10 came about.&nbsp; So, unless Microsoft takes stock on the feedback and see which one is better, chances are, Windows 10 is going to win over and stay for good.</p>

            <p>Let me make an additional note on this: as for the screen resolution not changing - that would be from an update to the Intel HD graphics which mine did the same thing.&nbsp; It reverted back later on its own, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft did at one time come up with an idea of a Metro UI version of Windows 8 only (no desktop).&nbsp; That would have been appropriate for tablets.&nbsp; However, you would have to change all the software on the market to have a Metro UI version which is not
 practical.&nbsp; Microsoft did finally make the mobile office apps which are in the Windows 10 Store now (in the Store, search for "office mobile") but did not make a full version of Office with Metro UI.&nbsp; That would have been the first but the Metro UI interface
 'was' perfect for touchscreens and tablets in general.&nbsp; Small screens, large tiles, you can't beat it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if people would petition to Microsoft to create at least a Metro UI option in Windows 10 for tablets and small devices.&nbsp; Desktop apps would still run small in size but I think people can work around that.&nbsp; No re-write of software or anything of that
 nature, just have an option in the Settings menu to bring back the Metro UI interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is probably one thing that people didn't think of and Microsoft is about to do the reverse for RT tablets by giving them a 'theme' of Windows 10 (even though it will still be Windows 8.1 RT).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start a petition and see what happens.</p>

            <p>My hope was that Continuum would allow the coexistence of Modern UI and Desktop, that Windows 10 would be able to change seamlessly between those two. That did not happen. So Continuum seems like a disapointment so far.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Windows 10 and the desktop I see no problems. I did not see any problems with Win 8.1 and the desktop either. Both works very similiar to Windows 7 (and XP...). As for new stuff like virtual desktops they come in handy, and I am allready using
 those, but to take virtual desktop as an example, this meant much more a few years ago before todays 30 inch WQHD and WQXGA montitors and soon to be 4K monitors. Most people I know allways dock their laptop in front of some monster display these they when
 doing heavy work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Personaly I found Windows 7 to be the most boring release ever. Reliable, yes, but utterly boring. Win 8.1 on the other side, was utter pleasure and joy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mobile apps are interesting, but somewhat lacking for my use. I prefer using Office, including Outlook (not the different Outlook apps. They are - to be polite - somewhat more lacking...) on my Surface and never have had any real problems with that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if admitting that Mac does have a slight edge in user friendlyness due to Apples total control of both hardware and software, I am not in the market for any of those. You can hardly do any real gaming on them, allmost all office enviroments - at least
 here in Europe - are built around Windows and Office and Windows gives me the ocasional joy of tearing a computer apart and putting it together.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Windows 10 may edge me towards considering something like Lenovo X1 Carbon next time (in combo with a cheap tablet...), even if the compact and clean design of my Surface 3 Pro have been a joy.

            <p>Local businesses in my area to include the local bank actually refuses to upgrade beyond Windows 7 and "may" upgrade to Windows 10 when the plug is pulled on Windows 7 support.&nbsp; That will be a while from now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 was boring!&nbsp; Windows XP was similar but the style of the interface got your brain going to "what next?".&nbsp; Windows 8 with the dual desktop types was unique and actually likeable (at least by me).&nbsp; I never had a problem with it and the slide out
 Charms Bar did give you access to the settings of either the current app you where using or to the system itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, with Windows 10, all you have is "Settings" and then guess where the function is buried to what you want to change.&nbsp; The 'supposed' menu for the Metro UI apps didn't appear (hamburger icon on the upper left corner) in most apps which means that there
 where no setting to change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They made the music and video apps to be "playback" apps and now rely on the Store for both software and media.&nbsp; One stop shop, I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest killer of Windows 8 was a lack of education and documentation.&nbsp; They eventually put something on a web site but ended up not being written by Microsoft (somebody else did it for them).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the old days of computing, the programmers themselves where responsible for creating the documentation of the software.&nbsp; You also got a book about an inch thick as well.&nbsp; Now, with Windows 10, they at least put in a "Getting Started" app with tutorials
 and videos (providing the app actually works).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem with Windows 8 and Windows 10: both systems are failing to install in 100% of the target devices.&nbsp; That has never happened before in the history of Microsoft with the exception of Vista because of the hardware requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they are not careful, that "flower pot" operating system from Apple just might end up picking up in popularity.&nbsp; It may be expensive, but it does work.&nbsp; Heck, even Linux might even pick up speed.</p>

            <p>I am not to guess about the future, but my main employer is on Win 7, upgraded from XP when they had to, and with 10,000 employes, 4,000 computers and compromising the health sector, education, public services and so on in a city of close to 200,000 inhabitants,
 will allways have enormous costs of&nbsp;upgrading, not least due to a huge amount of home made software and the need to run a lot of different secure aplications.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personaly I have Office 365 Small Business Premium for use in some of my other, independent&nbsp;projects&nbsp;. It works well. It's a long time since Office had any competitors, like Novel, Lotus&nbsp;or Corel. As for licenses and stuff like that Microsoft has allways
 handled that well (just pick up the phone and sort it out...)&nbsp;but - since Microsoft is moving into services - I must say that I, as a paying costumer, is not so impressed with their level of support outside North-America. I spent a lot of money on Google Adwords
 last year, and I must say that Googles attitude towards their local customers as a seller of services (giving support) were impressive. Google does offer an office enviroment, albeit not for the pro-market. Yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for written documentation and good help features, that went out the window a long time ago. For the time beeing you will allways find help and solutions online due to the massive usage, and there are manuals for sale. And courses. Some Excel-courses are
 pretty expensive for a day or two though. </p>

            <p>Yea, Office 365 has been a plus for Microsoft.&nbsp; I think that Windows is going to gradually move into a subscription service in the future as well.&nbsp; Don't know how well an operating system would work well in that fashion but may be a cost saver in the long
 haul, especially for companies and local/regional governments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no real competition when it comes to office suites.&nbsp; I have been experimenting with both paid and free suites for the last two years and sum them up as functional 'junk'.&nbsp; LibreOffice/OpenOffice sticks with JAVA and is slow and sluggish.&nbsp; Corel
 was so caught up with the registration components that they forgot that the office suite had to function beyond the registration screen.&nbsp; So much for that one.&nbsp; WordPerfect usually works backwards compared to everything else anyhow and not much use either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are others but are in heavy development or just too light to be worth anything.&nbsp; Some of them can't handle a text document beyond 20 pages before they slow down and sometimes even crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Apple side, you can forget about Pages, Numbers, and Keynote unless you are 5 to 10 years old.&nbsp; Good for doing something but haven't figured out what yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Local produced software are geared for the system they where developed on and future operating systems are a question mark when it comes to functioning them.&nbsp; Here in the states, medical billing software takes a hit on that one when the developers do not
 keep up with the times.&nbsp; Same with some insurance companies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say "to heck with it" and bring back DOS and/or CP/M and run WordStar and Dbase.&nbsp; Those two systems along with a good spreadsheet and everything worked.&nbsp; There used to be nothing like WordStar and a Diablo II Daisy Wheel printer to get work done!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to you and would just say, run a petition like they are doing with the RT to get features added in Windows 10.</p>

            Hi Bhavani, it seems your monitor is set outside of its allowed refresh rate
<br />
<br />This can be fixed from Safe Mode, where you will be able to set your Display Settings back to a usable state
<br />
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as the manufacturers logo disappears and Windows attempts to load, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, right click your Desktop and choose Display Settings
<br />
<br />Set the Resolution to the one marked (recommended)
<br />
<br />On the same settings Page, click 'Display Adapter Properties'
<br />In the resulting dialog, click on the 'Monitor' Tab
<br />Set the refresh rate to 60 Hertz
<br />
<br />Restart your System       
        </p>

</p><p>I have the same issue with my second monitor (the main screen is an HP all-in-one) after the most recent windows 10 update. I have tried this fix, but am unable to change either the resolution or the refresh rate when in safe mode. In fact, the display settings
 doesn't even seem to recognise the second monitor in this mode.</p>

<p>My Dell computer and monitor (UP2716D) were fine until the Windows update of 1/7/18. When rebooting after the update, the screen showed the error message “The current input timing is not supported by the monitor display. Please change the setting to 2560x1440
 60Hz.”</p>
<p>The challenge is obviously that if you can’t boot the computer, you can’t change the resolution. Many threads online about this error suggest booting into Safe Mode or various other things. I tried many avenues, including hard restarts, but couldn’t get
 any to work, since the monitor didn’t like whatever was coming through on the HDMI cable.</p>
<p>I worked with Dell tech support (great by the way), and they decided that I needed a new monitor. Once it arrived (2 days later), I plugged it in and it worked fine. However, the resolution was set at 1920x1080. Thinking I wanted the highest possible, I
 set the resolution to 2560x1440 (especially since Windows was saying that it was the recommended saying. Once I accepted this setting, the error message reappeared!&nbsp; Now I had two monitors that didn’t work.</p>
<p>I borrowed a smaller monitor from my wife’s computer and set it up easily with the same HDMI port and cable. After much switching between monitors and rebooting, nothing changed. I finally got the idea to try to have both the smaller monitor and the 2716
 monitor as dual displays. I found a DP cable and things worked fine. My plan was to be able to change the setting to 1920 while it was screen 2, which I was able to do. Things looked good, but of course it annoyed me that I wasn’t getting the maximum resolution
 I paid for (even though my eyes probably couldn’t tell the difference). So then I tried changing the resolution on the 2716 to 2560. Things worked fine, even after rebooting. I then rebooted after removing the smaller monitor. The 2716 with the DP worked perfectly
 and has shown no downsides.</p>
<p>My advice to anyone with this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have the ports on your computer, get a DP cable and try it at the correct resolution, or</li><li>Try booting with a different monitor and then add the 2716. Then you can change the resolution. I was ready to accept the 1900 setting rather than nothing.</li></ol>

                    I have a Device that plugs into the USB. I am running 64 Bit Vista. this Device is so I can upload my Insulin Pump Data to the internet so I can see my info pertaining to my Diabitis. Does anyone know of a way to get this to work. The Device is made by
 Medtronic and they have been able to get it to work with the 32 bit but not the 64. is there a way to run a Temp. 32 bit window or something to get this to work?!?!?! Anything would be good as I&nbsp;only want to convert down to 32 bit as a last resort.&nbsp;

If you are using Hardware(Device that plugs into the USB),&nbsp;you need the 64bit Drivers to make it work with your 64bit Operating System.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, its Manufacturer is the one that writes the Drivers for it, not Microsoft.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;Medtronic do not have the 64bit Drivers for it, nothing can be done.<br />

            If you use an English Language disc, it will install English, in fact, you will be doing a custom install. Your product key will work, but the installation will no longer be French.<br />

<h2>            Surface book 2 15&#39; image persistence</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have a new (5 months) surface book 2 and i've noticed that when the screen stays for a while, about 10-15 minutes with static image or app open on it, i can see the same image or app on other windows or on the task manager screen.</p>
<p>It's not burn in because the image fades eventually, but it's really strange phenomenon on a 3500$ machine...</p>
<p>Does anyone else has the same problem, or does Microsoft knows about it?</p>
<p />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Boot Problem &#8211; Server Initialization Failed</h2>
                    <p>
I have a Windows 8.1 desktop which is failing to boot and displaying the following error: Server initialization failed with an error: 0xc00700c1.
</p><p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Automatic trouble shooting and check disk were unable to resolve the problem. Prior to this error the system was functioning normally and no new software had been installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not been able to find much information about what this error code means or how to address it. Could anyone point me in the direction of a solution?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let’s try the following methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program
 in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality
 when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network,
 network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform a <strong>
SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have attempted to troubleshoot the problem as suggested in method 1. However, I am unable to successfully access the Windows Recovery Environment. I have attempted to restart the computer three times in a row and I have attempted to press shift-f8 during
 the startup process to enter the Recovery Environment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both methods have no effect, - the Recovery Environment does not load and I am instead shown the same error: “Server initialization failed with an error: 0xc00700c1” followed by an automatic restart. If left alone the system will continually loop like this,
 showing the error and restarting indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can access the Recovery Environment with a USB boot disk, however, the Startup Settings option needed to force a safemode boot does not appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: &nbsp;Automatic repair</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you are unable to boot the computer, then I would suggest you to perform an Automatic repair. The Automatic repair can detect and fix the issues that prevent the computer from starting normally. You will need
 the Windows 8 disc to perform an Automatic repair. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;After you have a Windows 8 installation disc inserted, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be F12.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Restart the computer, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to CD\DVD ROM</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click Repair your computer in the lower left corner</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on Troubleshooting, advanced option and then click Automatic repair.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2: System restore</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If automatic repair didn’t help, then you can perform a system restore and check:</span></span></p>

            You have to let it sync.
<br />Microsoft accounts are stored in the internet so sometimes when you go through a password change and you use more then one machine it takes time to sync.
<br />It might help if you reboot your PC a few times as well.

<h2>            Missing file mfc30.dll</h2>
                    I have an old program, Edmark Thinkin' things 1 (for windows 95) that I would like to install on my computer with XP but it says I am missing the file mfc30.dll Do you know where I can obtain a safe copy of the file

            I got one off a Windows 95 CD and uploaded the compressed version (mfc30.dl_) and expanded version (mfc30.dll) to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
I don't know where it needs to go or what you need to do with it - maybe put it in the c:\windows\system32 folder or XP may give you a clue in the complaining message.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file(s) you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39%21311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.
<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called mfc30 when the file name really needs to be called mfc30.dll (if the downloaded file has no extension you will have
 to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You really must let us know if this helps!<br />
