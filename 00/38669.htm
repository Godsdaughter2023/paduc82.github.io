<p>
</p><p>what you are going to do if the dword is not shown is create the dword and give it a value of 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>go to start, run, type in regedit and click ok</p>
<p>
</p><p>in regedit go here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System</p>
<p>
</p><p>in right hand pane is this line present??</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>DontDisplayLockedUserId</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>if not then you will right click on system in the left pane, choose new, choose dword value</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the box you will type&nbsp; DontDisplayLockedUserId&nbsp;&nbsp; just like that no spaces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then click outside the box to set and then double click the line to modify and give a value of 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>now in secpol.msc you will see the line interactive logon: </p>
after closing regedit, you may have to restart to set the change.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Check with the System Maker's Support, their on-line documentation and drivers,<br />
troubleshooting, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Double check<br />
for Windows 10 compatibility.</p>
=====================================================<br />
<br />
Check this :<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X&nbsp; OR&nbsp; place the mouse in the lower left corner and Right Click - Command Prompt (ADMIN)<br />
<br />
Enter the below (or COPY and PASTE ) :<br />
<br />
<span>reg.exe add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\Controller0" /f /v EnumDevice1 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001
</span>

<br />
See if that troubleshooter helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Control Panel - Device Manager - DVD-CD drivers -&nbsp;Right Click the drive -<br />
Driver Tab - Click Update Drivers -&nbsp;then Uninstall the drive - then&nbsp;restart the computer<br />

Fix: DVD Drive Not Detected In Windows 8/10<br />
<a href="http://www.intowindows.com/fix-dvd-drive-not-detected-in-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.intowindows.com/fix-dvd-drive-not-detected-in-windows-8/
</span></a><br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
If needed let's test the CD/DVD drive to see if it works at all &nbsp;:<br />
<br />
Try this to see if the drive is viable at all (you will need to make these on <br />
another computer&nbsp;since your's will not start - XP, Vista,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;8/8.1 , or 10<br />
or even running&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;does not matter).&nbsp;You could also try booting with <br />
another Windows disk&nbsp;- any OS though do not use&nbsp;it to try to ANY&nbsp;repairs <br />
unless it is absolutely the same&nbsp;version of Windows on your system - just <br />
boot to see if the drive&nbsp;works. You can even&nbsp;make a Windows 10 DVD boot<br />
disc&nbsp;by running the Windows Media Creation tool&nbsp;(on any computer) -<br />
<br />
Windows Media Creation Tool (make 32 or 64 both disk same as the OS<br />
version you are running.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><br />
<br />
Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 so watch the screen as you boot - set <br />
the boot&nbsp;order to CD/DVD first. Remember to set it back when done.<br />
<br />
Or ry booting to a Linux boot disk.<br />
<br />
If the drive will not boot to these then it has failed or there are other hardware
<br />
issues&nbsp;affecting it. However even it does boot that does not mean there are <br />
not some possible&nbsp;hardware issues affect the drive's other functions.<br />

    <title>How to publish to my computer with windows movie maker&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosemarykaye  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to publish to my computer with windows movie maker&#63;</h2>
                    I have made a movie and I am completely finished. &nbsp;I have already saved but now I want to publish the movie to my computer, so I can upload the movie online or put it on a memory stick. &nbsp;However, the only way I can publish with movie maker is if I save
 the film as a file online. &nbsp;I don't want to do this. &nbsp;So how can I publish a movie to my COMPUTER? &nbsp;Sorry, If I sound really simple but everyone I have asked has assumed I haven't look at the windows website but I have. &nbsp;It tells you there is an option to
 publish to your computer but there isn't. &nbsp;Please, any help would be great.

<h3> delouise11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Game Pass payed twice&#40;&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I bought Game Pass a few Days ago, because it was a special offer (1 month for only 10 kr (I live in sweden)). When I checked my mail I noticed i got 2 mails about Game Pass, one that said i had bought it for 10 kr and one that said i bought it for 135 kr.
 I also checked with my bank, and my creditcard had been debited 2 times. The thing is, it debited my card for the same month, so now I have payed much more for this month than I should have...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            It is a SCAM!!! Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that nor do they hire sub-contractors or people or even get volunteers to do that. There are probably thousands of such companies out there doing this every day - we get two or
 three messages like this (or more) every day asking about it. You are the lucky ones who recognized the scam enough not to be sucked into it and end up with identify theft, infections, hacking of your computer, convincing you to buy software or services you
 either don't need or that don't really exist at all, and all sorts of nefarious tricks. You'd be surprised by how many contact us AFTER they realized they'd been suckered asking what to do. Do not waste time talking to these people, do not give them any personal
 information whatsoever, do not be tricked by what they may get you to see on the computer - in fact, don't do anything they suggest on your computer or even visit websites they recommend, and for heaven's sake don't give them access to your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Microsoft knows this goes on but with these companies springing up like dandelions, or closing and changing names when discovered, and mostly operating in foreign countries, it would take an army of lawyers to pursue every one of them. They do the best they
 can, but there simply are too many and more get added every day. People have to be careful of these things. They not only occur by phone, but also by e-mail, instant messaging, regular mail and every way imaginable. Just remember that Microsoft does not do
 this and hang up or delete emails or messages or mail from anyone claiming they are doing this because they know information about your computer or want information from you to confirm your account so it won't be closed and ask you for your username and password
 and all sorts of other personal information. Microsoft DOES NOT DO THIS!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope you didn't get caught by these scammers and saved yourself a big headache. Continue to use the same caution and you should do fine.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you got caught by these scammers (did any of the things they suggested and especially if you gave them access), I would also proceed as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It was not a good idea to give them access to your computer or any personal information, but if they had access to your computer or you visited a website they suggested or downloaded anything intentionally or unintentionally from a website or email, they could
 have infected you or made changes (or installed a way to gain access at their convenience in a background download occurring while they were showing you things and installing who knows what). Plus if they installed fee-based products (as is often the case
 since they negotiate deals with such vendors to split the profits on such “sales” – in effect, a kickback), they may have removed other products and when the service is cancelled what they installed may also be cancelled. In some cases, this may be good. In
 others, it may leave you without security protection depending on what they did. So you need to make sure that you eventually have proper firewall and real-time AV protection installed (and remove any they installed unless you did a clean install or System
 Restore as will be suggested shortly – then just confirm things are back to normal and the security is enabled or re-installed).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
See this article: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10. The article also includes links for things to do if you think you've been a victim of this type of scam and information
 about what Microsoft does and doesn't do so you won't be tricked again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Still, it doesn't hurt to be cautious. I believe the safest thing to do at this point is to backup your data and do a clean install or a restore to factory conditions (however you are setup to start from scratch after doing a full format of the hard drive).
 If you aren’t prepared for such a radical solution (even if it is the safest), please at least proceed as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do a System Restore to before the call and giving them access. That will hopefully remove anything they may have installed and undo any changes they might have made. Also change your password and security questions with your email provider, network, ISP and
 perhaps others listed below (which a System Restore won’t do – they’ll still be the same until you revise them). There’s no telling what they could have done while they had access to your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then to make sure you weren't infected, please do the following;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:http://www.malwarebytes.org/ and SuperAntiSpyware:http://superantispyware.com/ and then run a full ESET online
 scan: http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If so:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start here - https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (http://www.answerdesk.com/) in the US at this time.
 After an initial free consultation, a fee will be charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If not:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can start here: https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/ (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In other regions not served by the link above, go here: http://Support.microsoft.com/securityand go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally good, the
 level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
P.S. In the meantime, I'd contact the bank or credit card company and dispute the charge to try and get my money back (if you actually paid anything - otherwise skip ahead to the P.P.S). Canceling the card is not enough to remove prior transactions that were
 charged to it without disputing them – and there may be more than just this one company if they installed products that cost money that will separately charge you (or already have). That may be simpler than asking the company or companies for a refund - but
 if the banks can't help you at this point, then of course try to get the refund from the company or companies (and keep asking to talk to the person's manager until you get as high as you can) and tell them if they refuse you'll notify the authorities and
 the company that hosts their website and take legal action (even if we know you won't because it's too much of a hassle, they won't be certain).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How far you want to go in terms of changing all your other passwords, pins, logon information, account information (including all your financial data if on the computer) and such is a decision you need to make for yourself. They are not all related to resolving
 the computer issues and your best bet outside of anything computer-related is to contact those companies or the local authorities and see what they advise (or seek out an attorney for advice).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />

P.P.S. If you wish to report it and live in the United States, here are some links you can try:<br />

<br />
http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Internet_Fraud.shtml<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx This one is the "big gun" and while the best (like getting the BAU to take your case at the FBI), they really only focus on the major cases. I imagine enough complaints from enough people (or the right person or perhaps someone
 actually victimized or the company being misrepresented) about a particular company would make it a major case, but frankly don't know how they work or prioritize what they do. Still, since if they do get involved they can probably do the most to resolve the
 matter, I'd include them if I were harmed.<br />

<p>Hi Radu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have checked .NET Framework 4.6.2 and found that it should work for Windows 7. To isolate the issue, did you download Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 either

<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>? If not, we suggest downloading it again and check if it pushes through this time.</p>
<p>

            Fascinating how Microsoft's solution always seems to be "delete everything and hope for the best".<br />
<br />
<br />
Tried the same thing with DISM and everything was ok, rebooted and the problem happened again.

<p>
</p><p>Can confirm that the CCleaner registry scan fixed the "Open with..." freeze issue for me and that it was also a problem with Adobe for me too (it was Adobe Illustrator and CCleaner said there was some problem about the context menu and rasterization...weird).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Important* CCleaner didn't pick up the problem with Adobe Illustrator on the first scan. If you are like me and have this problem + an Adobe product, run the registry scan multiple times until it doesn't pick up anything anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Open with freeze is fixed but I still have the same problem as the OP with image thumbnails and folder icons becoming blank pieces of paper (although mine are white with a band of small pink vertical stripes on the bottom, kind of like a print alignment
 test page). Strangely, this problem doesn't affect every folder icon, and sometimes a folder icon with update itself to reflect the folder's contents, but when I press F5 it reverts back to a blank piece of paper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there Doubledown</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to here this, Have to ask if you using a external hard drive at all? have to ask due to there is a way to saved clips on external hard drive. It is extremely odd for it to delete games from reinstalling a game. Can't say I have heard of that one&nbsp;</p>

            Yes I am using a 4 tb external hard drive with an xbox one x. I had this problem before where the games that were on my Hdd were "uninstalled" but I did a hard reset and they came back. I'm more upset about all my clips they were all there until I uploaded
 one to live and then *poof* like magic all gone.

<p>Hello Doubledown,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're experiencing an issue concerning the uninstalling of Back Ops 4 after attempting to cancel the update on your Xbox One console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As provided by Smwutches, cancelling an update will uninstall the entirety of the game/app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the clips, some clips are game specific, so upon installing Call of Duty Black Ops 4 the clips should return.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try that our for us and let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<p>Hello DoubleDown,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question " Okay well what do you reccomend I do when an update gets stuck on 0% ", You can always power cycle your console. Hold the power button down for 10 seconds or until the console turns off. Then restart the console. This usually does
 the trick for me and works during installations as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this</p>

            try to power cycle your console. Please hold down the power button on the front of the console for approximately 15 seconds until the power light shuts off. Wait about 60 seconds, then power it back on. Be sure you see the green "XBOX ONE" animation loading
 screen when you power it back up.

            Thanks I just figured cancel update would be faster than hard resetting the console. I was wrong LOL. Note to self cancel update means uninstall game from xbox. It should say that instead or give you a warning prompt or something

<h3> davidc88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Post-Windows 10 issue &#40;&#63;&#41; stuck on red loading screen</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded Windows 10 onto my laptop&nbsp;last week, and there did not seem to be any problems. A couple days after, I selected "Restart", and as it was doing so a notice popped up saying that some updates would be installed. It went to a red background as
 the updates loaded, and then it announced that said updates were complete, but it remained on the red background with the rolling loading circle. I left my&nbsp;laptop alone for a few hours and came back to see that it was still stuck on that same screen. I then
 pressed the power button and shut off, then turned back on the laptop. It showed the HP logo briefly, then went back to the red loading screen. I've turned the laptop on and off, and even removed the battery, but it still does this. Control+Alt+Delete still
 works, though it simply takes me to the three options of selecting a wifi network, Ease of Access, and Shutdown options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is an HP Pavilion 17-f053us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'm currently deployed in the middle east, so I don't have the option of taking it to a store.</p>

            <p>My computer is an HP Pavilion, model 17-f053us. I think I have McAfee antivirus software at the moment, and no, I cannot access the lock screen (I'm assuming you mean the screen to log in) or the desktop. Whenever I stop and restart my computer, it shows
 the HP logo, and then goes straight to the red loading screen and stays there; it will not let me log in.</p>

<p><span>If the computer does not shutdown or restart I would suggest that you perform clean boot and check if any third party program installed on the computer
 is causing the error message.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind
 of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<h2>            SD card</h2>
                    Basically, I ran out of storage space and so I went to buy an SD card.<br />
I set up everything where my new files go. Yet every time I screen capture, my computer keeps saying "insufficient storage" so I rechecked to make sure all my new files go to my SD card. I have barely used any storage on it, so I am completely clueless and

            <pre>You need to have a minimum amount of space on the local drive because it still writes some files to the temp folder. 
Here are some ways you might be able to free up space on the local drive.
Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

    <title>Do I really have to pay for shipping to get a replacement Xbox One Day - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Do I really have to pay for shipping to get a replacement Xbox One Day One Controller&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been looking around for a while and cant seem to get an answer.</p>
<p>My Day One Xbox One Controller is having a problem with the LT activating randomly.</p>
<p>Through the flow of links lead me to a replacement of the controller for free (as the console and parts are covered till feb 2015)</p>
<p>but...</p>
<p>It doesnt seem MS/Xbox service will be sending me a box or shipping receipt for the item to send out,</p>
<p>instead I am left with shipping it out?!</p>

<p>How is this 'free'?</p>
<p>Can someone answer me how this works?!</p>
<p>They send me a broken controller for my $500 system, which then I have to time out of my day and pay to ship the item out, which then they will take 10 days to return?!</p>
<p>Are they forcing me to go without using my $500 system for over 10 days?! or forcing me to buy another controller?!</p>
<p>I did not budget this for my system, and shouldnt be force to do so. not for a Day One Launch Item.</p>
<p>Why cant they just send me another controller, in a shipping box for the item, with packing material, and a return paid slip/sticker for me to just put the broken one in and send that right back?</p>

<p>Again, can someone explain if I have to pay for the shipping and if I will be refunded (not in Ms Points or whatever they are now)</p>

<p>My xbox one stopped turning on 3 weeks after i got it. &nbsp;I returned to the xbox one and got a letter back with it saying no problem found. &nbsp;Tried to turn it on same issue. &nbsp;I returned the PSU, with me paying the expense of shipping, it was received by them
 on 2/25...I still do not have a replacement. &nbsp;Support is no help, "this is escalated to the Advocacy team" this is with a manager "we have no record of receiving it" you should have it in the next 4 days.. on and on and on and on. &nbsp; I have chatted with about
 10 reps and no PSU still.... VERY FRUSTRATED.</p>

<p>Contact your local Microsoft Physical location to see if one is nearby, and to see if they will support your trade in. This will be the fastest most reliable transaction other than taking a loss and buying a new controller.</p>

<p>I honestly can't tell if you're being serious or not. Those shades are possibly the worst gimmick I have ever seen in gaming for a long time. I love how they try to sell them off like they improve eyesight but screw with the color distortion, despite it
 being 'low' to them. Like it's been said before, if you're eyes are tired then go take a break and get some rest. Although, if you're dense enough to think these actually are worth the 80 smackers they demand for it, I assume that you already don't care about
 your well-being enough to get what your body needs in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even worse, you can find replica glasses and shades from movies for cheaper than these yellow shades.</p>

<h3> pietro_m  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to move the whole Windows from one internal disk to another&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Lenovo ThinkPad E585 laptop with Windows 10 Pro preinstalled on the internal NVMe SSD (256 GB).</p>
<p>I added a new SATA3 SSD (512 GB), and I need to move the whole Windows OS to this drive.</p>
<p>I have the original Windows license key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I do it?</p>
<p>- Should I make a physical copy of the whole OS to the new disk? (Already tried, but I cannot boot from it)</p>
<p>- Should I download a free new copy of Windows 10 Pro from Microsoft, and install it using my original license key?</p>
<p>- Any other option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi Pietro_M, to get the best possible performance form that new SSD, your best option is to clean install Windows 10 onto that and then install a full set of device drivers for your PC . . .
<br />
<br />
You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need your Product key and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />
Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will
 have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers <br />
<br />
Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues
<br />
<br />
Click this link: <br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />
Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

            Hi Pietro
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Option 1: If you don't want the chore of reinstalling applications, hardware drivers and backing up files, you can create a system image then restore it.
<br />
<br />How to: Create a system image in Windows 10
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />How to restore a Windows 10 system image to an existing or larger storage device 
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/how-to-restore-a-windows-10-system-image-to-an/e20992ca-5641-4f7c-bb09-3895d0732162">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.
<br />

<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi WaterShed, 
<br />
<br />That message is basically saying it can’t find that command. 
<br />
<br />Is there a space before “ipconfig” within powershell? 
<br />
<br />Have you tried to run it in cmd prompt? 
<br />
<br />Click start, type “cmd” - right click and run as admin
<br />
<br />Then type “ipconfig” and hit enter. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if this works!
<br />- C
