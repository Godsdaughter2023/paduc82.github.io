<h2>            Brand new PC build - Windows 10 will not load - ACPI Bios Error</h2>
                    <p>I just put a new build together and am getting a Stop code (at blue screen) "ACPI Bios Error".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a USB boot drive with a new 16G USB drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The motherboard is ASUS an&nbsp;H110M-C/CSM with 2X4G 2133 RAM.&nbsp; The processor is i3-6100.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the splash screen everything seems to be connected (processor, hard drive, ODD).</p>
<p>Based on instructions I have seen elsewhere I used the default BIOS settings and made the following changes:</p>
<p>I have disabled fast boot, disabled secure boot and enabled CSM.</p>
<p>I thought maybe the BIOS version was a problem so I upgraded it to the latest and get the exact same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            Hi Sidney.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI, UEFI is enabled, CSM disabled, Windows Boot Manager set first to boot, if necessary disable Secure and Fast Boot until after install:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Make sure to follow the setup steps to complete your install.  Drivers are important enough that those steps are printed in red.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<p>I think i have attempted everything you are recommending with the following except the ASUS BIOS setting does not have a "Set SATA Controller to AHCI.&nbsp; I think&nbsp; that is a default.&nbsp; I saw some videos of older ASUS BIOS settings that had this setting, mine
 is similar but does not have the setting.</p>

            May I ask why you gave me a bad rating before I had the chance to reply to help you further?
<br />
<br />Newer UEFI firmware doesn't have the AHCI setting because it is standard now as the SATA controller default.  
<br />
<br />If you tried everything in the list including re-enabling UEFI and turning off CSM to use the new features of the UEFI BIOS, what is the exact failure behavior now?  Normally when someone does the troubleshooting steps, they report results to give us clues.  Normally when someone says they tried everything, they haven't really even read through the dozen or more steps.  I say this as someone who has far more experience on the web troubleshooting install failure than anyone else.
<br />
<br />Another step to try on new builds is to remove every component except what's absolutely required to install Windows.
<br />
<br />But if you've completed every single step which resolve 90% of failures, then one thing you can try is to move the hard drive into another PC (alone) to install Windows 10 to it, then move it back to the target PC.  Windows 10 is remarkably adaptive to new hardware without needing adaptive restore.  If it will start it will swap out all drivers requiring several restarts.  
<br />
<br />This will also tell us if the problem is with the install or the build.  Then if necessary you can tear down the build and try over.

<p><span>Greg,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your assistance.&nbsp; I did not intend to give you a bad rating, I don't even see how that is done??&nbsp; I did not answer yes to the "Did this solve your
 problem?" because it didn't.&nbsp; I'll correct the bad rating but I am unsure how to do this. Let me know, but at-any-rate I did not intend this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your skepticism regarding these steps, you gave a very detailed list of instructions which I tried to follow, so here is a list of what I've done.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Regarding your page on Clean Windows 10, I downloaded the media creation tool and created a USB boot drive using the 64 bit criteria.&nbsp; I used a new 16G drive.&nbsp;
 None of the instructions regarding backing up and organizing files, saving emails or bookmarks applies as this is new installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. I removed the GPU and the ODD, so the only thing connected is the HDD.&nbsp; I checked ASUS and their was an update to the BIOS that I downloaded and installed
 it. Since I did this I did not think I needed to reset the CMOS.&nbsp; I disabled secure boot, fast boot and CSM in the UEFI/BIOS settings.&nbsp; I am not sure where the UEFI enabled setting is located, I think I have done this in the boot settings by choosing UEFI
 and not legacy settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. I inserted the USB and powered on the machine, hit F8 to get me to the boot selection and selected the USB file with the UEFI description.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. The machine then gives me a blue screen with the STOP CODE “ACPI BIOS ERROR” and tries to restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have toggled many of the boot settings and nothing changes, I get the same error.&nbsp; I tried a different USB drives and have the same error.&nbsp; It does
 not seem to matter what changes I get the same error.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let me know if I missed any steps.&nbsp; Thanks again for your assistance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br />

<br />
<br />Confirm the media is good by booting it in another PC to see if it loads.
<br />
<br />If not try creating  bootable DVD to compare.  
<br />
<br />Try any other bootable media you have on hand to see if it does the same thing.  
<br />
<br />See here fixes for ACPI error during Windows install including toggling off ACPI using F7 key:

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have another computer to load windows 10 on, however, I tried to load it from a DVD (ISO) and I get the exact same error.&nbsp; I am thinking maybe I need to backup and try windows 7 or 8 and then upgrade to 10 if I can get it loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regrading the link and the use of the F7 key.&nbsp; That does no good because I can't get to point where I am asked about storage drivers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, when I boot from USB or DVD I never get any screen other than BSOD with the ACPI BIOS error.</p>

            Hello . I'm Greg, an 8 year Microsoft Windows MVP, here to help you.

In Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the install, which is the reason most enthusiasts won't ever run an inferior Upgrade or Factory install.

1) Please work through this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs are done: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...

2) If any steps cannot be performed then try whichever method works to enter Safe Mode with Networking at http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984712/windows/... which may work better to perform the steps, or from the Advanced Startup Options listed at https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc... use the Command Prompt at boot to run the Repair Commands in the Checklist.

If you’ll report back as you go, I may have other steps that are indicated. I will help you complete them all.

3) If nothing else works then you can reinstall Windows while keeping your files, programs and
        </p>

<h2>            Trine 2, awesomenauts, golden axe, fatal inertia...</h2>
                    
<p>What do these all have in common??<br />
they are free to playstation plus members. full game, free, for the same price as xbox live gold per month you get those games ( trine+ aweomenauts is like $20 )
<br />
<br />
this is what i hate most about xbox, the xbox live bang for buck is nothing, where is our free trine 2, and awesomenaughts and some other stuff.<br />
<br />
I can deal with paying to play online, but give us the same deals as PSN+ <br />
I can partially deal with the lack of exclusives as long as it isn't out of hand like it is now.<br />
<br />
Live is $5 a month for playing online<br />
PSN+ is $5 a month for $30 worth of games and DLC for free....&nbsp; Online is free... ask yourself what the better deal is =\</p>

<p>It's not really free. You're paying to rent them. If you ever decide to not go with PSN+ anymore, the games no longer function on the system. You're forced to resubscribe to the service or purchase the game. On Xbox Live you BUY and KEEP the games you buy.
 You're not renting them.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Having perks like that would be nice for live, but I'd rather have more interesting offers(Trine 2 is the only one that you mentioned that's any good) and I'd like to be able to keep them. I know the five months I was subscribed to PSN+ were pretty lackluster.
 I subscribed for the Socom 4 Beta(and got several months free because of the outage) and out of all those months, all I got was Sonic the Hedgehog(which I already had a much better version of on my Xbox)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Playstation Network isn't far behind Xbox Live, but Live is still the better online service.</p>

<p>So you'd rather buy a game for $60 and not be able to experience it all unless you pay Microsoft $60 a year? Anything you BUY on psplus is yours to keep as well as all the themes and avatars. For me personally, plus has blown live away in terms of perks.
 And with the rumored "Free new release retail games and free call of duty elite" I cant wait to see what the future holds in term of Plus. I used to be the biggest xbox guy, but Playstation 3 is the better system by far. It's amazing to look back and see how
 far xbox as a brand has fallen. I traded mine for a vita and havent looked back. Hopefully next gen they'll do something to win me back.</p>
<p>Free games (can't even begin to count how many I've gotten free, alot on day one)</p>
<p>Awesome discounts (once again, alot of games are discounted upon release)</p>
<p>Free themes</p>
<p>Free Avatars</p>
<p>Betas (Starhawk beta was insane)</p>
<p>Auto download of patches and DLC</p>
<p>Cloud storage (way before live came out with it)</p>

<p>Trine sucks anyway haha. too much to do to collect some of those items high up in the air. which idiot wants to put effort on that! I really don't have that kind of energy anymore for any game like that. It looked and played nice, but the items you have
 to get are just stupid. NO way </p>

<p>[/quote]you got it wrong here.your like any other star struck person who just got a ps3 and is reverting to a fanboy by making up things. limited list of games does not add to abunch of free games.i can still communicate with my freind's via private chat.
 lastly,don't call us fanboy's. most of us actually have ps3,wii,gaming pcs ect . hell,the mere fact this crappy thread is still standing is a testament to that.</p>

<p>i'm star struck? i had PS3 since 2010. and only played it a few days. the only people defending the xbox left are the fanboys and kids that don't know about other system perks.</p>
<p>what did i make up? i downloaded awesome-naughts a $10 value, and i'l have it as long as i pay for PSN+ which is the same price as xbox gold. if i ever decide to take a break from PS3 i can still play the games i bought online.</p>
<p>private chat isn't party chat i guess i have more friends then you as we normally have 4-5 people on at once. if your not gold u cannot do this.</p>
<p>if your a silver member on xbox you cannot play online, in all respect you don't have to buy PSN+ you can play your BF3 and cod and madden and such for free. on xbox if your a gamer u basically do unless you only play alone.</p>

<p>Lets see. You don't KEEP any of the games you get from PSN+. The second your subscription runs out, the games die. You are RENTING them.</p>
<p>Free themes and avatars? Xbox Live gets those as well. Big whoop.</p>
<p>Betas? You get those on Live too. I am pretty sure I just played the Hybrid and Ghost Recon betas on Live.</p>
<p>Auto download of patches? I am pretty sure that's been around since the 360 launched....as soon as you turn on the Xbox or pop in a game and a patch is available, you're notified and required to start downloading it....nothing.</p>
<p>Auto download of DLC? Why would I want that? I don't want the system to automatically charge my cards for DLC I may not want. You're foolish for even throwing this out there.</p>
<p>Xbox Live has cloud storage too. Sure PSN had it first, but Sony didn't invent it. They did nothing special.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>What does Xbox Live have that PSN doesn't?</p>
<p>Party chat</p>
<p>Access to dozens of apps(I can't tell you how frustrating it is to move my Xbox to the living room to watch Hulu or HBO Go)</p>
<p>Better servers(If people think hacking and modding in games like Call of Duty and Borderlands are bad on the 360. Try playing it on PSN.)</p>
<p>On top of all the stuff that Xbox Live has offered before PSN+</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Seriously. The PS3 and Xbox 360 are on par with each other as far as systems go. Both have their pros and cons, but as far as better online service goes, Live is better.</p>

<p>[/quote]you made up the idea that abunch of games are free.yet you failed to mention this is a list of certain games that go free.you also failed to mention that party chat is not on every game on the ps3.a fanboy is a person who glorifies a system,refuse's
 to see the faults of one system but yet see's all the faults in other consoles.that right now sound alot like you</p>

                    My SSD and HD are going to be transferred to a new build with new parts. I saw that I might need a new product key. Building the PC tomorrow with a couple guys to help so what happens when I boot up the new comp with Windows 10 already installed. Will
 all my stuff boot up as it normally would? If I need to buy a new product key do I just pay the $119 and it gives me the 25-digit code? What will my new comp ask of me when its booted up with windows already installed but on a new motherboard?

<br />You dont need to buy another Windows License if your is valid.

            Hi  Markus_800,
<br />
<br />When you boot up, you will see Windows 10 loading some device drivers (Getting Devices Ready)
<br />
<br />The the new PC will boot to the Desktop
<br />
<br />You will then have to load some drivers manually - go to Device Manager and see which if any drivers Windows setup was not able to find
<br />
<br />Then you will have to remove the product key from that Windows installation:
<br />
<br />Open Command Prompt as Administraor
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />slmgr /upk
<br />
<br />Then close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Then you can purchase a new product key and enter that in Settings - Update and Security - Activation
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

            Hi LeonardQQ,
<br />
<br />Try by click on the forget option, usually there is 3 dots next to the username address
<br />
<br />I see that you delete the cache but you tried the advanced option in chrome?
<br />
<br />
<br />Advanced
<br />The "Advanced" section includes the basic data types, plus the following:
<br />
<br />Download history: The list of files you've downloaded using Chrome is cleared, but the actual files aren't removed from your computer.
<br />Passwords: Records of passwords you saved are deleted.
<br />Autofill form data: Your Autofill entries are deleted, including addresses and credit cards. Cards from your Google Pay account aren't deleted.
<br />Content settings: Settings and permissions you give to websites are deleted. For example, if a site can run JavaScript, use your camera, or know your location.
<br />Hosted app data: Data from hosted Chrome Web Store apps is erased, like the local storage used by Gmail Offline.
<br />Media licenses: Licenses for HTML5 or Flash protected content, like movies or music that you’ve played or downloaded, are deleted.

<h2>            new windows 10 refusing to allow new skyrim game download from steam.</h2>
                    <p>A test of the connection says it is an incompatable download.&nbsp; Since I have played this game on windows xp for ages what's the problem? The drop down window says it cant initialize the renderer at the current setting. I have tried every setting available
 with no luck. My machine is a brand new acer predator so I'm pretty sure it's got the juice. I have turned off my malware and virus programs again with no luck. I'm beginning to have a nagging feeling, based on some other problems, none of the sixty five games
 in my library will run, that windows 10 just may be a piece of ****. Anyone else out there having downloading issues?</p>

            <p>I suppose you get this error when trying to<strong> launch the game </strong>via Steam, not when downloading a recently bought new game. If that's right, the most likely causes are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Your video card / driver doesn't support some needed rendering features (only an example which should be obsolete on today's hardware: no shader 3.0 support, limited to shader 2.0). Those issues can be avoided by updating to the latest driver version.
 Sometimes it could be enough if you simply uninstall and reinstall your current driver, only to make sure that the game recognizes your (new) video card and doesn't apply settings from another (old) video card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Even if it seems so, you can't change all settings by the game launcher alone.&nbsp;You must allow permanent changes&nbsp;to your SkyrimPrefs.ini first (the one in&nbsp;your \My Documents\My Games\Skyrim folder, not the one in your game folder);&nbsp;to do so, make sure&nbsp;that
 the file isn't set to "read only", or any changes made in the launcher won't be stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Make sure that your in-game resolution fits your monitor's resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Make sure that your new computer also has a complete DirectX 9.0c distribution installed (should come with the game, can be downloaded from MSFT). This doesn't happen automatically when you switch to a new OS. It is needed, however, for a lot of games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: As you can see, none of these issues are related to Windows 10. Those are associated with hardware changes and game adaptation to them which posed the very same problems on Vista and 7.</p>
<p>

            When you are in zoom and you connect your camera do you see yourself?
<br />If not, sounds like your camera is not working through zoom.
<br />Go to start - settings - privacy and make sure you camera is on and that you allow zoom to use it.

<br />Cause it doesn't look like it's an issue with Windows or your Camera.

<h2>            Computer automatically looks in Program Files, can&#39;t open something from Program Files &#40;x86&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since today none of the shortcuts on my desktop work anymore, and the computer will give me an error saying "C: Program Files/*name application* cannot be located". But these programs are all "Program Files (x86)" programs, which is why they can't be found
 in Program Files. They've always been in Program Files (x86). I've also tried opening the application through start etc, but they will only open if I go to their folder in Program Files (x86) myself and click on it there (and creating a new shortcut from there
 doesn't work either, the computer seems stubbornly set on looking for it in Program Files).
</p>
<p>When I copy the files to the Program Files folder the shortcuts etc work again, but I'm afraid copying them to Program Files might cause trouble again later, for example what if the applications themselves keep saving their data to Program Files (x86)? Programs
 that I have this issue with are Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, Steam, Mendeley, ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>So two questions I guess: 1) did I accidently change something somewhere, causing the computer to constantly look for things in Program Files, and can it be changed back?&nbsp;<br />
2) What will be the consequence of copying the Mozilla/Steam/etc files into Program Files the way I did now?&nbsp;</p>

For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually
<br />
by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Insert the Headphone jack in the right port of your computer.<br />
<br />
Right click on Speaker icon present in the taskbar.<br />
<br />
Select Headphone and set it as Default Device.<br />

            Thanks for the reply S.&nbsp; When I insert the jack in the right port and right click the speaker icon in the taskbar, there is no "headphone" present to select. When I select "playback devices" I'm given the options of speakers and my t.v. but no headphones
 (that's where I mistakenly deleted headphones as an option).

    <title>Notification Icons disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaxx89  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notification Icons disappearing</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 8.1 x64 With all the latest updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tons of icons in my notification area, some that I choose to show on the taskbar and others accessible via the show hidden icons pop up.<br />
Here is the problem I am facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes some of these icons just disappear after a reboot or if Windows explorer crashes for some reason.<br />
These icons don't even show up in the "Customize" Or Control Panel&gt;Notification Area icons when this happens, if it does show up, I get an error saying "Notification" Icon not currently active" even though I can see the process active in Task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This causes trouble especially if I have an external HDD connected and the "Safely Remove Hardware" icon disappears, even from the "Control Panel&gt;Notification Area icons " list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried creating a new user profile to test and it seems to have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Active and full list of Notification Icons.</p>

<p>4.) There are no viruses, I have checked using KIS 2013(my current AV program) and also used Malwarebytes anti malware and Super antispyware.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had done a clean boot before but saw no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for third party software causing conflict, how do I check that?<br />
Another thing I noticed after the last windows update, even my power settings tend to reset itself to default.</p>

            <p>Sorry for replying after a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restore default icon behaviours didn't do much as I still can see some icons are missing even though the application is active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See this<br />
http://i.imgur.com/31yLhXK.jpg<br />
<br />
Also it seems now that isn't the only problem.</p>
<p>I might have to start another thread for my PCI-E USB 3.0 card for which the windows driver seems to be malfunctioning.<br />
<br />
And even my softwares that are there in startup, the settings seems to get reset.</p>
<p>Even my browser settings got reset.<br />
Going to try creating another User profile and check again.</p>
<p>If you could guide me how do I transfer all my user settings, program settings and also get the folder name of the new user id what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc and chkdsk results are clean.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for the response.</p>
<p>This is what happens with the PCI-E USB 3.0 card</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I reboot the system I am able to use it perfectly until I turn my external HDD off after doing the "Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media"</p>
<p>Once the device is ejected and turned off, if I want to use it again, Windows refuses to detect it properly.</p>
<p>Only after a system reboot does it start detecting the drive again.</p>
<p>The drive has its own power supply.</p>
<p>The PCI-E card is this one.&nbsp;<br />
I have tried using the Driver CD that came with the device and even the updated ones v4.50 available online. Currently using the ones installed by Win 8.1 automatically.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><br />
The drives are detected properly in the USB 2.0 ports when this happens.<br />

            <p>I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling without rebooting as well as after rebooting.</p>
<p>For some reason, if I don't reboot, it does not work. But even if I don't uninstall the drivers and just reboot, it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the new user account, I was getting errors as I was trying to create one with my Hotmail a/c</p>
<p>I created a local account for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need to know is how do I change the folder name of the new user account I created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create the user account&nbsp;name as JaxxD (existing one Jaxx), the folder created in C:\Users is JaxxD_2 and another folder by the name of JaxxD is automatically created.<br />
</p>
<p>I want the folder name to be JaxxD, but the user account assigns it as JaxxD_2</p>
<p>How do I change it to just JaxxD</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Let's update the all the device drivers for the computer from the computer manufacturer website. Check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the issue persists, let's uninstall Antivirus software&nbsp;and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>1) Please make sure to re-install Antivirus software after performing the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable or uninstall your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable or uninstall it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled or uninstalled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
If the issue persists, I would suggest you to create a local User Account and check if the issue persists.<br />
</p>
<p><span><strong>Create a user account</strong><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><br />

<h2>            Skype was hacked by a bot - Backup email expired.</h2>
                    <p>My skype account was hacked by a very prominent skype virus that was occurring at the time which spammed my contacts with ads and blocked my account for suspicious activity. I went to try recover it and was required to verify my details to prove it was me
 to begin account recovery. I ran into the following issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I was using a hotmail.co.uk account.</li><li>My hotmail.co.uk outlook account has expired due to inactivity.</li><li>Outlook has discontinued hotmail.co.uk accounts and does not allow new registrations.</li><li>Emails from my new hotmail.com account with the same username does not bounce hotmail.co.uk emails to my .com account.</li><li>When completing the skype account recovery form I do not have enough information to further the process as I never made purchases on my account, or anything that could add bulk to my application apart from previous passwords.</li></ul>
<p>I really wish to have this account back as I was sole administrator of a large popular group chat which has been hijacked by trolls recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any advice on what I could do, it would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            DHCP and DNS issues</h2>
                    <p>I'm sorry but this will be a long post. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit of history; We recently rolled out VoIP phones for a bit under 300 users. Since then, DHCP and DNS has been giving more issues. The increase in&nbsp;requests to our DHCP and DNS server caused alarms for performance to be triggered. I bumped up the resources
 to compensate and we no longer see performance warnings. However, the problem remains.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are primarily running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit.</p>
<p>We are not out of addresses.</p>
<p>There is nothing new in the event log.</p>
<p>I can run ipconfig commands to temporarily fix the issue. </p>
<p>This hasn't effected everyone that I can tell. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems as though leases expire and don't renew. It occurs after reboots as well as just suddenly happens in the middle of the day. Also, reboots don't necessarily cause a DHCP address to be properly assigned.
</p>
<p>

            <p>Still looking into this. Running more diagnostics revealed a few minor warnings but I made changes to leave no rock unturned. DHCP has been less of an issue since this post was made but I still struggle with DNS issues. Unfortunately it's a waiting game
 now, I think. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For more detail on the recent issues with DNS; just this morning I had at least 3 reports from separate people that the names were not resolving at about 6:30 this morning. However, by the time I come in at 8, it's all working fine. No events seen this far
 that point to a potential resolution. Still searching. </p>

            <p>Hi Rondell,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Is your Windows 10 activated?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There can be many reasons for booting to a black screen.&nbsp; These screens may appear with or without the mouse pointer.&nbsp; The main causes observed are:

<h2>            Com Surrogate is taking all memory and sytem crashes &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Recently my pc started getting slow and freeze. And when i checked Com Surrogate was taking most of the memory. roughly 80% of it. There was no programs running neither file was open or video. after reaching to 90% + black screen cam and system crashed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a hard Force shutdown, i restarted the system. didn't open any thing or any folder, Only the task manager and i kelp watching and same thing happened. it takes all the memory and goes black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there any solution for this that u can recommend. Because i think it's either me or only com surrogate can use the system.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. I will assist you with this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To better understand the issue please let us know the make and model of the Graphics card installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I recommend you to boot in safe mode and check if you encounter the same issue. Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer with only basic service and functionality. If an existing problem doesn’t reappear when you
 start windows in safe mode, you can eliminate the defaults settings and basic device drivers as possible cause.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Visit the below link on how to boot in safe mode:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not appear in safe mode then you may check in a clean boot state.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><em><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.&nbsp;
</span></em></strong></span><strong><em><span><br />

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><em><span>Disclaimer :</span></em></strong><strong><em><span>Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot "to reset computer as usual.
</span></em></strong><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></span><strong><em><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

            Have you tried connecting through a different USB port or check if the cable might be damaged or chafed?
<br />
<br />What type of camera is it?
<br />
<br />You can try other methods to import your photos:
<br />
<br />Click File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC. You should see the camera appear under Devices. Right click it then click Import pictures and videos.
<br />
<br />This will start the Camera import wizard. Go with the default option then click Next.
<br />
<br />If you want to customize where Photos and Videos are stored, click More options at the bottom left corner. Click Browse then choose where you want your photos and videos to be stored automatically.
<br />
<br />The Camera wizard displays your photos in groups according to date and time. You can click Enter name field then enter an appropriate name. You can also uncheck groups and just keep the ones you want to import.
<br />
<br />Once you have selected the groups you want to import, click Import
<br />
<br />Wait while your pictures and videos are imported. You have the option to erase them from the camera the same time.
<br />
<br />When the Import is complete, your photos will be presented to you in File Explorer.
<br />
<br />
<br />Import Photos and Videos manually using File Explorer
<br />
<br />You can import photos manually too. Launch File Explorer then open the Camera. Some cameras will have both fixed and removable storage. In most instances, yours will have removable, so open that.
<br />
<br />Open DCIM folder
<br />
<br />Browse and scroll through the photos. Select the photos you want, use the Control key + mouse click to select photos. Click Copy command under Home tab or press Control key + C
<br />
<br />Go to your Pictures folder then click Paste, you can also create a folder then paste them there.

<h2>            Edge keeps replacing Adobe as default PDF viewer</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Edge keeps reverting to the default PDF viewer and it's extremely frustrating. I believe it occurs whenever I unzip files using winzip. I know how to reset the default application but it's time consuming doing it once or twice every day and shouldn't
 be necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does it keep changing back to Microsoft Edge and how can I stop this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can i remove Microsoft Edge completely?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Adobe not appear in the default programs list? How can I add this to the list as if it did appear the steps to change the default viewer would be quicker.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Edge is the recommended PDF viewer for Windows 10 by default. It is based on a clean install environment without any third party applications installed. While you are free to install any third party software that you like, once you change the configuration
 for your default apps, it is not advised to reset the settings as it will go back to its default state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are three ways to set Adobe as your default PDF viewer. Right-click the file &gt;
<strong>Open with</strong> &gt; <strong>Adobe Reader</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcfda88d-28df-4b1b-8ea0-afdd64419098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcfda88d-28df-4b1b-8ea0-afdd64419098" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, is by going to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Apps </strong>&gt; <strong>
Default apps </strong>&gt; <strong>Choose defaults by file type</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4e84d99-8bb6-4d5f-80ef-a1ab97d20718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4e84d99-8bb6-4d5f-80ef-a1ab97d20718" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Apps </strong>&gt; <strong>Default apps</strong> &gt;
<strong>Set default by app</strong> &gt; <strong>Adobe Reader</strong> &gt; <strong>Choose defaults for this program</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbfce927-a074-4a1a-94cb-70486ba03651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbfce927-a074-4a1a-94cb-70486ba03651" /></a></p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
