            Yep, from the start screen type mstsc.exe and hit enter, from there is just like its x86 counterpart, also it seems that all of those settings get transferred to the Modern UI App, at least I'm able to use by USB Smart Card via RDP in both....

<h2>            USB headset 7.1 - Unknown USB Device Error Code 43 &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my new computer. While I updated my new OS (from Windows 7 to Windows 10), my USB headset 7.1 (Asus strix dsp) didnot work at present. My headset&nbsp;is fine when I was using Windows 7. While I check the problem, my computer display: Unknown
 USB Device with the&nbsp;Error Code 43.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, I go to the official website of motherboard and download the driver. However, the installiation of&nbsp;driver of headset is failed since the computer indicated it is disconnected. Windows updated is also OK, cannot find any problem. Even I updated eash
 USB drivers, the items that&nbsp;showed&nbsp;the&nbsp;Error Code 43 will disappear, but still appear that error&nbsp;after few seconds....<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the hardware, when I connect it with my computer by the USB, the light of headset control is on within 1 second and then off immediately, the computer showed Error Code 43.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I fix the probelm? Thank you!</p>
<p />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your headset
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your headset
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing. 
<br />
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

A puzzlement... You might visit My Account at Skype.com to verify that call forwarding is enabled to your own telephone. &nbsp;If it isn't, correct the problem. &nbsp;If call forwarding was indeed set to that auto shop business, I suggest that you change your password
 in case your account details were hacked. &nbsp;

<h2>            insanity</h2>
                    <p>I have never had such a hard time changing passwords in my life. I understand I.D. Theft and everything, but this is nothing more than pure insanity. I have worked now for four solid hours trying to change passwords and change some account information and
 am still battling. I am tired and need to go to bed, but I can't because I know I will be locked out of my 2nd Hotmail account if I do go to bed.</p>
<p>There is no sense in sending code after code after code after code to my phone and back up email address.</p>
<p>I don't want to use my cell phone as a recovery method, because I just changed phone numbers again. I want to use my yahoo address. Obviously my internet connection speed isn't fast enough to please Microsoft, so by the time I get my code, the code is invalid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is nothing short of insanity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here lies the 2nd problem: If you make the mistake of tying a 2nd computer to your windows live account, there is no way to change the settings. Because of the mess created by my not knowing you could not change things in Windows 8.1 I now have to return
 a computer I bought a week ago. When I first got the computer it said I could change the settings, well I would like to know how. This stinks!</p>
<p>Why can't we all just go back to the best operating system that Microsoft ever had which was XP. I never had the problems with XP that I have with 7 and 8.1.</p>
<p>Insanity!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am in computer H...ll!! I will most likely be locked out of both of my accounts tomorrow (today) because I can't get my code. Well I would be able to get my code if you did not make it so hard to get my code.</p>
<p>Insanity!</p>

</p><p>problem 1: you say that you can get the code on the phone but that you want it on the email but at the same time the email is slow and that it is giving you trouble - then why not use the phone? i'm puzzled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>problem 2: you talk of "settings", but what settings are you talking about? you are returning a computer for what, exactly? I use the same account on a fair number of computers and have no issues whatsoever. I can't even imagine what problems you're getting.</p>

            <p>You should not be forced to enter codes from both a phone number and an email address. To my benefit, I'm glad I found out now, because I am changing my phone number soon.</p>
<p>I had to change the passwords on both of my Hotmail accounts and ran into complications because my internet was running slowly last night. By the time I received my codes, Hotmail timed out forcing me to start over again.</p>
<p>Lord help you if you've change your phone number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've straightened everything out now, but it was a lot more difficult than it should have been.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The cause for the error <strong>This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1)</strong> is because the device has no drivers installed on the computer, or the drivers are configured incorrectly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to <strong>try updating the hardware drivers from the device manager
</strong>and check if the issue resolves.</p>
<p><strong><span>Refer:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">
How to install and Update Drivers</a></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you run the Hardware Update wizard and the wizard does not find your drivers, it means that the manufacturer or vendor for your device has not added the drivers for your device to Windows Update. In this case, you must refer to your product documentation
 or visit the web site of your device manufacturer or vendor to download or request the correct drivers for your device.</p>

 it and if you face further issue related to installing driver, feel free to write us back we’ll be glad to assist you.<br />

<li>Click on start orb and type 'cmd' </li><li>when cmd opens, type <strong>diskpart</strong> </li><li>after that type <strong>listdisk</strong> </li><li>select the disk that your pendrive is and type <strong>select disk (number of your pendrive)</strong>without the brackets

<h2>            nVidia GTX 650 ti only supports DirectX 10 , why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi I am new to here, yesterday I bought a Nvidia GTX 650 ti graphic card ( used ).<br />
But that card doesnt support directx&nbsp; 11. I know you wont believe it .... <br />
<br />
this is the image ...<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03ac0ca0-c33c-4665-ba2b-6e09e87edd67" height="629" width="838" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed driver 331 WHQL and also tried the latest 336. But none helped me.<br />
Please tell me whats wrong with my graphic card!!!!<br />
Please....<br />
Can I fix it?</p>
<p>I even tried in another PC with Windows 7 64bit on it , but none.</p>
<p>Is this a windows fault , not any single directx 11 app works for me. Even though I installed directx redistribute that comes with Battlefield 4.

            <p>I would guess the card is a fake. All Nvidia cards from the 400 series on support DX11.</p>
<p>( They change the information on the cards BIOS to show a different model name/number).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other specifications are also not correct for a GTX650ti -</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-650ti/specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-650ti/specifications</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The GTS 250 is the closest I can find. This also has 128 Cuda Cores (vs 768 on the GTX650ti).
</p>
<p>The number of Cuda Cores is the main indicator for determining which gpu the card has.</p>
<p>The GTS 250 is a low end card, not suitable for BF4, even if it did support DX11, but the rest
</p>
<p>of the specs on your card are even lower that those in the link below (except for the memory bus speed</p>
<p>@ 256bit). The other odd part is the 2GB VRAM. A GTX 250 should have no more than 1GB.</p>
<p>It may be an OEM version ( built by a computer mfg such as HP or DELL). They often make down clocked variations of various models.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note that even a true GTX650ti will not run BF4 with high settings @ 1920x1080.</p>

<h2>            Windows shutting down apps in sleep mode</h2>
                    Ever since the October 2018 update, whenever I close the lid and put the laptop to sleep, Windows closes all of my apps and appears to maybe even shutdown. What is the fix?

<h2>            LG Slim Portable DVD Writer &#38; Windows 10</h2>
                    I have the external LG Slim Portable DVD Writer that is compatible to Windows 8 and recently downloaded Windows 10 to my Samsung laptop. Now my LG DVD Writer won't play any dvd's, the computer recognizes them and so does the VLC app but won't play it.
 Do I have to buy another DVD Writer that is compatible with Windows 10?

<h3> jklucid  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Store Windows Version FFXV Comrades CrossPlay</h2>
                    <p>Purchased this recently and wanted to play with friends on XBOX One X.</p>
<p>It appears to me that multiplayer aspect is just not working for me on PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did extensive research to trouble this issue but no luck.&nbsp; Does cross play work with Xbox One X and PC (MS Store Version)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I choose Quickplay, it ends up not finding anyone online defaulting me to play with AI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried using filters such as friends, anyone, and the 4 digit codes.... creating the game from both XBOX and PC.</p>
<p>No matter what I do it doesn't see each other's game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Xbox side, it looks like multiplayer atleast works since others would join the game.</p>
<p>But from the PC, nothing... feels like single player...&nbsp; Maybe because of player base issue.&nbsp; But then why doesnt it see my Xbox friend?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked server and Both are on same server... Not sure what the issue is.</p>

<h2>            Recover files after system crash and windows reboot</h2>
                    Hi everybody.<br />
<br />
I want to know if it's possible to recover a lot of files that disappeared after the crash of my operative system windows xp.<br />
<br />
Last week I tried to install service pack SP3 on my native SP2, it all went wrong and I have to reboot windows xp without making the back up of my pc.<br />
<br />
After it, I found that the memory remained the same but I don't know where to find the data files like photos, mp3 and lot of others like .doc.<br />
<br />
Someone told me that these files should be in a directory named "Userdata" and probably it's in the administrator account. The pc is mine, I am the administrator but I used to enter with another account because I don't know why the pc doesn't ask me any kind
 of password.<br />
<br />
The question is: is it possible to recover the "apparently" deleted files? Thanks
                </div>

<p>When you say "reboot" do you mean that you did a clean install of Windows or a repair install? If you did a clean install, it will be hard to recover your data. If you did a repair install, then your files might be there but you will have to search for them.
 If you did a factory restore/clean install -&nbsp; If the data is crucial and cost is not an issue, send the hard drive to a professional data recovery company. I use Drive Savers for my clients, but there are others. General prices run from $500-$3,700 with an
 average of around $2,700. I understand that some insurance companies are now covering data recovery costs so check with your insurer.<br />

</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">IMPORTANT</span> - If you think the drive is physically healthy, it may be possible to retrieve the data by software methods.
 and either use it from that operating system or create a bootable cd/floppy and work with that. If you don't have the skill and/or equipment to do these procedures and the data is crucial, take the machine to a professional computer repair shop that has experience
 in doing data recovery. This will not be a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place. In-shop data recovery is usually not exactly cheap (for example, my charges are generally $150-350USD), but it normally costs less than sending the drive to a company like
<a href="http://www.drivesaversdatarecovery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Drive Savers</a> . You need to make the determination of the value of your data and decide what to do.<br />

<h2>            Lifecam VX 2000 black screen</h2>
                    <p>
Hi,</p>
<p>
I am going to be crazy. I have problems with my webcams VX-2000.</p>
<p>
I am trying to connect 2 webcams VX-2000 simultaneously to a PC for video surveillance.</p>
<p>
Sometimes, and I don't know why, the preview in Microsoft Lifecam software is blank (black).
</p>
<p>
The only way to resolve this problem is to disconnect and reconnect the Webcam that is malfunctioning and then the preview displays the real image.</p>
<p>
And after many time (I don't know how many: it seems to be a random problem) the problem is coming back and I am far away from the PC: I am connecting to it with Logmein, and with Logmein it is impossible to disconnect and reconnect the Webcam.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I have already tried all what I found on the net about this problem:</p>

Nothing works for me.</p>

I have many theories about this problem, tell me what seems possible to you or what do you think about my problem:</p>
<p>
1-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The combinaison Win7 64 Bits + 4Go RAM + 2 Lifecam VX 2000 simultaneously is malfunctioning</p>
<p>
2-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acer PCs have some running programs that are the reason of this problem</p>
<p>
3-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The USB Hub is not powered enough for 2 lifecams VX 2000 simultaneously</p>
<p>
4-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The USB Hub has not enough bandwith for 2 lifecams VX 2000 simultaneously</p>
<p>

<h2>            I&#38;&#35;39&#59;ll still care</h2>
                    
<p>Dear MIcrosoft,</p>

<p>You were good to me.&nbsp; We had our times.&nbsp; From my first play on Jet Set Radio Future, which really wasn't that bad, to the times when I willingly paid money to look at adverts that gave you money.&nbsp; It was nice you know?</p>
<p>We had quite a thing going.&nbsp; All of those great, great games I played on the 1st XBOX and the 360 to which I thank you very much.&nbsp; You even brought online gaming to me.&nbsp; I admit the Dreamcast was my first experience but I ran up a bill of about
 £400 due to Phantasy Star Online - and you didn't charge me as much.</p>
<p>I could list all the good you have provided.&nbsp; All the awesome games I played on your console.&nbsp; And once - I even watched Netflix which was quite handy I guess.&nbsp; As impressive though as lists are I don't think I have the time or memory to write
 it down - and that is something to be commended for!</p>
<p>Although, the XBOX ONE sounds quite bad.&nbsp; Sure Kinect is nice for jumping around but we have that already - it's called sports and I prefer sports.&nbsp; Where I live isn't quite a sub but my internet usage is restrictive and what the system requires
 would just be too much.&nbsp; It isn't like I live in the 3rd world (arguably), I live in a busy city in England.&nbsp; England!&nbsp; We invented TRAINS.&nbsp; But I'm sorry - I think I'll have to call an end to this relationship.&nbsp; I'm going to get back with the ex.&nbsp; Ole Sony
 just looks too good these days.</p>
<p>I hope one day we can see eye to eye again.&nbsp; I'm still going to keep our memories.&nbsp; I won't trade them in or lend them to a friend or any nonsense like that - it's what you would have wanted.&nbsp; But hey - we still have Hotmail …</p>
<p>Take care old love,</p>

<p>Gary</p>

            I have a possibly related problem. &nbsp;I mistakenly created 2 users on my Asus tablet running Windows RT. &nbsp;I deleted the users using the Control Panel, but the folders didn't disappear and were taking up significant disk space. &nbsp;I tried to delete them using
 File Explorer but couldn't, getting the message that a file in the folder was in use. &nbsp;I finally was able to delete the folders in the Users directory by painstakingly deleting each sub-folder until I found the file that was supposedly in use, in&nbsp;C:\Users\#####\AppData\Local\Microsoft\InputPersonalization\TextHarvester,
 which I was able to delete by opening the DOS-style command prompt window, stopping Windows Explorer with the Task Manager, and then deleting the file.
<div><br />
<div>But... &nbsp;is this really the best way for a modern OS to work?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm concerned that the OP found that the user directory reappeared - I'll check that out when I next reboot.</div>

    <title>Windows 7 wont complete install and get a blue screen physical dump - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennifer cartwright  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 wont complete install and get a blue screen physical dump</h2>
                    <p>On Monday my computer was playing music off a hard drive when it went into sleep and started shrieking.
</p>
<p>It wouldn't respond to any keyboard controls so I reset it by holding the power button.</p>
<p>Since then it refuses to load windows 7 but also puts white dots across my screen at regular intervals when the system goes through its settings.
</p>
<p>It gets into the starting windows window it loads the logo fully&nbsp;with three lots of 3 blue stripes run from top to bottom in the background but don't effect the logo or words at all but&nbsp;then says there is a windows error and cant load.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asks to do a system&nbsp;repair which fails and so I tried to reinstall the operating system instead. The screen has lots of wavy blue lines yet again in the background across the normal windows 7 desktop screen which is in the back of the system repair window.</p>
<p>I clear the drive of the partitions&nbsp;and start the install. It goes through the whole install till it gets to&nbsp;'Completing&nbsp;installation' then it blue screens says physical&nbsp;dump but flashes on and off&nbsp;and cant read it. The goes back through boot loads windows
 logo, then brings up pop up box saying 'installation was unable to finish due to an unexpected error, please click ok to reinstall windows' Then it goes around and does the same again and I go around and around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The graphics card cant be gone because on some screens (like the motherboard logo screen to enter Bios etc) there is no error at all, it only seems to be anything to do with black Bios windows&nbsp;or windows&nbsp;screens&nbsp;it puts these error lines on. Also the mother
 board doesn't say there is an error or a fault with it either. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked and reformatted the hard drive and it does work with no errors.
</p>
<p>Tested my 4gb ram which also passed and had no errors. There is nothing wrong with the power supply.</p>
<p>I am worried it is something with my graphics card and motherboard, or is it something in the BIOS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WD - 500gb hard drive</p>
<p>Corsair XMS3- 4gb ram (2x2gb 1600mhz)</p>
<p>Asus P7P55D-E Motherboard</p>
<p>Sapphire Pure 950w</p>
<p>I5 processor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just don't know what else to do other than replace the mother board?</p>
<p>I CAN NOT get to the desktop so no start menu stuff please as I cant do it. So I can also not download the minidumps or update my system. Unless someone knows how to update the Bios and drivers without being booted?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for your advice. Thanks everyone for their advice. I have got my system running kinda once the new parts turn up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done some experimenting. </p>
<p>I put my brothers old graphics card into my computer and it loaded the operating system no problem.</p>
<p>Does all the updates no bother. I tried refitting my card to update it but yet again before it finishes the download it crashes and we are back in the loop again.</p>
<p>So I think the card has officially had it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have ordered some new parts and doing and upgrade with definitely a new graphics card.</p>
<p>But it does now work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if anyone else has the same problem.</p>
<p>Find another computer and do a check for the new bios for your motherboard and do a flash upload if your motherboard has that function like mine did.
</p>
<p>Take out your hard drive and get the data off it by plugging it into a new computer.
</p>
<p>Reformat it and reinstall the operating system.</p>
<p>If you have problems with your screen like lines and dots like I did then your operating system will refuse to load and you will get 'nvlddmkm.sys' then your graphics card is totalled.
</p>
<p>If it does work do and update on your graphics. </p>
<p>That's all you can do.</p>

            <p>Hi Jenny Cartwright,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The STOP 0X0000001E generally indicates issues with drivers or faulty hardware.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have NVIDIA display adapter? In your scenario you also get the error 'nvlddmkm.sys' which&nbsp;belongs to&nbsp;nvidia driver.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using NVIDA display card then I&nbsp;would suggest you to remove it and then try installing Windows again. After the installation is complete attach the display adapter and install the&nbsp;latest drivers from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information helps.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 pro computer can&#39;t access shared folders on a vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ortnpalms  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 pro computer can&#39;t access shared folders on a vista computer</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded one of my home network computers to Windows 8 Pro.&nbsp; When I click on Network in File Explorer I can see the Vista computer from which I want to access shared files (as I did before upgrading to Windows 8 Pro).&nbsp; But when I double click on the
 Vista Computer's icon I get the error message: Open Folder (X) 
\\&lt;computer&gt; is not accesible.&nbsp; You might not have permission to use this network resource.&nbsp; Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions.&nbsp; The network is not present or is not started."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the Windows 8 and the Vista computer have the same Workgroup Name ("WORKGROUP").&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The frustrating thing is that the Vista Computer can open shared&nbsp;files on the Windows 8 computer but the Windows 8 computer can't open shared files on the Vista computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Sounds exactly like my problem.&nbsp; I just completed all the steps in the sharing with different systems and:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My two vista computers communicate with each other.</p>
<p>My two vista computers can access my windows 8 computer. (HP pavilion g6 purchased dec 2012)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, when I try to access either of the vistas from my win8 I get the "you do not have permission error"</p>

I want to add a little to the reply I just sent that said it is exactly like my problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is something in the operating systems that just make it impossible for a win8 to access files on a vista, I can live with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just tell me so I quit trying to figure it out.</p>

I'm not at that computer right now, so I can't pull up exactly all the settings I setup first, but I did setup all the file-sharing settings correctly first before running into the problem I had.&nbsp; I'll try to get more details for you when I'm at home tonight.&nbsp;
 I also already had folders on the Vista machine setup to be shared.&nbsp; Both computers were also already in the same workgroup.<br />
<br />
As to my specific issue that I had, it was giving me a security prompt to enter credentials, which I didn't have to do with my old XP computer (it just connected).&nbsp; Well, I was confused by that because I hadn't setup a domain and I didn't have any security
 credentials to access the Vista computer.&nbsp; What I eventually figured out was the I had to log in to the domain it was perceiving to be there (but it's actually a workgroup) and log in with the user name that I use on the Vista machine.&nbsp; So when it prompted
 me for the user name and password, I signed in with my Vista user name and password (which I left black since I have no password).<br />
<br />
To access the Windows 8 computer from the Windows Vista computer, I had to sign in with my Windows 8 user name and password, which gave me access to the entire User folder (not just shared folders), which I don't really want, but I can't figure out how to do
 it any other way.<br />
