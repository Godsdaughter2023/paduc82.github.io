<h2>            Getting a Skype.exe - Bad Image error message when trying to open Skype on a Windows 10 HP computer.</h2>
                    <p>This error box pops up whenever I try to open my Skype application.&nbsp; The full error message is:&nbsp; C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\MSVCP140.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error.&nbsp; Try installing the program again using the original installation
 media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support.&nbsp; Error status 0xc000012f.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have searched this website for advice on fixes; so far, deleting all Microsoft C++ visual files and reloading them, or just the one with 86 in the file name, along with reloading my Skype application, has not solved the problem.&nbsp; This problem did not occur
 prior to Dec. 10, 2017, when I downloaded a Microsoft software update.</p>

<p>Hello chanderkant,<br />
<br />
Look at the post from the Nero forum for a user having the same issue. <br />
<a href="http://forum.my.nero.com/index.php?showtopic=8443&amp;hl=c0000005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.my.nero.com/index.php?showtopic=8443&amp;hl=c0000005</a><br />
<br />
If that doesn't help, then use a clean boot to see if there is any program or software that is causing a conlfict with Nero.<br />
Do you have any other software burning program installed on your computer? If so, then uninstall it.<br />
<br />
You will Disable all startup items and third party services when booting. This method will help us determine if this issue is caused by a loading program or service.</p>
<p><br />
The steps below will place your computer into a “clean boot”, meaning using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that we can determine whether a background program is interfering.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start on your Desktop<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once the computer is back to your Desktop, check to see if you are still having the problem.</p>
<p>If the issue is resolved by placing the machine in “clean boot” then we have some sort of third party application and or service running that is possibly interfering. To determine which program(s) and or service(s) that is causing this, we would need to
 go back into “msconfig” and start to enable programs and services and reboot until we see which one causes the problem.&nbsp; This can be a long process but is needed to find the conflicting program.</p>
<p>If placing the computer in “clean boot” does not fix the issue or after the troubleshooting is done, follow the steps above “To return your computer back to normal boot”.</p>
<p>KB 929135 - How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>How to set your computer back, to boot normal: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click the Start orb on your Desktop<br />
2. In the Start Search box. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
Click the General tab. <br />
3. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.<br />
4. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might want to post in the Nero Community Forums for assistance with this issue.<br />

            There was a variety of Bugchecks. Some indicate Kaspersky, while a large number of those indicate your Network driver etc. There is no way to check if the Network card is faulty unless you work keeping it disabled. Can you please disable it in Device Manager and see if the issue persist?

            As you have done a clean install, likely it is a hardware part that is bad. Assuming the system is appropriately cooled and getting adequate power, consider doing an RMA on the mobo

<h2>            2 backwards compatability questions</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing L4D2 and i met a person. He sent a friend request to me but it wasn't anywhere on my xbox one. I had to turn off my xbox one and turn on my 360 to accept the friend request. Is there an easy way to do it on xbox one? Second question: when i'm
 playing a backwards compatible game online, am i playing with other people on who are on the 360 or just on the xbox one or both? Thanks!</p>

<p>Heya mate,</p>
<p>In asnwer to you first question, no I do not belevei there is a way to accept 360 friends requests through the console. Possibly while you are playing the game, you might be able to hit the dashboard button and find it in your messages, but I don't think
 so. Easiest way is to do it through the Xbox App, or through this website :) </p>
<p>In answer to your next question, you are playing with both xbox one, and xbox 360 players :)
</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

    <title>Drawing Tablet Pen Pressure Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rinkuengel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drawing Tablet Pen Pressure Issue</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I updated my computer with the most recent update my drawing programs have not been registering any pen pressure or stabilization. I can't do a restore before this point because it says it was a critical update. I've tried reinstalling my drivers
 and my programs and nothing is working so I'm wondering if it has to do with the new update. I'm using a Huion H610PRO and it has had no issues up until this update. The lines are not stabilizing and I'm unable to flare the edges.

    <title>Microsoft office Ultimate 2007. Loading word &#38; excell since - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft office Ultimate 2007. Loading word &#38; excell since Windows 10 upgrade Dec. 2017</h2>
                    <p>Since Windows 10 latest upgrade (Dec. 2017) my Microsoft Office Ultimate 2007 has developed 2 problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[1]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I try to load Excel I get a warning sign and message "stdole32.tlb" with options to press OK or x (to exit?) either option will bring on a window "configuring Office 2007". this runs for about 30 seconds then Excel loads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>[2]</p>
<p>Similar problem with Word. (it did work o.k. a few times after update, problem occurred after loading Excel) When I try to load word it brings up the Office logo and then "configuring Office 2007" which runs for about 30 seconds or sometimes it just brings
 up the Office logo and <span>then takes about 30 seconds to load.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>These delays are very frustrating and I would appreciate any information on how to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I revert back to restore point before upgrade and then prevent upgrades or would this be in-wise?</p>
<p />

    <title>Symlinking Folders after cloning OS to SSD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Symlinking Folders after cloning OS to SSD</h2>
                    <p>the short version</p>
<p>After cloning select parts of windows 10 to my new SSD I can't log in because certain files are missing. I wish to simply junction the folders to my SSD so that I don't have to move them from my original HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the long story</p>
<p>I used Paragon Migrate to clone my windows 10 install to a new drive however I left behind certain folders (such as users and Programs)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now When I boot to the SSD I can't log in because the users folder is missing on the drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to make junction links between the old HDD and the new SSD while booted into the HDD in order to simply link the missing folders (using a junction link) to folders on the old drive, however this was ineffective.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need help solving this and I'm not sure what my options are. Going to attempt maybe using safe mode on the SSD to perhaps work around the issue and see if I can just create the junctions from there to maybe fix this but I'm not overly confident
 that it will work.</p>

    <title>24x7 Help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lj killen  say:</h3>
<h2>            24x7 Help</h2>
                    Recently a icon (a woman with a headphone) appeared on my desktop and also at the top of any open window.&nbsp; It 's called "24x7" Help and opens a screen with a telephone number 0800-030-4160 and saying it's "Microsoft trained technicians are standing by
 ready to help you solve all your PC issues and more".&nbsp; Is this a scam?&nbsp; Because I'm having trouble with the screen display I called and got a call centre in India and was shown umpteen "errors" (over ten thousand) and, if I got a Certified Microsoft Technician,
 he could clear the errors and sort out my computer.&nbsp; The cost was over $200.&nbsp; So, again, have I been scammed.&nbsp; I use Microsoft Security Essentials and I have Simplitec Power Suite for maintenance of the system.

            <p><span>Yes, this is a scam!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As this happened recently, you should be able to run system restore, if it’s enabled.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Restart the computer and start tapping the F8 key, select the Safe Mode with Command Prompt option. If you are asked to select an operating system, use the arrow keys to select the correct one and press Enter. Log on as an administrator
 or with an account that has administrator credentials. At the command prompt, type %systemroot%\system32\rstrui.exe and then press Enter. Follow the prompts to restore the computer to an earlier date.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After successfully restoring the system,<span>&nbsp;
</span>run Microsoft Security Essentials to clean up any residual ‘nasties’ in the user folder(s). When the computer is clean, create a manual system restore point and name it, say, ‘After removing a recent infection’. This new, clean restore point can be used
 should you have to restore again in the near future.</span></p>

    <title>No message notifications - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dts342  say:</h3>
<h2>            No message notifications</h2>
                    I'm not suffering from this issue, myself, since I use good old Classic, but my friends/contacts who use the latest version (desktop AND phone) have stopped getting notifications when they recieve a new message. This renders Skype completely useless. What
 is going on? Is this a known issue? I hope so, and that it gets resolved soon, because now Skype is completely unusable. One of my contacts has had this problem for about two months now...

            Hello Stone.<br /><br />I'm a fellow Community member here to help. I'm sorry to hear that your friends are experiencing trouble. I know that it is extremely frustrating.<br /><br />This is in fact a known issue with the new version of Skype. The new Skype is still under development and as such as lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and has several bugs that have been identified.<br /><br />While there is not yet and ETA, It is believed that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in the very near future that will add features and functions as well as correct any bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listen to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future.<br /><br />If your friends wish to return to Classic Skype they may do so.<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.<br /><br />Have a great day.

<h2>            Video Skype calls no longer work on mac</h2>
                    <p>I have made regular video calls using Skype for several years without problem. Recently it has ceased functioning. Video calls disconnect instantly, and voice calls disconnect if I try and share screen. I am using Mac high sierra 10.13.4 on a reasonable
 new and powerful MacBook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling then reinstalling Skype which I thought had worked, but when I click 'About Skype' I get the following:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade to 1709 keeps failing with error 0xc1900208 and ZoneAlarm9 &#40;2010&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Every day now Windows 10 keeps trying to upgrade to the latest version 1709, but every time comes up with error</p>
<p>0xc1900208</p>
<p>or says that </p>
<p>"ZoneAlarm9 (2010) is not compatible with Windows 10."</p>
<p>But there is no indication whatsoever that ZoneAlarm9 is, or ever was, installed on the PC in question.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled various other apps, but all to no avail.</p>
<p>I have run the Windows update troubleshooter facility, but nothing makes any difference.</p>
<p>It is completely maddening, particularly as it is not even possible to switch off the upgrades for a month.</p>
<p>I clicked that option, but it still tried to upgrade.</p>
<p>It is a good job I am not on a limited download contract.</p>
<p>Anyway, does anybody have any ideas about how to solve this problem?</p>
<p>If it is a problem with an application installed, then why does it not simply identify the correct one rather than indicating an application that is not even installed?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Andrew.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Any chance any Zone Alarm products are in a Downloads folder, even not installed?
<br />
<br />
<br />What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by downloading and  installing Media Creation Tool from this link and then choose to Upgrade This PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If Version 1709 causes problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If problems persist you can also roll it back within 10 days at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery and block it using the Hide Updates tool or another method here to wait to see if it matures:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            It does the exact same in-place Upgrade saving files, programs and most settings, except from a more stable platform.

<br />Your files should always be backed up though if valued at all because the hard drive can die at any time.

<p>"What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by downloading and installing Media Creation Tool from this link and then choose to Upgrade This PC Now.

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>. "</p>
<p>But it still comes up with the same problem at the end and refuses to proceed with completing the upgrade.</p>
<p>Error code 0xc1900208</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>ZoneAlarm9 (2010) is not compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a chat session with Check Point and they pointed me to a "clean" utility for completely removing Zone Alarm (although I don't think it was ever installed anyway!). I ran that and rebooted, but it made no difference whatsoever. Still the same barrier
 at the end of a time-consuming process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try your next suggestions sometime soon under</p>
<p>"If Version 1709 causes problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki..."</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But I wish it was not such an immensely tedious and time-consuming process! I hope that I do not have to resort to the solution of a completely new clean install as it would then take ages re-installing all the other programs I have carefully set up over
 several months.</p>
<p>If there really is an old program which is causing a problem then it ought to be clearly identifiable in the installed programs list (otherwise why would the upgrade process keep protesting about it?), but there is simply nothing there corresponding.</p>

<p>Not making much progress!</p>
<p>Is there any log file created by the failed upgrade process which would identify the location on my hard drive of the ZoneAlarm installation which is apparently preventing the upgrade? The upgrade process always asks me to uninstall it manually, but since
 there is no sign of it in the uninstall facility under settings and since I have no idea of where it is installed then I am stuck.</p>
<p>I have already hunted for zonealarm in the registry and deleted the one reference there was to it there.&nbsp; I have no idea how it got there!</p>
<p>But that still made no difference.</p>

<p>I have finally managed to upgrade to Fall Creators Update build 16299.</p>
<p>Here is the process which eventually worked.&nbsp; It involved finding the "incompatible" file which was preventing the upgrade from proceeding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Event Viewer (Find by typing "Event Viewer" in bottom left search box)<br />
Click Windows Logs (left hand side)<br />
Click Application (left hand side)<br />
Go to Action menu<br />
Find "winsetupdiag02"<br />
Click "Event Properties" in right window.<br />
Scroll down in box and double click on SetupAct.log<br />
This should give clues (lots of them!!) about the problem.<br />
In my case I found "Manual uninstall required for vsdatant.sys".<br />
I opened a File Explorer window, click on "This PC" typed the filename in the search box and found the file that was causing the problem.<br />
Deleted it.<br />
Tried upgrade again.<br />
And all proceeded fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has taken a lot of googleing and research to get to this point.</p>
<p>I don't know how the "offending" file came to be on my system, but I doubt very much whether it would have interfered in any way with the operation of the Upgraded Windows system.&nbsp; It was not "installed" in any way at all - just there on my hard drive, waiting
 for the day to cause a lot of bother in preventing the upgrade!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, could you please try to ensure that your users do not have to spend time dealing with enormously frustrating issues like this.</p>
<p>1. Could the upgrade system be smart enough only to prevent an upgrade if a file is "installed" on the system which is genuinely incompatible with the "actual operation" of the new system (rather than simply being there).</p>
<p>2. If the upgrade process is suspended because of an incompatibility issue please ensure that the resulting report which is seen by the user identifies the precise location on the system of the offending file(s) if they need to be removed manually.&nbsp; It was
 very time consuming to have to discover for myself the procedure outlined above, which seems currently to be just about the only (difficult and obscure) way of resolving this issue.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Loss of audio devices not sound. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Loss of audio devices not sound.</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been running windows 10 for a few weeks now. This past week I logged on to my computer and tried to change the audio device from my speaker set to my headset and I realized there weren't and audio devices. I tested my sound and it came out just fine
 from the speakers. I plugged my headset in and the sound continued to come out of the speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to step 1 "Turn it off and back on" Sound was coming out of my headset now but still no audio devices. The computer isn't detecting when I plug and unplug my audio devices now. I have tried reinstalling the drivers for my head set. My speaker set
 and my monitor have the 3.5mm jacks and they only work if I start the computer with the headset unplugged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The kicker for me is If I try the audio troubleshooting it sees ALL the devices but it says nothing is wrong with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok so I've checked out all of the options above as well as a host of others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is not that the devices are being set to default or anything similar. The devices do not show up at all.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/032593ac-7004-407e-9a3b-d5a939dcc446" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>But If I click on troubleshot the computer is acknowledging that the devices are plugged in.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b5b0dd65-fa63-4f8e-a058-937f67a47062" /></p>
<p>If I click on any of them it says nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I have clicked on "Show disabled devices" Still got nothing. Any further suggestions?&nbsp;</p>
<p />

            Ok really getting to the end of my rope here. I've heard nothing but horror stories about re imaging with 10 and being forced to buy a new product key. Really not looking forward to going through that for this. Is there really no one else here that has

<h2>            Dont buy Daggerdale&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok devs I know you guys read forums but this has got to stop.This game is so badly glitched I cant even play it.Everytime I get to the Teifling fight pit all my skills are gone and my hotkeys dissapeared.This has happened more then 3 times and I am sick
 of playing this far only to have to delete my guy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you people even test this game ? Why did we have to pay for this crap ? I am so beyond upset that I gave my money for this craptacular turdfest of a game.Shame on you for charging us and I will try to thwart anyone who may be interested in this game
 from NOT buying it.I dont care how your time restraints may have affected the development of the game but this kind of stuff is beyond uncool.Some guys if you had any interest in this game please dont buy it.Its time these game companies step it up not a bit
 BUT ALOT this is getting out of hand.Paying customers getting a ****product and using us to alpha test your software.Needless to say, I am disapointed and will never buy a game from this developer.</p>

<p>Its supposed to happen. Once you pass that part you can remap them, you need to make sure you are not on the character info screen and on the last tab of where the weapon, armor, jewelery selection screen is the 4th tab is to map skills. If you are still
 having trouble I can make a screen shot for you.</p>
<p>Also I agree this game needs serious patching. </p>

<p>But there is an issue with actually losing skills during the game. I am not sure if it s a glitch from fighting goblin hexer's when they curse you. But all my characters except my dwarf lost the top row skill during play, the dwarf lost 2 skills. While I
 only noticed some of them missing after the tiefling fight when I went to reassign them, with my dwarf I discovered them missing before that point. &nbsp;I was actually able to still use them as long as I didn't map over them, but I could not assign points to them
 or anything, and the points assigned to them were gone. I also could not remap them once unmapped.</p>

<p>I just had tons of luck then, my first character I thought I lost my skills but then I learned I couldn't map the skills in the character info screen thing and I have never ever lost a skill on the other 3 chars I made. Sorry it happened, whats funny though
 is the supposed patch is in certification for how long? Too Long...</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 randomly shuts down - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 randomly shuts down</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading my Asus Zenbook UX31E from 7 to 8.1, the laptop shuts randomly down when on battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read that others have the same problem on different laptops. Asus say they do not support this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the problem occurs on different computer brands, it must be a windows 8.1 issue, not hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone can help?</p>

            <p>Thanks for a quick reply. This problem appeared immediately after upgrading from 7 to 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shuts down at random, even when battery is at 60% charge. The screen just goes black and I have to reboot. No error messages or warnings, no overheating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded Power4gear from Asus and tried all available settings&nbsp;.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Zenbook is a verey compact laptop. Cannot remove the battery without special tools. Battery is two years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A search on the Internet shows others have same problem on different computers with Windows 8.1</p>

</p><p>Does it run OK on mains power?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Maybe the extra power consumption or CPU intensity&nbsp;of a major update was the last straw for your battery?&nbsp; Maybe you could get back to Windows 7 (if possible, or desirable) and test from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Most new machines come with a recovery partition allowing you to go back to the time of purchase, you will have to check your user guides (or the manufacturer's Web Site) for instructions.&nbsp; Choosing that path requires you to save all valuable data first.&nbsp;
 Unfortunately upgrading to Windows 8.1 may lose such Recovery Partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These options are built-in to Windows 8 also. </p>

            <p>Hi, I had the same issue, has anyone figured out what could possibly be the cause? I just got my machine back from ASUS. I sent it in twice regarding this issue and each time they wiped and reloaded my machine with Windows 7 Home Premium (the original version
 that came with the machine). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be a disappointment if this can't be resolved by some sort of update. &nbsp;I also have the next version of the Zenbook, (touch screen device) that comes with Windows 8 (now 8.1) So, in theory it would seem that the OS should work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further insight greatly appreciated as I'm trying to determine if I should attempt an upgrade or remain on Windows 7 (which becomes a limiter)....</p>

<h2>            Final Fantasy III is not working as it should.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 8.1 Pro PC and I downloaded a game which is Final Fantasy III. Once&nbsp;I open the launcher, it does work. But after pressing play. It said "FF3_Win32.exe stop working. Windows is checking for a&nbsp;solution to the problem" then after that, it closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My specs of my PC is passed to the system&nbsp;requirements. Why I am having a problem like this one?<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/127d9875-d214-4839-99f9-0111cb0d95de" /></p>

            Hmm, I guess it is the installer issue. The installation files must be corrupted.

<h2>            Medal of Honor Pacific Assault Sound Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Loaded the game on my Win 7 64 bit system. Game works well but no sound is available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System info:</p>
<p>XFX 780i SLI mother board, 4 g ram, XFX 9800 GTX video card, Q6600 cpu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            Thanks for the advice but it didn't work. It is only with this game that I am having problems. All other games that I have work fine including all other Medal of Honor games. I am running a single video card and the onboard sound which shows as Realtek.<br />
