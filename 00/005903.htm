<h2>            Red Screen Scam - We fell for it</h2>
                    <p>So, my dad received the red screen scam and called the number. The next thing he knows, gentleman on the phone has access TO HIS COMPUTER. He was controlling the computer for 15 minutes or so, explaining he could fix the virus situation with three charges:
 $149 to clean up $350 to build a firewall or $450 for a super version .....</p>
<p>
</p><p>We shut down dad's computer and will run McAffee, but are worried that all the other devices on the same network, same IP etc - four computers, cell phones, ipads - are at risk. Are they? Is there a remedy? Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">sending a contact card with information to an external person in Skype for Business for Mac (running latest version) is not feasible. But,
 as a workaround, you can configure your Office365 account in Outlook, then your Skype for Business Contact will sync to the Contact list in Outlook, then right click the contact and Forward as vCard, then this contact card information will be sent to the recipient
 via email.</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should move your contacts to sim from your old phone and then put it into your new phone. If the sim doesn't support the number of contacts you have, then you might want to change the sim. Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open hotmail.com from my blackberry. It was fine yesterday.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to open my hotmail.com email account via my blackberry as I have done for the past 2 yrs.</p>
<p>i keep getting the message when I attempt to open the sign in page......</p>
<p>'there was a problem establishing a secure connection'</p>
<p>i can click STOP or DETAILS</p>
<p>if I click stop I get the message...</p>
<p>refusing connection. The server has been previously noted as supporting http strict transport security. Due to ssl certificate warnings/errors. A connection will not be made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I first saw this I cleared my internet history and rebooted the blackberry ...to no avail.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>sean</p>

            <p>Funny, I have a live.com account that I was not able to use as of yesterday. &nbsp;I have also been using it on my Blackberry and on outlook on my computer. &nbsp;I updated Skype yesterday and it forced me to change my windows or microsoft password and next thing
 I know I can't get email on either my Blackberry or Outlook... but I can get it by logging into the website live.com, so I know that my new password is correct. &nbsp;Very perplexing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was on help all day! &nbsp;In the end the person really didn't know what it was and she decided to tell me that my computer network is at risk level medium and that that is why my outlook is no longer working, because my network has been compromised. &nbsp;Right!?!
 &nbsp;And, then she takes me to Amazon and asks me if I have a $3,000 Sonic Wall!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing this is a Microsoft issue!</p>

            Just read another problem... and figured this one out! &nbsp;I had to turn off two-step verification in order to get access on my Blackberry and Outlook. &nbsp;That seems like a silly thing for them to roll out without properly letting people know how to make it
 work!

<h2>            Windows Defender will not load updates</h2>
                    <p>I have used Windows Defender successfully for a few weeks - last update was successful on 10/25/16. &nbsp;I have tried to update for the past several days - HOURS LATER (6+ hours), it is only about 25% complete - and the status bar is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not moving</span>. &nbsp;I have tried restarting my computer, deleting cookies, browsing history, etc. and nothing happens after the bar reaches about 25%. &nbsp;There is no error message - it just stalls. &nbsp;The first 25% will happen
 in less than a minute.</p>
<p>I also have done a complete scan using WIndows Defender. NO LUCK. Help!</p>

    <title>Problem with Search function. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bart308  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Search function.</h2>
                    
<p>A few weeks into using my new WM5 device (Asus P525), i notice the Search function (or program) does not work anymore. It works fine on the first day. But then it won't work anymore. Do a search, and after many agonizing
 minutes, it just terminates, with the "We're sorry..." message. Options are,&nbsp;only to&nbsp;send or don't send the error report to Microsoft. (And i did click "send" several times.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect i may have installed something that could have come in conflict with this program. So i did a full restore to factory settings. Installed all the programs allover again, and recover&nbsp;all data from PC. Suddenly, the Search program is
 fully functional again. It still do searches in long stretches of countless minutes, but at least now&nbsp;it produces results.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was ok for a couple of weeks. But then again, the Search program ceased to function again. I did not install any new programs, or tweak any settings. Between the time it's ok, up to the time it stopped functioning, nothing has changed in
 the mobile device. Apart from updates to Outlook items and excel files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't understand why it just ceased to function properly. I can still do searches, but only, it has to be confined to certain data types, such as Contacts, or Notes. But it cannot do an "All data" type of search anymore. Doing so will bring
 you back to "We're sorry..." message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do i fix this problem or bug?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why that has occured Bart.&nbsp; I had what appeared to be an issue on my 8525 a while back but I limited where it was searching and it seemed to work.&nbsp; Since then I did do a hard reset and it has not been
 an issue but I have eliminated a lot of "old stuff" from my device with the hard reset.</p>

<p>The issue does not stick out in my mind as being a "topic" of discussion in the forums.</p>

            I'm just looking for help on fixing this problem. Search tool is one of the most important PDA function for me. As i am not very good at organizing info. I essentially depend on Search to dig up from the hundreds of megabytes of info i've collected and
 thrown into my mobile device thru the years. <br />
<br />
I used to own an Asus A620BT. Never had any problem with its search function. Altho its specs is slow for today's standard, the old Search from WM2003 is blazingly fast. It produced results accurately, and much faster than this new WM5 -- with faster processor
 and more ram -- can. <br />
<br />
I was totally satisfied with the old 620BT for the past 4 years. I never even hard reset it. It's all perfect from the start to the end. I've installed tons of programs, from the important down to the trivial. Never asked for, never needed an upgrade. Until
 it was stolen. <br />
<br />
I've already done a couple of hard resets with this new one. It always cure the Search for a few weeks. Then back comes the same problem. I still can't figure out what's causing it.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
Oh, yes. Limited search seems to work. But what i need is total blanket search. Like what my old A620BT used to provide me. Often, i wouldn't know where i stashed info to certain products or procedures. Whether in the notes, text documents, contacts, excel
 files, tasks, or calendar. Some items, such as I-beams or waterproofing materials, have to be attached to particular contacts who supplies them. But i need to jot down some technical info or procedures in the notes or word docs. Other aspects of these materials,
 such as types and dimensions, comparative costings, i have to store it in spreadsheets. Sometimes, i have to check on the delivery dates in the calendar. And more still, reminders for orders and work schedules in the tasks.
<br />
<br />
So you see, most of the time, i have to do a blanket search. And then pick out the info i need from the search results. Which can contain all types of data, pertaining to a particular info.

Thanks for taking interest in my problem. <br />
<br />
My phone have built-in MMS function. Forms part of the SMS-MMS-Email program. I'm not a heavy user of MMS. Not much use of it. But i did use it a couple of times just for fun. I did use it before and after the hard reset. Not immediately. So it can potentially
 be the cause. <br />
<br />
If so, any suggestion for cure?<br />

I have initially suspected a 3rd party software to be the cause. Especially those freewares.
<br />
<br />
So, after the hard reset, i gathered a list of essential and not-so-essential but useful softwares, and then dump the rest. I installed all these selected programs after the hard reset. Then try out the Search tool. It still works perfectly.<br />
<br />
Since the last installation and configuring, i haven't done any tweaking or new installations for a few weeks, during which the Search tool still works fine. I settled on this as the final configuration, or the "final package" of my mobile device.
<br />
<br />
But then, just the same, the problem did come back again. (Surprisingly. Because i thought my "hands-off" policy to any tweaking or new installations have solved the problem.)
<br />
<br />
Jeff's suggestion can be the possible cause. Considering i don't use <span style="font-style: italic">
all </span>the programs all the time from the start. <br />

            <span><span>Hi. I am having a similar issue....<br />
<br />
I am trying to use the Search program that comes on the HTC Touch pro (found under programs) to find some information on over 2000 contacts e.g. to search for something in contact's notes. It runs WM 6.<br />
<br />
It is so slow that its unusable! It runs for more than 5 mins for simple searches...<br />
<br />
The phone has more than enough free memory when this is running: 70MB storage, 125MB programs is free.<br />
<br />
I dont use MMS either... <br />
<br />
Like you, the Search function is one of the most important for me...<br />
<br />
Fyi - on my old IPAQ running an old PocketPC it was done in a matter of seconds.<br />
<br />
Please does anyone have any suggestions on how to improve it, or alternatives? <br />
<br />
It seems its an issue with the Search program on Windows Mobile ?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
<br />

    <title>Problems opening SharePoint&#47;OneDrive Online Office documents for - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems opening SharePoint&#47;OneDrive Online Office documents for edit</h2>
                    <div>
<p>In the last month or so, we started seeing problems with SharePoint/OneDrive locking up edit access to excel and word documents stored in Office Online SharePoint and OneDrive.&nbsp;
<span>The problem is now being reported approximately 4-5 times per week, by various users. &nbsp;
<span>The problem is now being reported approximately 4-5 times per week, by various users. &nbsp;
</span>The circumstances and specific behaviors can vary somewhat.&nbsp; Summarized, we have been getting these periods of time ranging from a few minutes to a couple hours where multiple individuals cannot open for edit SharePoint Online doc library or OneDrive
 files.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if you are using Office Online apps or locally installed apps.&nbsp; People using OneDrive sync to access files via Windows File Manager and people using only Office Online apps both have the problems.&nbsp; Again, this has only been observed
 in the last few weeks.&nbsp; Prior to this period we had been using the same SharePoint environment without problems doing the same kind of work.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Once the problem starts to occur, it is not isolated to a specific file or individual.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday afternoon, for example, I found that I could not get into edit mode on an excel sheet that I had been working on successfully all day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I proceeded to test
 other files in other SharePoint doc libraries and discovered that the problem was persistent with all other Word and Excel files I tested, no matter what file was being used and where it was located in SharePoint.&nbsp; I even tried a file from a different SharePoint
 site collection with the same result. &nbsp; <em><strong>Doc libraries are set to NOT require check out before editing.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>It is also interesting that the problem will often impact multiple people at the same time who are not working on related documents. &nbsp; This is odd because all of the reading I have done related to similar issues have revolved around file locking.&nbsp; Our experience
 is not consistent with cases where specific files are locked for one user. &nbsp; It is more like all of SharePoint goes into some strange state that thinks everything has an edit lock on, but only for certain people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The presentation symptoms vary from instance to instance, but generally present as one of the following:<br />
&nbsp; - Error message:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, something went wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; An error has occurred on the server...."<br />
&nbsp; - File will eventually open with the ribbon greyed out.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; - If I wait a very long time, like a few minutes, the display will eventually update and go to "read only" mode with the file open.&nbsp; If it does that, clicking the "edit in word" button will have no effect.&nbsp; It will just clock and not change modes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>The problem always seems to clear up by itself if you wait long enough, which immediately takes the mind back to "locks".&nbsp; Perhaps coincidentally, I have most frequently encountered the problem in the mid to late afternoon (EDT).&nbsp; Either the next morning
 or by the time I get on at home it has all cleared up.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also looked at local network load and Internet connection loading.&nbsp; Neither appear to be problematic when the issue occurs.&nbsp; I have gone so far as to test editing Word docs stored in Google Drive
 accessed via Google Drive File Stream while SharePoint is failing.&nbsp;&nbsp; No issues on the Google side.&nbsp; During the most recent problem period I tested using a
<em><strong>Chromebook</strong></em> and other Windows 10 PC's. &nbsp; The same problem continued to manifest itself on all client platforms using two different Office 365 user accounts. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi EEKER22,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last month the Error message:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, something went wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; An error has occurred on the server...." is maybe due to
<span>the Service Health Dashboard (SHD) as incident <strong>SP175730 </strong><span>SharePoint Online - SharePoint Online latency and timeouts</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span>has been resolved. It
 was </span><span>starting at 2019-03-13 14:05 (UTC) and end time at 2019-03-13 at 15:04 (UTC). The user experience of this incident is:&nbsp;Users may have experienced intermittent delays or navigation errors when accessing SharePoint sites or OneDrive
 content. Preliminary root cause: A sudden increase in traffic caused a portion of infrastructure that facilitates access to SharePoint Online sites and OneDrive for Business content to become unbalanced, resulting in site delays and navigation errors.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the error:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;File will eventually open with the ribbon greyed out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
- If I wait a very long time, like a few minutes, the display will eventually update and go to "read only" mode with the file open.&nbsp; If it does that, clicking the "edit in word" button will have no effect.&nbsp; It will just clock and not change modes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I confirm that whether you have receive the error message "Excel file is locked for editing by another user"? If yes, please follow the suggestions in this article to see the outcome:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/excel-file-is-locked-for-editing-by-another-user-6fa93887-2c2c-45f0-abcc-31b04aed68b3?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Excel file is locked for editing by another user</a>. Also, as you mentioned the&nbsp;problem always seems to clear up by itself if you wait long enough is the same as the article mentioned "
<strong>Make sure the file is closed on all your devices. If the error still occurs, wait a few minutes for the server to release the lock on the file. (Sometimes the server thinks you have the file open, and just needs to catch up with what’s really going
 on.)</strong> "</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above information is not your situation,please provide the screenshots of the error message you have received to help us narrow down the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Clark</p>

            No, we do not receive the message "<span>Excel file is locked for editing by another user".&nbsp; It just times out and opens in read only mode the majority of the time.&nbsp; The "Sorry something went wrong" error is much less frequent, typically happening
 on the first edit attempt, then followed by repeated opening in read only mode until the problem clears, which sometimes will take over 1 hour.&nbsp; I will try to get a screen shot when an error is presented.</span>

I verified that the regional settings are all correct as indicated in the article.&nbsp; So that must not be the cause of the problem for us.

            We are investigating the possibility that a managed Antivirus service may be related to this problem in some way. &nbsp; We are using Webroot. &nbsp; I would be very interested if anyone can provide any information that would contribute to this activity.&nbsp; I did
 see a few things that might indicate AV apps can cause this type if problem, but could not find anything specific.

<p>Yes, we just had it happen again yesterday. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am fairly confident that the problem is being driven by scheduled Webroot AV scan activity.&nbsp; The problems only occur when the scheduled scans are running.&nbsp; However, the scan activity is causing problems in SharePoint/OneDrive, not locally on the devices
 being scanned. &nbsp; I was able to confirm this by testing on two Chromebooks.&nbsp; The Chromebooks do not run Webroot AV, yet the user using Office 365 Online on the Chromebook has the same problem symptoms with SharePoint/OneDrive files as another person on a Windows
 10 PC with Webroot.&nbsp; I still see no signs that there is a network problem, which would be obvious thing to check.&nbsp; All other cloud applications (e.g. Google Drive) and services are running without difficulty and our network monitors show plenty of capacity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, the data we have leads me to believe the Webroot scans are causing some kind of file lock management bottleneck in SharePoint, which is manifested to potentially anyone trying to access files from our SharePoint environment.</p>

<p>Hi EEKER22,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting back and sharing your test results with us, it will definitely benefit other community members who have the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the Webroot scans are causing the file lock issue when users trying to access files from SharePoint online, it may have some compability issue with SharePoint. To make sure you get the dedicated
 assistance, I suggest you contact Webroot support for further troubleshooting. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

    <title>Using speech with text messages changes sound output - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using speech with text messages changes sound output</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Nokia Lumia 1520.&nbsp; I have discovered that if I am using a corded headset to listen to podcasts and a text message comes in, if I have the speech option enable so that the text message is read to me, once I finish with the text message the phone
 outputs half the volume to the headphone and the other half to the speaker.&nbsp; Is there a way to keep the speech option enable but fix the sound output problem I am having?</p>

<p>Hi, Doc0608.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate you posting your concern in the Nokia Support Discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still having&nbsp;the said behavior? How long have you been experiencing such? When you go to Settings &gt; speech, what is selected under "Read incoming text messages aloud"? Is this happening with all your incoming text messages? What if you try using a different
 compatible wired headset? Does it still occur?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have the latest software installed on your phone? To confirm, 'Lumia Cyan' should be visible under Settings&gt; extras+info. Make sure that your system apps are also updated. You can scan the QR codes from here:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Wiki/6643B883-3321-457A-82BD-0037485483B1">
http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Pool-of-Knowledge/Nokia-Windows-Phone-8-App-Updates/td-p/1640082</a>&nbsp;to do that or go to the Store&gt; ...&gt; downloads and see if there's any pending updates. Please use WiFi while doing such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope to hear from you soon. Good day!&nbsp;</p>

Since Safe mode worked around the problem, the underlying cause is an add-in or a corrupt Normal template. You can troubleshoot COM and Startup add-ins and you can get assistance with renaming the Normal template if you follow the instructions in the article

<p>
</p><p>So I think I might have narrowed it down by seeing whats open when Word goes haywire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have a random word document open then open a folder and click a save .doc file, the preview window shows to the right and the opened word doc goes haywire and any others i open afterwards. I need to close the folder and close all word docs then reopen
 them and they are fine again until i look at a preview file in a folder.</p>

<p>It happens most often when I am zoomed out so that I have 2 or more pages side by side on the screen to check the overall file layout for large projects. I'll be viewing pages 144, 145, and 146 and then I'll be viewing pages 143, 144, and 145, and then it
 jumps back. They keep reordering as I work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well, when I save as a pdf, Word seems to randomly add blank pages to the file. I have a single blank page between chapters so chapter headings all appear on odd numbered pages and section breaks so that I can have page numbers on some pages and no page
 numbers on other pages. The pdf had 3 blank pages instead of one. I have removed all the "link to previous" between headers and between footers. I am wondering if the two issues are somehow connected, that Word is randomly adding and removing blank pages in
 parts of the document I'm not currently viewing on screen and somehow this was saved to the pdf.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 and as far as I know my Word app is up to date. This is not the only file I've experienced this with. It was happening before I installed Grammarly and after I uninstalled it and while it was installed. It does not happen in safe mode because
 in safe mode it doesn't matter how small you make the page, you still get them "single file" and not side by side on the screen.</p>

            I also kept getting this error message, I was sending to multiple addresses.&nbsp;
<div>I discovered that I had inadvertently added a letter in the "address box" I deleted this and the message was then delivered with no error message. This therefore seems to be an Email Address problem,</div>
<div>Suggest you try opening the message from your outbox and check all the addresses are correct with no spaces or added letters?&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Mansi,<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can't download apps because it's asking you to set up your Microsoft family, perhaps your age is below 18 years old on your Microsoft profile. If you're at the right age, just log in to your Microsoft account and have it corrected. Check out this article
 for more details: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17199/windows-10-set-up-your-family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set up your family</a></strong>.&nbsp;<br />

                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I don´t know if it is just me, but sometimes when I boot my system my ping gets screwed because Windows Updates some stuff in the background and uses my whole bandwidth. As I have a pretty poor internet connection this is really bad, especially when you
 need to have a good ping e. g. in video games. Is there any fix for this?</p>

            <p>In the current technical preview build 9926 you don't have any control over updates, but theoretically Microsoft could give the control back in later builds or the final version, but right now, it will just update automatically when it wants, so that Microsoft
 gets feedback right away if there are any issues.</p>

<p>There is no SP3 at this point. Is there a reason you don't want to use Windows Update? With Project it is best to have all the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no version 14.0.7165.5000 for Project 2010. That would have been the January Public Update but none was released for Project 2010. You might want to check out this blog:</p>

            In fact I think Microsoft has stopped issuing Service Packs and replaced with regular updates. They also release a cumulative update every so often.

<p>That's interesting because I always understood that cumulative updates (Public updates) were released with the caveat that they weren't fully tested so user be ware, and that appears to be true from some of the posts I've seen on the forums (e.g. "We installed
 update XYZ and now this or that doesn't work").</p>

<p>
</p><p>my first skype account has always been separate from my MS account (Onedrive, Office365 etc). One day, I found that I could not log into skype1 anymore, even after repeated password resets etc. I then created a new skype2 account with my phone number - it
 worked for a while and then I cannot login anymore. Finally I created another new skype3 account with my email, which is the same email in my MS account. Now my skype3(third) account is Linked to my MS account.&nbsp; I will lose all my old chat threads, contact
 list etc, but never mind, I will rebuild them again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want to delete my old ghost skype1 and skype2 accounts.&nbsp; Where can I find and delete them?</p>

<h2>            How to Obtain Direct URL for Document in Library &#47; Sharing Documents from Mapped Library</h2>
                    
<p>Hey Guys -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our company recently switched from a locally installed SharePoint (2013, I think) to Office 365. &nbsp;I've already configured our Team Site, created a document library for our own knowledgebase, and uploaded documents to it. &nbsp;Currently, our Team Site therefore
 library inside of it is shared with the 4 members of our team. &nbsp;One feature I like is the ability to either map drives directly to the site so that you may access and edit content from Windows Explorer or connect using OneDrive and syncing the libraries. &nbsp;I
 frequently add / update documents / spreadsheets to the library which are placed in a few different folders. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the prior SharePoint installed, I could right click an uploaded document, copy it's url, then either paste a link to it directly in an email or documentation or add it as a hyperlink to text I had typed. &nbsp;In Office 365 when I attemmpt to do this, I simply
 get a menu with a few options - none of which allow me to obtain a direct url which one may go to to open the file directly. &nbsp;In many scenarios now, I am having to send the URL to the folder which contains the document.</p>
<p><strong>Question #1 -&nbsp;</strong>Is there a way to obtain a URL for a specific document in a library which may then be sent to others or put in documentation? &nbsp;I realize that I can select the document, choose to "Share" it, then add a comment to the message;
 but this doesn't help when I need to send a detailed message with the link and/or add it to documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Question #2</strong> - Is there a way to send a direct link / URL to the document when viewing the file in Explorer which is accessing the file either via a drive mapped to the library / site or synced via OneDrive? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been all over Google trying to find a solution, but can't - partially because I don't know what to call the product - "Office 365", "SharePoint 365", "Sharepoint for Office 365", etc...</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance!</p>

<p>hi benjamin,</p>
<p><strong>for question #1</strong>, we can obtain a url for a specific file/document in a library by clicking the ellipsis on the left of it and copy the link in the box as below. and then we can paste it in word/ppt/excel/email, etc.
<br />
<strong>note:</strong> when people without permission for this file/document try to click the link and access the file/document, they are not allowed to access it.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb499f7b-5eee-4275-9807-adbcdeb845fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb499f7b-5eee-4275-9807-adbcdeb845fe" /></a><br />
and if you need every one who gets the link can open the document, click the ellipsis &gt; click
<strong>share</strong> under the link&gt;click <strong>get a link</strong>&gt;copy the link and use it for your need.<br />
you can choose one from the above two ways to meet your need .</p>
<p><strong>for question #2,</strong> if you mean whether we can send a file/document to a document library when are viewing it from the browser, the answer is no. if this is not the case, please let us know your needs in detail. related screenshots are highly
 appreciated and you can upload them by clicking <strong>use rich formatting</strong> at the bottom and then clicking the icon of
<strong>insert media</strong>.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<h2>            Formula for removing the 00&#47;01&#47;1900 when using VLOOKUP and not giving the &#35;N&#47;A code for missing lookup values...</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to write a formula for removing the 00/01/1900 when using VLOOKUP and also not giving the #N/A code for missing lookup values...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I want to combine:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(ISERROR(VLOOKUP(A3,data,2,FALSE)),"",VLOOKUP(A3,data,2,FALSE))</p>
<p>
</p><p>and&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(VLOOKUP(A3,data,2,FALSE)=""),"",VLOOKUP(A3,data,2,FALSE))</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I have this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(OR(ISERROR(VLOOKUP(A3,data,3,FALSE)),(VLOOKUP(A3,data,3,FALSE)="")),"",VLOOKUP(A3,data,3,FALSE))
</p>
<p>
</p><p>...but although it gets rid of the 00/01/1900, I am still getting the error codes for when there are missing values in variable A3, and the VLOOKUP can't be done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions appreciated!</p>

    <title>Tracked Changes with Outline Numbering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amandatinsley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tracked Changes with Outline Numbering</h2>
                    <p>I am tracking changes in a 200 page doc with outline numbering on.&nbsp; The doc is exported from IBM's DOORS program with the changes being tracked, into a word doc template.&nbsp; The doc is then pasted into it's final place where we begin to make small edits (font,
 etc)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However we have begun to notice that when a paragraph has been added, the auto numbering changes but the numbers remain grayed out.</p>
<p>We can not accept the numbering change, however everything else is fine.&nbsp; None of the track change buttons are grayed out and we can proceed creating the document.&nbsp; The ONLY thing we can not change are the numbers itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we change the numbering within the document anywhere else, the same problem occurs.&nbsp; However any changes made to actual text are able to be tracked and accepted/rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When trying to view the changes by pressing next, the outline numbers which are grayed out, are not part of the list of "changes" being tracked.</p>
<p>When right clicking in the numbering field we are not given the option to accept the change, and when we simply click "Accept Change" nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice would be welcome and appreciated!</p>
<p><br />
Thank you!</p>

            <p>Your observation is correct: you can't accept (or reject) numbering directly. What you can do is accept the insertion (or deletion) of the paragraph mark(s) (¶) which caused the renumbering. To get a better view of what happens, display nonprinting marks,
 such as paragraph marks, for example by clicking the ¶ button on the Home tab.</p><p>
</p><p>However, note that you can't fully control the behavior of auto numbers, or field numbers; they will display correctly once you have accepted, or rejected, all changes in the document.</p>

<p>I notice that when I receive an Outlook email, the "TO" line sometimes is "Undisclosed Recipients.&nbsp; I know this is because the sender has left the TO line blank and just used the BCC line.</p>
<p>However, in Outlook 2007, when I send a message leaving the "TO" line blank, those who receive my email see my name in the TO line.&nbsp; I would prefer that they see "Undisclosed Recipients" in the TO line.&nbsp; How can I make Outlook show "Undisclosed Recipients"
 rather than my name when I leave the TO line blank?</p>
