<p>
We are having the same issues with our logs.<br />
<br />
How do we change back to the standard format of &lt;user&gt;@&lt;domain&gt; instead of &lt;large number&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;<br />
<br />
Or how do we translate the &lt;Large number&gt;&lt;@domain&gt; to &lt;User&gt;@&lt;Domain&gt;</p>

<h2>            Office 365, Word 97 etc - unethical blocking</h2>
                    <p>Correct me if I am wrong - this is the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 years ago I subscribed to Office 365. This year I decided not to renew the subscription. The next thing I know</p>
<p>ALL my documents are now inactive INCLUDING those from 10 years ago on word 97!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand office 365 templates being off, but my documents are my intellectual property, I produced them, yet I cannot alter them, copy them, import anything into them or do anything except read them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether this is legal or not, such action from Microsoft is monstrously unethical in my opinion. They are basically saying the documents I created while paying them a subscription fee are in fact theirs and I only have the right to read them, but not to
 own them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This cannot be right let alone fair. &nbsp;I never thought any such thing could be done and the perpetrators get away with it.</p>
<p>I am sure their programming big brains can easily work out a system to remove the templates at the end of a subscription but not affect documents created prior to cancellation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder how many customers now using office 365 are aware of this plot.</p>

            <p>Your old documents are just fine. They are not "blocked." Your computer just doesn't remember what to do with them. If you start Word through the Start menu, you should be able to open and edit any of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you installed the new version of Word you told Windows you wanted to use that program for Word documents. It "registered" as the application for your computer to use to open and edit all Word documents. When you uninstalled the new one, the uninstaller
 is not smart enough to fix this. It knows you uninstalled Word. It does not know that you still have your previous version of Word. You need to re-register your version of Word with your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hold down the Windows key and press R. (then release both)</p>
<p>This will open a small box you can type in. Paste the following line in that box and press Enter:</p>
<p>winword.exe /r</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the space before the /.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens when you do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it can't find the program, try the following (with quotation marks) in the Run box for Word 97:</p>
<p><span>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office\winword.exe /r"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it can't find the program, your previous version of Office may have been uninstalled and you would have to reinstall it.</span></p>

<p>Since it isn't possible to install a subscription version of Office with a stand-alone version installed, in all likelihood Office 97 was uninstalled, so remedial action would require far more than just re-registering Word via</p>
<p>winword.exe /r.</p>
<p>Office 97&nbsp;would need to be&nbsp;reinstalled</p>

            As Charles points out, your old documents are fine, but you need some version of Word to open them. When you were using Word 97, if you had uninstalled it, you would have been unable to open those documents then, too. In trial copies of later versions,
 you could create Word documents, but if you did not purchase and activate the program, it went into "reduced functionality mode," allowing you to read and print documents but not edit them or create new ones. By dropping your subscription to Office 365, you
 have in effect uninstalled it, or at least failed to (re)activate it, so it is operating in reduced functionality mode.

                    My Lumia 625 has only 170 MBytes free out of 8Gigs. I can see the phone as an external drive on my laptop but can't access its folders, such as Pictures, to move some stuff thus freeing up space. I select Storage Sense but it doesn't open even after adding
 a 1 Gig MicroSD card. What can I do to free up some space?

            <p>Thanks Gary, successfully deleted some pictures. I've got another problem with Lumia 550: if I turn off the wifi modem and restart it, I have to restart the 550 as well otherwise I get the message: "Can't connect to wifi network".</p>
<p>Took it to the dealer and they tried a hard reset but still the problem remains. Had it sent to Microsoft and they said they did a software update&nbsp;and sent it back but again same story.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea about the cause of this and how to solve it?</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. Are you saying that this is the case then and its a scam?</p>
<p>This hasn’t come from an email though and isn’t a link for me to click on. When im using my ios device a message keeps popping up saying “enter password for hotmail account” and the options “edit settings” or “cancel”. I click on “edit settings” and it takes
 me to my settings and says “re-enter password”. When i do this it comes up with the message “You need a parents permission. Based on your age we need your parents permission before you can use this account. Using a web browser sign into account.microsoft.com
 to get your parents permission and come back to try again”</p>
<p>When i sign into my account on my laptop it tells me the same thing “you need a parents permission” with an option to put in a parents email address or two options “i’m and adult, why am i seeing this” and “my parent is here”. Both of those options ask me
 to enter credit card details to confirm age or the option to submit a form if i dont have a card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If i go into my settings in my hotmail account it is showing my date of birth as 2012 and wont let me change it so maybe this is why?!</p>

<p>We appreciate your speedy reply. With this error message saying " You need a parents permission. Based on your age we need your parents' permission before you can use this account".<span>&nbsp;
</span>The system is detecting that your age on file is below 13 years of age. Thus, you need to prove that you're an adult. This may not be a spam message but, we are wary of the amount that you have to dole out to verify your age.</p>

<p>I have done this and while it's not a scam, it's non-refundable and is only for age verification. So, for all intensive purposes, feels like a scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read somewhere that its given to charity, however how can that be validated? Which charity benefits from my 50p?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate it's only 50p and not the end of the world, however its the principle of it and not having it state that its a) non-refundable; and b) given to charity; throughout the payment process is underhand. In my opinion, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give me my 50p back, Microsoft!</p>

<p>Hi Timmy,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft complies with regulations such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and COPPA in the United States regarding online account creation for children under the specified ages for their country.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>To verify that an adult is giving a child permission to create a new Microsoft account, a small amount must be charged to the adult's credit/debit card. We charge 0.50 dollar/euro for this verification. This charge isn't refundable.
 All fees collected are added to the parent or child account&nbsp; or donated to UNICEF.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>If you have additional questions, kindly reply to this thread.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Disagree that £0.50 must be charged to verify age. This may be a requirement in the US, however not in UK. GDPR does not require the charging of a fee, its just a Microsoft thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, i have previously been told that ALL money goes to UNICEF, not some of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refund please.</p>

<p>The money that was charged to your card is not for the verification of age. It is for the parental consent of accessing your Microsoft account. The system detects that your age is not yet legal or adult and that is why you were prompted to provide a parental
 consent. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take note that the charge will not be refunded. Like what we've mentioned in our previous reply, all fees collected are added to the parent or child account or donated to UNICEF.</p>

<p>Thank you greatly for your response. It means a lot. The clarification is as clear as a good consomme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look, your reply comes across as rather brusk. Luckily, i have a query in with escalatons team too. I couldnt give two figs about the value of 50p, its the lack of clear UK specific information during the payment process and&nbsp; how it is built on a US method
 which holds no relevance to UK regulations. All to gain access to my 3 year olds email account she has no idea how to use. Also the manner of Microsofts support, whilst it doesnt surprise me, is disappointing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a situation where Microsoft has my money, i have no intention of spending it with Microsoft, theres no evidence to say it gets sent to UNICEF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the money accrue interest? I might end up with a tenner in 30 odd years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank you for your attempts of support&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers now.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to reply and help TimmySalmon. After scrolling through pages and pages of unhelpful microsoft information i decided to take the risk and pay the 50p. I niw have access to my accihnt again. I completely agree with you.....it’s
 not the cost that annoys me. I could find 50p in the bottom of my bag no problem but why should i pay this when im 37 for goodness sake? And why now and not years ago? I certainly didnt put my DOB in as 2012....i had the account before then!</p>
<p>thanks again :)</p>

<p>The same thing happened to me. Im 31 and they think im 13 for some reason. Ive had the account for like 6, 7 years. Theres no way im giving them my credit card details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What i did was, i signed up to gmail and set it up so my outlook emails get forwarded there. So i can access all my emails at gmail now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i don't understand is how they think children wont be able to get round this? What's stopping them making another account and saying they were born in the 80s?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole thing is complete nonsense and extremely annoying.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 822 Windows Phone 8.1 Random Shutdowns</h2>
                    <p>Model: NOKIA Lumia 822</p>
<p>Carrier: Verizon Wireless</p>
<p>Software: Windows Phone 8.1 Update</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS version: 8.10.14203.306</p>
<p>Firmware revision number: 305.50009.1446.0077</p>
<p>Hardware revision number: 1.0.0.0</p>
<p>Radio software version: 2.0.092078.3</p>
<p>Chip SOC version: 8960</p>
<p>Screen resolution: 480x800</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this phone for years on Verizon. Suddenly, it has started doing a random shutdown.&nbsp; Screen is black.&nbsp; Not responsive to any buttons.&nbsp; Have to open it, remove and reinstall the battery, close it and press power button to get it to work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it was a battery problem so I replaced the battery.&nbsp; Still getting random shutdowns.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasional,&nbsp; when I wake the phone up, slide up the lock screen and enter my password it freezes.&nbsp; Again, unresponsive to any buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verizon appears to&nbsp;be phasing out&nbsp;Windows Phones.&nbsp; The only Windows Phone they still offer is the Microsoft Lumia 735.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any suggestions on how to fix the phone.</p>

<p>But the instructions there appear to be for a Windows 10 PC: <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Backup</strong></p>
<p>There isn't anyway to do a full backup of a Windows Phone the way you would a Windows PC.&nbsp; Nor is there a way to find out exactly what won't get backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using backup on the phone but it now says:</p>
<p>Last backed up on Sunday</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to manually run a back up of apps+settings&nbsp;the status bar gets to 97% and then says:</p>
<p>We can't connect to OneDrive to back up.</p>
<p>Update your phone and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the phone is on the latest version of Windows Phone 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>There isn't anyway to manually run a backup of text messages or photos+videos.&nbsp; Nor is there a way to view text messages and photos+videos backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to fix this problem without losing everything that is on the phone?</p>

            <p>It will only cost you if you are on a metered connection. (e.g. a limit of 8Gb and then you are charged extra, etc.)</p>
<p>On a 2m connection it is going to take a while. &nbsp;It is a large download. &nbsp;But if you have unlimited access on your connection it shouldn't cost you anything more than time.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 16 Browse Web Locations - Getting Sites To List</h2>
                    <p>We are running windows 10, office 365 and are hoping to store all organisation documents in sites 16 (sharepoint online), with no sync.&nbsp; A key requirement is the simplicity of attaching documents to emails.&nbsp; I note that in outlook 16 the "attach paperclip"
 icon shows option for "browse web locations".&nbsp; Under this I can see onedrive personal, but the option/link to sites/sharepoint or even onedrive for business is not present.&nbsp; How do we enable, or get to see the link to our organisations&nbsp;sites?&nbsp; This seems to
 be&nbsp;the intention&nbsp;but it is not working for us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within "Other Web Locations" there are some recent folders but none are actually any of our site locations.&nbsp; I can access sites content by manually typing our sharepoint HTTP address into the file name after clicking browse this PC, I can then navigate to
 attach files from sites 16/sharepoint, but it does rely on typing or copying/pasting the HTTP link in first.</p>

<p>hi alex,</p>
<p>based on your description, do you mean you cannot view the onedrive and site options which are linked to your one drive for business and sharepoint site as below?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da98fda6-be1f-4131-a05b-c44c41afa248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da98fda6-be1f-4131-a05b-c44c41afa248" /></a></p>
<p>if yes, to let them show up when we navigate to “browse web location”, we need to sync our one drive for business and sharepoint to the computer via the following steps.<br />
in one drive for business: <br />
1. login to <a href="https://portal.office.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">office 365 portal</a>&nbsp;&gt;&gt; navigate to onedrive.<br />
2. click sync &gt;&gt; sync now to sync the files in our computer. <br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff981586-f01f-4ccb-91f1-f58b73cf90d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff981586-f01f-4ccb-91f1-f58b73cf90d0" /></a><br />
in sharepoint: <br />
1. login to the <a href="https://portal.office.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">office 365 portal</a>&gt;&gt; navigate to site &gt;&gt; open your site.
<br />
2. select the documents&gt;&gt; click library &gt;&gt; sync &gt;&gt; sync now.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/caeb39f0-692f-4c9c-a7ca-8df4483aa3e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/caeb39f0-692f-4c9c-a7ca-8df4483aa3e6" /></a></p>
<p>if the two options of onedrive and site still don’t show up after you sync them to your computer, please help us collect the information below to narrow down the root cause:<br />
1. a screenshot of “the option/link to sites/sharepoint or even onedrive for business is not present”.
<br />
2. if you configure your account on another computer and sync your one drive for business and sharepoint on that computer, can you view these two options when you navigate to browse web locations to add attachments?</p>

<p>Hi Poppy, Thank you for making a reply. &nbsp;The suggestion does not help me because we are not in a position to sync our sharepoint as the sites/libraries contain more than 20,000 files which exceeds to sync limit. &nbsp;The point of sharepoint is so we don't have
 our data locally, but we need to be able to navigate to it easily to be able to attach documents to email to send. &nbsp;I appreciate we can send links, and share files, but still a lot of people prefer to receive an actual document on an email attachment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case I have tried to sync a small library but it does not seem to change the options.</p>
<p>I have found 1 alternative workaround in mapping the network drive of sharepoint web locations. &nbsp;Although I am struggling to make this work on many colleagues pc. &nbsp;</p>

Yes, you are right. As&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this article</a>&nbsp;says, we can sync up to 20,000 items in an OneDrive for Business library and 5,000 items in a SharePoint library including folders and files.</p>

 I pressed the phone button and it went to load a cycled back to my menu... as did my text message, email, calendar, cloud and a few other apps. I was perturbed by this so I scoured the internet for answers and the only conclusion I could fine was to Factory
 Reset my phone. I was able to get into my settings&gt;about&gt;reset yadda yadda. Phone shuts off and powers back up. No reset. I shut down and hard reset with the Volume down and power button then up&gt;down&gt;power&gt;down (Hadouken!) Phone cycles and loads back up. So
 I try uninstalling almost everything I can. Still to no avail. I have no sweet clue what is wrong with it. Has anyone run into an issue like this? Any fixes? I can't find anything on the internet about it. Help!

            Volume Down + Power is a soft reset. If that does not solve the problem you may need to try a hard reset (Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone). Just make sure you have backup turned on under Settings first.

            <p>I received a call from a man with Indian Accent today telling me he was Sandy from "Panel of Microsoft Certified Technicians".&nbsp; (I had to ask him several times to repeat the 'Panel of' but he was very clear on saying he was a Microsoft Technician.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>He advised me Microsoft was very concerned as they had seen a lot of activity on my email address and asked me if I had been using my computer between 5-pm last night.&nbsp; He said Microsoft was very concerned because there had been a lot of attempts to access
 my email with the wrong password which had triggered their security and that they have just had a request to change the 'forgotten' password and wanted to make sure it was a litigate request - thus were calling me as they did not want to lose me as a customer
 from having my security breached. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As the call came from 'private name, private number' I indicated to him I have no idea who I am talking to and giving there is no company identification on his telephone call (caller id), I would not be providing any personal information.&nbsp; He encouraged
 me to get on my computer (which is in for repair at the minute) as they have identified the IP Address that is trying to access my system.&nbsp; I told him if they have done that, they should be able to block it and more to the point report it to the police.&nbsp; He
 again wanted me to get on the computer so he could show me the 'Log" of attempts to access my personal information which he said they had identified as being routed via China.&nbsp; He asked could this be legitimate.&nbsp; Again wanted to know the times I use my computer
 - I declined to tell him and indicated I would need a phone number to confirm it was actually Microsoft calling.&nbsp; (had laptop stolen a year ago and got really burned - not about to do it twice). &nbsp; He then offered to provide me his name (Sandy), phone number:&nbsp;
 1-571-358-8077.&nbsp; I indicated that did not sound anything like a Microsoft number and he told me he was working from Virginia and that they are governed by the US government for System Security!!!, they are required to advise people when there is a risk to
 their system.&nbsp; I told him I hadn't time to&nbsp; be on a computer at the minute and he asked when my computer would be returned from repair.&nbsp; (I actually was starting to buy into his call),&nbsp; He said he will call me back in five days to follow up and make sure my
 security is not breached.&nbsp; So Glad I did not go on my other laptop because part of me wanted to see this 'log' that was showing attempts to break into my email. - duh!&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please don't fall for this, having recently been through a stolen laptop where access to my email was successful and many of my files deleted, it is soooooo&nbsp; much work to re-establish your security and I was actually just starting to feel comfortable about
 my security when this call came in.&nbsp; I was a little more inclined to listen to him as I had reported my theft to Microsoft at the time.</p>

            <p>These people are frauds trying to gain access and control of your entire computer claiming to be with Microsoft Support. &nbsp;Asked me to press my "Win" Key and "R". &nbsp;The "run programs" screen pops up and he asks that you type "www.fastsupport.com" enter. &nbsp;Our
 conversation (I've condensed) to place as follows:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>ME: It sounds like you're trying to gain access to my PC.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
FRAUD: Yes Sir. It appears someone has hacked into your PC and Microsoft wants to be sure no data was compromised. &nbsp;Follow my instructions and we will find out who hacked into your system. Then I will help your remove the virus..... .&nbsp;<br />
<br />
ME: I'm not giving you access to my PC, I don't know who the hell you are.<br />
<br />
FRAUD: Yes, I am with Microsoft support. &nbsp;My name is Ryan and my employee number is AA/8307. &nbsp;You can call 517-358-8077 and verify my credentials.<br />
<br />
ME: Give me a minute I'll call but how do I know I'm calling Microsoft..... (keeping up the small talk I googled the number) &nbsp;Well Ryan, it appears your phone number is connected with pages of fraudulent activity.........................connection lost.<br />

<p>Did you install the driver for the Wacom device? I had your symptoms, and the tablet (Wacom Graphire CTE-430) behaved only as a mouse until I downloaded and installed the correct driver. Take a look here:</p>

<h2>            MS Project as a Contractor</h2>
                    I am familiar with MS project but ran into a new challenge that I'm struggling with.&nbsp; One of the business I'm working with provides their services for a&nbsp;fixed fee.&nbsp; All of the "resources" have different hourly rates.&nbsp; The client will only ever pay that
 fixed fee but&nbsp;I still need to add up the resources hours x their rate to figure out if money was lost or made on that fixed fee.&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp;I'm trying to determine how many hours can be spent on the project before they go over the fixed fee....and start
 to loose money.&nbsp; Thanks in advance!&nbsp;

            <p>So, the business that you are working with is a subcontractor with their own resources, and they perform a number of the tasks in your project?</p>
<p>And the fixed fee is what it costs you for those tasks to be performed, and you pass this on to your client "at cost" ie no margin?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know who the resources are, and each of their rates, and which tasks each resource will be assigned to?</p>
<p>If so, then just list the resources in the resource sheet with their rates and assign them to tasks as if they were your resources.</p>
<p>However, it may be that you don't know who they are or what their rates are, or which tasks they will be assigned to.</p>
<p>In that case, you just have to estimate it all.</p>
<p>You will need to create individual generic resources like "sub1", "sub2" etc, because you are going to assign whoever you think will perform each task to the appropriate task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively (lazier), just have a resource called "subcontractor" and assign that resource to all of the tasks at various units so that subcontractor assigned at 100% represents one person, subcontractor assigned at 200% represents two persons etc. However,
 this shortcut comes at a cost because you will end up with over-allocation but will not be able to level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a first step, I would spread the fixed fee uniformly across all of their tasks, as a fixed cost (see the cost table), so that the cost accrues to the tasks and the project without any resource assignments.</p>
<p>This would establish an average cost for each task.</p>
<p>Whether that is an "accurate" estimated cost for each task will depend on the nature of the tasks.</p>
<p>Then these fixed costs could be adjusted up or down depending on the relative estimate of the cost of each task, until you are happy that you have established an approximate "budget" for each task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I would assign whatever I thought the resources would be for the first task until the cost of the resources was the same as the budget for the task (so the task cost apparently doubles) and then zero out the fixed cost.</p>
<p>Do this for each task until the fixed costs have all been replaced with resource costs.</p>
<p>You then have a combination of tasks, task durations, resource assignments, and resource rates, all of which are estimates but at least they add up to this sacred target fixed fee.</p>
<p>If any of the inputs are changed anywhere, the change will have to be compensated for elsewhere to maintain the budget. If one task gets longer, another will have to get shorter, or the assignments will have to be adjusted and/or the rates will have to be
 adjusted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help so far?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the quick reply Trevor.&nbsp; So I guess I should have been more specific, so to clarify,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do know who all of the resources are. </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I do what they bill at.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For example the company will perform their basic service for $100,000 (example) no matter the job.&nbsp; The project team is made up of let's say 15 people who all bill at different rates-&nbsp;What I'm getting from you is that the way to do this first part is&nbsp;that
 I have&nbsp;to assign them&nbsp;to specific tasks within the WBS? correct?&nbsp;That sounds pretty logical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second- Since we already know the "Budget" is always going to be 100k we can track how close we are getting to the budget but to stay within the budget we'll probably have to shift people around that bill at higher rates to stay within the budget.&nbsp; Is there
 a way to "level" the project(by resource)&nbsp;to make it stay within budget as opposed to just spread load the work?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the major issue is that they form "teams" who's members bill at different rates and who aren't assigned to a specific task but a set of tasks as a group- So the averaging might be a good option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I appreciate your help.</p>

            <p>Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your particular question about "Is there a way to "level" the project(by resource)&nbsp;to make it stay within budget", I guess the answer is no, because that is the part where the human being who is making the decisions comes in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole point of breaking the project into specific tasks and assigning specific resources to each of them is so that you can apply the necessary degree of oversight and control that you are trying to achieve.</p>
<p>If you cannot break the project into specific tasks and assign specific resources to each of them, then you simply will not have that control.</p>
<p>What you seem to have at the moment is a bunch of guys doing a bunch of tasks, and you will only find out that it all cost more than you thought it would cost after the tasks have been done, or, even worse, after all of the hours have been burned but the
 tasks have not all been done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially, you don't know (precisely) what has to be done or who will be doing it, or rather which specific people will do which specific things, all of which is the definition of not having a plan. The direct consequence of not having a plan is that you
 also don't know how long it will take or how much it will cost. You also don't have a cash flow forecast which would show how the forecast cost is, or will be, distributed over the duration of the project. You also don't know if what you are trying to achieve
 is feasible given the limits on the available resources and the budget limit.</p>
<p>If you go into it with the intention of shuffling people around as you go along, isn't this the same thing as choosing to plan the project as you go along rather than in advance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is difficult to see how you can on the one hand embark on the project with this intention, and without answers to the questions about what, when, who, how, how long, how much, and how much when, and on the other hand expect to have much control. It might
 work. Much human endeavor is undertaken like this and it does produce results, as well as a lot of failure. But better planning up front will shift the odds in your favour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would ignore the $100K, and instead work out what it will cost to achieve what has to be done, and then see if if it is more or less than $100K, which is the real question here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you should be aiming to track how close you are getting to the budget.</p>
<p>I think you should design the project plan so that you can forecast or predict now how close you
<strong><em>will be</em></strong> to the cumulative budget up to each review point (status date).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you ever get to the bottom of this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the exact same issue with Word/Excel docs originally created under Office 2013, which are now being worked on under O365 (Office 2016)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found there is a limited one-time fix - Do this fresh after a reboot and ensure you don't open any office apps beforehand. If you open your source Excel fie and copy a random cell to the clipboard. Now open a NEW Word doc which will obviously be empty
 - Now do a paste link of unformatted text which should work ok. Assuming this works then go ahead and open the Word doc where the links aren't working - Now they should work for this one time. As you noted, under the links section the Excel.Sheet.12 entries
 change to Worksheet entries, but if you close and reopen then it reverts back! Strange!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If case it helps MS investigate it, I find that if you try and paste a link normally without the above procedure, then I get an error like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Word cannot obtain the data for the {00020830-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} link."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>Hi Rosen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent the last day doing lots of tests as I had to get this issue resolved. I found that on other systems (also running Win7) that the issue did not occur, regardless of whether Office was 32 or 64bit. I checked my local Windows User profile and even
 created a temporary one as a test but this still produced the same issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>After these tests it was fair to say that the issue laid with my local system, either the Office files or the registry. I uninstalled Office completely via the GUI, then run the MS tool to clean up the system - O15CTRRemove.diagcab</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went through the registry searching for anything referencing C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15 and deleted the associated key. I created a few recovery points beforehand in case I needed to roll back&nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also went through the registry looking for any Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Access references, of which there was a ton from my previous Office 2013 installation</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I rebooted and installed Office 2016 from fresh, this has resolved the issue. I am positive this is a registry issue due to a lack of previous Office versions not cleaning up the registry, especially the HKCR\CLSID keys. Microsoft need to take this
 seriously and get a grip on clean-up tools</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recap - The issue was NOT with any of my files</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>The easiest is to use an IMAP or Exchange account. You can even use a free account like Gmail for this sort of things. Once the emails are all on the IMAP account in Mail, you can connect the same account in Outlook and everything will sync.</p>

<h2>            Band 2 not connected to iPhone anymore and will not connect</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a problem with my Band 2 which have not synced for almost a week now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I started troubleshooting it, the Dashboard app on the iPhone kept wanted to install the latest update, but kept telling me, that it did not have network connection. Altough everything else worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I uninstalled the app and installed it again. On the Band 2 I tried to pair again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After install the app now seems ok - but the Band is not connect - now when trying to "reconnect" my Band, it tells me that my Band is not paired with this phone and I need to factory reset the Band.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But doing a factory reset will delete my data for the past 7 days, which I am not interested in - isn't there a workaround to get me data from the Band out and synced with the Health dashboard. I don't care if I need to use a difference platform than iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peter</p>

            My wife's band + iPhone 6 is having the some problem. I have tried forgetting the band in the iOS Bluetooth settings and repairing and it still is requiring a factory reset of the band. Why on Earth would that be REQUIRED for a previously paired band that
 was working fine, ever?
