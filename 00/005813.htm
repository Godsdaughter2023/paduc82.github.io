<h2>            Anyone noticed that scrolling within Word documents is jerky after updating to Mac OS Sierra&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running three versions of MS Office on my MacBook Pro. I have Office for Mac 2011 running natively, but I also have Office 2007 for Windows running under Parallels Desktop 12, and also an even older version of Office for Windows, Office XP,
 on which I use the Journal feature within Outlook to keep a diary. (Office XP runs under Parallels as well, of course.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I upgraded my Mac to the new OS Sierra operating system, and since doing so I have noticed something very weird...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any of the above applications, I find that scrolling within a document using the integral Trackpad on my MacBook Pro (two-fingered vertical swipes) is exceptionally jerky. Sometimes trying to scroll just doesn't work, and sometimes it suddenly jerks much
 further than I want to scroll. Even when it does scroll reasonably accurately the action is nowhere near as smooth as it used to be. And
<em>slow</em> scrolling is absolutely impossible; the text simply does not move if one tries to scroll slowly. (Prior to the OS Sierra upgrade the scrolling was fine in all three apps.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, the scrolling feature on my Trackpad works as smoothly as ever when I scroll within a TextEdit document, or a Pages document, or within a website on Safari. (ie. within Apple apps)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems as though it is only Microsoft documents that are affected by this jerkiness, but I cannot fathom the logic of this at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else noticed this since updating to OS Sierra, or is it just me?</p>

            You might have to go into Trackpad Preference and reset everything. Sierra works differently.

            <p>Thanks for the tip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, I've tried that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I un-ticked everything, and closed preferences, then went back and re-ticked everything that had been ticked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it made no difference whatever. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that the problem is there in at least one non-Microsoft app now, though. Although Safari pages themselves scroll perfectly, scrolling through the history drop-down in it is just as jerky as with Word. So maybe it isn't something MS-specific
 at all.</p>

            <p>I am also having this problem. So far I've tried uninstalling office for Mac 2011 and deleting the preference files for all office applications and no change. I guess its a compatibility issues and we will have to wait until they release an update that addresses
 it.</p>

            While it's not impossible, it is very unlikely Microsoft will optimize 2011 for Sierra. They're concentrating on Office 2016 now.<br />

            In word, I went into the preferences and under "view" unchecked "vertical scroll bar." This seems to have fixed the problem. Unfortunately, this means that you won't have the vertical scroll bar on screen in word, but at least the scrolling will work reasonable
 well.&nbsp;

            Yes, definitely only Office 2011 in my experience. I "upgraded" to Office 2016. The scrolling issue is fixed, but trying to drag selections around (for example to select a data series for a chart) is pretty dicey.&nbsp;

<h2>            Lost emails during transition to outlook</h2>
                    I had some emails with the original hotmail account that I recently needed to open again. &nbsp;However, when I went to find them I found that they have been lost during the transition to outlook from the previous system. &nbsp;The email I need to retrieve is over
 a year old and the "deleted recover" only brings me back 6 months. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.

<p>I have this same issue. &nbsp;The box to automatically update is not checked. &nbsp;I add some text copying previously styled text (from the same document) in a new location, and that new text changes styles and changes all the other text of that style - though I
 have done nothing except copy and paste. &nbsp;I am not changing any underlying styles on which these are based. I'm then having to reformat the copied and pasted text, and then update the style (back to what it was) to match selection. &nbsp;It's quite annoying, and
 makes it difficult for me to be an evangelist for styles in my company (though I would otherwise want to).</p>

            <p>&lt;&lt;&nbsp;I'm using styles to format the text, but it's redefining the style very often when I don't want it to. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Are all your styles in the document based on Normal style?? If not, they should be, to create consistency and so that the appearance of your other styles do not change just because you've copied formatting from anywhere in the document or pasted in text
 from one page to another.</p>
<p>For instance, if you have a style MyParagraph1 that's based on Body Text, and then you make a change to Body Text style, it's going to change the appearance of MyParagraph1, too. All of your styles should be based on Normal style, with additional style features
 added in and updated.</p>
<p>(2) Under File/Options/Proofing/AutoFormat As You Type, under the subheading "Automatically as you type," is there a check in the box next to "Define styles based on your formatting"?? If so, UNcheck that box so that _you_ have control of how your styles
 look instead of letting&nbsp;Microsoft's idea of the way styles should look make that decision for you.</p>
<p>(3) Make sure that&nbsp;you do NOT have "Automatically update" turned ON for any style (except TOC styles). Otherwise, any&nbsp;change&nbsp;to one paragraph could change the appearance of any or all the rest of your paragraphs.</p>

            <p>&lt;&lt;&nbsp;Format painter together with these styles seems to be the remaining problem. &nbsp;I had been clicking on actual styles most of the last half an hour and not using the format painter, as far as I can recall. &nbsp;It's good to know list paragraph is unstable. &nbsp;Is
 format painter also mildly unstable when used with Styles? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the 15 years since I first learned Word 2000, I've never had problems with the Format Painter EXCEPT when trying to copy formatting from an auto-numbered paragraph into another paragraph. (The number formatting tends to go back to Word's own default settings,
 whatever they are.... and they've never made sense to me so I can't tell you exactly what they are; you'll recognize it if you ever try it yourself.) So I can't say whether Format Painter is stable or unstable. BUT it's my practice to use the styles our firm
 created all those years ago consistently within the document and to apply them to the text in my document by clicking on the text, then clicking on the style. I rarely use the Format Painter any more often than maybe a few times a week.... and I work full-time
 so that's not very often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;&lt;&nbsp;I cannot reapply the style at that point as it has been modified to some random new indentation, and I cannot undo what was done. &nbsp;I can either close and reopen my document to what was last saved, or edit the style back to what I had it as before. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, we have found that when you're having problems such as you describe, it helps to save and close the document, and then reopen it and try again. Or save and close the document, close Word, then reopen Word and reopen the document. Also, do
 you shut down your computer everyday or at least once-a-week?? You wouldn't think that doing so would fix such a problem, but as often as not, it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, my people here laugh at me, both to my face and behind my back,&nbsp;but I still sing my own&nbsp;song of "document compatibility" with whatever version of Word you're running. I can't tell you how many times my users have had problems with Word, even silly
 problems like you're having&nbsp;with the Format Painter,&nbsp;and have called me in for help. On looking over their shoulders, I notice immediately that the words "Compatibility Mode" appear at the top of the&nbsp;Word window, so I ask them to click on File tab/Info tab/Convert
 tool ("Compatibility Mode") to convert the document to match the version of Word they're running on&nbsp;their computer. Then we save the resulting *.docx document,&nbsp;then close and reopen it. 99 times out of a 100, whatever problem&nbsp;they were&nbsp;having has&nbsp;resolved
 itself when&nbsp;they finally reopen the document.</p>

    <title>How do I know if it&#39;s safe to use a possibly refurbished phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bnw1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I know if it&#39;s safe to use a possibly refurbished phone sent as a replacement from Microsoft repair center&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had a problem with my Lumia 640 and sent it into Microsoft to repair. &nbsp;They immediately emailed that it needed to be replaced and sent out a replacement phone within days (great service). &nbsp;The phone came loose in a box rather than retail packaging, and
 I think the repair contract said reconditioned parts could be used. &nbsp;If I'm going to use the phone with multiple email passwords, and the occasional secure transaction, how do I know the the phone is malware free and safe to use? &nbsp;I've heard there is less
 malware for windows phone because of the small market share, but for those of us who are paranoid...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the number they included for questions after the repair, and the rep said that the phones they send out as replacements could be ones sent back from the stores. &nbsp;The do a reset of the phone, but my limited experience with windows PCs is that even
 if you delete files, or even format a drive, only the file system is hidden and the actual files are still present unless you do a sector by sector overwrite. &nbsp;So how do you know if these phones are secure to use with passwords or a sensitive transaction?
 &nbsp;Does the hard reset really wipe away any malware?</p>

            <p>The main thing you need to understand is that a Windows phone is NOTHING like a Windows PC, despite sharing the same name and visual aspects of the UI. There is NO malware or viruses for Windows Phone or Windows Mobile, as it is now known, not because of
 the small market share but because of the way the OS is structured. Whilst the system architecture is similar to Windows in a modern PC, viruses intended for your PC cannot infect your phone.</p>
<p>The operating system cannot be overwritten by an external program and also nothing can be installed without your knowledge. You can only download apps from the Windows Phone store - there is no such thing possible as "sideloading", "rooting"
 or "jailbreaking". In the Windows Phone Store, the description of every app tells you what data and phone features the app will need to access so you can make an informed decision before downloading whether you want to proceed.<br />

            <p>Thanks a lot 93tid. &nbsp;Your answer helps to explain why people say these phones are so secure. &nbsp;I went online and read about the sandboxing of apps on windows phones that prevents apps from affecting one another as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you control what you install and I know the windows store is "curated" to allow only safe files. &nbsp;Say for argument's sake the prior owner of the phone did install a malicious app. &nbsp;Aside from not being able to affect other apps because
 of sandboxing, a hard reset would also remove apps, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found this on the microsoft answers forum:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">no app can scan the system on windows phone - because they don't have system access. this means an antivirus is pointless, and is also explains why no viruses actually exist for the
 platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So I'm assuming that just hooking up a windows phone to a PC and running an antivirus doesn't do anything? &nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Tenant to tenant 365 migration using IMAP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Tenant to tenant 365 migration using IMAP</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to test migrating a mailbox from one 365 tenant to another 365 tenant. I know there are 3rd party tools that can do this but I would like to attempt using the built-in tools first. From my research I can see people have done this before but they don't
 explain the precise steps they took.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I have is that the account that is being migrated must exist and be licensed in the target tenant first, but how can I achieve this when the domain can only exist in one tenant at once?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the following error:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Error:</span><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">MigrationRecipientNotFoundException:
 A recipient wasn‎'t found for "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" on the target. Create a recipient of the appropriate type for this migration on the target and try again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Hope someone can help!</span></p>

            Hello James,<br />
<br />
I understand what you concerned and I also won’t suggest “exporting/importing PST files” as the best choice. As far as I know, we don’t have a roadmap of a built-in tool&nbsp;for migration between tenants. I suggest you submit feedback via this link:

            <div><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Dependent on your accounts reputation these are the limits</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>The limit for outgoing email messages is 300 (three hundred) messages per day. Maximum 100 per email.</strong><br />
<br />
<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>The limit is lower for new accounts and when Windows Hotmail/ Outlook has spotted what it deems suspicious activity</span></span></span><br />
<span>(a large and sudden increase in outgoing messages may indicate your account has been taken over, for example)</span><br />

<br />
<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>You can add up to 100 (one hundred) recipients per message in Windows Live Hotmail.</em></span></span><br />
<span>Again, suspicious activity can lead to a temporarily lower limit (as low as 10 (ten) recipients).</span><br />
<br />
<span>If you’ve been notified that you have hit some limit on a Microsoft product, it’s almost certainly part of an effort to reduce spam.</span><br />
<span>You can also increase your limit simply by continuing to use the services normally. &nbsp;</span><br />
<span>It only takes a few days of normal activity to increase the limits—that gives us enough time to detect automated spam machines and accounts that have been hacked.</span><br />
<span>We’re constantly working to make things worse for spammers and better for real people.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>The send mail limit depends on your reputation.</strong><br />
<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The system needs a few days to build your reputation.</span></span><br />
<span>So, there are stricter limitations on new accounts or accounts that have engaged in activity that is representative of abusers sending spam.</span><br />
<br />
<span>If you are a new user, a low sending quota is a temporary restriction and is upgraded to the maximum limit as soon as the user establishes credibility in the system.</span><br />
<span>If you are an established user, recent account activity may have sent us a false alert.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Note: Recipients is different from emails - 1 email with 5 recipients' counts as 5 emails, not 1.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>You can raise the limits by getting a one-time verification code sent to your mobile phone.</strong><br />

    <title>External users get an authentication request on every modern page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andhhh  say:</h3>
<h2>            External users get an authentication request on every modern page</h2>
                    <p>When sharing a site in SharePoint Online, an external user receives the invitation e-mail and creates an Microsoft account. They log in successfully to the SharePoint site.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a modern communication site the Home page is loaded together <strong>with</strong> an "Authentication Required" pop-up. For a classic team site the Home page is loaded
<strong>without</strong> the pop-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do users get this <strong>authentication pop-up</strong> in the browser, every time a modern page is reloaded (see picture)? I've created several test sites (different kinds) in the same tenant, with the same result (see example url:s below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge in Windows:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21a8c0be-ee33-4d15-8d34-bccc56ccb358?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21a8c0be-ee33-4d15-8d34-bccc56ccb358?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome on Mac, incognito mode:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1d95c39-0c07-42ec-b933-1e5e22a68ace?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1d95c39-0c07-42ec-b933-1e5e22a68ace?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Examples below with a classic team site 'test-share5'. For some pages one can switch between the modern and classic experience.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>...sharepoint.com/sites/test-share5/SitePages/Forms/ByAuthor.aspx&nbsp;

<p>This issue was posted to the Service Health Dashboard (SHD) as incident SP133540 starting at March 19, 2018, at 12:00 AM UTC. The user experience of this incident is: External users may experience credential prompts or access errors when trying to access
 SharePoint Online sites. Specifically, external users may receive credential prompts when attempting to access the SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business sites.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A suggested workaround is: users can close the credential prompt to access the sites successfully.

<p>I can see that you have input values for the % work complete. Once you do this, MSP will be forced to give the tasks an actual start start date and an actual duration, and what was previously a scheduled start date will become the actual start date. You
 can see this in the tracking table. MSP will not change actuals after you have input them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect (because you haven't mentioned it) that you assigned the predecessors after you input the % work complete, that is, after the start date was locked in. You have forced it to ignore the predecessors, or to put it another way the predecessors can
 no longer have any effect. They are just a decoration at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove the progress. Delete the actual start date, actual duration and actual work in the tracking table. The tasks will all take up their scheduled position according to the predecessors. Then you can re-do the progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help? Fast enough for you?</p>

<p>Hi Trevor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excellent Solution!! Thank you very much, and yes it was fast enough! : )&nbsp; I ran into an issue though where the chart appears to not show the connection/progression it had before. All tasks are now stacked?</p>

 &nbsp;Secondly .. these undeliverable emails are coming to my personal email account through Rogers. &nbsp;This has been happening for awhile. &nbsp;I've changed my email password and it's still happening. &nbsp;How do I get it to stop???</p>

<p>Regarding “they are to people in my contact list”, do you mean the contact list of your Office 365 mailbox?</p>
<p>For further investigation, I have sent you a private message to collect the entire undeliverable message. Please also let us know your Office 365 mailbox address in the private message too. (See

<h2>            Merge &#47; Import .csv &#47; .ics calendar into a &#34;Group&#34; calendar&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So I'm not very hopeful in actually succeeding in this, as I've tried everything I can think of (today, at least. Perhaps when in bed tonight I'll get another bright idea)</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>I have received an exported .csv calendar from a colleague. This calendar needs to be imported to a&nbsp;<strong>Group Calendar</strong>. This group has been created as a few of us are working on a rather large project together, and this one colleague has already
 created really important events stretching from now until May next year on his own personal calendar.</p>
<p>So merging sounds easier said than done - this&nbsp;<strong>Group</strong> has been existing since June, so starting over is&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em> an option.</p>

<p>I've already converted this .csv file into an .ics to give me more options. And yeah I've been successful adding it to 'my calendars' etc. But not to the&nbsp;<strong>Group</strong> calendar.</p>

<p>No sync. No merge. No add. nothing.</p>

<p>Please tell me someone knows what I can do in this regard? I don't like giving up.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Marianne</p>

<p>hi shyamal;</p>
<p>sure thing.</p>
<p>1. yes - their personal calendar has a lot of important events that needs to become part of the "groups" calendar, because all of us need to know what has to happen.</p>
<p>2. after going online to outlook.office365.com, i clicked on the ribbon and chose the "calendar" option. in "calendar" i went down to the&nbsp;<em>groups</em> section and chose to add a new group</p>
<p>:<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=89b5ba52-e40c-43a6-a172-f79f53c64f2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d89b5ba52-e40c-43a6-a172-f79f53c64f2f" /></a></p>
<p>the group name &amp; access / members etc were added.</p>
<p>the members have been using this created group for a while now. most members add events to that calendar and everyone in that group can see it.</p>
<p>now we want to add someone else's calendar into that group calendar &amp; here is where i get stumped as it seems to be a manual process.</p>
<p>3. this colleague exported their outlook calendar into a .csv file. while i was exploring the options in the calendar ribbon in the
<strong>outlook web app</strong>, i noticed i could&nbsp;<em>add a calendar from file</em></p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=df8b73a2-452d-498d-82a5-d402ce03dfcd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3ddf8b73a2-452d-498d-82a5-d402ce03dfcd" /></a></p>
<p>this told me that the file type it would accept is .ics, so i went and converted the .csv into .ics, and managed to import this successfully. however, it was successfully added to one of my&nbsp;<strong>own calendars</strong> and not to the&nbsp;<strong>group's calendar</strong>.</p>
<p>so from here i tried exploring other options.</p>
<p>4. most of the steps are above what i tried. the only other thing i tried was to&nbsp;<strong>share the imported calendar above</strong> with the group, which has it's own email address. however, when attempting this i was told i don't have permission to share
 anything with this group email address. our it manager could not either.&nbsp;</p>

I have bought my Nokia 2610 today and I've got the same problem.<br />
The screen becomes black after 15 seconds.<br />
I have tried to change many parameters of the display menu but I didn't find the way to stop that !<br />
If you found the solution, please tell me !

            How do you mean it blacks out? On the front screen if no button is being pressed for a long time? What do you expect it to do? It saves battery life that way.<br />
<br />
You can turn the sleep mode off in your phone settings, that will stop it going to sleep (obviously)

"We appreciate your inquiry with regard to increasing the backlight timer on your Nokia 2610 phone and can provide the following information.<br />
<br />
most Nokia phones are not manufactured to have the display or keypad lights remain illuminated more than 15 seconds. Pressing the scroll keys on your Nokia 2610 phone should turn the display light back on without exiting any menus.<br />

            So if power saver &amp; sleep mode have no affect on the screen light, just what DO they do on the 2610? I've tried to get customer service to answer this but so far have no response except that they "save battery power". Duh! but how?

<h2>            outlook mobile app does not show calendar entries setup in outlook app on iMAC</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using an iMAC on which I have installed office 365. I have linked my iCAL (MAC) into outlook 365 and this is working fine.</p>
<p>I can see my emails, everything is fine. However, the calendar entries do not sync. When I input a calendar entry on my outlook mobile app it does not appear in outlook installed on my iMAC and vice-versa. The calendar of my office 365 account does sync
 properly. But there seems to be a parameter issue with my iCalendar from MAC.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi Claude.</p>
<p>I totally understand you concern on this issue. To better help you, please confirm the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;For “Outlook installed on your Mac”, does it refer to Outlook for Mac?<br />
2.&nbsp;Does the Outlook mobile App refer to Outlook for Android or Outlook for iOS?<br />
3.&nbsp;How did you configure your Office 365 account in your Outlook mobile App, via “Exchange ActiveSync”, “POP” or “IMAP”?<br />
4.&nbsp;Does the issue persist in the default calendar?</p>
<p>Generally, if we want to sync the calendar, it is necessary to configure the Office 365 account via “Exchange” (user name and password) in all the devices. For more information, please refer to set up Office 365 account in

<p>hi claude.</p>
<p>you can follow up the following picture to identify whether you are configuring your office 365 account via "imap" or "exchange":</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79c80aa1-c07a-41da-8c27-f9c6960c74b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79c80aa1-c07a-41da-8c27-f9c6960c74b5" /></a></p>
<p>if "imap", try deleting this configuration method and use "exchange". (click "office 365" icon or "exchange" icon).</p>

<p>hi claude,</p>
<p>thanks for your update.</p>
<p>as far as i know, it is not feasible to add the shared calendar in mobile outlook app (outlook for ios told in your previous post). there might be some way about adding the shared calendar in mobile outlook app shared by some customers. however, it can cause
 some potential issues according to the report we have received. if so, we can provide limited resource regarding this if any issue occurs. we appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>also, if you have any further concern on outlook for ios, we suggest you contacting the built in app support for dedicated help. when using the in app support:<br />
1. it can take a while for a representative to get back to the user. it is recommended that the user turn on notifications for outlook in order to know when the technician is available.<br />
2. if you don’t have notifications turned on, then when the user opens the app again and goes to support, you should see a response from the technician.<br />
3. it is recommended that the user’s initial question be as fully descriptive as possible of the situation.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e481e60-5964-4a1c-815a-d903b4c7d2b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e481e60-5964-4a1c-815a-d903b4c7d2b9" /></a></p>
<p>on the other hand, if you want to see the shared calendar, try using owa for ios. you can install the app in your app store.</p>

<p>We are running a report from a propietary program that generates the report in Excel.&nbsp; At the moment, the Date is pulling into Excel 2003 as a Text Field.&nbsp; Thus, today's date would be 20100609, but in a text format rather than number or date.&nbsp; Because it's
 a lengthy data list, I'm wondering if there is a way to convert these to a date format - any date format - all together, rather than line by line.&nbsp; We tried selected the column and changing the Cell format but it did not remove the Text designation.&nbsp; Any guidance
 would be helpful.</p>

 Officejet Pro 8500. I can print labels using Word 2003 fine . . . it is just the #10 envelopes. I have gone through a box of envelopes trying different settings. I can change the top setting on the return address and it prints beautifully . . . it is only
 the left side of the return address that is not close enough to the left edge that I cannot print.
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

Try setting a negative left indent for the paragraph used for the return address.

            The addresses are placed on the envelope with the envelope address and envelope return paragraph styles in the current document template. If you add an envelope to a document you can easily modify the envelope return paragraph style to include a negative
 indent as suggested by Doug. Then save that indent as part of the style. <br />
<br />
Note that Word relies more heaviliy on the printer driver to format the document than some other applications and you will probably not be able to print to the edge of the envelope.

<h3> diablodale1  say:</h3>
<h2>            ScheduleJob, WinTask, RestrictPrivilegesScan command line parameters</h2>
                    Microsoft or educated readers, will you please educate me and document the following three command line parameters for
<span>MpCmdRun.exe<br />
<span>MpCmdRun.exe<br />
-ScheduleJob<br />
-WinTask<br />
-RestrictPrivilegesScan<br />
<br />
These three parameters are used on the task that MSE automatically creates if you choose it to schedule a scan for you. However, these parameters are not documented. The EXE doesn't provide help. I have searched this forum and the internet. No one knows.<br />
<br />
I opened a case with Microsoft, after about two weeks back and forth it was escalated to a manager, Chalapathy Naidu, who told me that these were undocumented parameters and that it would require them going to the development team. However, he denied such an
 inquiry to the development team saying, "I need to let you know that we are at a juncture wherein we do not have the sufficient resources to provide you with the information which you are requesting."<br />
<br />

<p>Thanks so much :smileyhappy: . Ok so this is what i did:</p>
<p>I have one signed app:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I first &nbsp;Downloaded through OTA (from the internet): result: I see the key icon on it</p>
<p>2. I then deleted the installaiton and installed the same app through the cable: Result: This time there is no key icon!!!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So whats the deal with the phone? Does it selectively add the key icon as it wishes :smileyvery-happy:</p>

<h2>            Excel is slow when closing files</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>since office 365 was installed on my Notebook I experience problems when closing the excel files. I must mention that I work with very large and complex files (in both number of rows and formulas).</p>
<p>If I have more files open, when I close one of them (no matter the size and even if I choose "Don't save"), excel blocks for a few seconds&nbsp;and sometimes a totally white screen appears.
</p>
<p>Is there any setting that I can do to avoid this?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>From my experience that key sign does not matter, it is unrelated to your decribed issues. What we need is that "something about java". Please, we need that error message word-for-word especially the details!</p>

<p>That Java error indicates a broken JAR file because files (internally required by the app) are missing. Not normal at. Sounds like a broken file structure on your Nokia. I am not aware of any easy fix for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a reset (all that helped nobody, yet). Then, go for a computer and try the Nokia Software Update: Does it offer a firmware update and/or a re-install button? Again since 2007’ models that helped nobody. Anyway, these are the only two things you can try
 before sending your Nokia to a local, but official Nokia Care Point. Those Care Points have tools officially copyrighted only to them. These Care Points
<span>‘refurbish’ the</span>&nbsp;complete firmware which re-creates the file structure.</p>

<h2>            Cannot change default &#34;from&#34; address in Wndows 10 Mail Outlook account on PC.</h2>
                    <p>I set up my new Window 10 PC&nbsp;using an&nbsp;existing email address.</p>
<p>I changed my ISP and made a new&nbsp;@outlook.com email address to prevent having to change email addresses in the future. I successfully changed the default "from" address to my new @outlook.com address in the on line version of Outlook, but I cannot change
 the default "from" address from my old one in my Outlook account in Windows 10 Mail on my PC. When I click on " change account settings" it opens up the on line version of Outlook where I have already succeeded in changing the "from" address.</p>
<p>Emails sent from Outlook on line come from my new @outlook.com address.</p>
<p>Emails sent from my Windows 10 Mail outlook account on my PC (which has the name of my new @outlook.com address) have my old email address in the "from" line, there is no way of changing this, and replies get sent to my old email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently that option&nbsp;is not available in Windows 10 mail app, However I suggest you add that account in Mail app &amp; you can reply to the emails with that email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I suggest you to provide us the feedback through feedback option in mail app, so that developers will try implement in future.</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If by "I suggest you add that account in Mail app" you mean the on line version of Outlook, as I explained previously I have already done that. If you mean the Window 10 mail app, it will not let me add a new account with the @outlook.com address, I get
 the "something went wrong" Error code 0x8000ff ff pop-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posted on the feedback option as you suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you add this to the inability to make additional mail folders, the Window 10 Mail app really is rubbish. Window Vista was better (!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for trying.</p>

    <title>Failure to Migrate Data Microsoft My Phone Data to SkyDrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karim434  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failure to Migrate Data Microsoft My Phone Data to SkyDrive</h2>
                    I have a Windows (6.5) Phone and I write regarding the migration of data from the soon to be defunct Microsoft My Phone website. I have received an E-Mail stating that none of the data I had backed up on the Microsoft My Phone website could be successfully
 migrated to Windows Live SkyDrive and that this will not be attempted again.<br />
<br />
I do not know whether or not I can reply directly to the E-Mail I received and, in the absence of any contact link on the My Phone website, I am forced to&nbsp;post the following query here.<br />
<br />
The covering information for this migration (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2557520) states: "Starting on October 6, 2011, users can request physical media (CD or DVD-ROM) containing all information saved to their My Phone account." I am concerned, however,
 that this will not be possible for the same reason (whatever the reason is) that the data could not be migrated to SkyDrive. Unfortunately, the quoted date upon which such a hard copy can be requested is also the day the My Phone website shuts down, leaving
 no room for uncertainty.<br />
<br />
Please can&nbsp;someone confirm that (in spite of the failure to migrate my data from Microsoft My Phone to WIndows Live SkyDrive) I will be able to order a hard copy on CD or DVD-ROM. I am not concerned that my data is not going to be available on SkyDrive now
 but I do require&nbsp;a hard copy.

            Create a new profile, configure the problem account in new profile and check. If it works fine in new profile then I would suggest you to switch to new profile.
