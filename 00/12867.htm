    <title>Where do downloaded files go&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where do downloaded files go&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so here's what most bothers me about Microsoft Lumia(*) phones: where on earth do downloaded files go?, how can I find them?, use them?, recover them?, delete them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easy example: I'm browsing the web and I download foobar.pdf file; when the download is complete, the phone notifies me that I have no app to open .pdf files. "Hmmm", think I, "then I'll delete foobar.pdf until I install Acrobat Reader." But, oh!, as it's
 virtually impossible to explore the filesystem, there's no darned way of finding foobar.pdf in my phone! It may have sunk to the dark depths of the unknown and mysterious ocean of Microsoft Lumia's filesystem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hmmmm", think I again, "then I'll install Acrobat and, doubtlessly, upon executing the app, foobar.pdf will appear as a candidate file to be opened." But, no. Nothing of the sort. My Acrobat is empty and pure as a virgin. If I want to read foobar.pdf, I'll
 have to download it again and have it stored twice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I now have a phone that has swallowed one foobar.pdf file, which not only can't be accessed, but also takes a part of the scarce storage space that Lumia devices ship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Call me a neurotic, but I suspect that this issue is just another move on the part of Microsoft' for pushing us to use "the cloud", so that they can gather more valuable information about the people, and then sell it to third parties, publicity, governments...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(*) I write "Microsoft Lumia" instead of "Nokia Lumia" because it's about time we stop thinking of Nokia as the good old honest Finnish non-dependent company. For practical matters, Nokia is not a company any more: it's just a brand belonging to Microsoft.
 Hence the radical change in devices manufacturing, in marketing policies, and the dramatic drop in customer support and care. We'd rather erase the word "Nokia" from our brains and substitute it with "Microsoft" for our minds' peace, and for not going through
 continuous disappointments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.: A.m.a.z.i.n.g!!! After writing the above text and submitting the message, I'm spacing out: I get an error report saying that "the message body contains *ndependent, which is not permitted in this community". So, I had to remove that word (*ndependent)
 and replace it with "non-dependent", instead.</p>
<p>What the f****???</p>

            hi mate, sorry to hear of your troubles. i use an app named PDF Reader and never had any such problems, all the PDF files that i downloaded appeared in the "Local" list and i could access them later on, and also delete them by tapping and holding.<br />
<br />
as for there being no file manager, this is inherent to Windows Phone 8, and hasn't given me any grief. then again, i do understand many users preferences to have an open file manager/browser. in this case, you can leave feedback with Microsoft over at

            Hello. Thank you for the hint. I'll try to find and download such app, and give it a try.<br />
Still, my question remains unanswered: where do downloaded files go? Suppose I download a file whose format is rare, or for which there is no app yet. Where will it go?<br />
You're lucky to be so happy without being able to manage your files, but I'm not sure if that's the most common case.<br />
As to leaving feedback to Microsoft, I don't believe in such things. MS knows pretty well what people want. They're in the business for three decades. The thing is, they want to impose on us a way of working, instead of developing the way we want to work. There's
 only one reason, but a ver powerful one, for making me go through the pain of Windows Phone; and that reason is called "Here maps".

            I use PDF Reader Pro, though it is not coming up in the windowsphone.com website.<br />
<br />
<br />
there is another one called a better PDF reader: <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/a-better-pdf-reader/75ccaa96-e827-486c-82d2-fa6676c24a02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
and I also use File Hub: <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/file-hub/eb83936a-6e24-4729-ba17-2100870ec17b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/file-hub/eb83936a-6e24-4729-ba17-2100870ec17b</a><br />
<br />
but just like AH said above, you can tap+hold/delete and find the files if they are there.<br />
<br />
with the PDF Reader Pro: once I download and view a file, it will always show in that reader until I delete it.<br />
<br />
when I download and open a pdf, it gives me the option to open it with a list of the products that I have installed that can view them.

<p>Thank you Ceroberts75! That File hub sounds interesting. I'll download and try it, but I doubt I'll be able to go further than the files I can see when connecting the device to my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, after installing a PDF reader, I'm still facing the same problem: the .pdf file I downloaded prior to installing the pdf reader doesn't show anywhere. That file must be&nbsp;<strong>somewhere</strong>&nbsp;in the filesystem, useless except for taking
 the precious and scarce disk space in the Microsoft Lumia. I hope that someone will agree with me that this is kind of unacceptable. Filesystems should be readable to, at least, some reasonable degree. Is it too much asking to be able to read,&nbsp;<em>at least</em>,
 the "downloads" folder of the web browser?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh my! These Microsoft have taken it too far!&nbsp;:smileyfrustrated:</p>

<h2>            Inking or Draw with Touch functions not working on Surface tablet</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro with Windows 10 upgrade (that was a mistake) and the latest version of Office 365.&nbsp; When I was on the Windows 8 platform and the older version of Office (2013 version) I was able to use the "pen" function and fill in forms that I created
 in Word.&nbsp; Now that the computer upgraded to Windows 10 and the 2016 version of Office 365, (even though I had the automatic upgrades turned off) I can no longer use the Microsoft pen or touch and fill in the forms.&nbsp; Instructions for the 2016 version say that
 I should be able to go to the Draw options and use the "draw with touch" option or go to the "review" tab and click on the "Start Inking" Option.&nbsp; When I try to do what the instructions say,&nbsp; the "draw with touch" option is greyed out and does not function,
 and there is no "start inking" option on the Review tab.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Without the ability to use the inking, or draw with touch option (the old "pen"), I have a useless computer which would be better used as a boat anchor.&nbsp; I posted this question earlier and was told that I needed a computer with the touch screen...but the
 last time I checked, my Surface has this function, so that technician's help was useless.&nbsp; When I pointed this out, a second technician provided a link to the instructions that say to use the "Draw" or "Review" tabs, which I already knew.<strong><em>So,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How do I get the "pen" or "inking" functions back?&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
Is anyone else having these issues trying to get the ability to use the inking or draw with pen functions?&nbsp;&nbsp; And yes, I have the "touch screen" activated in the settings...as I can use
 the stylus to point and navigate on the screen.

</p><p>There's no option to merge two Skype accounts, you can only merge a Skype account to a newly created Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can delete the other account and keep the other one as your main Skype account.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Take note that you need access to the account you want to be deleted to proceed with&nbsp;deleting it. Also, it takes 60 days before your account is totally deleted from the time you marked your account for closure.</p>

    <title>Problem with multiple email accounts set up in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlottewhite3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with multiple email accounts set up in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have three email accounts set up within my Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of these is my personal account - which I want to be the default one, and the one that I "land on" when I first log into Outlook every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been into the Account Settings, and the personal one is indeed set as default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Outlook, upon opening, default "lands" on one of the other mailboxes. If it's early and I'm not paying attention and send an email, I can sometimes not notice that it sent from the wrong mailbox (just because that was the one I "landed" in)</li><li>When people send me calendar invites to my personal email address - they appear in the calendar of a different email account?? (which also happens to be the one that I "land" in when I don't want to!)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that in the Data Files settings, the offending mailbox is set as default, rather than my personal one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when I try to change this - I get an error message saying "Outlook Data Files (.pst) cannot be used when more than one exchange account is configured"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Please bear in mind in your responses, that I am not a tech person - so will need it in plain and simple terms :-) Thanks!)</p>

            This is easy to fix:
<br />&gt;&gt; * Outlook, upon opening, default "lands" on one of the other mailboxes. 
<br />Go to File, Options, Advanced - the start up folder is at the top.
<br />Screenshots, if you need them: <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/developer/how-to-use-outlooks-vba-editor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/developer/how-to-use-...</a>
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; When people send me calendar invites to my personal email address - they appear in the calendar of a different email account??
<br />They are going to the default calendar. This is typical when a data file does not have a calendar folder. If the account is an outlook.com or exchange account, events sent to the address will always go to its calendar. 
<br />
<br /> Go to File, Account Settings, open the account settings dialog. Switch to the data files tab. Which data file is set as default? Is it a pst or ost file?

<p>Thanks Diane!</p>
<p>Problem 1 is now fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the other problem - I have been into the Data Files Tab of the Account Settings and the wrong data file is set as the default. It is an ost file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to change it to the right data file (which is a pst file) but it wont let me - and gives the error message as written in my original question above.&nbsp;</p>

            Sorry I missed that part.  
<br />
<br />What are the email account types? Are the exchange accounts outlook.com or from another exchange provider? 
<br />
<br />What is your Outlook version and build number?  I know some older builds of Outlook 2016 didn't like other data files set as default but that was fixed. I'm able to set a pst as default with 5 exchange accounts in my profile.

<p>Hi Diane</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to answer - but I'm not sure I know the difference, sorry :-0</p>
<p>One is a gmail account (the one I have now set as my default email account). One is an Outlook account. One is set up as part of a school, where I am a governor, via an organisation called klz. No idea what type? Think they might all be Outlook? Have attached
 a screen print below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Outlook 2016. Version 1803. Build 9126.2152.</p>

            look on the Email tab of that dialog - the account types are on the right.  I know gmail is imap - what are the other types?

<h2>            What is purpose of the Sirefef&#47;ZeroAccess Virus&#63;</h2>
                    My computer has the Sirefef/ZeroAccess virus. I know I need to run the kickstart thing, but I have to buy the&nbsp;memory stick first. My question is how does the virus benefit it's maker? Why would they want to invade my computer? Can they view my pictures
 and documents that I have stored on my computer? Can they see the websites I go on? Can they see my passwords? Also, I had Microsoft Security Essentials running on my computer so how did the virus bypass that? &nbsp;I read on one of the comments that someone had
 problems after they downloaded a Java update, I downloaded a Java update also because the computer told me to. Could that have been the virus? I don't even know what Java is but I figured it was something like the windows updates that pop up&nbsp;all the time.
 As you can tell, I'm new to computers and there is a lot that I don't understand.&nbsp;Any info would be greatly appreciated. Pretend you're talking to a 5 year old when you respond so that I will understand it! Thanks!

<p>"<strong>Functionality </strong><br />
The primary motivation of this threat is to make money through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_per_click" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
pay per click</a> advertising. It does this by downloading an application that conducts Web searches and clicks on the results. This is known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_fraud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click fraud</a>, which is a very lucrative business for malware creators.
<br />
<br />
The threat is also capable of downloading other threats on to the compromised computer, some of which may be Misleading Applications that display bogus information about threats found on the computer and scare the user into purchasing
<a href="http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2007-101013-3606-99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
fake antivirus software</a> to remove the bogus threats. It is also capable of downloading updates of itself to improve and/or fix functionality of the threat.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it opens a back door and connects to a command and control (C&amp;C) server, which allows the remote attacker access to the compromised computer. The attacker is then able to perform any number of actions on the computer, and the computer may then
 become part of a wider botnet. <br />
<br />
It is able to achieve the above functions silently as it infects a system driver that acts as a rootkit hiding all of its components on the computer. The threat creates an encrypted hidden volume in the computer's file system where it stores all of its components.
 Not only does it store all of its components in the hidden volume, it can also hide any other malicious software that it downloads onto the computer there as well."</p>

            <p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that Microsoft Edge is not working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you&nbsp;to clear the cache and cookies in Microsoft Edge and check with the results. follow the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open Microsoft Edge Browser and click on the <strong>Hub icon</strong>.</li><li>Now click “<strong>Clear all history</strong>“.</li><li>Now select “<em>Cookies and saved website data</em>” and “<em>Cached data and files</em>” and click
<strong>Clear</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>Also please be informed, the November update for Windows 10 has already been rolled out which you can install using Windows update which is an approximate of a&nbsp;3GB feed over the existing Windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update will play a major role in incorporating new features and improving&nbsp;as well as fixing missing links in performance in Windows 10 which includes core functionalities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users already running Windows 10, you will receive the November update according to your Windows Update settings.

            This is the Insider Preview forum, the build is 11082 as the title and post dates the November TH2 release. So are you suggesting we remove the latest Insider build and go back the previous generally released version?

            <p>Thank you posting this. I am getting issue on the TechNet forum (text editor) with Edge 25.11082.1000.0 the 11082 build version. This helps me understand the issue and I have not been able to work out what was the cause.</p>
<p>The issue I see is the page refreshing when spelling mistakes (thanks you bringing that to my attention) and general corrections to the text, i.e. press backspace. This editor seem more tolerant.</p>

<p>This is the same as I posted early I thought it was only when I use the Insiders, but I guess it is a Edge problem as Google Chrome with the insiders works fine.</p>

<h2>            Make a timestamp sheet of when values are chosen from the Data Validation drop down list</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an excel&nbsp;workbook ("Template") containing a part number, a manufacturer and a serial number that will be filled in using data validation drop down lists (already made). On another excel document ("NCR"), I have sheets dedicated to each manufacturer.
 Once someone fills out all of the information on the&nbsp;"Template" workbook, is there a way to keep track of the part number and serial number that is chosen per manufacturer with a timestamp in the NCR document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking of maybe having a button the user clicks on&nbsp;at the end of the document (in "Template") when they're done filling out the information. When&nbsp;the button is clicked, the serial number, the part number and a timestamp will automatically be added
 to the corresponding manufacturer tab in the "NCR" workbook. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions or know how to do this? Because I am clueless. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, <br />
Sara </p>

If book marks are different, then it will be added to the old book marks. if you are importing the same bookmarks, then the bookmarks will be replaced with the old bookmarks.<br />

<h3> e-mail blues  say:</h3>
<h2>            How does one attach a photo to a &#34;reply&#34; e-mail in Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    In trying to attach a photo to a "reply" e-mail I've clicked on "Attach Files". &nbsp;Rather than giving me a browser window I get the Folders on my C drive. &nbsp;If I then click on the folder that would eventually lead me to the photograph, Outlook then tries
 to load that folder. &nbsp;In this case Windows Photo Gallery.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I open the folder where the photo resides first in a separate window, and then hit "Attach Files" My "C" drive folders open as an option as before. &nbsp;If I ignore these and double click the file name of the photo, then the photo appears in the e-mail
 window, but only the photo which now occupies the whole window where the e-mail had been. &nbsp;I get the same results if I try to "drag and drop" the photo into the e-mail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I navigate through this nightmare? &nbsp;FYI &nbsp;I'm of the same opinion as all the other responders are. &nbsp;Somebody deserves a lot of credit for this classic bone head downgrade to e-mail. &nbsp;You might want to change the name to
<b><i>"LOOKOUT".</i></b></div>

    <title>MS Project Best Practices for Very Large Projects - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the dog  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project Best Practices for Very Large Projects</h2>
                    
<p>I am looking for Best Practices for MS Project (2007, not Server baseed) for very large projects.&nbsp; I have reviewed PMI's Practice Standard for Scheduling, but it was of limited use and I have not yet found a creditable document.</p>
<p>Our current multi-year project schedule was developed by the consultant we hired and does not follow many of our companie's scheduling best practices.&nbsp; Their schedule consists of 24 sub-projects combined into one project weekly (by 20 team leads), which
 results in over 26,000 tasks.&nbsp; There are approximately 175 FTE on the project.&nbsp; The consultant is responsible for the project schedule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our goal is to find generally accepted (or industry - IT)&nbsp;best practices for large projects, which will provide us&nbsp;addtional credibility to get the consultant to make changes in how they develop and update the project schedule.&nbsp; There current scheduling
 process has not met our needs and been one factor in many missed milestones.&nbsp; One person's best practices may not provide much creditability, even though the person is an expert in MS Project and the practices are very, very good.</p>
<p>Topics in question, include but are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not limited to</span>:&nbsp; the best method to progress (update) the schedule, duration vs work hours based, &nbsp;individual vs group resources, resource leveling or not, how to best create
 and update a very large schedule, should actual hours and remaining hours be recorded per task, the best report reports/charts/graphs, how to obtain a high level senior management data/critical path, fixed date constraints, lead/lags, rolling&nbsp;wave or not,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;
 The list is endless.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>THe Dog -</p>
<p>Where to begin..</p>
<p>Generally you are not going to find scheduling standards for "small projects" and "large Projects"... all you will find are best practices or standards that relate to&nbsp;most schedules.&nbsp; You mentioned the PMI Scheduling Standard.&nbsp; Keep your eyes open as a new
 version is hitting the streets for "Exposure" review before the end of the year (I am not allowed to disclose the exact date, but I'd say keep your eyes open on the PMI website). I am on the team that is writing the new version along with 7 of&nbsp;peers from around
 the world.&nbsp; The approach used by PMI (and many others) is "Most Projects Most of the Time" when they address "best practices."&nbsp; The level of rigor applied is only somewhat related to size and complexity.&nbsp; Don't confuse rigor with size.</p>
<p>In particular, I'd go back to the Version 1 of the PMI standard, and also contact the PMI "College of Scheduling".&nbsp;In the PMI standard, I would look at the conformance index items, particaullarly Chapters 4 and 5.&nbsp; I work as a consultant in Project Management&nbsp;(Aerospace
 and HighTech) so my comments are going to be a bit slanted but here goes.&nbsp; I would suggest breaking the schedule into Master and Subprojects for each team lead.&nbsp; Use Physical%Complete as your earned value method, place costed resources in the schedule and
 have a baseline.&nbsp; Save interim plans frequently.&nbsp; Update weekly.&nbsp; Never allow "unfinished work behind you" and also avoid "future actuals" ... you cannot claim anything other than 0% complete on a task unless it has an Actual Start no later than the data date.&nbsp;
 Also, if the task was scheduled to finish "yesterday" then it better be 100% complete or you need a revised finsh date (in the form of remaining duration/work). Resource leveling is probably not worth it, but it is a best practice -- it does help but wakes
 up all&nbsp;sorts&nbsp;of gremlins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your best friends are [Actual Start], [Actual Finish], [Actual Work], [Remaining Work], [Remaining Duration]. If your consultant keys a date into [Start] or [Finish] jump all over him as it creates artificial constraints.&nbsp; Manage Total Slack and Free Float.&nbsp;
 Watch your Schedule Performance Index light&nbsp;a hawk.&nbsp; Date Constraints should not overly constrain the schedule and should only be applied if logic cannot get you the answer.</p>
<p>If you are going to use Resource Leveling, use individual names, not groups. Other than that, it is a personal choice.&nbsp; We use names, not groups.</p>
<p>Unless you are using Proejct Server, recording actuals against discrete tasks is going to slow you down and annoy your team.&nbsp; Take time card information at the work package (or summary task) levels and use that for actuals.&nbsp; You can have a single task for
 each Charge Number (or what ever you call it) that contains only actual costs.&nbsp; You can use that for the Actual Costs and then use the other tasks in the work packages&nbsp; for collecting "anticipated spends" (that is called Planned Value or Budgeted Cost of Work
 Scheduled) and Earned Value (sometimes called Budgeted Cost of Work Performed) --- you get that by using Physical%Complete, having costed resourses, and a real baseline.</p>
<p>Establish a system of Givers and Recievers for hand offs of work between files.&nbsp; Hold those Givers/Recieves under configuration control and keep them as milestones near the top of the file.&nbsp; Make sure no one violates a Giver/Receiver date without management
 permission.&nbsp; It will help you track who is really driving who.&nbsp; I've seen where "Joe" was taken to task for being late when in reality he was executing per his schedule durations but was getting his inputs late from "Carl".</p>
<p>Best reports/charts?&nbsp; We use the standard Earned Value charts from Project and export to Excel.&nbsp; In addition, we use a product called Kidasa Milestones Professional to make "Eye Candy" for the executives.&nbsp; That is perhaps the easiest way to make summary
 charts, etc.</p>
<p>Although my peers will disagree --- use of "Leads" is cause for trouble and typically indicates lack of sufficeint detail planning.&nbsp; I will agree sometimes it is "the easiest way" to get the point understood. Personally, I only implement "Leads" with a sneer
 and a lot of grumbling.&nbsp; But, they are common, and yes I have used them.&nbsp; Fixed Date constraints such as "Must Start On" or "Finish No Later Than" ... oh, no ... run from those.&nbsp; Consider using Deadline Dates and monitor Total Slack.</p>
<p>I have a couple of papes on my blog.&nbsp; You may find two areas of interst: (1) What %Complete Should I be? , and (2) Predecessor and Successor Relationships.</p>
<p>Make sure you have the ability to group your project by various phases, etc.&nbsp; That means you will need various numbering schemes in the schedule for sorting.&nbsp; On that is highly recommended is something called "Integrated Master Plan/Integrated Master Schedule
 (IMP/IMS)"&nbsp; It deals with Program Events, Significan Accomplishments, and Accomplishment Criteria.&nbsp; It is imposed on US Government Defense contracts for the past several years.&nbsp; It is tight, and seems to work OK for reporting towards events.</p>
<p>Rolling Wave.&nbsp; That will probably be a necessessity.&nbsp; We require detail plans for 90 days, planning packages after that.&nbsp; That assumes Weekly status.&nbsp; Use of Rolling Wave creates its own set of problems as it essentially sends the critical path through "summary
 tasks" and plays havoc with baselines and resource leveling.</p>
<p>What else, off the top of the gray hairs on my head... all tasks shall have a predecessor and successor, no logic or resources on summaries... tasks&nbsp;should be about the same duration (and usually not more than two reporting periods).&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may want to visit my website and see if you can gather anything else.&nbsp; You will also find my contact information there.</p>

<br />Is the computer on the corporate network? If so, the admin can change the password.

<p>We don't have a corporate network, it was set up with a Microsoft account. I do have another Windows profile and Microsoft account that I use, but the old employee's profile is the administrator for the computer so even though I'm using another account,
 I still need his admin password to download anything. Unless there's something else I'm missing?</p>

            And you don't have the admin password? If you have the admin password, you can make your account an admin. 
<br />
<br />Are you able to log into the desktop used by the admin account? (Using a pin) If so, open Control panel &gt; User Accounts and change  your  windows profile to an admin account.

<br />If you can';t get in at all, you need to recover/reset the pc.

<h2>            Array Constant in Forumla returning &#35;VALUE&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to use the DCOUNT function</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This works:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=DCOUNT($F$1:$G$285,"LifeCycle",$L$1:$M$2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>L1:M2 contains:</p>

<p>NorthEast&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This the above formula works.. If I try to hard code the array using an array constant:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=DCOUNT($F$1:$G$285,"LifeCycle",{"SortOffice","LifeCycle";"NorthEast",4})</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get an error #VALUE.</p>

<p>Yes I used CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER after putting in the foumula in the Fx box so that the fx shows up as</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all Database functions i.e. DSUM, DCOUNT etc, the last input has to be a range only.&nbsp; Looks like you want to solve your problem without using ancillary cells.&nbsp; If that indeed is that case, then try this alternative</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT(($F$2:$F$285="North East")*($G$2:$G$285=4))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Thanks for pointing me in the correct direction. Your formulae returned errors but changing it to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT(--($F$2:$F$285="North East")*--($G$2:$G$285=4))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worked. Now, if someone can point me to a discussion on the use of "*" and "--" and how they are used and in what formulas that would be great.</p>

<p>There should&nbsp;not be a need to use both * and - in the formula.&nbsp; Try this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT(($F$2:$F$285="North East")*($G$2:$G$285="4"))</p>

    <title>MS takes over my machine&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baffledguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS takes over my machine&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My anti-virus program expired on one machine-a different subscription supports this machine.&nbsp; I tried to use the expired machine to do some word processing on the local machine.&nbsp; Shortly after I opened the document to work on it I got a blue box with white
 type telling me my subscription had expired and offering me two choices-uninstall it to rely on windows defender, or renew it.&nbsp; I cannot make the popup disappear, I could not even get the window shut down popup to appear.&nbsp; I just powered off in disgust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be traveling for the next month and will not be using that machine at all during that time, so I wanted to wait til I got back to renew the subscription.&nbsp; But it seems MS is holding the machine hostage, prohibiting me from working locally until I
 meet its demands to comply with virus protection.&nbsp; That is totally ridiculous.&nbsp; What gives MS the right to totally disable my machine?????? &nbsp;</p>

<div>I had already been notified my virus protection was going to expire (webroot) than today got notice it had expired.&nbsp; I closed that and went on to my documents. The popup in question said I could either remove my expired virus protection and then windows
 defender would protect me, or I could renew my subscription.&nbsp; There were two clickable boxes one for each choice.&nbsp; It is possible that some malware detected the anti virus had lapsed and the two choices were in fact bait to a malware site.&nbsp; I had not thought
 of that.&nbsp; The popup did not look as "scary" as most scams urging me to click here or there. I had not opened a browser, just Word, so if it was malware it would have had to be lurking on my system waiting for the antivirus to expire.
<div>I did not use the webroot removal tool since I did not want to bother to remove the program b/c I will re-enroll in it in a month.
<br />
Since I could not get the machine to respond after the popup appeared I could not take any screen shots.

<p>I can't comment on the popup without seeing it. I would suggest you contact Webroot and explain the popup to them to see if they are aware of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not use the computer until you either run the removal tool, (Webroot will still install in a month without issue).
<em><strong>Windows Defender will not protect you unless you use the removal tool</strong></em>.

</p><p>If you had something "lurking" on your computer, then why pay for Webroot at all? All I use id Windows Defender and an occasional scan with Malwarebytes just for good measure.</p>

            &nbsp;I know Defender will not operate if there is another anti-virus on the machine.&nbsp; This is one reason why I thought the popup was MS "trying to be helpful" by telling me Defender would step in only if I removed my old program.&nbsp; Thanks for trying to help

<h2>            The Hotmail spam filter has recently gotten far too aggressive</h2>
                    <p>Almost everything that is being mishandled is stuff that some people would have no doubt reported as spam.&nbsp; If I had to guess it is checking the community reports of spam before checking my filter rules.&nbsp; I have a folder for promotional emails that I **do**
 want and a bunch of rules set up to send the stuff there--yet I'm finding stuff that matches the rules going to spam instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we get a snail-mail from Humana because supposedly my e-mail address isn't working--yet I've read at least a dozen e-mails today, the address certainly is working.&nbsp; All I can figure is that you are rejecting them immediately.&nbsp; I have also had that problem
 with **one** e-mail from NewEgg--the promotions come through fine but one containing a license code absolutely refused to, it wouldn't even go to spam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does it take to get this filter fixed???</p>

    <title>Office 365 Proplus on an RDS server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andyolsonht  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Proplus on an RDS server</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know a million people have asked about what is allowed to be installed on a RDS server. I provide 3rd party IT for businesses and I'm trying to get a definitive answer. I have two customers that I have installed Office365 ProPlus on for shared activation
 using this article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deploy-Office-365-ProPlus-by-using-Remote-Desktop-Services-af9d7621-8c2c-4181-84b4-27778b1e7920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Deploy-Office-365-ProPlus-by-using-Remote-Desktop-Services-af9d7621-8c2c-4181-84b4-27778b1e7920</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, in the link below that was only updated a couple month's ago on technet, it includes this line:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">8</span><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">&nbsp;Office
 365 ProPlus is supported on user-dedicated virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI). Office 365 ProPlus only supports Remote Desktop Services (RDS) when purchased through a Volume Licensing Program.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I contact Tech Data to purchase licensing, they say that E3 is ok. Other places, I've read that it's ok as long as you have ProPlus whether that is E3 or Pro plus. I don't want to buy Volume Licensing if I don't have to. I'm not using VDI, so does this
 statement mean that I can't use Office365 for RDS licensing? Is the article wrong? Can we get Microsoft to fix this or pitch in with a definitive answer?</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your sharing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can deploy Office 365 ProPlus by using Remote Desktop Services as long as you have an Office 365 plan that includes Office 365 ProPlus. And for the eighth item of Note in

            Hi
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues with Skype! My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor Specialist on Microsoft. We are experienced users who assist the Support Staff by helping out fellow users in the community. 
<br />
<br />This issue has been discussed in Microsoft user forums (<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/how-do-i-know-if-i-have-been-blocked-on-skype/64e690ac-46f6-48f1-9c2e-f178a205b907">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum...</a>). 
<br />
<br />Eventhough there is no direct way to see it, 
<br />- if you can see that person is "online" or last seen as "4 hours ago", you have not been blocked. 
<br />- if the person suddenly goes from x hours ago to "seen days ago" it most likely means that you have been blocked. This is because normally "seen days ago" means the person did not come online for more than 6 days, so if it happens suddently, it's a sign that you may have been blocked. 
<br />
<br />Hope this clarifies! 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great weekend! 
<br />Margarida

            Hallo Dhena,
<br />i am Azzurra ,an Independent Advisor.I am at your disposal to solve the problem.
<br />
<br />From what you have described to me it not seems that the contact has  blocked you
<br />
<br />If you see his picture on the profile the contact has not blocked you.
<br />
<br />If the contact blocked you ,you'll see a question mark next to the photo of your contact.
<br />
<br />If you see the message "This person did not share his details with you " to confirm definitively that you have been blocked or deleted on Skype by that user.
<br />
<br />Nice to Help you
<br />Azzurra

    <title>Reinstalling Windows Feedback, Alt Tabbing and Other Miscellany - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reinstalling Windows Feedback, Alt Tabbing and Other Miscellany</h2>
                    <p>Hey I'm wondering if you can implement a way to reinstall the feedback app? Maybe include it in the windows store?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also can you please make alt tabbing less awkward. As it stands it flashes the the preview screen each time and it's very jarring and almost painful on the eyes. In 8 it simply would switch from program to program, please return this if the input is fast
 enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also can you remove the ugly colored boxes around icons when alt tabbing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly can you add an option to remove the shortcut icon from desktop shortcuts like can be done with windows ultimate tweaker so I don't have to use this program anymore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: It seems it is still possible to tab without the flash but the timing requires near perfection and is difficult even for my fast fingers with a mechanical keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
