<h2>            Gears of war 4 install problem</h2>
                    So i had to upgrade to the lastest version of windows 10 to even Install Gears of War 4 because the install button was greyed out. that's all fixed and it lets me click install the game requires 80gb free space. i choose my drive with 250gb free space
 click Install and the store just closes and nothing happens at all. am i doing something wrong here or is this just a bug? below is a image of what it looks like. as i said i click install then the store app simply closes and nothing else happens. have tried
 restarting. and my drive has 250gbs free space. so that's not the problem.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49c799e3-ab9d-4406-89e2-17668a9cccb3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49c799e3-ab9d-4406-89e2-17668a9cccb3" /></a>

<h2>            Cyberlink PerfectCam Cannot be Uninstalled</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need your help. I just downloaded the Cyberlink PerfectCam yesterday. After trying it out, I decided to uninstall it. However, whenever I try to uninstall it, a different item appears in the uninstall pop up window. It's a Microsoft app/software. So I
 couldn't proceed because it doesn't show up the Cyberlink itself. What should I do then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I observed today that when I tried to scan the Cyberlink PerfectCam with the Windows Defender, I received a notification that
<em>Items skipped during a scan</em>, "The Windows Defender Antivirus scan skipped an item due to exclusion or network scanning settings." How was the item excluded from scanning? Can someone help me understand what's happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

But I wanted all the add ons from my old laptop so I just transferred them manually<br />
They did not work and the game messed up so I uninstalled the game<br />
Now when I try to install it again it says 1628: Failed To Complete Installation <br />
I tried all the solutions I found online but nothing works and most of them seem to be for windows 7<br />
I also tried a lot of registry cleaners but nothing works<br />

            Hi VladKalugin,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
From your issue description I understand that you are unable to install Microsoft Flight Simulator X on Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
Could you please answer the following questions so that I can help you in a better way.<br />
1. What troubleshooting steps have tried to resolve this issue?<br />
2. Which add-ons are you referring to?<br />
3. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
Now let’s try some steps for resolving this issue, which I have described as methods given below.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method1:<br />
</strong>You may rename the Install Shield folder.<br />
Follow the steps to rename the Install Shield folder.<br />
a. In Windows Explorer or in My Computer, open the following folder: <br />
DRIVE \Program Files\Common Files\<br />
b. Right-click the Install shield folder, and then click Rename.<br />
c. Type InstallShield1, and then press ENTER.<br />
d. Try to install the game.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> If the above steps fail then you may install the game in a clean boot state.<br />
Perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps given in the link below to start the computer in clean boot.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: After performing clean boot refer to the article<strong> How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot
</strong>to boot to normal mode.</div>
<div><br />
If the issue still persists then contact flight simulator technical support. </div>
<div>Refer the link.<br />

            <p>Hi Lynn,</p>

<h2>            No port &#40;com 1&#41; driver</h2>
                    Hi all. Screwed up and could use your help please. I had a yellow flag on communications port (com1). Right clicked to update driver but box opened stating no drivers available. Tried with XP disc and IBM driver disc with no success. As a last resort i
 decided to roll back the driver. Big mistake as it gave me driver #5.1.2600.0 from 2001. Needless to say that task bar and desktop are waaay out of whack. I had to increase font and icon sizes but still missing 25% of my screen on either side. Any help would
 be appreciated. &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks

<h2>            Install Windows 7 upgrate to Windows Vista</h2>
                    I am trying to install a window 7 upgrade to windows vista for a dvd I purchased online from the windows store.<br />
During the "gathering file, settings and programs" phase of installation, the install program hung.&nbsp; I called Microsoft support and they told me to cancel the installation and restart the computer.&nbsp; I did this, and then started the installation over again.&nbsp;
 This time it hung at the Expanding Windows files phase (at 21%) with a "please wait gathering additional information before expanding files" After waiting an hour and a half, I tired to cancel the installation but I get a warning message that says "Setup cannot
 be canceled at this point.&nbsp; Doing so could leave Your computer in a potentially unusable state." There is no activity on my computer, and no read write lights flasing. I called microsoft support again,&nbsp; with a case number, but was told they were closed after
 9:00 PM PDT.&nbsp; So here I am with a hung install program and I can't do anything until tomorrow.&nbsp; I wish to say that I ran the windows upgrade advisor and was cleared for the upgrade install of Windows 7.&nbsp; I uninstalled all the programs and features that were
 suggested by the compability phase during the first stage of install.&nbsp; I am installing from a disk, not a download.<br />
what do I do?

<h2>            InstallShield 1628&#58; Failed to complete Install</h2>
                    Hey there, I was recently trying to install an older "Made for Windows" game off the CD when this error popped up, as of yet not found the solution to fixing it. It would seem that the "InstallShield" folder is missing from the Program files directory
 all together. Also when using the command prompt there are no errors. Is there a "InstallShield Reinstallation" available? Is there a way to reinstall Installshield? What other options are there?&nbsp;

<p>Hey there, Thank you for your quick reply.</p>
<p>After using the first link you gave me, Option 1 -&nbsp;<span><strong>Method 1: Rename the InstallShield folder</strong><span> - The InstallShield Folder itself is missing from my computer completely unable to be found. Option 2 -&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>Method
 2: Download and install the latest Windows Installer package</strong><span> - Latest Windows Updates all taken care of "no change", this one was confusing as once you go to the link that Microsoft has its extremely convoluted on what you need as it
 does not give you criteria on "which" of the "8" different downloads is yours. Option 3 -&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>Method 3: Locate and then close the files</strong><span> -&nbsp;</span></span><strong>idriver.exe</strong><span>

<p>Windows errors are often misleading when dealing with game, which can lead to a lot of messing around for nothing.
</p>
<p>Windows often tosses out an error regarding something that is indirectly related to, but not necessarily the source of the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The name of the game is more often the main lead in determining the cause of the problem, and what can be done to fix it.<br />
btw -The <em>Games for Windows</em> tag is meaningless, unless you own a Mac. This tag was introduced way back at a time when</p>
<p>MS seems to have paid game developers to make their XBOX controller the default controller in PC games.</p>
<br />
<p>- While it's not important with old games it's also a good idea to post the brand and model graphics processor and cpu
</p>
<p>your machine uses when dealing with games.</p>

            Although I already tried the above, the solution I found that works is, if I shutdown the PC completely and then back on sound returns to my headphones, but if I restart the PC sound goes back out. So I just shutdown the PC and the back on when needed.
 Thanks for your help anyway. :)

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you be more specific about shutdown and restart...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you shutting using the Power button on your computer or the Shutdown button in Windows...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I ask is that <span>Win 8 has a new feature called Fast Startup. It can sometimes cause problems like you mention as well as others.</span></p>
<p>The easiest way to tell if this is the problem is to turn it off and see what happens.</p>
<p>This feature only works when you do a SHUTDOWN and then Boot.</p>
<p>It doesn't effect a RESTART.</p>
<p>To turn it off or on...</p>
<p>Go to Control panel...Power Options, and select Choose What the Power Buttons Do on the left.</p>
<p>Then select Change Settings That Are Currently Unavailable near the top center of screen...</p>
<p>Lower down on the window, uncheck Fast Startup.</p>
<p>This may or may not help your problem, but is easy to check.</p>
<p>If this resolves the problem, then you can investigate what isn't loading properly.</p>

            <p>Sure,&nbsp; I use&nbsp;the shutdown button in Windows,&nbsp;when I hit the power button in Windows and select restart, it boots with no sound to my headphones. When I hit the&nbsp;power button in Windows and select Shutdown, my sound returns to my headphones on boot.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to look for what is loading when you use a Restart... </p>
<p>Even though you have no sound, everything is loading properly for the manner in which you have your settings.&nbsp; Whether you set them or by default...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally what happens when you use Fast Start is that something DOESN'T get loaded properly...</p>
<p>This basically means that there is something that is loading with a restart that is causing the problem...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not real sure how to go about isolating the problem though...</p>

<h2>            Call of Duty&#38;&#35;174&#59;&#58; Ghosts - Xbox Pack &#40;received redeem code from MS but it&#38;&#35;39&#59;s for Xbox 360&#41;</h2>
                    
<p><span>So I (well my Dad actually) orders COD for Xbox One from Microsoft Store, using the pre-order e-mail from MS that promises a $10 store credit (received that, no problem) and some
 DLC. The DLC is called "Call of Duty®: Ghosts - Xbox Pack" and the e-mail promised a "player patch, reticle and weapon camo".&nbsp;December 5th the code e-mail arrives and I'm waiting waiting for Christmas Day. The Day arrives and after updating everything I set
 out to&nbsp;redeem various codes. </span></p>
<p><span>Only one problem: This one is stuck in my "Download Queue" (according to&nbsp;xbox.com) waiting to download to my&nbsp;xbox 360. But I don't have that console. I have the One. How do I get
 the&nbsp;Xbox One version of this DLC? Microsoft Store support sent me to Xbox Support, Xbox Support sent me to Activision (even though this is a MS promotion). And Activision's Web site&nbsp;can't talk to&nbsp;IE on Win8.1 (even in Compatibility Mode).
</span></p>
<p><span>Thoughts/feelings/solutions? Has anyone installed this particular DLC on their One?</span></p>

<p>You can forget about getting it...period!!! I l somehow lost my pre order riley from in game. Just started playing one day and &nbsp;noticed the riley character was gone (had him on the xbox 1) and MS done the same to me by sending me to Activision....I just
 reviewed my case again, it's been open for a month now, and they can't find or fix the problem. I keep getting, "we're looking into it"...As for the code you have "in the system", it's gone forever and Activision will tell you what they told me, "We don't
 have any codes for the game"...LMAO, their own game, and they don't have any and can't get any codes!!! Trust me, I've tried with MS, Activision, IW and Call of Duty....Your code is gone and you're not getting a new one....Looks like that's two of us in the
 same boat....Welcome aboard my friend...</p>

<p>This happened to me as well. I pre-ordered the Xbox One version from the Microsoft Store. I received the $10.00 credit and redeemed it with no problems. Got the code for the personalization pack on December 5th.Tried to redeem the code on my Xbox One console
 and it says only good for the 360 version.</p>
<p>I tried contacting the Microsoft Store support and they tell me to contact Xbox support. Well I contacted Xbox support and if you guessed that they told me to contact the Microsoft Store you'd be correct. I know it is just a weapon skin, reticule, and player
 patch, but still it was part of the promotion they had. Kinda disappointing. </p>

<p>Amillie, there's nothing that can be done about that. It has already been stated that singular Map Packs will not carry over, whereas the Season Pass will. You're S.O.L.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 wont reactivate after motherboard change. Version changed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 wont reactivate after motherboard change. Version changed</h2>
                    <p>Hello, this is odd, and after getting hung up on by Microsoft's International Technical Support, I'm pretty fed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Win7 Ultimate on a MSI motherboard, with an AMD fx-6300 processor. </p>
<p>Its old, slow, so I picked up a new motherboard and a new Ryzen5 CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Ryzen 5 doesnt support win7, and the new motherboard for the Ryzen is win10 ready, so I purchased
<strong>Windows 10 Home</strong> from the microsoft store onine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Per microsoft's advice:</p>
<p>I downloaded it.</p>
<p>I installed it. </p>
<p>I made a microsoft account and linked the activation key to it.</p>
<p>I activated windows 10 home. </p>
<p>In the activation screen it it said "This product has been activated via electronic blah blah... via the account"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great. Thrilled. Microsoft Rocks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I replaced the motherboard, cpu, video card, and ram, and powered the machine up.
</p>
<p>Machine boots up beautifully.</p>
<p>I updated the Drivers for the new motherboard. </p>
<p>I updated the drivers for the new video card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As expected, Windows would not activate because of the hardware changes, so I ran the activation troubleshooter, but it fails and tells me to go by a legitimate copy of windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thats when I see, that now it says <strong>Windows 10 Pro</strong>. I didnt download pro. i didnt pay for pro. I downloaded Home right through the reciept email I recieved with my product key that worked a few hours ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made several calls to Microsoft Customer Support. </p>
<p>One sent me a text, hung up, and the link in the text forwarded me back to the activation tool instructions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>not at all helpful. </p>
<p>
</p><p>when I typed in that my problem was not resolved, I activated the callback feature, as microsoft says, "As a conveniece so I wouldnt have to wait on hold". They called right away,
<strong>then put me on hold</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>That person couldnt help me. My problem is apparently off script.</p>
<p>I called the tech support number he gave me (the number i called in the first place) where the next tech support told me to perform the following"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hit Win-R</p>
<p>Type "SLUI 4" and &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>nothing happens. the run box just closes. </p>
<p>when I told him for the 3rd time that nothing happens, he asked "Did you recieve a product key?"</p>
<p>I answered "Yes, but..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I was cut off by the customer service satifaction survey becasue he <strong>
HUNG UP ON ME</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do? I can't activate this thing, becasue I have a Windows 10 Home key, and this thing mystically is trying to sel me a PRO key for another $200??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>
</p><p>TX9XD-98N7V-6WMQ6-BX7FG-H8Q99 is a temp install key for win 10 home, you might try it but my understanding is you cant downgrade Pro to Home - it needs a fresh install from booted thumb drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During install you would select your Home edition &amp; will have the oppertunity to enter your home key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally a win7 ultimate licensed install, if upgraded - it would magically upgrade to win10 pro.&nbsp; The installer contains Home &amp; Pro &amp; now education too I think.</p>
<p>If you downloaded the insider version, there are two web pages, the advanced page will not give you home unless you go with the next 1903 build 18343.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />To reactivate W10 after hardware change,
<br /> you need 
<br />- to perform a clean install on the new PC 
<br />- to install exactly the same edition of Windows as on the old PC 
<br />- to connect on the new PC with your Microsoft account and Windows 10 will be automatically activated via the digital licence linked to your Microsoft account. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 10 is still not activated, 
<br />Select the Start  button &gt; Settings  &gt; Update &amp; Security  &gt; Activation
<br />Then select Troubleshoot.
<br />If the troubleshooter can’t resolve the issue, you’ll see a link to reactivate after a hardware change. Select it to follow this path. 
<br />For more info, see the article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530</a>

            Hi,
<br />you may either buy new Windows 10 Pro license or reinstall Windows 10 Home. I suppose the second variant is better.  Unfortunately there is no way to downgrade Pro to Home.
<br />Please be careful installing apps and following recommendations from Internet - you did something wrong before, Windows itself cannot upgrade from Home to Pro.

    <title>I bought a new 250GB HDD and now my XBOX Original games don&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dudacles17  say:</h3>
<h2>            I bought a new 250GB HDD and now my XBOX Original games don&#39;t work when I mount it onto my 360...</h2>
                    
<p>Right, so I ordered a 250GB HDD off of Amazon. I checked the label and everything and it appears to be an official one, licensed by Microsoft. So I started transferring my saves and stuff from my 20GB HDD to my 250GB one through use of USB sticks (yes, I
 know it's dumb and ineffective but I couldn't for the life of me get my XBOX to recognise the transfer cables that I got with it.) Everything got transferred over just fine, with the exception of my XBOX original saves. When I tried to transfer those, the
 XBOX told me that I couldn't because of licensing issues.<br />
<br />
Well, I thought nothing of it at the time, figuring that I'd simply be able to put in the games and start over. It wouldn't be that big a deal. However, upon trying some of the games that I had recently downloaded (Max Payne, Stubbs the Zombie and Black), they
 all came up with a message that said that the XBOX was unable to boot up the game, and that I had ought to redownload them. So I did. This yielded no better results. I figured that it had to do with licenses that hadn't been transferred over. Having the profile
 that's attached to the licenses connected to XBOX LIVE while playing should have fixed this like it does with XBLA games, or so I thought.<br />
<br />
Well, I tried putting in a disc-based XBOX original as well, and that didn't work either. Halo 2 gave me the exact same message, telling me to "try downloading it again." It's
<i>on a ******* disc.</i> What the hell? Discs don't have licenses associated with them, unless this is some new anti-used game sales ploy by Microsoft that I was as of yet unaware of.<br />
<br />
<b>So, bottom line</b>: I bought a new HDD. I am unable to transfer XBOX original saves between my old and new HDDs, and when I mount my new HDD onto my XBOX, none of the original XBOX games, be they downloaded or disc-based, work anymore. Everything else works
 to perfection. I assume the licenses come into it somehow, but I am always online when I boot these games up.<br />
<br />
Any help? Does anyone know how I might be able to fix this?</p>

<br />
It does sounds like it is not an official MS HDD, I might be wrong but given the fact neither xbox original discs or downloads work it points towards that.<br />
That would also explain why the transfer cable did not work.<br />
<br />
If you get no other suggestions I would recommend phoning support on Monday morning.<br />

<p>Yeah, it seems it's a fake. It's a very elaborate fake though: aside from the fact that hologram sticker does not have that same "depth" effect that the official HDD's sticker does, my 20GB and counterfeit 250GB are indistinguishable. I got it from Gadgetgear,
 a UK-based retailer that sells through Amazon.co.uk. Their reviews were very positive for the most part but there was one lone review that stated in all caps "THEY SELL FAKE STUFF." I suppose I should've listened to that guy. Ah well, guess I'm putting down
 more money to buy an official one from a brick-and-mortar retailer. That way, at least, I'll know for sure what I'm getting into.</p>

<h2>            How to get minecraft back</h2>
                    <p>I uninstalled my minecraft xbox one edition and now i cant find the game anywhere to install it again. This shouldnt happen considering i bought the game and have already redeemed the code. The only minecraft version the xbox says it has is minecraft live, which is a terrible version of the game. I just want my game that i payed for back.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately if you got the Better Together update there is no way to go back to the old version of the game.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for coming to the Xbox forums. A quick search of this game shows that there have been no new developments or announcements released from the developers for quite a long time. There is no relevant information found about this game
 in 2019. You'll need to contact the developers for a release date or an update in development because I doubt there is anyone on these forums who will have that answer.</span></p>

            <p>I don't believe you can directly from Microsoft. As long as it is HDMI certified and is capable of 18Gbps, you should be fine with a non-OEM cable.</p>

</p><p>Hey there</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just go too a local store and you can get a HDMI cable very easy. I would advise you look for a cable thats 4k certified for the xbox one X

<h2>            HOW TO DOWNGRADE TO WINDOWS XP&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have just purchased a new computer with Windows 7 Home Premium&nbsp;installed.</p>
<p>Most of my programs which I used on my old computer with Windows&nbsp;XP do not work on my NEW Windows 7 computer.</p>
<p>Also my Epson Perfection 1260 Scanner will not work on my NEW Windows 7 computer.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can downgrade my NEW computer to Windows XP so that I can use my existing Software and Scanner?</p>

<p>Hello James Owen Skinner,</p>
<p>If you are concerned that your Windows XP software will not work with Windows 7, there are many places to find that information before you purchase a Windows 7 computer. Microsoft provide a Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor you can run on your older computer that
 will provide a report on whether programs may be compatible. Click here for a link to the Windows 7 Compatibility Center. Microsoft makes every effort to upgrade this site but you still may want to go the software manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Click <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here to download the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor</a>. However, in your case that will no longer help you as you would have needed to run it before your system crashed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Compatibility tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the compatibility is not successful, then try and run</span><span>the</span><span> Program Compatibility troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the<span>Start</span> button.</span></p>
<p><span>Then click <span>
Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type <span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click<span>Troubleshooting</span>. Under
<span>Programs</span>, click<span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something
 similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you run Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate version, install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP mode (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</span></a>)
 and execute your software in Windows XP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.virtualbox.org</span></a>) or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.vmware.com</span></a>)
 or any other 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party virtualization software and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose.<span>You can find virtualization software free of charge that will run on Windows
 7 Home Premium.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Hope this helps with most of your questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
