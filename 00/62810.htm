<h2>            CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED After update to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Updated to Windows 8.1 on our Media Computer.&nbsp; However, ever since the update installed I have not been able to get a successful boot.&nbsp; The cycle is (and has been from once the installation completed):</p>
<p>Power on Computer, Blue Screen - Crash - CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED - Restart</p>
<p>(repeat)</p>
<p>After&nbsp;it repeats the attempt to start normally, it restarts and boots up in Automatic Repair.</p>
<p>There, none of the options work either:</p>
<p>-- Advanced Options -&nbsp;Troubleshoot:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Refresh = "Insert your Windows Installation or recovery media to continue"&nbsp; This was an update through the Windows Store.&nbsp; My Windows 8 recovery drive (created from an non-updated different computer) is not recognized since it is still Windows 8.</p>
<p>- Reset = the same message as above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubleshoot - Advanced Options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- System Restore = No restore points created.&nbsp; System Restore is available only in online operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- System Image = No System Image</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Startup Repair... Attempting Repairs...&nbsp;= Startup repair couldn't repair your PC (created log file)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Booted to Safe Mode and attempted:</p>
<p>- Refresh - "Insert Media - Some files are missing.&nbsp; Your Windows installation or recovery media will provide these files" - but this was an update through the Store.&nbsp; No installation media.&nbsp; Never had successful boot to create recovery media.&nbsp; Windows 8
 media "not valid"</p>
<p>- Restart - same message.</p>
<p>- System Restore - "You're running Windows in safe mode..."</p>
<p>- Windows Update&nbsp; - ...just spins and spins</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have updated my bios firmware (Intel DG45ID) to the most current available.</p>
<p>I have confirmed that my graphics driver is updated and on the Windows 8.1 supported list (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn344644.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn344644.aspx</a>) - Intel&nbsp;GMA 4500/X4500
 WDDM 1.1 x86, x64&nbsp;8.15.10.2702</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uploaded my minidump and startup log files to: <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=3CBA8086CC7FA05!320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=3CBA8086CC7FA05!320</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is frustrating to learn that this "update" can not be rolled-back.&nbsp; Without installation media it is difficult to restore.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Windows 8 installation&nbsp;was a downloaded upgrade from XP last year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your assistance</p>

            <p>I love how both these suggestions start off with "After you boot your computer" when the questioner has made it perfectly clear that the PC won't boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems typical of Microsoft: offering "support" without even reading the problem.</p>

            <blockquote>I have the same problem. &nbsp;After Windows 8.1 got an official update and installed I could not log into OS and BSOD appears with the aforementioned error message. I tried both methods and searched through the internet to find
 a cure! But it seems there is no way except installing a fresh copy of windows.It is a real issue that needs an urgent solution.

<p>This problem was solved by installing an updated version of windows 8.1 . The last update works like a charm.</p>

            Well - same problem with 8.1 suddenly without any update done! But after reboot it just shows my desktop and no Win 8 i available. Furhter it will not let me open a browser to create the repair that you recommend as I don't have a disk (win 8 was preinstalled
 on the laptop)

<p>Does anyone else think, that Microsoft should unlock the original Xbox content, for the Xbox 360 to use...??</p>
<p>The Content is on the Game Disc, waiting to be unloacked &amp; all it needs, is a file like the Optional Media Update to unlock them...</p>
<p>The DLCs were only 100-200kb&nbsp;&amp; that is too small, for a whole Multiplayer map or content...&nbsp;The Main file is on the disc....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things were clever in those days, now they're fat. &nbsp;Everquest Online Adventures was a great example of clever in this way, more or less any amount of expansion could be made to the game world, it was designed well but it was implemented before hard disk
 drives were commonplace in consoles so you needed a disk to trigger the expansion but by the same principle all of the content was already there eupemistically on the other side of a mountain pass you could only see one side of until the expansion was triggered.

 big was your Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge DLC..??[/quote]The DLC is listed as being the following size:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Firebrand - new multiplayer mode airplane. 66 blocks<br />
Fury - new multiplayer mode airplane. 59 blocks<br />
Hellhound - new multiplayer mode airplane. 70 blocks<br />
Vampire - new multiplayer mode airplane. 61 blocks<br />
Badlands - new multiplayer map. 1567 blocks<br />
Caverns - new multiplayer map. 1545 blocks<br />
Lost Plateau - new multiplayer map. 1520 blocks<br />
New Game Types: Chicken Pox &amp; Gun Heist - 2 new multiplayer game types. 4 blocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blocks are 16KB, far as I can tell as an 8MB XBOX MU is 500 blocks or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The installer for all the above DLC is 38MB. The unpacked size is 78MB.[quote]Because, the DLC unpacked is over 1GB...[/quote]Doubtful given the size of the original XBOX HDD, though I believe I have it all downloaded and can check the number of blocks it
 takes up both on the 360 and on an original XBOX.[quote]As I said; It's a host file, you download....[/quote]With rare exception, DLC was not stored "on disc" back in the day. That's a fairly new development.[quote]Think of it, like a MW3[/quote]How about

<p>[quote user="NanoTechSoldier"]Because you are now talking about a PC pirated installation of Original XBOX DLC[/quote]I'm talking about the actual DLC. These are the files that were downloaded and installed when one obtained DLC from original XBOX Live.[quote]on
 the Xbox 360[/quote]I have not once mentioned installing original XBOX DLC on the 360 from another source. I've talked about checking to see what the file size is on the 360, but that's from pre-shutdown installs I did on several consoles prior to original
 XBOX Live shutdown.[quote]it is against the ToU/CoC...[/quote]Yes, it is. What's your point?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understand this: in general original XBOX game DLC was downloaded from Microsoft. It's not stored on original XBOX game DVDs. It's not available via game discs other than in specific circumstances (Halo 2 Map Pack), and even then may not be complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you are asking for with this thread does not exist. Original XBOX games did not ship with on-disc DLC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And for the record, maps that re-use original game assets may easily be a mere 100-200kb in size. There are plenty of Half-Life multiplayer maps that fall into that size range.</p>

            other way : if i have e.g. AVIRA installed it will use its own Realtime protection.<br />
<br />
now start Defender and enable "Regelmässiges Überprüfen" and start Windows Update<br />
NOW it start to download AV definition and KB4052623 but again Install Error<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible cause for an update not to be installed properly is due to conflict with a third-party antivirus software that's also installed on your device. Regarding this, may we know if you've already tried disabling the other antivirus program
 that's installed and proceed with the update. If you haven't done it yet, please try to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to confirm, have you already tried running the <strong>Windows Update troubleshooter</strong>. If you haven’t done it yet, please try to so and click
<strong><a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here to run the Windows Update troubleshooter">here</a></strong>. Then, you may also run the
<strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service</strong> tool. It can be used if you’ll encounter issues when installing updates and can be found under Control Panel. Here are the steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search box.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>View all</strong> under the<strong> Control Panel Home </strong>
section.</span></li><li><span>Double-click <strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service</strong> or right-click it, then, click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer.</span></li><li><span>Try to install the update again.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also. here are additional troubleshooting steps that you can perform if the issue will persist:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Make sure that your computer has enough space for the update</strong>. The device requires at least 16 GB of free space to upgrade a 32-bit, or 20 GB for a 64-bit OS. For additional information, see Free up drive space in Windows 10.</li><li><strong>Run Windows Update a few times</strong>. Try to download and install any available updates in Windows Update. You can use the Windows Update Troubleshooter tool if just in case you’ll encounter an error.</li><li><strong>Unplug extra hardware</strong>. If there are external storage devices and drives that are connected, unplug them so it won’t cause any conflicts with the update process.</li><li><strong>Check Device Manager for driver errors</strong>. Type <strong>Device Manager</strong> in the
<strong>Search </strong>box on the taskbar, then select it from the results. In the window that will pop up, try to look for any device with a
<strong>yellow exclamation mark</strong> beside it (you may have to select each category to switch to the list of devices). Right-click the device name and select either
<strong>Update Driver Software </strong>or <strong>Uninstall </strong>it to correct these errors.</li><li><strong>Repair hard drive errors</strong>. In the <strong>Search</strong> box on the taskbar, type
<strong>command prompt</strong> and right-click on the result, then select <strong>
Run as administrator</strong>. And, type <strong>chkdsk/f C:</strong> in the <strong>
Command Prompt</strong> window and press <strong>Enter</strong>. This will repair your hard drive automatically and you’ll be asked to restart your device.</li><li><strong>Restore and repair system files</strong>. Run the System File Checker tool. Follow these steps:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Type <strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the <strong>Search </strong>box from <strong>
Start</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on it, then select Run as administrator.</li><li><span>Enter </span><span><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></span><span> (note the spaces before each "/").</span></li><li><span>Enter <strong>sfc</strong> <strong>/scannow</strong> (note the space between "sfc" and "/").</span></li><li><span>Once done, try to check if it resolved the concern.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're just here if you need further help.</p>

    <title>XMP and no boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deertroy1  say:</h3>
<h2>            XMP and no boot</h2>
                    
<p>My computer will not boot if I use the XMP setting in BIOS. I have used it before with success. Even though my memory doesn't say XMP, Gskill told me all of their memory is XMP and that is the setting they recommend. I have used it before but it will not
 boot if set their now. I tried one stick of memory by itself and it will boot. I tried the other stick by itself and it will boot. However, when I try with both sticks it will not boot. I haven't changed anything other than restore my system a couple of times
 with Acronis. I get an error message saying that "the boot sequence failed because a required device is inaccesible. In order to get the system to boot I have to clear my CMOS and reset my BIOS. I have two hard drives. My primary drive has Windows 7-64 bit.
 My secondary drive has XP home 32-bit. My computer will boot to the XP drive with the XMP setting but not the Windows 7 drive unless I use only one stick of RAM. I have updated my BIOS to 1504 but I reverted back to 1404 but that made no difference. I have
 all of the latest drivers installed from the ASUS website. Anyone have any thoughts?<br />
My board is an ASUS Asus P7P55D-E and the memory is Gskill F3-12800CL7D-4GBECO Eco PC3-12800 I wanted to use XMP to get my memory to run at the listed 1600. I have enabled DOCP and overclocked my memory that way and it works fine but not with XMP?</p>
<p>I really don't think this is a hardware issue as I have used XMP setting in the past, I can boot when using only one stick of Ram and I can boot into XP.&nbsp; It seems like a Windows 7 issue however I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<h2>            Xbox One - Game appearing I have not purchased </h2>
                    
<p>So I turned my Xbox One on yesterday, And went to my ready to install list and The Evil Within was there. I have not purchased the game and I'm the only one on my console. A friend of mine also has the same thing. I installed the game and it tells me that
 I either need the disc or to have the person that bought the game to sign in.</p>

<p>Why is this game appearing there? And is it there for anyone else?</p>

<p>Also should note that I am in the preview program. If it might be something to do with that.</p>

<h2>            Error code 0x800703f1 converting from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10</h2>
                    I have tried the update to the free Windows 10 upgrade from my desktop computer running Windows 7 Home Premium (Service Pack 1) several times but I keep getting the error code 0x800703f1 each time I run it. I got to the point in the update process where
 it was checking for updates and then when it was checking for available space (which there is plenty), it said it couldn't determine that and then I got this error code and it said to try again. However, I have tried numerous times and continue to get this
 error. Any ideas?

            I have tried to convert my Windows 7 Home Premium desktop to Windows 10 at least 5 or 6 times and have not been successful. I then started trying to get a Microsoft tech help me out and after going thru the process with 5 of them (4 of them are&nbsp;<span>Carlos
 Q,&nbsp;</span><span>Dilip K,&nbsp;</span><span>David G and&nbsp;</span><span>Savithri
 S - I forgot to write the fifth one down). In all 5 communications, they each assured me that what they had done would work and of course, none of them did work and all 5 of these updates failed, so I am still running Windows 7 Home Premium..</span>

    <title>how to sync files on pc with usb drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how to sync files on pc with usb drive</h2>
                    I know it is possible to automatically synchronise files from one&nbsp;PC to a network, but I can I do it from my pC to a USB memory stick?&nbsp; I have looked in the Sync Centre, but nothing shows up.&nbsp; Do I need 3rd party software and if so what is the best freebie?
 I only need it to make sure my&nbsp;Uni course&nbsp;work is up to date and I dont lose the most up to date version if I have done work&nbsp;in the Uni&nbsp;library&nbsp;rather than home.&nbsp; I know it is probably eaiser to just use the USB drive, but I need to have a backup anyway so
 I thought to sync all the work would cover both aspects.

<h2>            I cannot delete my recycle bin using Elevated Command Prompt &#34;rd &#47;s &#47;q C&#58;&#92;&#36;Recycle.bin&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Support,</p>
<p>I've been having problems with my Recycle Bin.&nbsp; It gets corrupted and I cannot delete any files in the recycle bin.&nbsp; It happened 2-3 times.&nbsp; I tried to use the elevated command prompt, "rd /s /q C:\$Recycle.bin", but I get a long files that&nbsp;show "Access
 Denied".&nbsp; I've only been able to fix the problem by System Restoring to a previous saved state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The elevated command prompt that I've been using is below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may follow the method below and see if that can resolve the issue.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The following procedure permanently deletes all files and folders which are already in the Recycle Bin (from all user accounts in the system) and cannot be recovered.</p>
<p>1.Open an elevated Command Prompt window. To open an elevated Command Prompt, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator.</p>
<p>2. Type the following command and press ENTER:</p>
<p><strong>rd /s /q C:\$Recycle.bin</strong></p>
<p>(This clears out the $Recycle.bin folder from the C:\ partition. You may have to do this for each hard disk partition in your system.)</p>
<p>Type exit to close the Command Prompt window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 Home Premius 64 bit. My computer was preinstalled with WIndows Vista Home Premium. I was given a WIndow 7 upgrade from Dell.</p>
<p><br />

Did you actually manage to delete the recycle bin when following the instructions you posted? You did not state the outcome.<br />

Keep tapping F8 at boot time, then boot the machine into Repair Mode. You can open a Command Prompt from there, then run the command you tried before.<br />

            I think it may have worked.&nbsp; I typed it in, I didn't get the usual long list of Access Denied files.&nbsp; It didn't say it did anything.&nbsp; I am not sure if it's supposed to say it deleted my recycle bin.&nbsp; When I typed in the prompt again, it said there was
 no such file anymore.&nbsp; I'm assuming it deleted it.&nbsp; Is that true?

    <title>How do I change my Win10 password&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rooster6975  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change my Win10 password&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I thought this would be easy, my son has been misbehaving and I want to change the password so that I can control how often he logs onto the computer.&nbsp; However, this has proven to be a difficult challenge.&nbsp; I am the administrator on my Win10 machine.&nbsp; I
 went into Control Panel - User Accounts - selected the main account on this computer - Make Changes to this account in a PC setting - Sign-in Options - Password - Change.&nbsp; I ran through the entire procedure, including sending a code to my other laptop, and
 changed the password.&nbsp; I was surprised to find that only changed the password to my online Microsoft Account.&nbsp; When I restarted this Win10 computer, it still accepts the old password.&nbsp; But now I have a popup when boot finishes telling me that it wants to log
 into my MS Account.&nbsp; I put in the new password, and that works, but that is still not the one I want to change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Win7 latpop, I just hit CTRL + ALT + DEL, and one of the options is Change Password.&nbsp; I have been changing the login password on that machine every 90 days for years.&nbsp; However, that option does not exist on this computer when I select CTRL + ALT +
 DEL.&nbsp; So I can't believe I have to post this, but I cannot figure out how to change the very first password when I log onto Win10 (NOT the MS Account Password).</p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; I ran through this entire procedure, and it only changed my online Microsoft Account password.&nbsp; When I restart the computer, it won't accept that new MS Account Password, only the old one I am trying to change.&nbsp; Now I have a dialog box telling me
 that I need to log into my online MS Account, I put in the brand new password I just created, and successfully log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my local Win10 password is still the old one I am trying to change.</p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; Interestingly, only another laptop comes up under Windows Credentials when I get to step 3.&nbsp; The computer I am on right now (the one on which I am trying to change the password) is named Hal9000.&nbsp; That does not appear in that Credential Manager
 list.&nbsp; Only the upstairs computer named HOMEWORK appears.</p>

            Does your son have his own MS account linked under Family Safety?

<br />Then set up or change only the child's sign-in password, not the adult's.

<p>That's interesting.&nbsp; Once I get this problem sorted out, I will set him up with a child account.&nbsp; However, right now, when I turn on the computer, it comes up to the login screen for a user named Rooster McChicken (that's me).&nbsp; It waits for a password.&nbsp;
 That is the one I am trying to change.&nbsp; If I don't change it, even if I set up a Child Account for my son, he will simply log in as Rooster McChicken like he has many times before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what is going on.&nbsp; On my Win7 laptop upstairs, I just hit CTRL + ALT + DEL and select Change Password.&nbsp; That changes the local login password on that machine which work requires I do every 90 days.&nbsp; I want to do exactly the same thing on this
 computer, however that option does not exist on the CTRL + ALT + DEL page.&nbsp; Instead I have Lock, Switch User, Sign Out, Task Manager, and Cancel.&nbsp; I have now run through the "Sign-In Options - Password - Change your account password" 3 times, and each time
 it successfully changed my online MS Account password, but it never changes the local login password.&nbsp; I can still login locally with the same password my son knows.</p>
<p>

            The problem then is that he is operating from the same account that the parental controls are set from, so can change them at will.  This is why it's designed to be set up by the parent with the children's accounts being the ones that are restricted.

            Chances are it's legit &amp; is related to a recently-installed update for something called "Microsoft .NET Framework,"
<br />
<br />Assuming Win8.1 64-bit...
<br />
<br />We can do some "digging" here if you wish. Please answer each of the following  [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably without quoting this post: 
<br />
<br />1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1b. Did the computer come with Win8 (or Win8.1) preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win8 (or Win8.1), or did you upgrade a (e.g., Win7) computer to Win8?
<br />
<br />1c. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Lenovo; Acer)? 
<br />
<br />1d. Have you ever done a Refresh? ...a Reset?
<br />
<br />1e. Has Windows 10 ever been installed?
<br />
<br />2. What is the full name of your currently-installed third-party anti-virus application or security suite (i.e., not Windows Defender!), if any, and when (approx. date) does your current subscription (if any) expire? 
<br />
<br />3. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., not Windows Defender!) are installed, if any?  What third-party firewall, if any?
<br />
<br />4. Has a(nother) Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it?
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the  McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. Is KB4048958 and/or KB4040974 listed in Installed Updates (not Update History)? [1]
<br />
<br />7. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the second line of text in IE11's Help | About [Alt+H+A] tab; e.g., Update Version: 11.0.54 (KB1231231) ?
<br />
<br />8. Is Adobe Flash Player v27.0.0.187 installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER ONLY! =&gt;  <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html</a> 
<br />
<br />• Do NOT attempt to install or upgrade Flash via the above page! Stop at item #1!
<br />
<br />9. Is Firefox version 57 (or higher) and/or Google Chrome version 62.0.3202.94 (or higher) or any other alternate browser installed?
<br />
<br />10. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Total System Care; Glary Utilities; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG Quick Clean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; Norton PC Tuneup; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; FixMyPC; PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner Registry Cleaner component)?

<p>I have skype on my laptop and on my phone</p>
<p>now on my laptop i set it so that people not on my contact list can not message or call me</p>
<p>however on my phone the skype app still allows for people not in my contact list to call and message me</p>
<p>how can I disable that on the app?</p>
<p>It's rather annoying....I'm sure i'm not the only female out there that has issues with perverts!</p>
<p>This is a major privacy flaw that really needs to be fixed!</p>
<p>The app is for the iphone.</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to try disabling the driver. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>a.</strong> Go to Start</div>
<div><strong>b.</strong> In the search field type Device Manager</div>
<div><strong>c.</strong> In the results above click on Device Manager and find the Windows WDM image capture driver.&nbsp;
<div><strong>d.</strong> Double click on it, go to the driver tab and click disable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Recent Skype Update</h2>
                    Skype just recently updated, and as a result, it logged me out of my old account. I have always been logged in and because of this, I have forgotten my password after many years. The email it's linked to is also unable to be used. I've tried numerous times
 to reset it using the 'accountlive' step process, but each time it has denied these attempts. I list three contacts and other information accurately, but there's an option for old passwords, which I never had except the one I used to make the account, which
 has been forgotten. Is there any way to recover this account?

</p><p>It seems that you already answered the automated recovery form multiple times based on the information you provided above. Password reset codes are sent to the account's
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-and-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">security info</a></strong>.&nbsp;Please be reminded that this is&nbsp;the only available option left to recover your account
 if you do not have access to&nbsp;the account's associated&nbsp;security info. </p>
<p>

 to the user who would be <strong>able to pass the verification process</strong>. You can try answering the recovery form again,&nbsp;this time
<strong>use a device where a successful sign in occurred previously</strong>. As long as the information you provide matches the account, you will be able to recover it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've filled out the form several times but still nothing. There's a section that states "list old passwords"; could that be why it isn't working? I would think just listing three contacts and the email address of where it was created would be enough, but
 it appears not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After each time it fills out, how can an automated function determine it's not credible, despite many attempts trying? Especially when it says this message: "<span>We'll
 send an email to --- to let you know if you've provided enough information to recover your account. It usually takes us about 24 hours to review the information submitted. If you've already submitted a request, we'll close that request and take a look at this
 one." An automated reply usually comes with the same message: determined the information is not good enough.</span></p>

 skype account was created without needing to log in to microsoft here though.</span></p>

<p>The automated account recovery form is double-checked by an Account Specialist to avoid discrepancies. As long as the information you provide match what is on your account, you should be able to recover your account.

<h2>            No accedo al juego Gears of War 2 en modo retrocompatibilidad &#40;se congela&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Tengo un Xbox one, aproximadamente la 4a vez que quise jugar Gears of War 2 (en modo retrocompatibilidad por supuesto) se trabó el juego.</p>
<p>Ya realicé todos los procedimientos del soporte "Mi juego Xbox One no se inicia o se inmoviliza durante el juego" (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/es-MX/xbox-one/games/game-freeze-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/es-MX/xbox-one/games/game-freeze-solution</a>)</p>

<p>Al parecer está corrupto mi archivo de avances en la nube, ya que si puedo acceder al juego con otra cuenta sin problemas y cuando he borrado el juego y mi perfil de la consola, cuando se actualiza desde la nube se vuelve a congelar el juego.</p>

<p>¿Alguien sabe como borrar avances en la nube o como se solucionan este tipo de situaciones?</p>

<p>Saludos.</p>

<p>creo que la unica forma es por una 360</p>
<p>deberias entrar ahi para que se actualizen los datos que se suben a la nube</p>

jajajaja</p>
<p>Para borrarlo de la nube tienes que seleccionar el juego con el botón menú (El de las 3 rayas)&gt; Administrar juego&gt; Selecciona lo que se ha guardado&gt; Te debe de aparecer "Eliminar de la consola", "Eliminar de todas partes" y "Cancelar". En este caso si quieres
 eliminar tanto de la nube como de la consola selecciona "Eliminar de todas partes".</p>

<div>I get this error, I can play on the a browser, but not using the Netflix App. I can open the app, and view Netflix. But when I click to play content, I get this error code. I see the above reply is only for the browser issue. What about &nbsp;receiving the
 error on my laptop using the "Netflix App" only?</div>
<div>I've updated every driver. Installed and re-installed Silverlight.&nbsp;</div>

<p>I have followed all of these steps and am still having the same problem. I can watch Netflix content in my browser Opera 22.0, Firefox 30.0, Chrom&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(48, 57, 66, 1)">35.0.1916.153 m, and
 IE 11.0.9600.17126 but then it worked with all of those BEFORE I tried renaming the file in your workaround above. My problem and apparently the problem of the others above is with the Netflix App being distributed by the Windows Store.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(48, 57, 66, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(48, 57, 66, 1)">I ran the trouble shooting cab that you linked above and it found and fixed some minor problems with the store setup and cache BUT that did not fix my problem with the
 Netflix App. &nbsp;I have checked my updates they are all up to date with no others currently available for my installation so if you could offer up any other suggestions they would be most welcome.</span></p>

            <p>My situation is also (or rather “still”) just as Chisaiyama says. The Netflix app is just useless. Tried all of the above. While I do appreciate the fact that these are being read, and we are getting instructions, the resolution has yet to a<span>ppear.
 &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Netflix isn't the only one either. Most apps that are set to run by default just sit on a blank (but colorful) opening screen - such as the video player for Win 8. I'm having to use a different program for almost everything there
 is a standard app installed for (apps installed at time of purchase, no less).</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Sometimes this issue can occur due to user account corruption. I would suggest you to create a new user account and check if you can access Netflix app:

</p><p>think I fugures out what's going on seems there are two version of resident evil 7 on the windows store,&nbsp;the one we have or rather had is the one that says resident evil 7 then has Japanese characters underneath the title , when I see that one in the store I see install but it's greyed out. And the one that we keep seeing when we search the store is the version that says resident evil 7 biohazard and has capcom underneath the title. That's the one that keeps saying to buy instead of install and it's what's linked in the xbox and windows store. So somebody at capcom or Microsoft totally screwed this up, probably best option get a refund and buy again on the bed store links. &nbsp;If you wanna see what I mean go to the store app on pc then my library the next scroll down to what's can't be installed on this pc you'll see the Xbox console version there click that then click the pc version of the game and you'll see the greyed out install option .</p>

            I believe that build has an issue. I ended up rolling back to the previous build and managed to run the game on it. It has a few problems running but mostly due to the age of the game. I am on build 14955 right now. If I remember right, the only way I
 managed to get the game to run was by installing it to another computer and copying those files over to mine then running a game updater.

    <title>So, I tried &#38;quot&#59;Legendary&#38;quot&#59; difficulty with a - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            So, I tried &#38;quot&#59;Legendary&#38;quot&#59; difficulty with a new character....</h2>
                    
<p>It wasn't too bad for the first ten levels, although I felt like the companion was doing most of the heavy lifting.&nbsp; But around level 10 I started Dawnguard, and man, those vampires do not play nice.&nbsp; They pretty much halted the playthrough cold.&nbsp; My damage
 was so miniscule that it couldn't keep up to the health they were gaining back via the lifedrain power.<br />
<br />
I think that Legendary is reachable if you're patient with a new toon, but you definitely need to use every resource you have, including all the buff and debuff skills in Alchemy, Enchanting, and Smithing.&nbsp; And a lot of gear grinding would be required through
 your teen levels.&nbsp; Anyway, I've gone back to my high level toon for more Dawnguard, but it was an interesting experiment.<br />
<br />
I still wonder if doing Dawnguard was the big mistake, and maybe I should have just gone after some Daedric artifact quests for gear instead.&nbsp; But the moment Vampires start spawning, you're kind of forced to deal with them.&nbsp; I also wonder if I made a mistake
 using Archery and Sneak as my main skills (thinking I'd use the sneak attacks for more damage).&nbsp; By level 10 these seemed really weak, and I can't help thinking that Alchemy and Enchanting would have been better routes to take, since some of the poisons can
 be pretty effective.<br />
<br />
It's driving me nuts that I let this difficulty get the best of me!<br />
<br />
Anyone else try this with a fresh character?&nbsp; What method of combat did you go with?</p>

<p>LOL! I still do not have DawnGuard. Mostly for that very same reason that they have to be dealt with as soon as they come out. No time for exploring or just fooling around. Way to intense for my liking.
</p>
<p>If I had to do it though, I'd choose Combat abilities over archery. Low level archery is foolish as it is, just trying to kill the wild life. Along with some Alchemy and Enchanting you'd probably stand a chance. Without some form of early warning, Stealth
 can be had pretty quick just by sneaking up on Mudcrabs. Patience pays off big time there.</p>
<p>I think I was level 20 something before I started to really become a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think Dawnguard would be a problem for me as well. I have enough trouble dodging Blood Horkers and Cultists! And I thought I was home free when I destroyed the Dark brotherhood. &nbsp;I would like to make my own arrows but it's not as if i can't go buy
 all the arrows I want or need and it seems kind of silly, in a "role-playing" game, &nbsp;to complain about having to go buy arrows just like an NPC would. lol Did you at least train your archery up to 50 with Faendal? That's easy and free and at lest gives you
 a good start. I only just discovered I could improve a long bow with firewood up to Hunting bow. I don't think I'm brave enough to try Legendary. I was kind of bummed when my freshly minted mage kept being killed by crabs on Master.</p>

<p>Wait, wait, wait ...<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><em> level 10</em></strong></span>???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legendary mode is for those character's who have leveled high enough so they can make weapons &amp; armour which can be enchanted to make up for the higher difficulty enemies!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Difficulty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><strong>this</strong></em></a>:
</p>
<p>The Difficulty in Skyrim can be changed by opening the pause menu and accessing "Settings" under the "System" Tab. Difficulties in Skyrim change the damage multiplier causing direct changes to
<a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Skills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">skills</a> that rely on them. There are six difficulties, ranging from Novice to Legendary, from less to more difficult, respectively.</p>

<p>"So, level 10 would be suicidal. &nbsp;Sorry ...".</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Speak only of your own ability, thanks. I consistently play my new characters on Legendary as soon as they hop off the cart in the tutorial and anyone, with practice, can overcome Legendary without needing a high-level character and overly strong enchantments.
 There is no point in having a challenge if all you're going to do is play it like any other difficulty using even stronger enchantments.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Legendary mode is for those character's who have leveled high enough so they can make weapons &amp; armour which can be enchanted to make up for the higher difficulty enemies!".</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Pointless, as mentioned above. Why not simply avoid overdoing your Enchantments and play on Master?</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Anyway, playing a new character on Legendary is a great decision and a solid challenge. Good luck and have fun with it.
<em><strong>It must be noted, however, that Legendary resets to Novice when you start playing Skyrim after having turned your console off. You have to manually set it to Master, return to game, then set it back to Legendary. After that you're welcome to continue
 playing.</strong></em></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Vampires are extremely difficult to take out in pretty much every encounter you could possibly have with them. Take a melee-using companion with you and do your best to get assistance when dealing with them. Also, don't bother engaging them from the front
 when you can avoid it... Drain Life will murder characters pretty much effortlessly for your early levels, and that's just talking about one vampire. Take a companion, equip them in Dawnguard Heavy Armour if it's available, let vampires focus on them while
 you attack from behind and heal your companion, get any nearby guards or animals to help... use archery... use healing spells, a Staff of Paralysis... go ahead and use anything you've got at your disposal but you'll really benefit from keeping their focus
 on someone else. You're also going to want some Dawnguard armour... that Drain Life spell really doesn't do you any favours, nor does it take long to exterminate you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Identify the key skills in each tree and work on them: Block's Block Runner and Elemental Protection, Alteration's Magic Resistance, Conjuration's Summon Spells in accordance to your enemy's weaknesses IF AND ONLY IF summoned creatures scale based on the
 difficulty... Restoration's Novice Restoration, Recovery, Respite and Regeneration in combination, Heavy Armour's Conditioning if it's relevant, Archery's Power Shot, One Handed's Savage Strike and Fighting Stance, possibly Paralysing Strike, Speech's Merchant
 and Pickpocket's Extra Pockets.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The above perks are all well-worth considering.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>There are lots of more specialised perks that could work wonders too, and a little grinding would give you early access to them. I hate to think about the contrast between a bandit with a Steel Warhammer and a Bandit who just had that Warhammer stolen out
 of their hands, for example.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Other than Perks, be careful about your gameplay. You can comfortably strafe and block/bash your way to victory in almost any straight melee fight against a single opponent with anything larger than a Longsword. If you're careful you can easily outdo several
 of those opponents, though you'd better not make a mistake. Keep enemies between you and any archers and feel free to save during the long fights you're going to be in. As a note, you're going to want to level Health and Stamina almost equally for a melee-based
 character as they're both extremely important. A little Magicka (I typically use 150) helps immensely with your ability to heal yourself and case other supplemental magic as you're going to be unable to rely on Alchemy unless you've got a hell of a lot of
 ingredients and some serious potions, though you'll want a few on hand to get out of those "I paused the game as his sword is making contact with my neck" moments.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Doing certain things in the environment wreaks havoc with the enemy AI as long as they don't have ranged options available (jumping onto a big enough object often causes groups of enemies to scatter in different directions, mysteriously). You can almost
 always reset an enemy's approach by doing something with the geometry in the area and arrows are remarkably powerful, especially with Faendal's help leveling yourself to 50 (and the very useful Power Shot). You'll never run out of Steel Arrows as you'll never
 run out of Guards.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Dragon Priests and other mages are all easy to take out with Archery as long as they aren't throwing Lightning at you. You can keep mages suppressed with a Shock Weapon and ample usage of your bash attacks. Be careful with charging Frost Mages unless you're
 confident about it, resistant to it or close to cover. Things like Draugr Deathlords are actually highly underwhelming unless they've got bows in which case Block makes them, amusingly enough, highly underwhelming. They're also remarkably fragile and don't
 take much damage compared to other opponents you could come across.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Giants? What are Giants? Mammoths are scarier and other than easily peppering them to death they're actually very capable opponents.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hmm. I don't worry much about magic but people more experienced in the use of it may very find it much more applicable and useful than I do. In particular, assuming enemy levels aren't a problem and it's a reliable spell, being able to turn an enemy into
 a distraction with Fury/whatever would be extremely useful.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I love the use of Ice Form to freeze several opponents and leave just one to take out by yourself, though it often doesn't work as well as it could. Enemies are too tough to get rid of easily in the time Ice Form will give you and companions love shooting
 frozen enemies. Soul Tear is an extremely useful finishing move as it resurrects any given opponent, if I'm not mistaken, and Unrelenting Force is always a useful way to remove people from the area or kill them with a fall.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hmm. What else?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Oh, Dragons!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Dragons are pathetic once they get on the ground. They're very easily bashed to death and Block Runner/Elemental Protection make their attempts to kill you before you get close underwhelming. If you're using an appropriate shield, or you've got both Fire
 and Frost defense shields on you (thank that Pickpocket perk) AND you're using Block Runner/Elemental Protection, well... I believe that's going to be 15% damage, which isn't very scary. You can interrupt every one of their attacks on the ground with a bash
 and take cover while they're in the air. Just be sure to give them space to land, or else it'll be a pointless fight.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Your own Drain Health weapon can be very useful. After acquiring the Ebony Blade, I've been able to stand toe-to-toe with most possible opponents comfortably regenerating the damage they've done while dealing the same to them. Turning and sprinting out of
 battle to heal sounds ridiculously implausible, but... it's extremely effective. You can also strafe enemies rather well even while using both hands to cast whatever the default healing spell is (Dual Casting sucks, by the way), along with regenerating the
 stamina you're about to use to defeat whichever enemy it is you're healing against. Isn't it convenient that your Magicka regenerates while you're bashing something, making it very easy to back out, recover your Health and Stamina and continue bashing them
 while your Magicka recovers to let you do it all over again?</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As far as those low levels go, be extremely aware of what you've got at your disposal, whether it be in the inventory or not, and focus on your general gameplay and tactics. Worry less about leveling Stamina than Health for a while as if you're constantly
 being OHKd by a deathblow then you're not going to get much further. This means less bashing and more strafing, so be careful as even a blocked blow can kill you at around 80 Health but you'll get better at it with practice.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Consider leveling your Health by raising passive or crafting skills for a while as although it's commonly warned against, the crafting skills can all carry low combat skills and you really are going to need that Health. Even Pickpocket, entirely passive,
 will guarantee about 10, 000 gold in the hand when you unlock the Thieve's Guild. Also, combat skills go up extremely quickly when enemies take minutes to defeat rather than single hits so there's no need to stress out about maintaining them. If you have the
 Magicka and healing spells available to you then feel free to spend some time raising your Armour/Block to hasten unlocking the best Perks.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Be careful about choosing to loose Dragons upon the world as they're exponentially more painful the lower level you are. At about 20 or so you should be perfectly capable of taking them out but if you have to battle them at level 10 it might get a bit ugly.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you already know any early-access item locations or fixed spawns for something that may help, go and get it as soon as possible. Though you won't be able to obtain it as soon as it becomes available, the Black Star is one such item. Some things just make
 a massive difference and they're worth having them if you can identify them and know where to find them. If you know about a guaranteed source of gems or other items of wealth, enchanted items, weapons or armour of above-currently-available strength, go and
 get them.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Also, as it must be repeated, Legendary Difficulty resets to Novice each time you return to playing Skyrim after turning your console off, though this does not apply to loading a save. That's good, because you'll be doing it a lot. You have to
 manually set it to Master, return to game, then reset it to Legendary, after which you're welcome to continue playing.</strong></em></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I hope something I wrote above helps you, but remember to make it YOUR experience. Take anything anyone says under advisement and incorporate it into your playstyle but make sure that at the end of the day, it is your playstyle. Everything I wrote is also
 only my opinion and other people may have different thoughts about much of it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Good luck, and make sure you have fun with the experience.<em><strong><br />

<p>Wow, thanks for the post, CSB...that's an impressive wall of info. &nbsp;You've given me some interesting ideas for a focused build that's melee based. &nbsp;I wasn't sure I'd be able to survive this with melee. &nbsp;I restarted this again yesterday, still with an eye
 toward archery, but thought I might try to use a combination of high level conjure spells to get the aggro away from me, AND unlock the Bound Bow at a ridiculously low level, since it tends to have a much higher damage output than most other bows I might see
 under level 10. &nbsp;Still not sure this would be enough to deal with Vampires, but being able to conjure pets seems like a good idea.&nbsp; I did a "very hard" playthrough in Oblivion once, and it was all Conjure and Illusion based.<br />
<br />
I was using the strategy where I control the pace at which I level by never sneaking, crafting, or even unlocking chests (companions will do this), so that conjure and Archery are well over 50 by the time I hit level 10.&nbsp; But your idea sounds kind of interesting,
 to use more passive skills to give you the tools to enhance your attack.&nbsp; I'm definitely going to try this approach as well and see how it works out.&nbsp; I've never been good a the frantic type of combat and always played stealthily, but I like a challenge as
 well.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>I was discussing the game with my son who complained about killing dragons with melee since they keep flying off. I said I just used that time to heal but it occurred to me later that it isn't that hard to finish the main quest through to getting the elder
 scroll and thus Dragonrend. After that you can make them come down where you can whack them all you want to.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Basher, my son's wife found great success using conjure to send in atronachs to soften and occupy the bad guys while she picked them off with the bound bow. This works really well at lower levels.

Good to know.&nbsp; I actually am thinking about pursuing the Dawnguard quest with this second attempt, and see if it goes better.&nbsp; That first time was a mess.&nbsp; I had archery and sneak, so beyond the first shot bonus, I might as well have been pelting them with
 harsh language.&nbsp; This time I'd like to see how things go with the bound bow and some reinforements in the form of pets.&nbsp; Killing vampires seems like a DPS race, and since pets and followers aren't affected by the damage reduction, they should be able to work
 them over.&nbsp; Although in many ways, Bob's strategy seems like more of a pure playthrough, since he's forced to do all the damage himself, rather than rely on help.<br />
<br />
I was thinking I'd also follow the Alteration path so I can get the Mage Armor perk, as well as the paralyze spell.&nbsp; I may avoid Restoration, so I don't have to keep dipping into the mana pool, and pursue Alchemy down the road.&nbsp; The Hearthfire add on makes
 it really easy to grow a bunch of good ingredients.&nbsp; Invisibility, Paralyze, and Slow were some of my favorities.</p>

<p>I find being a mage is greatly assisted by enchanting for free magic. Early get fortify magic and fortify &nbsp;your preferred school. Once you can double enchant you are good. That way you can put your levels into health where it will do you some good. I usually
 just used stamina potions when I needed them for archery. Also, magic regeneration is not an efficient use of an enchantment. It is much better to just boost the mana pool.</p>

<p>I'm finding it tough to decide how much magic to take. &nbsp;Right now at level 12, I have around 170, plus a couple of boosts. &nbsp;Everything else went into health. &nbsp;My load out is basically: &nbsp;Bound Bow in the right hand, and then Stoneflesh and one of my pets
 assigned to the left with the D-pad. &nbsp;It's great. &nbsp;I cast stoneflesh, switch to a pet on the fly, wait for the mayhem, then Bound Bow and disappear into the shadows without even having to sneak. &nbsp;The delay between getting a Frost Atronach and regen for the
 BB is only about 3-4 seconds. &nbsp;I was trying to avoid pushing my level up with enchanting for a bit, as I'm going to take another run at Dawnguard on Legendary, but I'm saving all the items I find to disenchant later. &nbsp;But you're right...some enchantments would
 help with the mana pool (I did get the Gaulder one on the mage quests, which helps a lot...I'm wondering if I should take this whole quest on, just for the full amulet, but I recall it being tough at the end. &nbsp;Legendary might be too much.</p>

            Sounds like you're not using the proper security.&nbsp; Either the code is incorrect or you're not using the right kind of security (WEP vs. WPA, for example).
