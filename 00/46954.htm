<h2>            POP3 email accounts on Windows 10 phone</h2>
                    <p>I have attempted to set up two POP3 accounts in the mail app on my new Windows 10 phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of them works perfectly, the second will not sync at all. I have checked the available settings and they are all seemingly correct They match the ones for the same account on my PC. This account, however, has different port numbers to the other. I cannot
 find anywhere to specify the port numbers on my phone. Is this possible? If not, why not as it seems pretty basic to me.</p>

<h2>            Online&#47;Offline&#47;Invisible Status on Android&#63; Interface is a mess...</h2>
                    What happened to the ability to set Online/Away/Invisible status in the Android mobile app (version 8.0.0..4736). It used to be a one-swipe option. from pretty much anywhere Setting "Do Not Disturb" under two layers of clicking is NOT the same thing at
 all. I want to talk to people, so I don't care about the useless "Highlights" which now takes up far too much of the App and its too easy to accidentally hit. The location button is also now perfectly positioned to be accientally tapped when I'm trying to
 sent a message. I very much regret updating to regret 8.0.0..4736 and wish I could go back to the version that wasn't trying to be Facebook.

</p><p>Currently the only statuses available on the new Skype is <strong>Active Now</strong> which is the default status set by Skype when you log in and
<strong>Do not Disturb </strong>which will stop message notifications but you can still receive calls. Since&nbsp;the new Skype is currently being rolled out, you might bump into some issues once in a while. Skype can use this as a constructive criticism to help
 improve the application. You can <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa34755/how-do-i-send-feedback-for-the-new-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
send Skype a feedback</a> about the things you want to change, update and improve.

            Sending someone to give feedback on a phone, with long sentences, is a bit like sending someone to a farm to get milk.&nbsp; The link you provided forces one to use the app to submit feedback - I'm sorry, I don't have a keyboard to use with my phone and my
 fingers don't text well.&nbsp; I agree with the poster, we need those options back - invisible, offline, etc...&nbsp; Why do I care about color schemes or themes, or any of that other garbage bloat stuff Microsuck is adding to Skype?&nbsp; Even the Linux version of Skype
 is going places it shouldn't.

            Recently I got an email asking whether my question has been answered. This is not an answer; I already know what options exist, and now the computer app seems to have done away with this functionality on the computer app as well. I'm not "bumping into
 some issues"---your new design is awful and LESS functional than before.

<p>Hi Danida</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why on earth Microsoft have been screwing up so many versions of Skype is beyond me, terms such as bonehead have been used by other c contributors which I think is extremely polite considering the awful damage Microsoft is doing to this once elegant and
 then justifiably dominant communication platform. &nbsp;This is a quote from Mark Harris elsewhere on the forum about Microsoft that benefits from many repetitions until Microsoft understand that Skype is not a toy to be dallied with, but a powerful communication
 tool that hundreds of millions of people use, and enormous numbers are dependent on for their business communications, or for maintaining relationships in families spread over the world:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This is NOT a game.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 for lost time and loss of income while you toy with this important application. Of course I am sure there is no hope of that.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 around with and for frivolous stuff like adding colours, graphics, etc whilst losing functionality.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 to. This was NOT the case for this latest installment of technicolour dung.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 yes, that is fine. But to fundamentally change the nuts and bolts of a functioning app and CRITICAL application, just so you can pimp it and migrate it to the cloud, illustrates a fundamental lapse, or woeful misunderstanding of the business you entered into
 when Skype was acquired.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 PERFECTED, and only trial, roll out new builds to those that are interested and make it easy to roll back to the previous version if the new version is not suitable.&nbsp;</span></p>

            I have been using Skype for over a decade and this latest version makes no sense. So the only way not to receive calls is to sign out completely. And to sign in again I have to retype my login info because there's no option for Skype to remember it. So
 disappointed, and a reason I'll be looking for an alternative.&nbsp;

 or not. She said she &nbsp;tried fixing it &nbsp;but there's nothing &nbsp;she was able to do . She told me we have a different type of Sype.is it that she is lying &nbsp;and to me and deliberately has it off, or is it a system problem. 4 trust issues,i want to know .. like I
 said it was working fine &nbsp;for year up until now the last week..so what is the problem? &nbsp;Skype problem or girlfriend problem?

<p>Hi Doug, there are 2 issues here that cover the problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly there would appear to be a bug in the online status reporting system for Skype. &nbsp;I was probably not the first to raise this issue in the original Skype bug reporting system maybe 7 years ago or so, yet it is an issue that persists today with at least
 one thread on this forum. &nbsp;Have several Skype accounts here for different devices, can quit Skype and put the computer to sleep or shut it down yet sometimes Skype will continue to show that account online for one or more days after the account went offline.
 &nbsp;These accounts are specific to one device and have never been used on another, so there is no other device online with the Skype account open; that does not address the issue of the account being hijacked, however there appears no other indication of hijackings
 and the issue applies to all my accounts across Windows, Mac &amp; Linux Skype versions; occasionally calls or chat messages seem to trigger the system to acknowledge the new status, other times the only way to trigger the new status is to quit &amp; restart Skype,
 a pain in Android as have seen reports that you now have to re-enter your password to log in each time having ditched the automatically sign in option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second issue is that Microsoft have released a new version of Skype across most platforms, with reduced options for status display amongst other really really useful features dropped; and as written from scratch in a different language (Electron) then
 there are massive opportunities for a whole new set of bugs having ditched the well debugged previous version. &nbsp;So your girlfriend is almost certainly right that she has a new kind of Skype which has not been well received by the vocal part of the Skype community,
 iOS App Store &amp; Android Play Store ratings going from 4.5 out of 5 to 1 out of 5 with a deluge of negative reviews for example. &nbsp;A possible widely applied solution that Microsoft objects to is to revert to an earlier version of Skype, with many going back
 to Android 7.46 as I have done here without issue, with the proviso that the older versions are not connecting successfully to some of the newer downgraded versions of Skype. &nbsp;You need to be careful about your source of a previous version to avoid a hacked
 version introducing malware onto your phone, so use a trusted source, sadly Microsoft are ignoring the deluge of criticism and are not hosting an earlier version for the majority, in my experience, of Skype users who are very very uncomfortable with the direction
 Microsoft is taking Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another bigger issue is how little Microsoft seem to understand how Skype is used by so much of the user base, apart from the business users there is a large body of Skype users replying on Skype to maintain close relationships over very large distances,
 often a significant part of the world away, where trust is a delicate issue that Skype has been able to make a significant contribution to in maintaining the health of these relationships; with the direction Microsoft is taking Skype removing some of these
 key features that help to maintain trust. &nbsp;I would go so far to suggest that Microsoft is currently the biggest source of emotional pain in the world at the moment, granted that for an individual the horrors of events around ISIS, Syria, South American drug
 violence, North Korea&nbsp;and tobacco induced trauma and bereavement (as an example of suffering deliberately created in the pursuit of profit) for example exceed about as severe as possible at the moment, however there are only thousands, or maybe low tens of
 thousands experiencing those horrors; there are many scientists now reporting that social connectivity is almost certainly a prime determinant of both happiness and longevity, by withdrawing the effectiveness of Skype as a tool to maintain that contact in
 a long distance relationship then Microsoft is causing probably the greatest pain for people in an otherwise safe society, that pain may individually only be 10% of the horrors above, however, with about 75 million active Skype users then 10% of the horrors
 experienced by thousands more people will add up to the largest source of pain in the world today.</p>

<p>The unfortunate part about this issue is the direction that Skype is heading, as has been said more to snapchat users. While there is nothing wrong with this type of application, this is not what people that user Skype are after.</p>
<p>We want to be able to let people/customers know if we are Available/Offline/Online/Away etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate to say it but bring back messenger!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason as I understand it, that Skype was first purchased was to get fully fledged Video conferencing tech.</p>
<p>Not an app that appeals to teens! There is Facebook, Snapchat, Viber, Whatsapp etc that can be used for pure fun.</p>
<p>If you want people to buy into it then make it so, but make it as it was meant to be a more business like app. Clean UI and simple to use, bullet proof.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I myself in Australia, use it more to talk to my parents in Canada, but I have a feeling after this new version, that it maybe beyond my 82 year old father to find how it works, as it is not user friendly. Its going to be hard to get him to migrate to google
 for google talk, but I think this will have to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a user of Hotmail and Microsoft products since the early 90s, starting with Dos and going to where we are today.</p>
<p>Its a shame that control of products has been taken away from the user over that time, be it update controls on Windows 10, unavoidable app updates of Skype, or making UI of various products non intuitive.
</p>
<p>It maybe time to walk. Now with the Android universe starting to get some very good apps, I think the time has come.</p>
<p>I wonder if Bill Gates ever wonders how little things like this trigger an exodus of users?</p>

            If you haven't already, you would need to file a complaint on them via the console in order for the enforcement team to investigate them, but as DDoS attacks are done through your internet, not Live, you would want to contact your ISP to have them help
 you get back online and stay online.

<h2>            Searching Windows 8 App store, &#34;Store Filter&#34; not showing-</h2>
                    I recently read a post on how to search for Apps in the Microsoft 8 App Store at url&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_store/cannot-search-app-in-windows-8-store-search-bar-is/49d9c7f1-e6a9-45a3-a9af-b53a876261ae">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_store/cannot-search-app-in-windows-8-store-search-bar-is/49d9c7f1-e6a9-45a3-a9af-b53a876261ae</a>.
 While I found the response to be helpful I am running into a problem. When I have the store open and I click the windows button + F to search, I look to filter the results within the store specifically however the Store App icon is not showing up on the right
 pane AT ALL. I have a Toshiba Satellite recently purchased and was wondering if someone could help me address the problem. Thank you in advance.

<h2>            I have an issue with using the USB on the computer.</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im having a huge problem with my USB drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everytime i plug something new in (my new expensive mouse for an example) there comes an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything (i think) and the last thing i tried which i saw somewhere here i think, was to do bunch of things, remove USB drives that were hidden, right click on that and do something there and to rename or delete
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>INFCACHE.1</strong></span> so windows can build a new one automatically and, according to the instructions,.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After i deleted <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">INFCACHE.1</span></strong>, the problem still exist except one thing, no error message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the file (windows/system32/DriverStore) and the <strong>INFCACHE.1</strong> isnt there. &nbsp;The only thing that exists in that folder is 3 folders: en-US, FileRepository and Temp,,,</p>
<p>
</p><p>and 4 DAT files (5 with <strong>INFCACHE.1</strong> if it were there): drvindex.dat, infpub.dat, infstor.dat and infstrng.dat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The tutorial i read sounds like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Unplug all USB devices ecept mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>2. <span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">&nbsp;Click on Start orb,&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sevenforums.com%2fimages%2fsmilies%2forb.png" />Type Advanced System and click on View Advanced System settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Click on Advanced tab, Click on Environment Variables.</p>
<p>4. Under the window "System variables" Click on new.</p>
<p>5. Type: devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices. At the variable value box type: 1</p>
<p>6. Close window (3 times pressing OK)</p>
<p>7. <span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">&nbsp;Click on Start orb,&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sevenforums.com%2fimages%2fsmilies%2forb.png" />Type Device Manager and click on Device Manager</p>
<p>8. Click on View, then Show hidden devices.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">9. You will now notice that you have a list of USB devices and that some lines appear to be faded. Uninstall all the faded entries.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>The INFCACHE.1 file is used to store information about USB drivers, the information in this file may have become corrupted and may cause windows to load the wrong driver or cause a driver not found message

<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Deleting this file will force windows to generate a new INFCACHE.1 file.</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

 Right Click on the file INFCACHE.1&nbsp;</span><strong>(if you have more instances of Windows installed only do this for INFCACHE.1 C:\Windows\System32\Driver Store)</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">4. Click on Properties, Click on Security tab, Click on Edit, Click on Add.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Type Administrators in the window with the blinking cursor, Click OK</span><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">.</span><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">6. Delete the INFCACHE.1 file.<em> (or rename INFCACHE.old
 which i did not do)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">7. Connect a USB device,&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">but not the one you were having trouble with</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">&nbsp;this
 will make a new INFCACHE.1</span><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">8. Now Start the PC and try your device again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">NOTE... It may, in a few cases be necessary to go through this Tutorial two or even three times to get this to work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">Thats the whole tutorial.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">I was going to do it again but the INFCACHE.1 &nbsp;isnt there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">Thanks for reading and i sure hopes someone has an solution for me.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the details on the issue.</p>
<p>

<h2>            My Laptop won&#8217;t start</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS Laptop:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f80fe437-991c-4df3-b427-66a1c2705eb3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f80fe437-991c-4df3-b427-66a1c2705eb3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>In the past days I’ve been trying to start my computer because, for some reason, it won’t start. I have tried the mayority of the option that the menu shows. I have not yet tried an external solution. Still, no solution.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a804cb6c-8d1f-4345-a618-e5f6c52fe336?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a804cb6c-8d1f-4345-a618-e5f6c52fe336?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The last thing I tried was using the command promt, guided by some other solutions found in the community, like: chkdks c: /r /f /v, but still no solution. I get errors and “failed” messages.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/500dfd2d-f1f4-455e-86a0-53a399c8785a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/500dfd2d-f1f4-455e-86a0-53a399c8785a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Is there any other solution I don’t know? Is the problem my hard drive? Do I have to consider taking my laptop to a technician?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope someone can help me. I would appreciate any feedbacks.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi xTofen, 
<br />
<br />Your hard drive could have an issue. On boot up, do you have a diagnostics option? Depending on the manufacturer it’d be a particular F key to get to it. You could do a test on the hard drive to see if it’s failing. 
<br />
<br />Next, Is there data on your machine you need off? If not, I think building media and reinstalling windows is our best bet. 
<br />
<br />Let me know about the things above and we’ll move forward!
<br />- C

<p>Hi, thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to enter in something called BIOS Utility, but I dont know what to do.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bf13b21-982a-40ec-b34b-af288198dd21?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bf13b21-982a-40ec-b34b-af288198dd21?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve already deleted my files, but they are in the cloud. I don’t need any data, just want my computer to function. Also after attempting to restart it several times I get this:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40c63646-d9f6-4d7c-a53c-c825754b1851?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40c63646-d9f6-4d7c-a53c-c825754b1851?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Cool BIOS screen! So that tells us info about the machine, as you can tell. If you look at the bottom right, you’ll see F7 Advanced Mode and that may lead us to a system diagnostics page. At this point though, I’m thinking it’s a software problem, and we should try to reinstall windows. 
<br />
<br />Do you happen to have a USB and another PC we can use temporarily?

<br />
<br />The two links above are to the Windows 10 iso, and how to build the bootable usb.
<br />
<br />You could also use these apps I like to build the media:

Watch out for ads on the sites that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />. Once you build the media, you’ll boot your laptop to it. you’ll elect to install windows. It’ll then go to a page where it shows you all your partitions, highlight and delete them all, until you have 1 unpartitioned drive, then click “next” and the install process will start.
<br />
<br />Let me know!

            <p>I've done the memtest and the driver verifier seems super repetitive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were 5 of the minidumps due to a memory corruption?<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Does it not say what specific driver is causing it?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to narrow it down without having to do unnecessary things if it can be found out early.</p>

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>Do not uninstall any of these different versions.</p>
<p>When a developer creates a software program, they use the files from the current or even an older version of the Visual C++ runtime files. Those versions are installed by the software program and&nbsp;must be present on the computer for that software program
 to work properly.</p>
<p>When Windows Update checks your system for available updates, it will detect that these older versions are present and if an update is available for these older versions, it will be installed.</p>
<p>Removing any of these versions&nbsp;can cause some programs to stop working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

                    Unfortunately, Skype 8, even in its last incarnation, is still far from being as good and as featured as Skype classic (7.41).&nbsp; Many of us need features in Skype classic that have not yet been fully and/or correctly implemented in Skype 8.&nbsp; So, it is important
 that Skype classic remains usable after November 1st.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please, keep it working until Skype 8 has really been improved and has become as good (or better) that Skype classic.

 app SEVERAL times and signed in and out SEVERAL times. &nbsp;I have the latest version on Skype on ios 8.46. I have a subscription and Skype credit and those aren’t showing up in the app either. I am currently at my wits end. &nbsp;Can a human reach out and help please?

            <span>Thanks for the advice, I downloaded the latest driver version from the AverMedia Website and installed it in compatibility mode but it did not work, then I&nbsp;uninstalled&nbsp;it completely and installed it again using the program's Autorun function
 without checking the compatibility mode and IT WORKED!!!!</span>

            <p>Windows 8 is another Vista Not ready for the public and will never be ready for the public I am glad I got it when it was on sale for under $40.00 M$ you need to get your act together!!!!!! telling people to try lying to W8 to force a W7 driver to install
 in compatibility mode Running apps that way is one thing but drivers is another!!!! you are asking people to risk disaster! few people out&nbsp;there have the knowledge us old school people have I go back to IBM DOS pre windows when a OS fit on a single density
 floppy, I know M$ is trying to get away from the Desktop but it can't be replaced!!! there are things a tablet can't do and can never do, asking someone to force a driver into W8 is just a&nbsp;very bad risk that could have disastrous consequences, but what's on
 there computer tablet/RT Wana be Laptop is not your concern if they loose everything on it photos, music, etc!&nbsp; there have only been 3 successful versions of windows 3.0 3.11 if you needed b=networking, XP,&nbsp;And W7! the Xbox&nbsp;One is a failure before it has even
 been released! those consoles are just PC's disguise as a Game Console running a modified version of Windows!&nbsp;and I believe Xbox one (should be called Xbox 0) is running W8&nbsp;at the core since everything striped out of it such as Media Center has been removed
 from W8 also people do use&nbsp;Media Center and it's Extender feature as I do to save money on there cable bills I have a Ceton Cable Card tuner&nbsp; and use my 4 gig 360's as extenders I like being in control of my TV not letting the Cable Co control me! The FCC
 seems to be on my side on this! why &nbsp;would I buy a Xbox one when you killed the Main function I use my 360 for? sure Ceton sells a stand alone extender that I may have to buy a few when my 360's die! but my main PC can play any game your consoles play and
 better since I am in control of the hardware I can install up to 4 Graphics cards Play and burn BluRay and DVD's via HDMI in 3D on my 55" Plasma TV My main rig makes your latest and greatest OS and Console look like a 1980's Texas instruments Calculator!&nbsp;Wait
 TI made a home Computer once I just remember I owned one, and as I see in your closing statement the end used is just a Beta tester reporting issues just to be told to deal with it and try something risky to see if it works as a temporary fix till M$ get around
 to fixing it! nothing in the last 20 years has been ready for primetime when you cut it loose on the public!!! XP for example 2 service packs that basically replaced the OS twice it won't even fit on the Hard Drives that were considered large back when XP
 came out! I own a PC repair/Custom build business and just sold a used PC to someone that was a Dell pre installed with XP Pro it still has a 7 Gig drive I had to replace because all the Modifications M$ made to XP left about 5% free on the drive after the
 updates even after I deleted the junk Temp Files no M$ OS removes after the updates have been installed it just takes up space in the c:/windows/SoftwareDistribution/Download directory the system cleanup tool does not even remove them this is sloppy programing
 but you get my point unless you were born in the 80's or earlier then you have no Idea what goes on behind the GUI M$ get your act together quit being greedy you will make more money being honest and fair to your customers what really gets me is charging/requiring
 &nbsp;people&nbsp; to have a Gold Account to access the net on a Console they own pay to power, pay for their internet your just being a bridge troll demanding money to use a bridge they have already paid for! how you brainwashed people into paying a toll? the act it's
 self it pure greed and immoral I can see if they were leasing the equipment but that is far from the case! And back to W8 how you were able to sell it for $35.00 when I got it and gave away free media center keys? now you want how much for W8 and $9.00 something
 for Media Center. Im done I am sure this will get moderated into oblivion because the truth hurts and the last thing you want is you customers opening there eyes and taking off the blinders M$ managed to put on millions of people. you have a chance to be the
 company you once were when Gates started M$.</p>

            I have been using Aver's 3D Beta installation and have not had problems until The Preview Team switched their &nbsp;9948 Built I was using and change to their 9926 Built yesterday. Since then, my Aver 3D Program keeps asking to be restarted. Are there any different
 installation querks that were added to 9948 and not 9926. Other then disturbing my watching the Super Bowl with "restarts", all else seems to be "dressed to the 10s".

<h2>            Desktop is gone</h2>
                    Hi, this morning I turned on my pc and my desktop is missing. Not the icons or the folder, but the desktop view in windows 10 itself. All I can see are the tiles. They are taking up the full screen too. There is no desktop tile and when I&nbsp;look at my task
 view, It does not have the option of opening a new desktop like it usually does. I will occasionally get glimpses of my desktop. It will flash sometimes when I open an app. I have a Lenovo yoga 3 pro and I upgraded to windows 10 as soon as it came out. Please
 help, I don't want to be stuck in tile hell any longer, it's the whole reason that I upgraded.

            I had this same issue on my laptop after I restarted my computer tonight. I tired the 2 methods posted by&nbsp;Arun B, but&nbsp;neither worked for me. I started randomly clicking my mouse pad with multiple fingers and when I clicked it with 3 fingers it brought
 up the search window and restored my start menu to being just the on the&nbsp;left side of the screen and my desktop showed back up. I am not sure why this fixed it, but I thought I would share it, just in case it can fix your issue (if you are still having it).

I tried both and neither made a change. In the second recommendation after entering the command and enter it never went back to the command line there was just a flashing&nbsp; cursor _&nbsp; that would not accept key strokes, either the second command or exit. Does
 that mean that the original command was still working and if so how long to anticipate it to stay the same and go back to the command line to reenter. I just X'd out and then reentered using the second command with the same result. Neither which made any diffenence.

<h2>            My desktop computer thinks it&#39;s a mobile device</h2>
                    My Dell desktop computer running Windows 7 seems to be sending info through Internet Explorer 8 that my computer is a mobile device. When I click on my desktop link to The Weather Network I now get redirected to "mobile.theweathernetwork.com" instead of
 "theweathernetwork.com". This has just started happening recently. How do i change this back to a desktop computer?

<p>*************************************************</p>
<p><em><strong>What is System Restore?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>System Restore helps you restore your computer's system files to an earlier point in time</strong>.
<u>It's a way to undo system changes to your computer without affecting your personal files, such as e‑mail, documents, or photos.</u></em>
</p>
<p><em>Sometimes, the installation of a program or a driver can cause an unexpected change to your computer or cause
<span>Windows</span> to behave unpredictably. Usually, uninstalling the program or driver corrects the problem. If uninstalling does not fix the problem, you can try restoring your computer's system to an earlier date when everything worked correctly.</em></p>
<p><em>System Restore uses a feature called System Protection to regularly create and save restore points on your computer. These restore points contain information about registry settings and other system information that
<span>Windows</span> uses. You can also create restore points manually.</em></p>
<p><em>System Restore is not intended for backing up personal files, so it cannot help you recover a personal file that has been deleted or damaged. You should regularly back up your personal files and important data using a backup program.</em></p>
<p><em>***************************************************</em></p>
<p>Using System Restore with&nbsp;restore point made just prior to the problem occurring will not affect your program files. Make sure though that critical data and files are backed up. Personally I backup critical files (ie. financial data,&nbsp;documents and an exhaustive
 digital photo archive)&nbsp;on my wife's Win 7 desktop automatically each night and our personal Win 7 laptop weekly.</p>
<p>Sorry I can't help further...</p>

            Hey Al_949,
<br />
<br />No problem, I may have a solution for you.
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + I together. You should see Windows Settings appear. Go into the Apps menu option, then navigate to Default apps on the left pane.
<br />
<br />Scroll down until you see "Choose default apps by file type". Change it to another program if you have one.
<br />
<br />If you have *no* application to replace it and want to remove the association entirely, this is a more exhaustive solution, but should do the trick:
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + R together, then type in regedit. That should bring you into the registry editor. Navigate to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, then find the extension. For example, if it is a .doc file, look for the key ".doc", then remove it.
<br />
<br />Hope that was helpful.       
        </p>

            Yes, for the .pages extension i have word as my default program so from your solution how would i continue from there ?

            In context with the second solution:
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + R together, then type in regedit. That should bring you into the registry editor. Navigate to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT on the left pane, then find the extension. In your case, it's a .pages file, so look for the key ".pages" under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, then once you find the key ".pages", remove it. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if this works.

            Al_949,
<br />
<br />Not necessarily. What this does is the next time you open a .pages extension, it asks you what default app to use on there.
<br />
<br />I'd also recommend for you to find .pages in these locations in the Registry Editor, they will appear as keys, for instance ".pages" will be a key in there, and from there you just delete it:
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Roaming\OpenWith\FileExts\
<br />
<br />Let me know how it goes.

            .pages is not an actual extension and is more of a compressed file that can either be extracted so you can view the tiff file or open it on a Mac installed with pages.

            Hi Al_949, it is not easy to remove a file association in Windows 10,
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the view Ribbon (tab) check the box marked 'File Name Extensions'
<br />
<br />Close File Explorer
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop and choose New - Text File
<br />
<br />Change the file extension on that new file from .txt to .exe
<br />
<br />Confirm the change
<br />
<br />Right click a .package  file, choose open with - Choose another App 
<br />
<br />Check the box marked 'Always use this app to open .package  files' - IMPORTANT! 
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom and click 'More Apps' 
<br />
<br />Again scroll to the bottom and choose 'Find another app on this PC' 
<br />
<br />Navigate to the dummy file exe on your Desktop and click OK
<br />
<br />The .package  file will not open 
<br />
<br />Delete the dummy exe file on your Desktop and restart your PC 
<br />
<br />The file association will then be broken!

            Hey MathewChin1,
<br />
<br />You can tackle this a couple of ways. Press CTRL + ALT + DEL to open up an array of options. You'll then click "Change a password". From there, only enter your old password, keep the new password fields blank. Hit ENTER.
<br />
<br />Another way you can do this (you can probably do this in tandem with the previous method) is hit Windows key + R to go into Run, then enter: netplwiz
<br />
<br />Now a new User Accounts window should appear. Uncheck "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer".
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, let me know if you need any additional assistance.       
        </p>

            Hi Matthew, to remove the need for a password in Windows 10 and get it working like all previous versions of Windows, you must first switch from a Microsoft account to a local account:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and enter a new password or leave it blank as appropriate 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />In the resulting dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer box' 
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>
