<h2>            A Promise to Microsoft About the Next Xbox.</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>I have been an Xbox fan since Halo CE and an Xbox Live member for about 8 years, as I am sure many people on these forums are. I waited in line on launch day to get an Xbox 360 and have since bought more games and accessories than I can even count.</p>
<p>I tell you that to establish that I am a core gamer and a huge Xbox fan, and I have been because Xbox 360 is the best gaming console I have ever had. You have all done such a tremendous job on this platform that it still astounds me sometimes.</p>
<p>All of this being said, some of the things I have been hearing about the next Xbox have made me think that you just might mess all of this up. This became even more concerning when I watched SimCity, one of my most beloved franchises, turn into a train wreck
 because a company decided that having always-online DRM was more important than making an easy and enjoyable experience for gamers.</p>
<p>So, I am going to make a very simple promise right now: Make the next Xbox have an always-online requirement and I WILL NOT BUY IT. I don't care how many great games you make for it, I refuse to buy a console that doesn't let me play games how, when, and
 where I want and I definitely don't want to support a company that put&nbsp;foolish anti-piracy measures ahead of what is best for the user experience.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.<br />
- Daniel&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>I hope I have spoken for many other Xbox fans here. If I have, please join me, right here on this form, by committing to not support an always-online Xbox. If Microsoft is currently planning on doing this they still have one month to change their minds!</p>

<p>It is currently all Chinese whispers and rumours at the moment, it is not offical untill Microsoft makes a press release. But if it is the case that if it is an always online device I am with you buddy and a lot of gamers will be too.</p>

<p>You can still play whenever you want to, you just have to be online when you do it. I would much rather be online all the time than play with a bunch of hackers and people who stole the same game I payed for. Xbox is still awesome, and I have full confidence
 that Microsoft will one up Sony. Also, from a business perspective it would be amazing to be able to sell games through a company that has far less pirates as "customers." Edit: Also, everything is speculation; I have not heard anything official about the
 next gen xbox. There is <a href="http://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-the-next-xbox-480112913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> link, and everything on it says "probably" or "think," no one knows for sure what the next gen will hold.</p>

<p>@Quail, this would mean no more Lan games/parties, or tournaments that aren't pro tournaments. Also if your internet failed for what ever reason, failed to pay the bill, or they are doing maintenance your xbox would not work. This would also mean if xbox
 live went down (which it does pretty often) your xbox would not work during those times. &nbsp;</p>

<p>True Webduelist, I would have to deal with any eventuality of my internet service stopping for whatever reason, but LAN parties do not lose their luster simply because you are connected to the internet. I am willing to be inconvenienced to not play my Xbox
 for whatever maintenance reasons, as I understand that everything needs to be maintained. I have however not had a loss in internet connection in quite some time (6 months I think), and I am quite confident that I will rarely be inconvenienced.</p>

<p>@Quail The main reason I am against always online DRM is that it is extremely difficult to make such a system truly seamless and easy for the gamer. If you look at what's happened with SimCity, which has been a complete catastrophe, it's because the massive
 server requirements of the always-online system got in the way of simply playing the game.</p>
<p>Also, in all my years of playing Xbox 360 I have only encountered "hackers" on maybe two occasions. Most people I have met that pirate Xbox games cannot play them online or are banned after playing with a hacked system for a short while.</p>

<p>I feel the same way guys. An always online connection all the time, come on microsoft think about your consumers all over the world and especially 3rd world countries where the internet is freaking slow . I planned on gettin the new xbox, but with all these
 rumors i may head to PS4, what a shame though, all my hard work for nothing, getting my gamerscore where it is today.Well we shall wait till may 21st to see if all these rumors are true., cuz honestly i hope there are false.</p>

<p>Well Dan of Blades, whether always online DRM is used or not I want to see a future where someone actually has to pay for a game; and get punished for stealing one. Also, I don't think Microsoft would actually consider implementing always on DRM since it
 would probably hinder sales because of the ease of use and simplicity you mentioned; however you have to take into consideration that pirates have stolen products that amount to more money that actually exists (true that was from the RIAA but if piracy is
 this rampant in the music industry just think of how bad it is in the game industry) so perhaps they could gain from it. This topic is quite hard to side on, being both in favor of less hacking and less customer issues.</p>

    <title>Want to downgrade to Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Want to downgrade to Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: I do not work well with virtual agents, can I chat with a human?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just received a new laptop. It has Windows 8 which is the worst customer interface I have ever seen. I want to return to Windows 7 but do not have disk. I have been told that I need to reformat the computer then install 7 from a disk. I have used
 a company computer for 2 years with OEM Windows 7 so no disk and before that I had OEM Vista on a computer that died so no disk. I find Windows 8 unfriendly and having it jump to the "start" page without warning is frustrating. I do not have a 'smart phone'
 or any device with a touch screen and what I have seen of them I do not like. How can I get back to Windows 7 without obtaining an illegal copy since I have 'paid' for Windows 8? I am sure that I can get a copy of 7 but I am trying to do it legally.<br />

            What exactly do you mean by, "you received a new laptop"? You did not pay for it? If you did not pay for it why do you expect to "receive" a "free" copy of Windows 7 because you dislike the later? Buying a license for one is not like buying a license for
 the other. Windows 7 and Windows 8 are like apples and oranges. I think you're stuck my friend. Interesting to read all the customer complaints on what many MS experts are calling the best operating system ever released, not. This is fun.

<p>You will first need to go to the manufacturers website for your model computer and first find out if there are Windows 7 native drivers available. A lot of computers that come preloaded with Windows 8 do not have native driver support for Windows 7 by the
 manufacturer. If there are no native drivers, you will have to consider returning the machine and purchasing a machine preloaded with Windows 8 Pro with downgrade rights to Windows 7 Professional. Or look through the manufacturers catalogue for systems already
 preloaded with Windows 7, usually the business line will have these options. </p>
<b>
<p>Additional information:</p>

<p>Since you want to downgrade to Windows 7 to meet the business requirement, you may refer this article and check if it helps.</p>

<font><span>
<p>Consumer versions of Windows 8 Pro that come preinstalled on PCs have downgrade rights to a previous version of Windows (example: Windows 7, Windows Vista).</p>
<p>If your copy came pre-installed on your system, you may downgrade your copy to Windows 7.</p>
<p>If not you need purchase a copy of Windows 7 and install the same on your computer.</p>
<p>• Downgrade rights are only available for licenses obtained through OEM or Volume Licensing (VL) and not apply to Full version (FPP).</p>
<p>• OEM downgrade rights apply to Windows 8 Pro and allows for downgrades up to two prior version</p>
<p>• Software Assurance through VL (Volume licensing) provides the greatest flexibility, allowing for downgrades to all prior versions and editions besides Windows 7 Ultimate and Vista Ultimate editions.Without Software Assurance coverage, VL has downgrade
 rights to prior versions of Windows with the exception of Enterprise.</p>
<p>• It is not possible for a Windows 8 copy with multi-language function to downgrade to Windows 7 Pro or Windows XP Pro as multi language function is exclusive to Windows 7 Enterprise edition and not available for Professional edition.</p>

            By received I mean it was bought for me. All except one comment I have heard was negative. That one said if I got used to it it was 'fun'. I am not looking for fun I am looking for useable. The feature where sliding my finger across the touch pad sends
 me off to somewhere else is frustrating. Your weather app finally let me enter other locations but won't show them. Your games app goes to xbox games when I want the simple games i have used for years; solitaire, minesweeper, hearts, etc. I opened the minesweeper
 game and got multiple versions, challenges, etc when I wanted the windows 98 version. I do not play online games I only play the standard windows game to relax now I am being forced to change, When I want a map I go to google maps where I can find what I want
 and see street views which help me find where I want to go. You have My yahoo streaming on the start screen, I want to go to yahoo and face book by an onscreen folder not an app. I understand that people are using these apps. However there are some of your
 customers who have specific desires as far as what a computer is used for. I am 66 years old. I want a computer to do my email, to access websites, to write stories and personal reports, to work with excel and publisher style programs, maybe to watch hulu
 or similar sites. Many of your customers are older and often poorer. We can only adapt so much. Taking Windows 7 completely off the market forces them to use older and because of you, obsolete equipment. The progression from 3,1 to 7 has been difficult but
 has been a logical step by step process. For Windows 8 you have brought in stuff that we have little experience with and are forcing us to figure it out on our own. Why must you take off older versions? Keeping them will give people time to see advantages
 in newer systems while giving those who prefer the older systems a chance to learn new and maybe better methods.<br />

 horrible, cannot describle how horrible it is, I am returning my new lap top and looking to buy a used one with windows xp or 7 on it. cause this is tooo crappy. watched the tutorial several times, should not be this difficult, I use computers and smart phones
 daily . this is just the worst os ever.

            <p>It is ridiculous reading this stuff.&nbsp; Mostly because the comments &amp; (mis)judgement of Windows 8 is&nbsp;are far from reality.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screens do not change or flip by themselves.&nbsp; Many people like Start &amp; its Tiles.&nbsp; If you don't &amp; the whole idea or approach seems strange or unappealing... just use the good ole familiar Desktop.<br />
<br />
In fact, there is a way (I put it in this Forum, already) that one can live 100% of the time on Desktop and access everything from there w/out ever changing screens.<br />
<br />
Do not add 3rd Party 'start' stuff... there is no need.<br />
<br />
If you can't understand Windows 8 or can't find instructions on using it, let me know.&nbsp; I will be glad to help you.&nbsp; It is VERY useable &amp; very easy to use.<br />
<br />
Ask me for tips.<br />
<br />
It is a very good OS &amp; reverting back to a previous OS is not the wisest thing to do.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<p>Although, (&amp; true, some don't 'get it') migrating to Windows 10 from 7 SP1 &amp; 8.1 throws support concerns re prior OSs)&nbsp;and any sense of "limbo" to the curb.&nbsp; XP is so old it's, already, 'off the table' but, again, Upgrading to Win10 negates any concerns
 over XP being history, too; including having buy an OS , again.<br />

<h3> phantom.atom  say:</h3>
<h2>            LaserJet 3055 AIO connected via home network not working with Windows 7 64-bit for fax and scan.</h2>
                    I have an HP LaserJet 3055 AIO and Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate. I managed to get it to work as a printer only. I cannot find any way to get fax and scan working. The LaserJet 3055 is listed as being fully supported in the compatibility site. Apparently to
 get the fax and scan working I need the "full software solution", but I cannot find any software solution&nbsp;for Windows 7 64-bit. If I plug the AIO in to my laptop via USB,&nbsp;it recognizes the fax and scan capabilities via PCL6 driver and I can use MS fax and&nbsp;scan&nbsp;or&nbsp;printer
 driver. However, via network connection,&nbsp;it only recognizes the printer. Can someone help as I invested a lot of money buying this AIO as well as my laptop and Windows 7. Thanks!<br />

<p>Hi phantom.atom ,</p>
<p>Try with the HP LaserJet 3050/3052/3055/3390/3392 PCL6 Plug and Play Scan/Print Driver Package<br />
from the link below.</p>
<p><a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareIndex.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodNameId=1140780&amp;prodTypeId=18972&amp;prodSeriesId=1161389&amp;swLang=8&amp;taskId=135&amp;swEnvOID=228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareIndex.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodNameId=1140780&amp;prodTypeId=18972&amp;prodSeriesId=1161389&amp;swLang=8&amp;taskId=135&amp;swEnvOID=228</strong></a></p>
<p>See if installing the above driver helps in getting the scan and fax to work over home network.</p>
<p>You may also check with this universal printer driver:<br />
<a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareIndex.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodNameId=1140780&amp;prodTypeId=18972&amp;prodSeriesId=1161389&amp;swLang=8&amp;taskId=135&amp;swEnvOID=4063#113266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareIndex.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodNameId=1140780&amp;prodTypeId=18972&amp;prodSeriesId=1161389&amp;swLang=8&amp;taskId=135&amp;swEnvOID=4063#113266</strong></a></p>
<p><br />
See whichever helps you in getting the scan and fax to work.</p>
<p>Before installing the downloaded drivers, remove the current windows 7 drivers from the device manager for printer.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Go to start orb and type device manager in the search field.<br />
2.&nbsp;Select Device manager form the control panel list.<br />
3.&nbsp;Locate the printer, right click on it and select properties.<br />
4.&nbsp;Go to driver tab and click on the uninstall button.<br />
5.&nbsp;Follow the on screen instruction.<br />
6.&nbsp;Restart your computer. <br />
Now run the driver installation, test and see if the issue is fixed.</p>
<p>If none of the drivers work, I will suggest you to contact HP for support.</p>

                    <p>The most recent posts I can find about this subject are from 2013. You said that there might be vulnerabilities to using Gadgets.&nbsp; Now in 2016, did you fix that vulnerability? Are gadgets now safe? The posts from 2013 said that a danger was that we might
 download a gadget the has a malicious code in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the only ones I want to use are the clock, calendar, and weather. Those are from Microsoft, right? So, those are safe, right? Or not.&nbsp; Or is the Weather one from weather. com, and is not not trustworthy?</p>

                    <p>I am running Windows. 8.1, but was originally running Windows 8. I have always had trouble with the windows updates, to the extent where I've had to completely restore my laptop to factory settings but it appears this has not helped.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Alice,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the effort that you have put to try and fix the issue till now. </p>
<p>Error code “<strong>0x80070490</strong>” might occur if the Windows Component-Based Servicing (CBS) manifest is corrupted.</p>
<ol>
<li>Was Windows 8 came preinstalled on the computer?</li><li>When you say factory reset, did you perform such an&nbsp;action on Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating system?</li><li>Do you have a third party security software installed on the laptop?</li></ol>
<p>As far as performing a repair installation is concerned, if you are doing so using a Windows 8 DVD/media, you will receive the an error message saying that the disc is not the correct one as you will need to use Windows 8.1 media. But, you can perform a
 “<strong>Refresh</strong>” using a Windows 8 media. This, in result, will revert the operating system back to Windows 8 (if Windows 8 was preinstalled). From there, you can use the update in Store to upgrade to Windows 8.1. At this moment, rather than performing
 a refresh and loosing apps installed on the computer, let’s troubleshoot the issue related to Windows Update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to reset Windows Update components and check if it fixes the issue. Follow the methods:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the link to do so. Refer to the section “<strong>Windows 8.1, Windows 8 and Windows 7”</strong></p>
<p>If the troubleshooter does not work, refer to the section “<strong>Manually reset Windows Update components</strong>” to reset Windows Update components manually from the link;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added
 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, you can refer to the following steps to back the registry files on the computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows and R</strong> keys to open the run box.</li><li>Type ‘<strong>regedit’ </strong>and press <strong>Enter </strong>from the keyboard.</li><li>Open the <strong>file </strong>option on the menu bar.</li><li>Click on <strong>Export </strong>and save the file with a name on the desktop.</li><li>If you want to restore the file, you can do so by double clicking the file that you have saved on the desktop.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s place the laptop in a clean boot state and try installing the updates. Refer to the link below to do so:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Windows 8</strong>”</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Please refer to the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. Sorry mine is so late.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows 8 was pre installed, and I only recently updated to windows 8.1</p>
<p>2. I did the factory reset the other month back when the laptop was running windows 8 rather than windows 8.1</p>
<p>3. The only security software I have is anti-virus. I had norton pre installed on laptop but when that run out I removed it and now have AVG</p>
<p>
</p><p>That makes sense about the refresh thank you for explaining.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted method one and it helped. It allowed me to do the updates. However I am still slightly worried - out of curiosity I ran the update troubleshooter and I got the message 'Potential
 Windows Update Database error detected 0x80070490'. It says it fixes it yet every time I run the troubleshooter it still come up with that same message. It just makes me believe that there is still an underlying problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Glad to know that method 1 has helped to fix the issue as you are now able to install the updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue related to Windows Update troubleshooter which still shows the same error code, let's rename the Windows Update folders such as Software Distribution folder and check if it resolves the issue. Follow the methods mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Follow the steps provided below: </p>
<ul>
<li><span>Type “<strong>cmd</strong>” on the Start screen and right click on Command Prompt. Choose<strong> Run as administrator</strong>.
<br />
without quotes in the search box.</span></li><li><span><strong>Paste </strong>the commands and hit <strong>Enter</strong> after each command.</span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>net stop wuauserv</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net stop cryptSvc </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net stop bits </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net stop msiserver </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old </span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net start wuauserv </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net start cryptSvc </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net start bits </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net start msiserver </span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Wait or the process to complete. </span></li><li><span><strong>Close </strong>the Command Prompt.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Check if you still receive the same error code when you run Windows Update troubleshooter. If yes, proceed to the next method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p>Run SFC scan and check if finds and fixes corrupt system files. </p>
<p>Refer to the link to run SFC scan:</p>
<p>Follow the steps from section "<strong>Windows 8.1 or Windows 8</strong>":</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted both method 1 and 2 and I am still receiving the same error message after running the update troubleshooter. The scf can did not find any corrupt files and finished with the message '<strong>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity
 violations'.</strong></p>
<p>Out of interest I went onto my files to check that the renaming process worked in method 1 and noticed I had many folders called SoftwareDistribution ending with .bak , .bak1 , .bak2 ect. &nbsp;I just thought I'd mention it in case it helped
 at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thank you for trying to help me&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Alice,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.&nbsp;I appreciate the effort that you have put to try and fix the issue till now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it seems that some or the other file is causing the troubleshooter to show up the error code and this might lead to an issue while installing an update offered from Windows Update in the future.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you u sing a purchased version of AVG security software which is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>If you are using a purchased version of AVG, I would suggest you to find out the purchase details for the software. You may find it in your email account. If not, you can contact AVG support for instance. After collecting them, uninstall AVG from the computer.
 You can use the <a href="http://www.avg.com/ca-en/utilities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AVG uninstaller </a>
to uninstall it completely. You can also refer to the link to know the details on how to uninstall AVG from Windows 8/8.1:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avg.com/ww-en/faq.num-5172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avg.com/ww-en/faq.num-5172</a></p>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: Security software can help protect your computer against virus and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the troubleshooter and check if it still finds and fixes the same error code. If yes, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new user account </a>and check if the issue still persists. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please let us know the results.

            <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I have not got the paid version of AVG I un installed it as you said in method 1. This still gives me the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried method 2, I created a new user account, with a new Microsoft email and everything and then ran the troubleshooter on that account (I did not delete my other user profile though) Still getting same message.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for all your help, this is quite frustrating now haha</p>

</p><p>Apologize for the delayed response.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Perhaps, Windows Update troubleshooter is unable to detect the changes that were made after resetting the services for Windows Update and components or the software distribution folder.

<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to run the DISM commands and check if it fixes the issue:</span></p>

<p>I had the same problem - reinstalled windows, updated it with service pack 3 and wireless tab was not visible. I couldn't view any wireless networks. WZC was started and running. Tried several suggestions on different threads but none seemed to help.</p>
<p>This finally helped:</p>
<p>Click on 'View available networks' and then 'Change advanced settings'.</p>
<p>Under 'Wireless Network Connection Properties', click on 'Advanced' tab.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the advanced window I had a link to setup network connections (I am not able to find it now - so don't know the exact name) and clicked on it. It led me through a series of steps where I clicked next/ok. Finally, after finishing it, the
 wireless networks tab appeared! Dunno why!</p>

<h2>            acer aspire 5000 laptop no longer recognizes bluetooth radio in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Bluetooth Device not found on my laptop. I know it's there...</p>
<p>For some reason, my laptop (acer aspire 5000) can no longer find my bluetooth radio.&nbsp; It says to "properly" connect it or turn it on (???)</p>
<p>All bluetooth functions are enabled - I checked. I have tried the troubleshooting, and always end up being advised to rollback the bluetooth driver (but there appears to be no driver backup). The driver appears to be up to date. Is the driver the problem?</p>
<p>Very grateful for your advice!</p>
<p>Cheers, E</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Do you have a cd or dvd for the bluetooth device by the manufacturer?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the bluetooth devices and check if it fixes the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Uninstall or change a program<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</a></p>
<p>Try uninstalling the device driver from device manager and restart to load the drivers automatically and see if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>To do that:</strong></p>
<p>1. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance,and then clicking Device Manager. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the assword or provide confirmation.<br />
2. In Device Manager, locate the Device, and then double-click the device name.<br />
3. Click the Driver tab, and then click Uninstall Driver and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>Restart your computer and check if it loads the drivers automatically.</p>

<h2>            &#91;FIXED&#93; Windows 7 hangs&#47;freezes on reboot after applying Meltdown&#47;Spectre update &#40;KB4056894, January 2018 Monthly Rollup&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my PC configuration:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Intel Core i5 2500K</li><li>16GB RAM<br />
</li><li>Asus P8P67 Pro BIOS 3602 (the <a href="https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/P8P67_PRO/HelpDesk_BIOS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest</a> available release).</li><li>NVIDIA GTX 1060 6GB</li><li>Windows 7 64</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After applying the aforementioned patch the system hangs/freezes on reboot (some people erroneously call it "restart"). The monitor first goes black, then powers down but nothing happens - the system keeps running without actually rebooting. I have to press
 the reset button on my case in order to reboot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no messages in the system log after rebooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like this patch makes Windows send the wrong sequence of instructions for this CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has never been the case for this PC prior to this update. Linux reboots just fine. Windows 7 prior to this update has always rebooted just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue goes away once you uninstall this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please investigate and fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit 2018-02-10 09:48pm </strong><strong><strong>GMT</strong>: the issue is related to CPU C-states handling (C3 or C6), so it might or might not be related to the KPTI patches added in this update. One thing is sure: it's a major regression.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit 2018-02-14: KB4074598 doesn't fix the issue. Systems with Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge CPUs are affected.<br />
<br />
Edit 2018-02-26: Woody Leonhard mentioned <a href="https://www.askwoody.com/2018/weird-hibernation-state-on-reboot-attributed-to-win7-patches/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the issue</a> in his Ask Woody blog. The initial reporter is utterly confused though, says that reboot leads to hibernation. No, it does not lead to hibernation at all.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
Edit 2018-03-13: KB4088875 fixes the issue.</strong></p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem on multiple computers from multiple vendors: Dell Optiplex 790, Optiplex 390, and Lenovo M82s. All running Win7 x64, and exhibiting the problem whereby sometimes the rebooting process will hang just before the PC actually
 turns off, leaving it in this state:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Monitor is inactive</p>
<p>* Keyboard has no USB power</p>
<p>* Power light and Power supply fans remain on</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboots work fine in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling KB4056894 and KB4056897 resolve the problem. Installing the February preview brings the problem back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On identically-imaged PCs, some seem to fail rarely if ever, and one fails almost every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a great many experiments, including updating BIOS and drivers, uninstalling antivirus, Deep Freeze (interestingly, only computers that we have configured with Deep Freeze are failing, although Deep Freeze machines need many more reboots than regular
 PCs), leaving the domain and joining a different domain and a workgroup, selective startups, etc. etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately, I found one setting change in the BIOS that seemed to do the trick. I disabled C-State Control on an Optiplex 390, and now this one PC seems to reboot properly (at least it did 20 times ina&nbsp; row). I will be testing additional PCs with this workaround
 soon, but wanted to float this to see if anyone else can confirm that this improves matters. Or if there's a better workaround.</p>

<p>@ FPL Guy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my C-State settings on my ASUS P8P67-M motherboard and they were set to the default settings in the ASUS manual.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>C1E [enabled]</p>
<p>C3 Report [disabled]</p>
<p>C6 Report [enabled]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Playing around by setting different combinations, I found the C1E enabled/disabled did not matter, so left it enabled.&nbsp; However, by setting C6 Report to DISABLED, I have now been able to perform a normal restart/reboot from Windows 7.&nbsp; Tried at least half
 dozen times and all good so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for investigating this and putting me on the right path to correct this issue.&nbsp; Microsoft has caused me so many lost hours of troubleshooting problems they inject with updates you wonder if they have any quality control.</p>
<p>

<p>@Ben1907 ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for verifying that the C-state workaround works for your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also confirm that C6 seems to be the problem. While my Optiplexes don't offer any granularity in their BIOS (C-States either all enabled, or all disabled), my Lenovo M82s have three settings: C1, C1+C3, and C1+C3+C6. My early tests last Friday suggested
 that the only state that didn't work was C6. So if I leave it&nbsp;as C1+C3, the system seems to reboot fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You used the phrase "correct this issue."&nbsp; It's not so much a correction as a crutch. I measured the power consumption change in my Lenovos, and in my application, the system&nbsp;uses 3W more&nbsp;when C6 is disabled. &nbsp;Haven't measured my Optiplexes yet, but I suspect
 the difference is more substantial, which is unfortunate. With my M82s, there was a full&nbsp;10W difference at idle between C1 and C1+C3+C6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's quite mysterious why so few people seem to have this reboot problem. It has the feel of some sort of race condition. Half of my PCs seem to have no trouble whatsoever. Are you running anything unusual on your PCs? The affected ones that I have are domain-joined
 with lots of GPOs, roaming profiles, and are using the following applications:</p>
<p>Vipre antimalware, Faronics Deep Freeze, Cybrarian access/time control, MS Office 2013, Java, Irfanview, Flash, Reader</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, leaving the domain and uninstalling most of these programs&nbsp;has had no effect. I did not try a clean install of Windows to see if that helped, but that was next on my list to try&nbsp;(clean install, and gradually add things back to see if/when the problem
 recurred).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you see anything in common with your system setup?</p>
<p>

<p>Looks like you don't expect a reply from me but I'll reply anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can reproduce this bug on a brand new Windows 7 64 installation (of course with the "bad" update installed) and zero additional software aside from necessary drivers (NVIDIA GPU and RealTek HDA).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it doesn't seem like a race condition of any kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for a low number of people reporting this issue: there are only a few Sandy Bridge / Ivy Bridge owners remaining and most of them have already upgraded to either Windows 8.1 or 10 which seem not to be affected by this regression (I guess ntoskrnl has
 changed quite a lot since Windows 7).</p>

<p>Thank you @ultrafine, that saves me some experimentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Lenovo M82s experience this bug, and they are Haswell machines from late 2013.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe from what I've read that Windows 7 and Windows 10 have roughly similar market shares right now (one report says Win10 slightly higher, and another Win7 somewhat higher). But either way, there must be millions of similar (Haswell or earlier) PCs
 out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does modifying the available C-States cause the problem to go away for your systems?</p>

<p>Disabling C6 made no difference but when I <strong>also</strong> disabled C3 the bug was gone. I'm too lazy to check whether it's just C3 + C6 or just C3 which affects my system - one thing is sure: along with KPTI they introduced a major regression in regard
 to reboot handling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm astonished so few people are reporting the problem. At the moment it's just us, three, and the guy who reported a similar issue in a different thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And considering how different our devices are it's surely a low level kernel bug which has nothing to do with the rest of the installed software on your PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not ready to sacrifice power savings granted by these options, so I will continue to use my system with all the C-states enabled - beside, my primary OS is Linux and it works just fine. As for Windows - I use it only for gaming, so I'm OK with powering
 down my system or using the hardware reset button. ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any of you guys have a company-wide software contract with Microsoft you should file a bug report. I'm a home user, so I'm quite sure my report will be dismissed as erroneous or absolutely minor.</p>

<p>I have just my single home PC with Windows 7 - 64bit, no networks or anything odd.&nbsp; If you read my original post on this issue, you can see all the things I did try to resolve it and nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect you won't see a lot of people reporting this issue since many may never even preform a restart unless a monthly update calls for it or some other update does.&nbsp; Or they just simple power off/on or hit reset like we had to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I frequently perform a restart for software updates, or to switch booting to my XP drive ( I have a dual boot system), enjoy some older games that play better on XP then Windows 7 or some that use DOSBOX on my XP setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If around 3w additional is all that's used, guess I will keep the work-around, but I'm not holding my breath that the root cause will be fixed in a future update.</p>

<p>Yeah, I have about 35 PCs that are exhibiting this problem sporadically, and they reboot a lot more often than home PCs, since they do so automatically several times a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like about 30 other people have this problem. It is amazing that there aren't more, you're right!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using a 3rd party antivirus on your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using a 3rd party antivirus on your computer, disable it and check. Refer to the following steps.</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>a) On your Computer screen Task Bar next to System Clock.</font></font></span>
<span><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></font></span> </p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>b) You will see the third-party Security Software Icon.</font></font></span>
<span><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></font></span> </p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>c) Click on the third-party Security Software Icon, you will see a pop up.</font></font></span>
<span><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></font></span> </p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>d) In that pop and select the option to disable, click on it.</font></font></span>
<span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span> </p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>e) Now the third-party Security Software will be disabled.</font></font></span>
<span><font color="#000000"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></font></span> </p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><span><font>You may try by resetting &nbsp;the App cache. Refer to these steps.</font></span></p>
<p><span><span><font>a.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><font>Press
<b><font>Windows key + R </font></b>to open run window.</font></span></p>
<p><span><span><font>b.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><font>Type <b>
<font>wsreset.exe</font></b>.</font></span></p>
<p><span><span><font>c.</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><font>Press
<b><font>OK</font></b>.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Have also encountered the same problem as the gentleman above (0xx800700E - 0x2000C). this happened after installing 8.0 pro 64bit, accepting the automatic updates for 8.0 and then going to the store and downloading 8.1. No software was installed &amp; it was
 a clean install on a blank Hard Drive! Have tried the download twice with the same result.</p>
<p>Had no problems upgrading my other computer's 8&nbsp;when 8.1 upgrade first became available. Seem to remember downloading the file manually first and then running it! Can I still obtain the file?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated please. My internet connection is very slow and it takes ages to download anything!</p>
<p>

<h2>            couldn&#39;t install Rise of Nations game in windows vista 64-bit</h2>
                    After running the setup.exe from the CD, progress bar shows 100% file copy complete but the installation is not yet complete and still showing "Updating System Setting"...however, i suspect that it is not working because the progress bar didn't change
 for 30 minutes or more...How to fix this?<br />
<br />
Btw, what is the approx. time to&nbsp;complete the installation? Thanks, hope to hear from you

    <title>Bad lag but good connection&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> codyskooma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bad lag but good connection&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So the past week or 2 I have had a bad online experience with gaming. My lag on my xbox has made it almost unplayable. I have done the basics; reset modem/router, reset xbox, and&nbsp;clear mac data. Doing these do not help. I contacted my isp (charter) and they ran tests on their end, which ended up fine.&nbsp;My modem came up running fine, a wired speed test of 112mb download, 5.6mb upload, 50ms latency. Wireless speed of 56mb download, 4.7mb upload, same latency. Yet for some reason, my games keep rubberbanding and having multiple second delays in gameplay. Any way I can fix this? I have ran these speed tests both on my laptop and xbox one. Xbox showing the most drastic results</p>

    <title>Cannot perform Task from Admin User Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rakeshthorat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot perform Task from Admin User Account</h2>
                    <p>I will breakdown the whole situation about the problems I have with windows10 below.</p>
<p>I have two accounts for name sake home and office, home was the administrator before I upgraded to W10, I upgraded while I was at office, and I think because of that the office account became administrator, it sounds weird, even I felt so but I realized
 it when I could use some features only from office account without getting this administrator permission thing. Then I went ahead and made both accounts administrator. The problems I am facing are as follows:</p>
<p>1) Whenever I try to download something, I prefer it to go to a specific drive, it was possible in windows7, as I had a separate drive for downloads, but now after upgrade, a defualt download folder was added, however, when I try to download something it
 will let me save sometimes on the drive, sometimes on the default folder, sometimes neither of them, only on desktop. It shows error saying would you like to save in the downloads folder, I click OK, it shows the same error. So i have to save it on desktop
 and then place it in my drive.</p>
<p>2) I cannot connect to VPN, the settings won't let me change few settings, I also realized there are about 40 ethernet connections, which I am sure I did not make, and I cannot delete them either.</p>
<p>3) I cannot delete the files from my pen drive, back up hard drive, also cannot create new folders either, I am way to annoyed buy this problem. I tried changing permission for the drives, but the special permission tab is not active, it shows my both accounts
 have full control, still I cannot modify the contents.</p>
<p>4) I am trying to back up my data, it won't do that either.</p>
<p>5) It updates and restarts, nightmare!!! the PC will take an hour to start once updated happened 2-3 times.</p>
<p>Any suggestions to any of the problems are welcome</p>

</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will provide our assistance&nbsp;to help you resolve the&nbsp;issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes to your computer before the problem occurred?</p>
<p>2. Does the same issue occur when you preform the above mentioned task from the other account?</p>

<h2>            Window Media Player  12 vs 10</h2>
                    I have a new computer with Windows 7 Home Premium and am having problems with the Window Media Player&nbsp; 12.0.&nbsp; I've read that other are having the same problems as well, specifically with the "cross fading" aspects.&nbsp; I use WMP 10.0 on another computer (running
 XP) &nbsp;and it works great.&nbsp; My&nbsp;question is, can I uninstall WMP version 12 and install WMP version 10 or 11&nbsp;on my new computer that is running Windows 7 Home Premium?

            You cannot downgrade WMP on Windows 7 because it's built-in to the OS.<br />

<p>Hi Patricia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Windows 8. We are glad that you have posted this query in the Microsoft Community Forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the description, It seems that you are trying to create a Windows 8 bootable recovery disk using the USB Flash Drive and wanted to know the free space that the flash drive should have to create it. Please let me know, if I got it
 wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create a Windows 8 Bootable Recovery disk, the flash drive must have at least 3GB or more of free space available in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Feel free to get back to us for any further queries on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

I created a recovery station on a 64Gb SD card. It uses 33.318.338.560 bytes (31Gb) I guess this does not fit on a 32GB memory card, So should the answer be something like at "least 36 Gb"? (a 32Gb card only holds 28Gb normally)
