</p><p>Changing the Trust Center Protected View settings seems to have done the trick.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Trusted Documents on the network was already checked.</p>

            The features of a Windows Live account were consolidated into outlook.com, so&nbsp;a live.com account is now the same thing as an outlook.com account.&nbsp; You should be able to log in with a live.com account, using your outlook.com email address and password.

            <p><strong>I get that, but the problem is tha</strong>t is that this phone won't allow me to change to an outlook account. Whenever I try to log in it automatically flashes up the live account, and refuses to accept my password which does work on an outlook.com
 log in. How do I work around THAT problem. It does not give me an option of logging in with an outlook account. I am beginning to rue the day I moved from Android to a Windows OS ...</p>

            <p>I guess I don't understand what your issue is. What kind of email address did you use when you set up the Microsoft account on the phone? Was it an outlook.com email address or a Live.com email address?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you used a live.com email address when you created the Microsoft account on the phone, when you are prompted to input a password into the phone, you'll use the password you use with your live.com account....you can't change the email address in this scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you used an outlook.com email address when you created the Microsoft account on the phone, when you are prompted to input a password into the phone, you'll use the password that works with your outlook.com account....you can't change the email address
 in this scenario.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you set the Microsoft account on the phone under a live.com email address and you want to use an outlook.com email address instead, you'll need to perform a hard reset of the phone and then when you set the phone up again, from scratch, you will use your
 outlook.com email address when you create the Microsoft account on the phone. </p>

 to windows 8? Well it's the same with what you have done with HOTMAIL. Let us choose. I know it's your company but how about letting your customers vote and decide how to proceed. Very pissed, frustrated and dissapointed in Microsoft these days. Rob Goerlitxz

<h2>            How can I re-download MP3 files for songs purchased through the XBOX Music Store that show being in my collection but the MP3 files are gone</h2>
                    While trying to move newly purchased MP3 files from one file folder to another on my Windows 8 Phone, I have found that when cutting and pasting the files, there are times where the pasting does not occur but the original folders and files are now gone.
 &nbsp;Although the files are gone, the songs still show being in my collection. &nbsp;Is there a way to re-download MP3 files for songs in my collection without having to re-purchase them again?

            <p>Hello BigTag:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding restoring songs you have purchased from the Xbox Music store.&nbsp; Before discussing the option you have to do this I would like to bring up the best way to copy content in the future.&nbsp; There should be no need to
 cut and paste and risk something like this happening.&nbsp; You can follow the processes outlined here to copy content from the phone to a computer and avoid risking the files be deleted,
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/music-and-videos/sync-music-ringtones-and-podcasts-using-my-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/music-and-videos/sync-music-ringtones-and-podcasts-using-my-computer</a> .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the option to restore your MP3 files.&nbsp; There is one way to do this and it requires a Windows 8 PC.&nbsp; On the PC you would sign into your account.&nbsp; You can do that by creating a user account that uses the Microsoft account you purchased the content on
 or you can create a local user account on the computer and sign into the Music application,
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8</a> .&nbsp; Once signed into your account, you can go to your collection where you should find the tracks and right click each one.&nbsp; In the ribbon along the bottom of the
 screen you should see that option to download.&nbsp; This should lead to the download of an MP3 file to your music library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

            <blockquote>It's an unlocked Dell Venue Pro so the app probably was preinstalled from Dell. &nbsp;To do a hard reset, do I go to "Settings", "about" and tap "reset your phone"? &nbsp;Will this delete any apps I've added, delete my e-mail settings,

<p><br />
There are two ways to perform a Hard Reset.&nbsp; That is one way.</p>
<p>It will delete EVERYTHING on your device and will make like you just got it from the store. So you will log in with your Live and it should bring back all the Contacts etc back to your device.&nbsp; Programs you have added will also be gone so you will have to
 reinstall</p>
<p>The Mango update WILL NOT be affected by the hard reset.</p>

<h2>            includetext of various documents by using a check box, how is it done&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking to have text included for various documents to a single document by means of a check box or other similar method. As follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chapter 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y/N,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y document chapter1.doc inserted at "begin doc"</p>
<p>Chapter 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y/N,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y document chapter2.doc inserted&nbsp;below "begin doc</p>
<p>Chapter 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y/N,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y document chapter2.doc inserted&nbsp;below "begin doc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Begin Doc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have toyed with the idea of using the field includetext but I cannot figure the combination to a chechk box or similar method.

<br />
First, there is no basic&nbsp; level user solution to this problem. You'll need to become an intermediate level user, at least in this area.<br />
<br />
Second, unless you are concerned with document / template size, instead of includetext and other files, consider putting your content into AutoText - a Building Block. If you do, you could use an AutoText field instead, or simply actually insert the text with
 the AutoText command. AutoText has to be stored in a template, it can't be stored in a document. The resulting text, though, can end up in your document based upon your template.<br />
<br />
Third, you'll need to write a number of macros. You could then create a macrobutton field to trigger the macro. For an example of macrobutton fields that work with AutoText and macros, see the
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/word/download.htm#AddIns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Checkbox template</a> on my site. This is writing macros, not recording them.<br />
<br />
The basic macros are simple. You would need one pair for each option you want to insert, with corresponding AutoText entries.<br />
<br />
Option Explicit<br />
Sub CheckIt()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; oAutoTextChecked.Insert Where:=Selection.Range<br />
End Sub<br />
Sub UncheckIt()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; oAutoTextUnchecked.Insert Where:=Selection.Range<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
The AutoText entries here actually are macrobutton fields. The text that can be included with these is limited to one line.<br />
<br />
To include much more text would be easy, it would simply not all be in the macrobutton field. However for the uncheckit macro to work (deleting the text) the text would have to be marked with a bookmark or otherwise marked.<br />
<br />
Possibly a better solution would be to create a <a href="http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Userforms/CreateAUserForm.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
UserForm (a vba construct)</a> that queries your user and pulls in information to assemble your document.
<br />
<br />
As you can see, this isn't a simple process, but it can be done. If you want to attempt it, write back and I or someone with better skills will help you.

<h2>            Using MSP files to install standard settings on Office 2010 Professional</h2>
                    
<p>Most of our PCs have retail editions of Office 2010 Professional (not Office 2010 Professional Pro).</p>
<p>[edit] The PCs are running either Windows XP or Windows 7. [/edit]</p>
<p>Is it possible to use an MSP file created with the Office Customization Tool to change the settings on existing installations of Office 2010 Professional?&nbsp; If so, how?</p>
<p>If not, what is the best way to roll out standard settings to multiple PCs running Office 2010 Professional?</p>

                    I am using Windows 7 and MS Office Home and Student 2010. When I try to print a document, through Word or Powerpoint, I get the message 'Cannot print. No printer installed'. The printer IS installed. It is there, on the print menu, as the default printer
 and it says it is ready. I have run every diagnostic tool I can find on HP (the printer is an HP Deskjet F4280), Windows and Office and they all say that no problem can be detected. I have downloaded every update I can find. I have uninstalled both the printer
 and Office 2010 and reinstalled but it still won't work. Any ideas anyone - I'm just about ready to throw the whole lot out of the window!!

            No I can't print from Excel either but when I try that (I've just had a go) I get a different message. It says something about there perhaps not being enough memory, or having a faulty cable or the computer and printer not talking to each other. However,
 I have tried it with a new cable (my first thought was that the cable was not working) and it did print the ink cartridge realignment test page so presumably they are talking to one another!

    <title>Scrolling acting like Page Up&#47;Page Down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremyoberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scrolling acting like Page Up&#47;Page Down</h2>
                    I just bought a Gateway laptop and for some reason when I scroll with the touchpad it doesn't scroll smoothly.&nbsp; It acts like a page up and page down button as opposed to a mouse wheel.&nbsp; This mainly happens with Internet Explorer and Safari.&nbsp; It scrolls
 fine in most other situations.&nbsp; I've got smooth scrolling enabled.

<strong>Method 1: </strong></div>
<div>Follow the steps mentioned below:</div>
<div><br />
a)&nbsp;Open Internet Explorer </div>
<div>b)&nbsp;Click on Tools and then click Internet Options. </div>
<div>c)&nbsp;Go to the Advanced tab and under Settings scroll down until you locate the box for Use Smooth Scrolling and make&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sure that this box is checked.&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong></div>
<div>You can go into the Touchpad property settings on your laptop and adjust the scrolling speed/sensitivity.&nbsp;
<div>For step by step instructions to adjust these settings, contact gateway.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:&nbsp;</strong> Update touchpad drivers and see if that helps:</div>
<div>a)&nbsp;Click on start type device manager and hit enter<br />
b)&nbsp;Go to Mice and Other pointing devices<br />
c)&nbsp;Right click on the touch pad drivers click on uninstall <br />
d)&nbsp;Now logon to manufacturer’s webpage and install the latest drivers for the touchpad</div>

            I've already enabled smooth scrolling in Internet Explorer, and I've adjusted the scrolling speed, and my drivers are the most current ones. &nbsp;This only happens in IE and Safari, everywhere else it scrolls just fine. &nbsp;Is there anything else I can do to
 maybe fix it?

<p>Have you tried upgrading to IE 9? Not sure if it will make a difference with your touchpad issue. If it doesn't help your situation or you don't like how IE 9 looks you can always uninstall and go back to IE 8. Here's the link that will show you how to install
 and uninstall IE 9.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a
 "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Try to perform clean boot and check if it helps, here is the link:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished diagnosing, follow step 7 in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></p>

            <p>PowerApps is a Modern Windows app downloaded from the Store.&nbsp;This means it&nbsp;does not have the power or the ability to cause any problems with the operating system (unlike legacy Win32 apps which we all know too well have that power).</p>

            <p>Thanks for reporting this, we were able to confirm it as a Windows issue. The bug has been fixed by the Windows team&nbsp;but we don't have an estimate yet of when this will reach Insider Preview users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no workaround for this and you will have to use an older build or the released build of Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Exported video for PowerPoint slideshow has skips and delays in the audio</h2>
                    <p>Created slideshow in Office 365 (like 2016 now) PowerPoint. Combined all music into 1 mp3 file and inserted on first slide to play across slides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very powerful i9 Windows 10 x64 64GB ram computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plays perfectly when listening to the slideshow in powerpoint itself (or just playing the mp3) so the input mp3 audio is good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I either save to mp4 or export video to HD I get stalls, and skips and distortions in certain places in the music. Not too bad but enough to make me want to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried encoding it with several other tools and using the audio as external. To my amazement they too had distortions or errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>VirtualDub - Fails to read one of the frames and bombs out</p>
<p>AVS Video Editor makes a flash in the video at every transition - terrible</p>
<p>DivX converter did the best video but still I get distorted audio at about the same places as PowerPoint made them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be some weird encoding going on in the mp4 or maybe it just cannot sync with the mp3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to try converting the audio to wma or wav and see what that does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I compressed the media images </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not have this problem with Office 2013/Windows 2007 I'm quite sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have this issue and find a solution?</p>

<p>I found that converting the mp3 to wma and including that in the PowerPoint slideshow. And then exporting the slideshow to wmv did the trick.</p>

<p>Use the userform_initialize event.</p>
<p>Inside the VBE with your userform active, show the code window (if you're<br />
looking at the userform).</p>
<p>Then use the dropdowns at the top of the righthand side.&nbsp; Chose Userform and<br />

This works but I have to click on the lable in order for the date to appear. Is there a way to automatically populate this date once the userform is opened?</p>

<p>Word 2016 adds an _1 to each bookmark when it changes for all new references to that bookmark. Old references still use the original without the _1 added to the end.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Word doesn't come with a tool for reporting what all the cross-references to bookmarks, etc. are and I doubt that you need them; they're not the kind of thing you'd edit and they can all be updated by Ctrl-A, F9, for example, in each story range (document
 body, headers, footers, etc.). That said, it's easy enough to find them by pressing Alt-F9 and using Find to look of all instances of 'Ref ', which is what cross-references use, or to generate a report of all such references with a macro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use Word 2016, so I can't comment on why it might add _1 to&nbsp;edited bookmark ranges; doing so doesn't make sense since the original bookmark still applies to the range.</p>

    <title>The Smartphone Reinvented Around You - is it a joke&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The Smartphone Reinvented Around You - is it a joke&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Smartphone Reinvented Around You – sorry to write this, but it's a big fat lie. In the past 10 years I used S60 phones and they're much more useable, than the WP8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in Hungary, and here my new phone costs more than an average monthly wage. The price of it was about 125% of a monthly wage. So I paid a lot of money and the phone physically is great, but the system... sorry again to write this, but I think a got
 a big s..t for my money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's see some example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- the calendar. Why do You think that every WP8 user (yes, every WP8 user without exception) every time (yes, every time without exception) always want to see the daily view??? Intead of - for example - the monthly view, or the weekly.. ooppss... wait! There's
 no weekly view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- the call information. No way to see later how long was a certain call. So if I want to no how long a call was I have to use a paper and a pencil. No separate groups (incoming call, outgoing calls, unanswered calls). So if I have 100 incoming calls, 100
 outgoing calls and 1 unanswered call I have to spend my time winth searching and searching and yes still searching in order to find that one call information I'd like to know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- when I add a new contact, it's automatically uploaded to the web account. What if I use an unsafe public wi-fi connection just to see when the next train comes? I connect to wi-fi, and the phone sends a lot of private data automatically in the background
 and who knows who sees it or not... I know that You try to do it as secure as possible, but I don't think it's okay. Don't You think at least there should be a question if I want to synchronize or not? What if I don't want my private stuff upload anywhere?
 This is my very first telephone I don't trust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- when I log into Skype and make a call, Skype automatically places new contacts to the phone. What if a friend asks me to use Skype on my phone? She/he logs into skype, makes - for example - 10 calls and I will have 10 new contacts in my phone. And I have
 to delete them every time... Don't You think at least there should be a question if I want to copy contacts or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- no local machine backup possibility. It's unbelievable. What if I don't want my private stuff upload anywhere? What if I'm at a place, where there's no internet? You know, there're places around the world, where there's no internet connection. Not everbody
 lives in an office where the toilet also has wi-fi connection.</p>
<p>Or what if I want to change the e-mail address on the phone? I have to do a reset on the phone, which process deletes all data. Before this I have to do a backup in order to save to contacts and messages. So I do a backup (to the Cloud) and then do a reset
 on the phone, then set the new e-mail address at the first boot and then what's next? How do I restore the backup file from the cloud? I have a new e-mail addres and the backup process was done with the previous login name. So? What to do? Shall I use a pencil
 and a big paper before the reset?<br />
So, let's see: we have no local backup support, but have Angry Birds. Wow, sure, when I need to restore, the Angry Birds will pull me out of the sh*t.<br />
Sync Wizard says: „If you want to move media or sync stuff between your computer and phone, there's always at least one good way to do it.” I'm really curious which is that way?<br />
<br />
- I have an older notebook with Windows XP on it. I tried to send an mp3 ringtone from that machine to the WP8 phone via bluetooth connection. But the WP8's just waiting and waiting... and waiting and waiting. And when finally pops up the question whether to
 accept the file or not, the Windows XP says, sorry, there's a problem and it's not possible to send the file. (I can send small files, but above a certain size it doesn't work). Okay, let's connect the phone via USB port. Ooppss... it's not working. The absolutely
 cheapest full stupid Chinese phones can be used via USB, but my very expensive brand new phone doesn't. Why should it? It's a joke. Okay, I uploaded the mp3 ringtone to a website, and tried to download with my phone. But there's no way to download mp3 files.
 I thought I jump out of the house... Hey Everybody, there! IT'S 2014 NOW! What's next? The next PC version of Windows won't support mp3 downloading?<br />
<br />
- if I copy sound files to my previous S60 phones, the ringtone chooser menu finds them wherever they're. Of course WP8 doesn't. I have to manually copy them to the Ringtone folder. But what if I have 10 favourite mp3 files, each of them have a size of 10MB?
 I want to listen them, so I copy them to the Music folder. And what if I want them use them as contact ringtones, too? I have to copy them again, now to the Ringtone folder. So I have to use 200MB of memory, because I have to copy them twice... again jumping
 out of the house?<br />
<br />
- if I send an mp3 file via bluetooth (only small, &lt;1MB sized files are possible to send, I mentioned the problem above) WP8 saves it to the Music folder. But what if I wanted to use it as a ringtone? No, no ringtone! Sending ringtones via bluetooth of course
 isn't possible. Have to find a PC with Windows 7 or 8, because WP8 decide instead of me where to save the new file.<br />
A bit too much automatic decisions, don't You think?<br />
<br />
- the media player has no separate volume control. When I play a loud video, I have to set the volume control to 1/30. If I forget to set it back, I don't hear the calls and messages. If I forget to set the volume before playing the video, everyone wakes up
 in the house, or if I use headphone, the volume nearly destroys me ears. So every time, every time turn down, turn up, turn down, turn up... it drives me absolutely crazy.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
- 10 years ago on my Nokia N-Gage I was able to download every file and zip them, unzip them, send them, manage them every way with great file managers. I can't do anything on WP8. And You call this a smarthpone.<br />
<br />
- on WP8 I can't create a simple subfolder within the Pictures folder. I have to connect to the PC. Of course a Pc with Win7 or newer, because it doesn't work with older systems. (Have You ever heard about backward compatibility? Yes, I heard about "We don't
 give a s..t, We force everything and people must buy everthing new, because We want more money." Unfortunately I not only heard about it, I'm experiencing it right now.) And You call this a smarthpone. And I paid 125% of a monthly wage for a phone, which is
 unable to create a subfolder.<br />
<br />
- when I connect WP8 to my new notebook, of course Total Commander can't manage it. Of course I'm forced to use the basic file manager. I paid 50% of a monthly wage for Windows 8.1, 125% of a monthly wage for a WP8 phone and I can't do the most basic tasks
 the way I want and used to do. Congratulations. I pay a lot of money and I'm allowed to do less things than 10 years ago.<br />
<br />
And this is the smartphone reinvented around me?!?!?! Wow... my 11 years old Nokia N-Gage is a much more user-friendly phone, than my brand new WP8 one. If this is the smartphone reinvented around me, what is the "not-reinvented around me phone" like? What
 do You think?<br />
<br />
I spent a lot of money, I bought a Nokia, because a really like Nokia phones (this is my 6th Nokia) and gave a try to WP8, but the more I use it, the more I think it was a big mistake to pay this lot of money for this s..t system. Sorry, really sorry, the last
 thing I want is to heart any developer's feelings but this is how I feel and I am the person who paid money. I am the absolutely disappointed person who payed a lot of money.<br />
<br />
If I pay for something I expect to use it the way I'd like to use and not how the manufacturer thinks and forces.<br />
<br />
And are You wondering why Android is much more popular? The problem is not that You sell something expensive. The problem is that this something is worse than my 11 years old Nokia N-Gage. If You (try to) sell something expensive at least You should make it
 competitive and user-friendly.<br />
<br />
I bought this phone in 2014, but if We talk about the words "personalizable", "user-friendly", etc. I must confess I feel like I went back somewhere to the mid 1990's.<br />
<br />
The Smartphone Reinvented Around You – sorry to write this, but it's a big fat lie. But what I'm talking about? I have Angry Birds!!! (By the way, what the f..k is that?)<br />
<br />
Please send forward this letter to the developers.... maybe something becomes better... I really hope that something will happen, because basicly I like Microsoft's products, but this system...<br />
<br />
Thank You...</p>
<p>
</p><p>...a very-very disappointed customer.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>While I dont know how many threads there are like these, and most of these issues have been discussed above and beyond, let's see what I can say.</p>
<p>Firstly: Feedback to MS can be given here: </p>
<p><a href="http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Calender: that's why there are apps. I could not agree with you more - the native calender is not a genius one, but there are literally dozens of choices that really, really work well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- calls: feedback forum given above, there's threads open for that, I presume.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- the cloud connection of the contacts. oh my dear god, where do I start. Search this forum, (please!) for this topic, as it literally has been discussed to death imho. some like it some dont.
</p>
<p>regarding your security concerns: WP does not "send out" your actual contact info with a wifi network, that would be ridiculously dangerous, not OS could survive if that is how an open/insecure wifi worked?!?! it just connects to the wifi, it wont display
 everything that is in the phone to it. </p>
<p>WP OS is one of the most secure OSs out there, because it's sandboxed. Not even the own apps have access to the OS or other apps, how could an internet connection have that???</p>
<p>
</p><p>- dont know about skype</p>
<p>
</p><p>-local sync: Acruto Sync, check it out. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- reset the phone to change acct: well.... your MS account holds all settings, all apps, all everything. if you could just easily switch that, you'd constantly lose your apps. i dont know the real reason that is this way, that's just why i think it is that
 way... might be some other reason for that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- connecting with XP: funny to post it today of all days, as support for XO has ended. I'd consider upgrading, that OS is three genrations old.
</p>
<p>To quote your own words: "IT'S 2014 NOW"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-there is no folder system/file explorer in wp- for a good reason (security, sandboxing, access to OS). check the forum again, literally hundreds of posts about this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>as for the rest... I'm about to start work, sorry, cant spend too much time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>but please, do try the actual feedback section in the link above. </p>
<p>
</p><p>oh.. and just an idea: all of these "issues" (and I grant you, some of those ARE issues, and ARE annoying, I agree!!!!!!) were known since WP came out, more than 2 years ago. Research is a good friend of mine, you might want to meet him.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>no harm meant, but you gave your opinion, i gave mine... </p>

<p>Hello Kudzanayi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This could be a possible hardware or software issue. To isolate this, are you able to hear a sound when someone is calling? Does performing a soft reset made any differences? Press
<strong>Volume</strong> <strong>down</strong> and <strong>Power</strong> <strong>
button</strong> at the same time until the phone vibrates and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may install <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/store/p/b2x-smartapp/9nblggh43np6?SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">B2X-SMARTAPP</a></strong> from the Store and use it to check the hardware and software of your
 phone. </p>
<p>

    <title>Export Nonworking Time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelly marrakesh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Export Nonworking Time</h2>
                    <p>I'm using MS Project 2010 and a shared resource pool with approximately 80 resources. To account for vacation time, each person has changed their working time to reflect this information. Is there a way to standard way to export this data (e.g. into MS Excel)?
 Through research I've come across a few suggestions using macros but I'm hoping MS Project has something already built-in.</p>

<h2>            Adding someone to my contacts list</h2>
                    I have been trying to add someone to my contacts list, but haven't been able to. I put their address in "search Skype"but nothing come up. I then put my address in to see if their address was the problem but my address didn't show in the search either.
 It looks like Skype is just searching my existing contacts.

<h2>            transferspreadsheet import xlsx with 140,000 rows</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to import an excel xlsx file into msaccess 2003. It has 140,000 rows, so I can't save it as an xls without breaking it into multiple files, due to the row limitation of xls. This is going to be an ongoing task. Is there a way to make msaccess
 2003 import an xlsx formatted file? If no, what are my other options?&nbsp; I tried saving as txt and csv, but get a numeric field overflow error. Don't want to go down that path and try to start troubleshooting that error if I have another option.</p>
<p><br />

            Sorry to say but my first advise would be to resolve the numeric field overload error. Start by tapping
<i>F5</i>&nbsp;and then clicking <i>Special</i>&nbsp;and setting only the <i>Formulas, Errors</i>&nbsp;option. This should quickly locate any problem values that have created something akin to a #NAME? error. If this doesn't produce a resolution, consider setting number formats
 for a static number of decimal places.
<div><br />
<div>There was also some good code recently posted by&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1c8c803f-5c40-4ff0-ab5e-5be09b208122">JP Rons</a><span>&nbsp;to get around a regional language delimiter problem
 that may be of use in your case. See the following thread for a VBA macro that forcibly writes a CSV with a specified delimiter.</span></div>

            <p>I am having a heck of a time writing something that will import spreadsheets coming from different sources into an Access database.&nbsp;&nbsp; You suggested csv or txt conversion, but that is coming w/its own set of "numeric field overflow" messages that I can't
 seem to successfully troubleshoot. Each excel file has its own mystery as to that message.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some spreadsheets are xls format, some xlsx, some are formatting the zip code as text, some as numeric, some are formatting the diagnosis codes as alphanumeric, some as text, some as numeric. I tried everything suggested above. I successfully compiled the
 regional language delimiter code above after adding Microsfot Scripting Runtime to my references and ran that macro, but I am faced with the same error message. Nothing is working. If I get it to work on one excel file, it doesn't on another. I need to be
 able to write something that will work for all scenarios, as long as the column headings are identical. That is the most I can demand of the people delivering the excel files; that the column headings be identical.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some are too many rows to save as xls, so they have to stay xlsx. Can anyone please help? Thank you so much.</p>
<p><br />

<br />
<div>It's unclear at this point exactly what you mean by <i>"different sources"</i>. Is the transition to be a constant flow of CSV ► XLS(X) ► ACCDB (Access 2007/2010 database)? Is the source material an assortment of TXT/CSV/XLS(X) files? Are you receiving
 only XLS(X) workbooks and want to either export them to CSV in preparation for import to Access or import directly into Access? Do they at least have a common number and layout of fields? For that matter, is there a single Access database target or a variety?
 Please describe your situation as thoroughly as you can.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Importing text rarely has a one-size-fits-all solution and the larger the TXT files are, the greater the chance of something new throwing a monkeywrench into the works.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am interested in seeing this <i>numeric overflow</i>&nbsp;and what can be done about it. If you can upload a copy of one or more of your more troublesome source files to&nbsp;public access file area&nbsp;like&nbsp;<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://db.tt/1YbiAnmF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DropBox</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://drive.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google
 Drive</a>&nbsp;and post a link to the&nbsp;<i>publicly&nbsp;shared</i>&nbsp;file back here, I will be happy to spend some time looking for a resolution.&nbsp;A firsthand look at the data and layout would help immensely. I don't have a copy of Excel/Access 2003 handy at the moment
 but I can work to a solid CSV layout.</div>

<p>Different sources = Different clients'&nbsp;excel files, each formatted differently.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The task is to get each client's records added to our Access 2003 database. 5 different clients will be sending data in Excel format on a quarterly basis. You will see from the&nbsp;examples I sent that the clients' excel files are always formatted differently:
 the zip code and gender and diagnosis code columns all look different.&nbsp; I don't need or want anything to be numeric except the very last column, which is called GENDER. There are 2 date columns, DOB and DOS.&nbsp; All the other columns should be&nbsp;text, including
 zip code &amp;&nbsp;phone number, as their corresponding fields in Access are text fields.&nbsp; (The column order is different, too, but I can work around that.)&nbsp; Some clients send xls files, some xlsx files. Obviously, the clients with records (rows)&nbsp;exceeding the xls
 limit of ~64,000 rows use xlsx format.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The only reason I started looking at a conversion of the excel file to csv or tab delimited was because access 2003 won't read&nbsp;xlsx, and when I try to save&nbsp;an xlsx as xls, the row limit of xls files truncates the larger files.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>(FYI, I know a lot of these are duplicate records. I have Access omit the dups when I import them, so that is not a problem.)</p>

            First question:
<div><br />
<div>There are alphanumeric codes for the Diag1, Diag2, etc. like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>959.3<span> </span>E905.6<span>
</span>881.00</div>
<div><br />
<div>These will all have to be treated as text and that is no problem. However, the alphanumeric codes that
<i>look</i>&nbsp;like numbers bounce between <i>1</i>&nbsp;and <i>2</i>&nbsp;decimal places as demonstrated by the first and third sample above. Would you like these compensated for so that they all have 2 decimal places or is the floating decimal place more appropriate?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Second question:</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is the <i>regional setting</i>&nbsp;for the computer with Access 2003 that will receive these as imports? Is it
<b>d</b>/<b>m</b>/yyyy or <b>m</b>/<b>d</b>/yyyy? I will be converting the DOB/DOS fields into text representations of dates and it is important that I get this right for Access to read on import.</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Suggestion:</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The phone numbers should probably be stripped down to 10 digit numbers and Access can provide custom number formatting to either xxx-xxx-xxxx or (xxx) xxx-xxxx.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Comment:</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The member numbers seem to conform within each worksheet but not from worksheet to worksheet. I will simply use a text representation of a number to get these to conform.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>More later when I have a chance to write and test some code for this.</span></div>

Jeeped, I know you are just trying to help Karen.&nbsp; But judging by the information stated in these posts, you are working with private medical information.&nbsp; It's a severe HIPAA violation for the file to have even been or still&nbsp;on anything public that includes
 DOB and diagnosis codes.&nbsp; Sending the files through a secure process and having a confidentiality agreement ahead of time is one thing, but open to the public for even just a few minutes is quite another issue.
