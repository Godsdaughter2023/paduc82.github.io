<h2>            isnumeric gives data type mismatch</h2>
                    I have a simple sql query in Access 2007, but I'm getting a Data Type Mismatch error when running it. The data looks as follows:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PrevTitle</div>
<div>======</div>
<div>T12345/2007</div>
<div>T4574/1994AT</div>
<div>T87958/48-2</div>
<div>T5478/19C</div>
<div>T7865</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If the first 4 characters after the / is a year field I want to select it. The query below select the 4 correctly:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>SELECT mid(PrevTitle,instr(PrevTitle,'/')+1,4)&nbsp;</i></div>
<div><i>FROM NewType5&nbsp;</i></div>
<div><i>WHERE (PrevTitle Is Not Null And PrevTitle&lt;&gt;'') and PrevTitle Like '*/*';</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But the moment I add an Isnumeric check I get a Data Type Mismatch</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div><i>SELECT mid(PrevTitle,instr(PrevTitle,'/')+1,4)&nbsp;</i></div>
<div><i>FROM NewType5&nbsp;</i></div>
<div><i>WHERE (PrevTitle Is Not Null And PrevTitle&lt;&gt;'') and PrevTitle Like '*/*' and</i></div>
</div>
<div><i>Isnumeric(mid(PrevTitle,instr(PrevTitle,'/')+1,4)) = True;</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

            <p>By placing InStr in the WHERE clause, you force Access to evaluate it for ALL records, even those with an empty (null) PrevTitle. This causes the error. You can use the Nz function to avoid this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT Mid(PrevTitle,InStr(PrevTitle,'/')+1,4)<br />
FROM NewType5<br />
WHERE PrevTitle Is Not Null And PrevTitle&lt;&gt;'' And PrevTitle Like '*/*' AND IsNumeric(Mid(Nz(PrevTitle),InStr(Nz(PrevTitle),'/')+1,4))<br />

            I'd suggest doing an online repair of the installation. That should fix it. 
<br />
<br />Please click Windows Start
<br />Choose Settings
<br />Click Apps
<br />Click on Microsoft Office in the list
<br />Click Modify
<br />Choose Online Repair
<br />
<br />
<br />The instructions to follow to do this are here:

            Hi Mattie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />If this doesn't fix it then go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Microsoft Office &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Modify &gt; Repair to repair Office. 
<br />
<br />If this isn't enough or you have broader performance problems then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 this is a case of deleted files or bad index entries. How can I determine if the physical files are still present &amp; if they are how can I fix the

            What I posted IS the error message I get trying to load Microsoft Word...It is proceeded with "Windows cannot find .."&nbsp; I know it refers to the file path which comes from a Windows Index which is why I asked if I could see the physical program file exists.
 I am not a dos expert, but I'm assuming there is some kind of command I could use to see files. When I attempt to open a Word document I have already created the error changes to "Windows can't find 'C\users\... etc."

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype is free to use if you will make a Skype-to-Skype call, or&nbsp;a call where you'll reach another person who uses Skype. But if you will call mobiles and landlines, you will need to have
<a href="http://www.skype.com/go/skypecredit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Skype Credit</span></a> or a
<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">subscription</span></a>&nbsp;to support the calling charges.&nbsp;For more information about how you can make calls in Skype, please visit
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10613/how-do-i-make-a-call-on-skype?q=make+calls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sending instant messages is another free feature of Skype, which allows you to send messages to your contacts. But if you will send SMS to a phone number, you will need to have Skype Credits before you can proceed sending it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers your query.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mobile forcing EV-DO</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I'm&nbsp;having a problem that I can't seem to find a solution to...&nbsp; I have a Qwest Mogul and when I got the phone I signed up for a limited data plan (BIG MISTAKE).&nbsp; Problem is that when Windows Live is signed in, my phone overrides wifi in favor of EV-DO...&nbsp;
 Hence, I ended up with an ungodly bill for 50MB overage of data.&nbsp; Is there a setting that disallows windows live from using wifi?&nbsp; Is this&nbsp;a known issue and if so, where can I find out how to let windows live to work over wi-fi?

    <title>After hibernating- all minimized&#47;open Word &#40;2010&#41; docs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kitheart  say:</h3>
<h2>            After hibernating- all minimized&#47;open Word &#40;2010&#41; docs show a few command buttons and nothing else. When I click to move the window it minimizes the window and I can&#39;t use my Word doc. </h2>
                    
<p>I am using Office 2010, Microsoft Word. It is on a new laptop and was working flawlessly. It no longer is. I have two issues. One, when I open an existing Word doc another "copy" of it opens on the desktop with random letters and symbols. I want to stop
 that from happening.</p>
<p>The second, more important issue is trying to open an already opened (minimized) Word after hibernating the computer. I will open a new doc, do my work, save it, and minimize it. I will hibernate the computer. When I turn it back on and click on the doc
 to pull it up to full screen to continue work/proof read it, it opens as a small window with only the following buttons at the top left: the M-soft Word symbol, save, undo (grayed out), repeat typing, open, and customize Quick Access toolbar. I cannot see
 anything I've typed and as soon as I click anywhere in the window it automatically minimizes, still blank. I cannot even close the doc using the red X at the top, but rather right-click when it's minimized and close it that way. Even new docs are opening as
 the blank small windows that automatically minimize.</p>
<p>I have not currently "tried" anything to fix the issue because i don't even know the technical terms I need to know to search the 'net.</p>
<p>The things I've most recently downloaded are Bejeweled 3 (this was before the issues started happening) and PDF995, including Signature 995.</p>

<p>Word creates hidden temporary files in the working folder - especially a lock file which is the same as the filename but with the two characters ~$ replacing the first two characters of the filename. This is normal and cannot be prevented. If you open a
 document from the desktop the desktop is the working folder and so you will see the temporary files there while you display hidden files (and you should always display hidden files so you know what is being saved on your hard drive).</p>
<p>The other problem sounds like a display driver issue. Have you tried rebooting the PC recently?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft technicians have destroyed my office system and refuse to help me. What can be done, please&#63;</h2>
                    About a week and a half to two weeks ago, Windows did a critical update on my computer. Literally every single time that this happens, my OS goes haywire and conflicts with critical apps that I use from the Adobe Creative Cloud; sound; drivers etc. After
 several long days on live chat, with more than half a dozen technicians sharing my screen and delving into the depths of my computer, changing all manner of settings and failing to sort the problems out, the OS was reinstalled. Before this happened, I made
 it clear to the technician on board at the time, that I could not afford to lose my copy of Office 2013. The reason for this is that when I bought it online from Microsoft all those years ago, I was given a hyperlink and a product key registered to an email
 address that no longer exists and I do not remember that address. Office was installed on what is now a broken, old Acer which is no longer in service. When I bought my new Dell, I contacted Microsoft live chat, explained the probl

<p>You dont say what exact Office 2013 version.</p>
<p>Most 2013 versions were associated with an MS Account when first installed/activated and you log on to this MS Account to reinstall

            Microsoft Home And Business 2013. The Microsoft account associated with the purchase remains unchanged. The only things that have changed is that a) the email address for the purchase is no longer in existence and I no longer remember what it is; I migrated
 the program from my redundant Acer a year and a half ago, onto the Dell; The OS was reinstalled. Yes, of course there is a fundamental problem.... a core problem with this expensive new *swearword* laptop, and how *double swearword* OS talk to one another.....
 either which way, I am an end of line consumer and this is all way over my head. I have lost a legal copy of the software, due to a Microsoft blunder.

<p>I purchased Office 2013 online and at the time I was given a download link and an installation key. I used the same key to load the software on my new computer, from a link given to me by Microsoft themselves. It is the Windows 10 updates that conflict on
 my computer and every critical update requires a fresh install. I cannot locate the product key for Office anywhere. The email address I was using when I purchased Office 2013 is no longer in use and I do not remember what it was. I have no way of finding
 the original email.</p>
<p>Silly me to think that technicians can help. So what you are saying is that I should not be relying on Microsoft for help?!</p>

<h2>            Several unexpected behaviour in synchronization between two computers &#40;OneDrive for Business&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have been working with OneDrive for Business for quite a while with little synchronization problems. I have recently acquire a second computer where I installed the same account as in my original computer and I have OneDrive synchronized on both... I wondered
 how it would deal with it...</p>
<p>I have noticed that while the all files and folders on my new computer had the little green icon meaning they were synchronized, all my files and folders on my old computer had the little red icon meaning they were not synchronized... This happens in all
 folders regardless if the files or folders have been changed since I installed the second computer... This is unexpected... but not extremely... I imagined that OneDrive stopped altogether synchronized the old computer and only synchronized the new... unexpected,
 unwanted, and unuseful but. in the convoluted way that some of these things turn to work a bit understandable... or at least there is a logic, not one I agree with but some logic... ... however...</p>
<p>it turns out that a few days after installing the new computer, I created and edited&nbsp;some files on my old computer, that still have the red icon, but I was surprised to find them on my new computer... could it be that it is synchronizing after all?</p>
<ul>
<li>no, there are other files I edited that were not synchronised</li><li>and I moved some files that were created to another folder on the old computer, but on the new computer they stayed in the original folder</li><li>and now other files I have created in the old computer have not appeared in the new (i.e. was not able to replicate)</li></ul>
<p>I remember (it may be relevant) that at some point (a few days before the files mentioned above were create and synched), the new computer asked me to log on again to my Microsoft account when I was saving a file on a synchronized folder... I did not expect
 that.. that folder and file do not appear on the old computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Explanation?</p>

            Hi Nsgma365,<br />
<br />
If you only need to sync your OneDrive for Business library, we suggest you use <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client</a>. It provides essential user capabilities such as selective sync, support for large files up to 10 GB in size and removing the 20,000 file sync limit.<br />
<br />
If you also need to sync SharePoint Online libraries, the OneDrive for Business legacy sync client is still required.<br />
<br />
Regarding the issue that you encountered, please confirm if all changes made from the new computer can be synced to the cloud.<br />
<br />
If so, the sync issue should only occur to the old computer.<br />
If not, both computers have the issue.<br />
<br />
To troubleshoot the issue, please try the steps below:<br />
1. Use the “<strong>easy fix</strong>” tool from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

2. Try clearing cached files from Upload Center. Right click the <strong>Microsoft Office Upload Center</strong> icon (with a white up-arrow) in the system tray, then click
<strong>Settings &gt; Delete cache files &gt; Delete cached information</strong>.<br />
3. Right click the OneDrive icon in the system tray, and select <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Stop-syncing-a-library-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-app-a7e41f1f-3a98-4ca7-9443-f10250688330?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
stop syncing the library</a>. Then re-sync the library. <br />
<br />

            <p>Hello Jiaxing Bian,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply and sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>So I tried what you suggested and now I have further problems. </p>
<p>I stopped syncing my personal library of OneDrive for Business, but I kept my Team Library.</p>
<p>I synced again the personal library of OneDrive for Business and it told me that that app would not work and that I had to update the app sending me to this link: https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-gb/update/</p>
<p>I updated, logged, selected the&nbsp;folders and all seemed to be going well.&nbsp;Then a warning flashed saying OneDrive stopped working.
</p>
<p>However, the folders are not synced and have no icon at all, no green synced icon, no red crossed non-synced icon.
</p>
<p>When I go to the system tray and try to stop syncing the library, the personal one is not there.
</p>
<p>I tried to go through the update link but after I log on it says the personal is already synced. I momentarily see an additional OneDrive syncing icon on the system tray but not long enough to be able to click on it.</p>
<p>The view sync problems are only related to the sharepoint team library that I am still syncing.</p>
<p>I even have stopped syncing the team library, but nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the system says the library is synced (but is not) and I cannot find a place to stop syncing it (if it was).</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. Meanwhile the second computer is synced with the web (obviously not with the old computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help welcomed.</p>
<p>N</p>

            Hi Nsgma365,<br />
<br />
About the new OneDrive for Business sync client issue, could you try adding a file in the local OneDrive for Business folder to see if it can be synced into the cloud? If so, please use the Easy Fix toll or fix it manually via the article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/3079213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Sync icon overlays are missing from OneDrive for Business synced items</a>. <br />
<br />
In addition, to stop syncing the OneDrive for Business library, we can right click on the blue cloud icon in the task bar and select
<strong>Settings &gt; Account &gt; Unlink OneDrive</strong>. <br />

            <p>Hi Shirley,</p>
<p>Please note that all the answers were in my previous message.</p>
<p>The files are not synced and there are no icons since applying the fix from the previous support member.</p>
<p>When right clicking the blue cloud icon I don't have the menu you show, and it is mostly greyed out. (see image)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/323f14b7-5307-4042-8cf9-6b8356235061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/323f14b7-5307-4042-8cf9-6b8356235061" /></a></p>
<p>clicking on the Sync a new library shows this menu</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b25a553-ce47-4d22-beb6-991d7f6818ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b25a553-ce47-4d22-beb6-991d7f6818ec" /></a></p>
<p>So my guess is that after the first fix I don't have any library synced... except...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to OneDrive for Business on the web and click Sync it tells me that it is already synced</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77ee18d3-528d-4bba-95e0-fb1273ccb980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77ee18d3-528d-4bba-95e0-fb1273ccb980" /></a></p>
<p>So in case someone missed the starting of this problem (or the title of this post), I am trying to synchronize the same account on two different computers a laptop and a Surface... If this is not possible all this could make sense, but I would hope this
 would be possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime,&nbsp;a strange thing has happened.</p>
<p>I had an Excel file opened on my old computer (where all these sync problems are occurring). When I closed it, it asked me to save which I did. I am pretty sure I opened that file from my local disk, but somehow it saved it directly to the cloud (it could
 be it was opened since before I tried the original fix) and it did not save locally.</p>
<p>So on old computer I had the file from 7.Jul, and on the cloud I ad the file from today.
</p>
<p>I then opened my new Surface computer to check if it would update the new file from the cloud... it did not and claimed oneDrive was synced - last sync 42 hours ago.
</p>
<p>I then opened the same file on the Surface and saved it with a new name. This file was promptly uploaded to the cloud and only then the original file was updated on the Surface.</p>
<p>I then uploaded a renamed file from my old computer to the cloud and it promptly synced on my Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So apart from that delay, the Surface seems to be syncing fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help (urgently) welcome, N</p>

We can sync the OneDrive for Business library with the same account on two computers such as a laptop and a Surface. If we add a file into the OneDrive for Business local folder in the old computer and the file can be synced to the cloud. Then, the sync client
 in Surface will sync the file from the cloud to the local folder synced. <br />
<br />
From the screenshots you provided above, I noticed that there are both legacy OneDrive for Business client (OneDrive for Business) and the Next Gen Sync Client (Microsoft OneDrive) at the same computer.&nbsp; We can sync personal site with new sync client and sync
 SharePoint teamsite libraries with the legacy OneDrive for Business client. They can run at the same computer.&nbsp; To sync the OneDrive for Business library, we can Sign in the client with our current Work/school account when the window pop up:

<br />
In addition, from “So apart from that delay, the Surface seems to be syncing fine”, I understand that there is no sync issue on Surface now. Therefore, let’s focus on the first computer to troubleshot.
<br />

            <p>Thank you Shirley. </p>
<p>This became quite long so bear with me. I think I identified two programming flaws and still I have a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never clicked on the Sign In because I arrived there after logging in, and it kept returning to that "You are already syncing this account" window. Then I realized that behind that window there was this "Getting ready to sync"&nbsp;window</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fbfe067-f2ed-4dd7-b311-cb5511cc79e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fbfe067-f2ed-4dd7-b311-cb5511cc79e3" /></a></p>
<p>So after running the new version installation (by the way, I think I had done this before) this prompted</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22056e4e-6711-471e-8a1a-b5e4be806e81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22056e4e-6711-471e-8a1a-b5e4be806e81" /></a></p>
<p>It is strange because it does not look absurdly long (to me). and I am not particularly keen about changing the name because is a third party file on my archive.</p>
<p>What is the limit? I clicked try again and it disappeared (more on this later).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked the files, there are a lot of them (the ones that I worked since it was disconnected) that have the to-be-synced icon. The list&nbsp;below is an example and are files I created earlier to try to understand how it was (not) working.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7924c188-af16-4523-bbd0-fea23abc5ea7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7924c188-af16-4523-bbd0-fea23abc5ea7" /></a></p>
<p>So three of them were not synced (they are not in the cloud) and the one I have uploaded manually a few days ago is shown as synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the task bar, I have now two blue icon clouds; one says "OneDrive for Business - No Libraries are currently connected" and the other says "OneDrive - MyCompany Up to date". When I click this last one it goes back to the error above "We can't
 sync this item because path is too long". Try again goes back to itself. So I assumed this is the file that is blocking it. Therefore I clicked exit and... all folders and files&nbsp;stopped synchronizing... no icons whatsoever... a bit radical to my taste, it
 is not clear on that window that you are actually totally disconnecting your computer from the cloud... your not turning the app off you are actually practically uninstalling it...</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4eb40255-9ea3-4323-bb72-88fe0bf6d6e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4eb40255-9ea3-4323-bb72-88fe0bf6d6e7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess that was not the problem. And that I have to start again... so I did...</p>
<p>I confirmed that the "You're already syncing&nbsp;this account" window&nbsp;asks&nbsp;you to sign in in a loop hiding the "Getting ready to sync" window (first image of this msg).</p>
<p>After that the&nbsp;folder and files went back to the mix of Synced and to-be-synced icons and the "too long path" error came back again. Has it claimed it was only 4 characters too long,&nbsp;I found a way to shorten the path... as a result the whole folder became
 to-be-synced...</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND of course that after that one file&nbsp;there was another one even longer... now I had to shorten 14 characters...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, this is really annoying because there seems to be no way of skipping these files and to be honest this long paths happen a lot when you unzip a third party file that comes with&nbsp;a long&nbsp;folder path that compiles with our folder paths... so to have this
 blocking the syncing of the newer files (if indeed this is the reason) it is very impractical...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember with the previous version, I also&nbsp;had some problems with the syncing of some of these files. But the files were shown as unsynced (which is what they are)&nbsp;and then you could access the "View Sync problems". I also remember that the problem previously
 was noted as "This file name contains invalid characters", which was not true. </p>
<p>Now I see the "View sync problems" but I cannot access because of the "... too long" error and I cannot skip it. This would mean to have to rename an unknown amount of files before I get to any conclusion about the correlation between these errors and the
 unsyncing of the&nbsp;new files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last thing I tried:</p>
<p>I copied one of the existing files and it didn't sync</p>
<p>I created a new file and it didn't sync</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31a2535a-f84d-4b17-99b6-965b5326c50a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31a2535a-f84d-4b17-99b6-965b5326c50a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I see four problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>the "log in" window is covering the "getting started" window - now I know it, it is a minor nuisance.</li><li>the "...path too long" error messageis annoying if it is true that there is a limit. what is&nbsp;the limit?</li><li>more importantly, "...path too long"&nbsp;error&nbsp;is preventing the access to the view sync problems - a really&nbsp;big problem problem</li><li>my new files (created while I was not syncing this computer and created now) are not being synced - a really really big problem...</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Any help welcomed.</p>

            Hi Nsgma365,<br />
<br />
In SharePoint Online, file name paths can have up to 256 characters, before you sync, please check all the file names. You may shorten the path by shortening file names or removing the file from a folder and putting it to the root library. You can find the
 Restrictions and limitations here：<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/3125202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/3125202
</a><br />
<br />
If we identify the folder with a long path and would like to shorten the file path, we can “Unlink OneDrive” via right-clicking the OneDrive icon in the system tray
<strong>-&gt; settings -&gt; Account -&gt; Unlink OneDrive</strong>. And then shorten the file name or remove to the root library or folder. Re-sync the OneDrive for Business library to check the result.
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley<br />

            <p>Hi Shirley,</p>
<p>Although I think 256 characters is an unpractical limitation, I may come to terms with, I cannot rename all my file paths to unblock the synchronization of all the other files that do not suffer from that problem. I don't even know how many files suffer
 from that problem. and when I rename the paths (as it happen in the example above) all new areas of my folder tree become unsynced.</p>
<p>Also, as I explained, this will happen frequently whenever a zip file is unzipped with their own folder structure. In those cases, although I can unhappily live with the idea that it is not synced to the cloud, I cannot believe that every other synchronisation
 is blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, you cannot " “Unlink OneDrive” via right-clicking the OneDrive icon in the system tray
<strong>-&gt; settings -&gt; Account -&gt; Unlink OneDrive</strong>.". As I said, everything in the task bar icon is greyed and inaccessible because of the&nbsp;"...the path is too long" error.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc8c5bd2-9190-4e25-939d-02fddec93aba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc8c5bd2-9190-4e25-939d-02fddec93aba" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84549750-1de6-4c06-8129-7d95090850b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84549750-1de6-4c06-8129-7d95090850b3" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and to be honest, it is not really practical to unlink and link the whole one drive whenever this happens, especially because I don't know when this will stop because I don't know how many there are. This is a disaster waiting to happen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the previous OneDrive version, I had an idea how many files were not synched and why. There was a list with all the files that had failed to sync. Now I can see large areas of my folder tree that are not synced and I have no idea how many and why.</p>
<p>Also it showed clearly that they were not synced, not this less clear icon waiting-to-be-synced.</p>
<p>It was also more clear, OneDrive said:&nbsp;"this file could not be synced and we moved on to the next and got on with the work syncing the rest"</p>
<p>
</p><p>More importantly than all, the new files that I am creating and that do not have a "too long path" are not being synced and that is a really big problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help welcomed, N</p>

<h2>            ie11&#47;edge not accepting target attribute to open links in like named page</h2>
                    As described in subject, after recent update these two programs does not accept opening links in like named page from target="name" (whatever the name of the targeted link so happen to be). Instead I am now getting several tabs or windows opening instead
 of one tab or window. Works in Chrome, but that is not my preferred program. What setting do I need to correct this?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>scripted windows or link navigation outcomes in IE depend on your IE security settings and/or your IE popup blocker settings and/or any third-party browser addons (like popup blockers). Outcomes in other web browsers may also be affected by your native browser
 popup blocker settings or third-party addons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In IE you can find out which IE security zone the current host is mapped to from the File&gt;Properties menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When developing/testing web sites:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Ensure that your IE security zone settings are at their default settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Options&gt;Security tab, click "Reset all zones to default".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Ensure that both the source and target hosts are mapped to the same IE security zone. (File&gt;Properties menu). IE has a security zone setting preventing navigation into zones of lower integrity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You can start IE in noAddons mode from Start&gt;Run&gt;iexplore.exe -extoff or you can manage individual addons from the Tools&gt;Manage Addons menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Outcomes may also be affected by ActiveX filtering (other browsers do not have this). To debug blocked content and security issues first go</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advanced tab, check "Always record developer console messages". Save changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>afterwards, when you use the f12 tool to debug your website/dev/or test sites, the console tab will list errors and security, blocked content, markup and xss warnings and errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. named windows in hyperlinks, were only fixed in IE the past 6 months or so. Ensure that you are using the latest update for your windows version. You can find the Version number and UPDATE version numbers from the About&gt;About Internet Explorer menu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>stackoverflow.com is a good place to ask technical coding questions. You should include:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A link to your website (if possible) or a jsfiddle mashup that demonstrates the issue.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Minimal markup and scripting, that demonstrates the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are consumer support forums.</p>

<p>I was asking the Original Poster how <em>he</em> was using the target attribute... &nbsp;&nbsp; just trying to make sure we're not missing something obvious before we go down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Where did this page on your desktop come from?&nbsp; Did you create this page yourself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wrote the page yourself, then I'm a bit confused as to why you're using the target attribute at all.... &nbsp; if the goal was to load each page in the same tab, then wouldn't having no target (or using target="_self") be most appropriate?</p>

<p>The coding on my desktop working page has not changed over the years, and has no issues. It was made simple enough to prevent issues years ago. The only changes was that windows update in July that changed something in Internet Explorer 11 and Edge. Chrome
 still works, so that tells me that whatever the update changed was in the settings for IE11/Edge. I already had everything on default, and there was no add-on's to shut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll go through your list, which I would think includes many things that are not likely my problem, but are included just in case.</p>

<p>The List Page I had created, and I am using the target attribute to open certain links in certain tabs based on how I am using those pages, overwriting same types of tabs instead of having a hundred different tabs cluttering up my computer screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>target=_self would open link in the same tab or window as my list page, if I read the info right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/att_button_formtarget.asp</p>
<p>
</p><p>target=_blank would give me what I am experiencing now with IE11/Edge. A new tab every link. Not what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having no target attribute would open a new page if I am not mistaken, like now, also not what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The goal is to load the page in a new tab for the first link, and every new link from my main list page to open any new links on that same tab, overwriting the old page instead of creating a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The list page would have coding like this, but not this:</p>
<p>&lt;a (link address 1) target=newpage&gt;link1&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>- this would open the first tab which I would make as a separate window on my screen to work from.</p>
<p>Going back to my List, I would click the next link:</p>
<p>&lt;a (link address 2 target=newpage&gt;link2&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>- this would overwrite that new window that was created by the first link, and so on. I would still have my list page to work from as well as only one window instead of how many windows I would have as things are now. The list page and the working page would
 be side by side, and each new list item would overwrite the old working page with anew working page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I am looking for a solution to why IE11/Edge treats this Links Page differently now since the recent update, than before that update. Tab settings looks alright. IE setting are default. No add-on's are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still going to go through that list of suggestions.</p>

<p>Hi &nbsp;John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to put into practice your suggestions, particularly about using "compare documents" function. &nbsp;I am still running into issues dealing with wanting to reject changes in which large blocks or original text have been deleted--no matter how
 I do the comparing. (and yes, I did do what you said about accepting all changes so both docs compared have no tracked changes in them about de-selecting formatting). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ask to see changes in a new document, I cannot find the large blocks of text deleted or alternately if I do the comparing in the reverse, then I cannot easily discern what he has changed and what is original. &nbsp;It makes the editing process a nightmare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I just work off the document he returned to me (in.doc with his admittedly collapsed formatting for all large deletions) the following still happens: &nbsp;I reject his change of a large deletion and &nbsp;the text is either restored as one big block of pages
 of unformatted text) OR I can't even find the deletion to reject. &nbsp;(In some case, he took blocks apart and wove them in a different order within a chapter, which makes things even more complicated). &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I so hope what I am saying is making sense. &nbsp;I want to proceed with editing this manuscript. &nbsp;There are a vast number of edits and a large number I will be rejecting as well as accepting. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Would it make a difference if I wrote the editor back and asked him to convert his .doc into .docx using a 2004 word converter? But how is that different from me opening his .doc edited document in Word 2011? &nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I request of him—or can I change some setting that collapsed all formatting of a large deletion? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there anything I can ask of this editor that might be helpful in this process? &nbsp;</strong>Note: he has been paid and we will not be going back and forth once I have decided which of his changes to reject and which to accept,. &nbsp;But I will be sending
 a completed doc (hopefully cleared of all confusing "cruft" (was that your word?) to a copy editor. &nbsp;And then will want a clean doc as I proceed with self-publication. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>STYLES</strong></p>
<p>I believe you said if I work in styles this would not be an issue?? </p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">if you are formatting with styles, you can re-format a whole chapter in about 2 minutes, so it's really not an issue."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>My manuscript, far as I know did have a style assigned originally. &nbsp;It is really just hundreds of pages of paragraphs (with an occasional title for a new chapter). &nbsp;I do not understand what you mean when you say that working in styles and how this would

            This wasn't an easy call, but I split this off because it seems this portion of the thread takes it into a new topic regarding how to use styles in a particular way.

<h3> vijay rchandran.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 640 no ringtone while connected to a earphone</h2>
                    <p>Got a Lumia 640 a few weeks back &amp; so far I've been happy with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if it an issue with the hardware, wrong settings on my part or Microsoft just forgot about this feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I connect my earphones the profile mode automatically switches to silent. No issues with that. Normally when you connect your earphones &amp; if a call comes, the ringtone can be heard via earphones. In 640 you hear nothing. The earphone works fine if I
 make a call or even when I see an incoming call &amp; answer it. Rechecked all my settings &amp; found nothing turned off/not configured.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is an issue when you are driving &amp; you have your earphones connected but you don't hear the ringtones for incoming calls.

</p><p>After reading through the remarks. I found to have solved my problem by going back to the ringtone setting and change the ringtone while the headset was connected to the phone.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>Which version of Windows? (Including SP level- e.g.&nbsp; Windows 7, Vista SP1, XP SP2 , 32-bit, 64-bit, etc. Right-click Computer/My Computer&gt; Properties to obtain this information) Be sure to look at System Type for 32-bit or 64-bit.<br />
<br />
Which version of Internet Explorer? (From IE&gt; Help&gt; About)</p>
<p>Try this test:<br />
Start Internet Explorer without add-ons by right-clicking the IE icon on the desktop. Choose Start without add-ons.<br />
or<br />
from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Accessories&gt; System tools&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />
Does the problem persist?</p>
<p>Don</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Outlook 2010 client connecting to Hosted Outlook exchange 2007</h2>
                    <p>Similar questions to this have been unanswered in the Outlook and Exchange forums as I believe this is an RPC issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am attempting to manually connnect&nbsp;a new mail profile on a new installation of Windows 7, to use Outlook 2010 on a hosted Exchange 2007 server. Several others in our company have successfully done this.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I repeateldy get an error that " Exchange server is not connected, Outlook must be online". Outlook will not open as there are no complete profiles installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The settings for the hosted server use Outlook anywhere both on slow and fast connections using HTTP connnection and basic authentication. I am able to resolve the&nbsp;&nbsp;URL for the proxy server in internet explorer to access an OWA, which form now is my only
 method of accessing e-mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have disabled all firewalls, including the domain, &nbsp;don't have anti virus installed yet, and disabled Windows Defender.</p>
<p>Spent 2 hours on the&nbsp;phone with the hosted exchange support team to be sure we exhausted every known setting to them and still no connection.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have all updates installed both for&nbsp;WINDOWS 7 AND OUTLOOK Including SP1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
