<h2>            Restore PC from Vista Ultimate 64 bit Image Backup</h2>
                    I have backed up my PC using Vista Ultimate 64 bit and have a Windows Image Backup on an external drive. I have tried to use the Restore Computer option, but the steps listed don't exist. I am told to press F8 during start up and select Restore Computer
 from the list of options in the directory. There is no Restore Computer option. How can I access the image backup to restore my system?

===============================================<br />
Maybe the articles pasted below will shed some light...<br />
<br />
As I understand it...if your system does not have preinstalled <br />
recovery options you must have a <span>Windows&nbsp;Vista</span> installation disc.<br />
<br />
***Warning*** Before proceeding with the recovery...be absolutely <br />
certain that your personal files (photos, documents, email, etc) are<br />
backed up on external media. <br />
<br />

    <title>Moving hard disk with windows 10 to another pc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrismashaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving hard disk with windows 10 to another pc</h2>
                    I have an old Samsung p530 that, after installing windows 10 (from the free upgrade), something happened that made it crash consistently, even when booting (before windows is loaded). Now, I borrowed a friend's HP pc and moved the old hard disk from my
 samsung to the HP. It worked fine even now am using it. I installed a new copy of windows 10 (education) yesterday. Now, I want to know if after I fix my old pc, or buy a new one, I can migrate my old hard disk (the one am using with hp pc) to either the samsung
 or the new pc with no need of activating windows again, or if I will need a new key. I used my microsoft account throughout on this hard disk (I hope this can save me).

                    <p>I have been syncing my zune hd with my surface tablet. &nbsp;I upgraded to windows 10 but still had windows 8 installed. &nbsp;I just deleted it to free up space on my surface and now my zune is not being recognized to sync. &nbsp;I'm not a techy person. &nbsp;Can someone tell
 me the steps I need to take to get my zune to sync now?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 apps frozen</h2>
                    <p><span>I installed Windows 10 pretty well as soon as it was available last year on my Asus laptop, although Windows 8 had been working pretty well. After the November Widows 10 "upgrade" (DEGRADE???), I lost the ability to synchronise with my HTC Android
 phone and my TomTom Sat Nav, and I&nbsp;couldn't open any jpg pics. Through advice from this community, I got instructions on how to fix the jpg problem (thanks, guys). The TomTom synch problem seems to have sorted itself out, though not the HTC phone synch. Last
 week, I found that some of the key Windows 10&nbsp;apps can no longer be opened. The app icons on the desktop have links to the Store, each of which shows a Microsoft URL and a Re-install button. The only successful re-install was Calculator. All the other reinstalls
 have failed repeatedly. The Download and Updates list has six apps in the Queue: Mail &amp; Calendar (Installing), One Note (Installing), Windows Camera (Pending), Microsoft Photos (Pending), Microsoft Phone Companion (Pending) and Microsoft People (Pending).
 However, the Download / Installing process has completely frozen, and nothing seems to be happening. The only thing I have installed recently has been a Seagate 1TB portable hard drive. I have uninstalled the accompanying “Lyve” software, in case this was
 somehow causing the problem. It has made no difference. Can anyone offer any help or advice? Sorry to have been so long-winded.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Installer Folder priviliges - A message from Desktop Gadgets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> girishramakrishnan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Installer Folder priviliges - A message from Desktop Gadgets says that settings.ini is being used by another process</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Dell Laptop with a Windows 7 Home Premium on it. A few days ago, when I started my computer, I got a message from Desktop Gadgets stating that settings.ini was being used by another process. Also, both my Office stopped running and Firefox required
 me to run as Administrator. After a lot of googling, I traced down the problem to the C:\Windows\Installer Folder. The permissions had somehow been altered ant the System was not given full control. I disabled the UAC rebooted and set the folder permissions
 on the installer folder to full control and most of the problems got sorted. However, When I restarted after resetting UAC to default, The problems returned. The above programs run with UAC switched off but not switched on. How do I change permissions of the
 Installer Folder and make sure they stay changed even after I turn on UAC.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PS. I wasnt able to apply the folder permission changes to all files and subfolders in the Installer folder. Some of them just gave an error when I tried to change the permission.</div>
                </div>

 They said my firewall had been penetrated and I had a number of security issues.&nbsp; In an attempt to force me to comply with their instructions they said with would delete all my files after a certain amount of time.&nbsp; Confused I let them scan my computer then
 they said to fix them I had to pay them money.&nbsp; I decided to double check the security already in my computer both Defender and MacAfee and both said nothing was wrong.&nbsp; There is no way get rid of the page from the page, they keep buzzing you and threatening
 to delete your files.&nbsp; You have to X them from the title bar.&nbsp; As you can see, this is a dangerous scam since they can enter computer at any time via the internet without your permission.&nbsp; If anyone has a way to notify Microsoft of this menace, they might
 find a way to block them.</p>

<p>That's a normal UAC (User Account Control) pop up. When a program is installed it makes changes to the registry etc. When you uninstall a program those changes need to be undone. Meaning you have to allow the app to make changes when uninstalling it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In general:</p>
<p>
</p><p>All such pop-ups are fake warnings/alert. They are called Tech Support Scams.</p>
<p>If you can't close your browser in a normal way: Open Task Manager (press Ctrl + Shift + Esc on your keyboard) and in the tab Processes end all browser processes. Make sure to not restore the browser session.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best thing you can do is getting a good ad blocker which prevents these kind of pop ups...</p>
<p>Personally I use the Firefox browser with the free extensions/add-ons uBlock Origin as well as Ghostery.

            Hi PatrickJ_384 
<br />
<br />Yes, that ReImage software sneaks onto your PC in many ways, it is not endorsed by Microsoft, even though, they advertise as such . . .
<br />
<br />When you try to uninstall those Apps, when asked is you want that to make changes to your PC, choose yes, to uninstall that app, otherwise the uninstaller cannot proceed . . .

<p>Hi Gamboa_CZ,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!</p>
<p>To convert WTV file to any other format (DivX, AVI, etc), you would have to download and install third party software. There’s no built-in program in Windows 7 to convert WTV format files to AVI or DivX. However, you may convert DVI files to an older format
 (.dvr-ms format).</p>
<p>Refer the link below for details:</p>
<p><strong>Convert a recorded TV file (.wtv) to an older format<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Convert-a-recorded-TV-file-wtv-to-an-older-format" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Convert-a-recorded-TV-file-wtv-to-an-older-format</strong></a></p>
<p>You may use the search engine to find any such compatible programs available for Windows 7.</p>
<p>As an additional info, I’d suggest you to refer the link below which talks about file conversion (WTV to something else):</p>

                    <p>I am running Windows 7 Home Premium, 64 Bit.&nbsp; The hard drive is 500GB. This is a HP that provides Windows 7 OS on drive C: and&nbsp;System Recover Software on partition Drive D:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive letter changed and Windows is no longer on C:&nbsp; I can't get to the command prompt and can't log on in safe mode.&nbsp; I tried to reinstall windows from my backup disks, however, the diagnostics indicates the&nbsp;Total Memory is 4096 mb.&nbsp; I cannot restore
 back to factory because D: Recover Files is a different Letter. I have tried my&nbsp;Windows Repair Disks, System Recovery Disks, System Image Backups, and Advanced Repair Options in the Bios.&nbsp; It was suggested that I try Bootrec.exe, however, I can't get to the
 command prompt.&nbsp; The data is on the disk, however, unless I can change the drive letters back to normal, the only thing I am able to&nbsp;do is get into the Bios to change the boot order to boot from the CD Rom.</p>
<p>
"C" is now "E", "D" is now "C" and "E" is now "C".&nbsp; This laptop has an internal CD drive which used to be "E"&nbsp; I can boot from the CD drive.&nbsp; There is no floppy drive.&nbsp;

<p>While you could use macros to achieve your aim, I would discourage you from doing this. In a multitasking environment, macros are quite unreliable. A far better method would use an additional folder context menu item. You would simply right-click the current
 folder (e.g. "2018"), then left-click "Create Subfolders". This would give you the nominated subfolders under 2018.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Thankyou ever so much for your response but your knowledge and mine are light years apart as this syntax is way beyond me and further, more complex than I was looking for.&nbsp; Some more background if you would be so kind to consider it.&nbsp; I have say 40 Suppliers
 to my little shop and I am wanting to save wasting paper on printing out all of the invoices, statements and credit not they send me so I wanted to simply create a supplier directory say 'Utility Company' then within that directory, create 3 directories named
 "invoices" , 'statements' and 'credits'.&nbsp; As I have 40 suppliers, I simply wanted to create these 3 directories as noted above for each supplier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I wanted to do was very simple, a 1 off task and thats about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, to create the 'automation' needs to be quick and easy. I downloaded an app called "tiny ???' and could not get that to do what I wanted ... at this stage, I could
 have done the task manually by now and been finished but .... I downloaded an app Pulovers Macro Creator and quickly realized that this program was very good but way too complicated over the top for what I am needing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Mr Frederik, am I a lost cause or is there a simply way or application to do this task.&nbsp; Thankyou even for taking the time to read all of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, i am interested in learning how to code windows to create little scripts for my own purpose.&nbsp; Could you please direct me to where I can learn the syntax of what you did above please</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>The method I gave you is simple. It looks complicated in my post because I needed to make very sure that someone with little technical knowledge would succeed no matter what. It's much like describing a car wheel change. To a mechanic I would say "Change
 the wheel!". To a novice I would need to explain where to car jack is, how to jack up the car, how to undo the nuts (clockwise or anticlockwise?) etc. etc. If you feel that you can trust me then I'll install my script for you under remote control within a
 couple of minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Batch files in their simplest form are a collection of console commands. This implies that you must know your console commands before you can put them inside batch files:&nbsp;<em>copy, del, md, echo, type, set&nbsp;</em>etc. There are a few dozen of these that you
 would need to know. The console command <em>help</em> gives you a nice collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In their advanced form batch files use variables and conditional execution. This is a bit of a black art and requires a combination of experience plus trial and error. A Google query such as
<em>help batch files</em> will probably get you lots of help. The best way is to try something simple, then build things up gradually. I'm happy to help you if you have a specific question.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note also that batch files are not "nice" from a programmer's point of view. They are "quick and dirty". If you want a nice scriping language then you could use VB Script or PowerShell. VB Script is somewhat chatty and requires an IDE (Integrated Development
 Environment) in order for you to be really successful. PowerShell is incredibly powerful and very terse. I never quite managed to wrap my mind around it. VB Script is my game.</p>

<p>Thanks very much.&nbsp; What you call the 'console' commands I think are what I would call DOS commands.&nbsp; I remember quite a few but certainly not 20 as I have never ever used them in 30 odd years.&nbsp; I guess my question is...is the batch file option the best to
 do what I want or are there better applications?.&nbsp; I am certain there are because 30 years in IT is 'forever'.&nbsp; i guess this is now my only question mate.&nbsp; and if the batch file is the go, how can I refresh my knowledge of the DOS commands?</p>

<p>DOS is an operating system that died with in about 2001 with Windows ME. Under all current versions of Windows there is no DOS but if you prefer to refer to console commands as "DOS commands" then so be it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For simple scripts, console commands are easiest to use. To see their syntax, open a console screen with cmd.exe, then use either of these two commands, e.g. to get help with xcopy.exe:</p>
<p>
</p><p>xcopy /?&nbsp; | more</p>
<p>xcopy /y &gt; xcopy.txt (followed by&nbsp;<em>notepad xcopy.txt)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>For more complex tasks you would need to use CScript or PowerShell.</p>

<i>password</i> for "publishing calendars to calendars.office.microsoft.com"?&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether I enter my password over and over again (as instructed), or simply press OK without entering my password, or otherwise simply close the pop-up window or hit
 cancel, the result continues to be the same: the same "Windows Security" pop-up keeps reappearing over and over and over again--usually, 3 successive times in a row, and generally, each time I open my Firefox browser.&nbsp; Needless to say, this gotten to be quite
 annoying.&nbsp; I've tried everything I can think of to fix this and to prevent it from continuing to happen, but nothing I've tried seems to work.&nbsp; If anyone can offer some help or guidance regarding this issue, I'd really appreciate it.
<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
<br />
