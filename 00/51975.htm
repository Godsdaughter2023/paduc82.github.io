<h2>            Update to destiny 2 failed</h2>
                    <p>Hello, would be nice if someone knows what's going on with the new xbox one interface update. I was downloading an update for destiny 2 but paused it because internet speed was slow and had to do something else at the time and forgot to continue downloading the update. Next day, i start the xbox and see theres some update with the interface/home then i try to start destiny 2 but says that there is an update needed and the game cannot start before it is finished downloading and that it will say "ready" when its done. BUT. Both the destiny update and another game i was downloading were erased from the que! The other game i just found on the store and started the download again, but for the destiny 2 update i see no way i can continue it.&nbsp;</p><p>So i just need to know if there's a way to force an update on it or somehow continue from&nbsp;where it left off. Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 is Stuck in high contrast mode WHEN I use my own desk top - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianpurdie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 is Stuck in high contrast mode WHEN I use my own desk top background picture.</h2>
                    <p>After a lot of sleuthing across a number of forums, I discovered that the extremely dismal rendering/not rendering of all sites I regularly visit on a daily basis was all due to a Win 8 solution
<strong>"Windows 8 is Stuck in high contrast mode"</strong>. OK, that was remedied eventually by this method:<br />
<br />
"Go to your start page, then click on desktop. Once you get to your desktop, RIGHT CLICK on the screen. A small box will open to the right of the pointer. Click on PERSONALIZE. Then click on the WINDOWS theme under the 3 default windows themes. You will click
 on the one with the flower on it. This will turn off you high contrast".</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/windows-8-is-stuck-in-high-contrast-mode/08a28d49-dd75-47f3-a359-19b679329657">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/windows-8-is-stuck-in-high-contrast-mode/08a28d49-dd75-47f3-a359-19b679329657</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Works just fine, high contrast now all gone - all sites rendering correctly!<strong> Whoa!</strong> Where's my desk top background picture gone? Back to settings/personalisation. Ah! There's my saved desk top photo. Click, desk top background restored, so
 is the rotten "high contrast" now restored.<br />
<br />
<strong>QUESTION: </strong>How to restore my desk top background and kill "high contrast" forever?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: Ever since way back to the old DOS 5, and Win 3.1 days - have I wasted so much time on a PC, by
<strong>upgrading from Win 8 to 8.1</strong>. A monumental mistake on my part.</p>

            <p>Replying to myself: This was <strong>NOT</strong> caused by the original Win 8 upgrade from Win XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was solely due to a catastrophic combined upgrade/update to Win 8.1 - I've solved/retrieved nearly 90% of all the other problems that change created in the last couple of weeks.<br />

            <p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur due to a specific background picture that you are using on the computer. .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you face the same issue while using a different customized wallpaper?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't checked for the same, try using a different wallpaper and check the high contrast mode pertains on the desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, websites are rendered differently in high contrast mode. </p>
<p>Refer to the link to find out the details on the information:<br />

            <p><em>"This issue might occur due to a specific background picture that you are using on the computer"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, that is exactly what I am doing - just as every other PC user I know, wants and uses. Their very own background picture, usually a family photo. Mine just happens to be Win XP Bliss.jpg though.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Do you face the same issue while using a different customized wallpaper?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean a Win 8.1 packaged Microsoft "Theme"? <strong>NO!</strong> That's the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Also, websites are rendered differently in high contrast mode"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I know, I've been bashing my head against a brick wall for two weeks over that. The question is:
<em>"How do I kill, slay, murder, banish your 'high contrast mode' forever from my PC</em>. I neither want nor need "high contrast mode", and I've done enough research over the last few weeks to determine the majority of users don't want it either. If you have
 a need fine, that should be an "optional extra/add-on" not some moronic default.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I need:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>a) My choice of background, and;</p>
<p>b) <strong>NO</strong> "high contrast mode"</p>
<p>
</p><p>How hard is that, remember many of us come from Win 3.1/95/98/XP backgrounds, and then find Win 8 and 8.1 have a truckload of guff we neither need nor want. My only upgrade motivation [as with many others] was modern updated browsers no longer function satisfactorily
 in Win XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Else? I wouldn't have gone to the expense of an upgrade. This PC of mine, as good as it is, is merely a
<strong>TOOL</strong>. It is not a life changing experience for me, it doesn't need to keep me in harmony with the Universe. My motor vehicle is also a tool, I don't need to waste weeks learning how it works at a nuts and bolt level, nor do I need it adorned
 with a TV, curtains and a lounge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I quickly looked at the link you provided above, it didn't prove helpful beyond telling me Win 8.1 should just have a simple switch in settings somewhere obvious to
<strong>NOT</strong> to have "high contrast mode".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mate, I'm a highly educated, experienced person with decades of experience in electronics. I'm not new to this gig, I still teach electronics online after 16 years - even though I'm a "senior citizen".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry if I come across as "old and cranky" but Microsoft is kicking own goals everywhere here with this latest rendition. Remember, there are far more older, experienced users around than the new kids and people buying updated PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PS:</strong> Why do I always seem to go through a tortuous process to sign in, are we some "secret society"?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Migrate everything relating to my favourite programs and browsers to the new SSD with Win 7 and then go forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leaving Win 8 and 8.1 behind until they fix it up. In the absence of a Microsoft answer...</p>

                    <p>My HP G61 updated from W7 to W10 some months ago and everything works perfectly except Cortana. When I go to Cortana settings the toggle&nbsp;is Off and I can't turn it on because the message says 'Cortana isn't supported in the region and language you've selected'.
 However all&nbsp;my settings&nbsp;are English UK, so in theory it should work. I even downloaded English UK as a new Speech language to replace the default English US</p>

            <p>Thank you for your time and response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo ideapad 500-15ACZ</p>
<p>
</p><p>That I just bought 7 days ago and this happened only hrs after first turning it on. &nbsp;So you may be right that's it's a hardware issue. &nbsp;I most definitely will be returning this laptop, but I'd like to gain the experience with this issue anyway, seeing that
 I'm starting a career in IT and would like to work for Microsoft one day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have yet to try recovery or restore or repair media, because I don't have any, but I will obtain this later today and write back.</p>
<p>However, OneKey restore has successfully restored it 3 or 4 times already, but it just keeps going to blue screen error code: 0xc0000185</p>
<p>So I've been trying to figure out why and solve the issue because simply restoring isn't fixing anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this isn't a hardware issue due to the fact that it's new and booted up to begin with, though I may be wrong.</p>
<p>I think this is a Windows 10 update problem as many other are going through this exact situation after updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's what I've done so far</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chkdsk</p>
<p>Errors detected in the uppercase file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chkdsk /f</p>
<p>Windows cannot run disk checking on this volume because it is write protected</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sfc /scannow</p>
<p>Windows resource protection could not perform the requested operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</p>
<p>Error:50</p>
<p>DISM does not support servicing Windows PE with the /online option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then in recovery advanced options</p>
<p>X:\windows\system 32&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chkdsk</p>
<p>The type of the file system is NTFS.</p>
<p>The volume is in use by another process. Chkdsk might report errors when no corruption is present.</p>
<p>Volume label is boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read-only chkdsk found bad on-disk uppercase table - using system table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stage 3: Examining security descriptors...</p>
<p>Errors detected in the uppercase file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I did Chkdsk /f again and got same response)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(So then I tried)</p>
<p>DISKPART&gt; list disk</p>
<p>There are no fixed disks to show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is where I left. &nbsp;I'm not sure what to do from here.</p>

            <p>I put the dvd in, but can't get it to work. &nbsp;I tried, repair, recovery, reset &amp; install. &nbsp;None of it is working, still just says either "driver is locked" or "hard disk not detected"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems even with this media I still need to either unlock the driver or make my laptop recognize the hard disk.</p>
<p>I guess after everything I've done the answer is starting to point more and more towards a missing or corrupted driver or hardware issues.</p>

<p><span>Since, the automatic repair doesn’t help to repair the startup files, you may try to repair them using these commands through Command Prompt under Advance Options.

            <p>Hello SnakierIce55222,</p><p><br /></p><p>I just want to take the moment to apologize for the inconvenience and pain this must have brought you. Reading this entire situation I do feel with you on your anger and headache this may have caused you.</p><p><br /></p><p>From the best of my knowledge which please don't quote me on this I may be incorrect as I have not read the rules and terms for post in the Forza 7 Giveaway.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually the reaction is to have you Email, Call or Open a Chat Support with Forza 7 teams or publisher involved in this case being both (Turn 10 and Microsoft Studios) I'm not 100% sure on how Both or Either Company may go about this. And I know it may not be much to you but as another member of the Xbox Gaming Community. I would like to reach out to you can send my&nbsp;sincerest apologies.&nbsp;<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Please feel free to comment anytime, Xbox is here for you and We are here for you!</p><p><br /></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>NightstepShadow</p>

            <p>The forums here are mainly for troubleshooting. No one here can or could address any of the issues you've posted.</p><p><br />What I state below is from relevant information that I am familiar with. And it will appear harsh but I or anyone else can state their opinion as well.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
<p>"i dint ask any compensation from the xbox support and asked them to send the case to who can give me the said compensation as i was told by the rewards team"<br />&nbsp;- Xbox Support can only manage their cases. They can't create a case for another group or department.<br />&nbsp;- Xbox Rewards has their own support<br />&nbsp;- Specific promotions will also have their own support </p><p><br /></p>
<p>"the problem with the support is something very easy to understand , i went there because i thought the problem was with my account not anything with the rewards and they gave me wrong information after wrong information"<br />&nbsp;- Again, as you experienced, Xbox Support was not familiar with or able to point you in the right direction for a promotion that they have not direction or support resources for</p>
<p><br /></p><p>"i contacted them day one of the giveaway and after one month no one solved the problem not only that but the worse was the fact that i was told very clearly that the case was sent to the rewards team and rangers "<br />&nbsp;- If you were in contact with Xbox Support, their support Rangers would only be able to handle Xbox Support issues. Not Forza Promo issues.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>"my mothers dead isnt a reason for me to have more or less things than any other person that is a costumer but there is one thing they should have done instead of using her dead and that would be respect me"<br />&nbsp;- I don't understand the relevance of your parents death unless she had something to do with a parent account. If you were not 18 when you tried to enter the contest then this whole discussion is irrelevant. You cannot enter into a contest under the age of 18.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>"about the sale and promotions foruns , i contacted them 2 times one back in october other in december i think and you know what ? zero awsers as you can check if you want"<br />&nbsp;- That forum group is different than the forum group here. If they choose to respond or not, it's up to them.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>"the legal department from usa as contacted in october you know how many awsers ? zero awsers"<br />"i talked with the legal department because i thought microosft was a big company with respect for me but when you start a conversation with "you could have deserved a compensation but since you contacted us&nbsp; a lot of times you dont get it ? it says a lot about he company."<br />&nbsp;- The legal department, in all cases that I have ever been aware of would never contact you directly. They would contact the attorney whom you would have had to hire to represent you. And after your attorney has presented documentation of your case to Microsoft.<br />&nbsp;- And all of this over a Forza promotion?! I'm sorry but this just does not seem possible</p>
<p><br /></p><p>"my 13 years old brother xbox one got banned from live"<br />&nbsp;- This will happen. You can't speak to what did or did not happen. The Xbox Enforcement Team has the ability to review the communication and details of what occurred. And if it's bad enough, they will permantly suspend the account.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>"i dont want or need to go to a court with microsoft and wast a year or two on this that is why i acepted to try to reach the said agreement and as of this momment there is not a legal thing agaist microsoft"<br />&nbsp;- Here is the legal process that Microsoft has spelled out. What you state seems to deviate from what the Microsoft Legal Team does or will do.<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/servicesagreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/servicesagreement/</a></p>

<p>I have been waiting for my 12 month code to be refunded to me, I was originally told it would take 2 days TOPS to get that code to me. Now it has been OVER a month and about 4 phone calls later, and a lady told me about a week and a half ago it would be
 just a couple more days, if that even. I am getting so fed up with this! This is outrageous! It was your guys' mess up to begin with, and I, the consumer, have to pay for it by being out of Gold for over a month. &nbsp;I have been a paying customer, non stop, for
 4 years. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really despise Microsoft as a whole right now. I would have to say that this is the most disappointed I have been in anyone's customer service, EVER. &nbsp; &nbsp;I don't want to talk to you guys ANYMORE. Just give me my freaking code.</p>

    <title>Bug in Windows - Remove VGA Setting in Windows 7 64 bits - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bug in Windows - Remove VGA Setting in Windows 7 64 bits</h2>
                    Hi folks,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using Windows 7 64 bits together with an ATI Mobility Radeon card. My PC was working fine with the HDMI output until I accidentally set VGA display to be my secondary display. Now even pressing the detect button in Display Settings in Control Panel
 doesn't allow it to switch to HDMI.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As the VGA display setting seems to be a hardcoded setting, I need Microsoft to advise on how to remove it so that when I press the Detect button, the Windows 7 OS would detect my displays properly again. Hopefully it can then detect the HDMI port on my
 PC and recognise it as the secondary display.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Suspect that this would need a registry setting to remove off the hardcoding for VGA Display Driver being the secondary display.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My email is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Grateful for any advice to do this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hi Randy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On Windows 10 Photos app, you can edit and enhance your photo by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on the photo and then select the pencil icon to open the editing window.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/febe8ced-591a-457c-8579-e8116656bf39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/febe8ced-591a-457c-8579-e8116656bf39" /></a></li><li>You can select how you want to edit your photo.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5459a73f-3ed0-435f-967e-8fd38316239b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5459a73f-3ed0-435f-967e-8fd38316239b" /></a></li><li>And now you can save the edited photo that you created.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/080a4262-920b-42eb-8b46-3bc02751a76c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/080a4262-920b-42eb-8b46-3bc02751a76c" /></a></li></ol>
<p>And with regard to add or change tag it can only be done to file explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You use the Send Feedback button that you will see on Settings window to give suggestions, comments or feedback. This can help us&nbsp; improve the service that we are providing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>Cute hound, Ma!</p>
<p>OK, I submitted a feedback to add the ability to tag images directly in the Photos App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>fwiw, I have around 10,000 pictures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I make extensive use of tags in order to be able to search for the images I'm interested in seeing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            SQL Server 2012 Command line installation</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to install SQL Server 2012 from a command line.&nbsp; (I have several servers to build and I want them identical)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The command line is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setup.exe /q /ACTION=Install /FEATURES=Fulltext /INSTANCENAME=TestInstance1 /SQLSVCACCOUNT="zzz-SQL-Server" /SQLSVCPASSWORD="" /SQLSYSADMINACCOUNTS="" /AGTSVCACCOUNT="NT AUTHORITY\Network Service" /SQLSVCINSTANTFILEINIT="True" /IACCEPTSQLSERVERLICENSETERMS</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SQL Service Account is a Domain Managed Service Account created and assigned to the server. The problem is that the SQLSVCPASSWORD switch is mandatory (and it wont accept a null value) and I don't know what it is except its 240 characters long. Can anyone
 advise me on how to progress with this please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

    <title>Bulk file renaming issue in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vostro3500  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bulk file renaming issue in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to rename a series of files with a long name. If I select and rename:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1908-20 HCB red Album - XRH, BEA, Swyth, Congo (1) to (20)</p>
<p>
</p><p>to </p>
<p>
</p><p>1908-20 HCB Red Album - XRH, BEA, Swyth, Congo</p>
<p>
</p><p>then the first file becomes</p>
<p>1908-20 HCB Red Album - XRH, BEA, Swyth, Congo (1)</p>
<p>the second file</p>
<p>1908-20 HCB Red Album - XRH, BEA, Swyth, Congo (<strong>20</strong>)</p>
<p>and the third etc. 1908-20 HCB Red Album - XRH, BEA, Swyth, Congo (21) all the way to (38)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With shorter names, ordinary names it works OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked fine in Windows 7 so why not in Windows 10?</p>

            Hi Andie, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />You can download iCloud from the Apple website here:

<br /><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204283</a>
<br />
<br />Once you've installed it and run it for the first time, you'll be prompted to create an iCloud account. You can follow the instructions and once you've registered, you'll be able to use the iCloud storage provided by Apple.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know if you need further support. Thanks!

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yes, Windows 10 can be installed on a server machine. However, you also have to consider that you can fully utilize the capacity of the Windows server operating system with the specification that you have provided.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to consider is the availability of&nbsp; the drivers for the operating system to recognize the hardware to your server machine. In that case, we suggest to contact the server machine's manufacturer.</p>
<p>

    <title>Can&#39;t delete second Administrator account in Windows XP... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nbcomputersolutions  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t delete second Administrator account in Windows XP...</h2>
                    <p>Working on two laptops, both Dell Vostro 1000's, both with Windows XP Professional, for a client who owns a restaurant. This client wants me to create two User accounts on each laptop, one with Administrator privileges (for the restaurant management) and
 the other with limited privileges (for the restaurant staff). The client also wants these laptops to be stripped of any domain with which they used to be associated. Changing the Administrator password on both to something new, I went into 'System Properties'
 and made each laptop a member of a Workgroup rather than of a Domain. After restart, I went to create another user account on each laptop, one with limited privileges for the restaurant staff. Windows would not allow me, however, to create such an account
 because it said there first must be an account in existence with Administrator privileges. There was, however, such an account and one over which I had control so the situation was confusing. I proceeded to create a second Administrator account on both laptops,
 after which I was allowed to created a Limited user account. Now I have two Administrator accounts and one limited account. I would like to delete one of the two Administrator accounts but Windows XP gives me no clear option to do so. What can be done?

            <p>Having a single admin account is as short-sighted as having a single house key. In this forum we regularly deal with queries from users who are no longer able to use their one and only admin account. A minor accident will cause them an enormous amount of
 grief.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should keep both admin accounts, give each a strong password, then give the owner detailed documentation about both of them. You should also warn him about the dangers of using an outdated and unsupported operating system.</p>

<p>Thanks DaveM121 . &nbsp;Tried it but didn't work. </p>
<p>My other concern was if I have to do this same trial and error thing with every other application ( i.e. Inventor ).</p>
<p>This has been already a bit of a painful process to go thru as it is, considering, again, &nbsp;that I invested a good amount of money to have the muscle computer that I thought I had.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bit of a disappointment and a huge waste of time.</p>

    <title>Missing Files in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lakshmi narayanan gurumurthy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Files in Windows 8</h2>
                    I had recently purchased a game and today morning, I made a copy of that disc as an image file onto my D:\Downloads\Games folder. After that, I installed the game, played it for some time, then rebooted into Ubuntu for some work. I came back to Windows
 only a couple of hours ago.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I came, I found that the installed game files were missing and when I searched the installation location, it was empty.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then, I checked the folder where I had saved the image file, <b>I found it inside that folder.</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought it was an issue with Windows Explorer, so I restarted Windows Explorer, and then when I checked again,
<b>I found that not only the installation files were missing, but also the image file, which was present less than a minute ago, was also missing now!</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>I did the obvious then, restarted my system and checked again, they were still missing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A summary of steps I've tried:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Restart Windows Explorer</div>
<div>2. Restart System</div>
<div>3. Rebuilt the index</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also a virus scan came clean(Bitdefender Total Security 2013). Show Hidden Files is ON.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would be grateful if someone could help me with this</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            easy fix i just fixed it myself, okay under the file explorer delete the pictures folder it wont delete your pictures, than right click the white space and add new library, add a library and under the manage tab set it for pictures, than go into the pictures
 folder it will ask for a folder to include click it and go to your computer users your name and My Pictures folder after you're set. Good Luck<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/355ec09b-8c6b-463f-8a40-8ff10b04f4bc" />

    <title>Suddenly can&#39;t print to pdf or any printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rontiara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suddenly can&#39;t print to pdf or any printer</h2>
                    <p>I've been printing to pdf and my two inkjet printers all day.&nbsp; Suddenly I get an error message saying the document can't be printed, and giving three meaningless reasons for that.&nbsp; I've had this irritating problem for some time now; I've noticed it usually
 happens late in the evening, even if I've been printing all day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option I have found is to reboot -- which can be a real problem when the document I want to print will expire if I reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed a lot of people are having the same complaint no matter what brand printer they have, so it would be nice if we could find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 7 Pro, and all my drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm having several difficulties using Play To. I can send a playlist from one PC to the other; however, the entire list does not appear to load. Often, only the first song or two will play then WMP will crash on the "Played To" PC. Sometimes, a song will
 repeat a few times then the stream just stops even though there's more enqueued.</p>

<p>I ended up doing a clean install on the laptop and HTPC. Everything works properly now.</p>
<p>The clean install on the laptop did not resolve the issue. I was still receiving&nbsp;"device not responding" when&nbsp;I would play to my HTPC.&nbsp;I knew then that the problem was with the HTPC and not likely to be from a Vista to 7 upgrade on the laptop.</p>
<p>On the HTPC, I had previously installed ffdshow and&nbsp;later the Shark codec&nbsp;pack. While these codec's gave me the missing media formats I needed&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;a boost in performance, they ultimately crippled my Play To functionality.</p>
<p>Uninstalling the codecs proved unsuccessful. Using graph studio, I was able to see ffdshow still rendering some audio formats. Rather than go through the painstaking process of reassigning codecs / testing, I just performed a clean install.</p>
<p>I will now install each codec I need individual and create restore points along the way. In the event that anyone from Microsoft is reading, please include support for FLAC, OGG and MKV. These are widely used formats and while I love WMC, it's incomplete
 without them.</p>
<p>Thank you for all of the support and suggestions you've given me, Barb.</p>
