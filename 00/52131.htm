            SMS short codes (vs. messages) or the source the codes may be coming from could be blocked by your provider. &nbsp;You can try contacting your mobile provider to inquire if any of these anti-spam measures are in place and if they can be disabled (at least temporarily).
 &nbsp;Skype offers no other method of verification.

<p>Hi&nbsp;sigmundXD,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to Techfreak_'s post, if you cannot receive the code, you may also use a different browser or device to request another verification code and then check if you will be able to receive it. If all else fails, please contact your mobile provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still cannot receive the verification code after contacting your mobile provider, I regret to inform you but there's no other option to retrieve verification code when setting up a caller Id on your account. If this will be the case, you may consider
 using a Skype number as your caller ID. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a heads up, Skype number is designed to receive calls from landline and mobile numbers, but you can also use this as caller Id if in case you are planning to provide it to multiple contacts, on your website or business cards. However, you may need to
 purchase a <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/features/online-number/?intcmp=CS-Upsell-FA1248-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype number </a>first then set it up as your caller Id after.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To set up caller identification using your Skype Number:</strong><br />
1. <a href="https://secure.skype.com/account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign in</a> to your account.<br />
2. In the Manage features section, click <strong>Caller ID</strong>.<br />
3. Click <strong>select a pre-saved number</strong>.<br />
4. From the bulleted list displayed, select the Skype Number that you want to use as your caller identification.<br />
5. Click <strong>Save Settings</strong>. Your caller identification is now set and ready to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Skype number as your caller Id, you won't need to provide verification code and it will be activated immediately after setting it up on your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>

    <title>HORRIBLE customer service, problems with purchase &#38;amp&#59; 5 days - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HORRIBLE customer service, problems with purchase &#38;amp&#59; 5 days to resolve&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am a happy ps3 owner.&nbsp; I recently purchased, albeit late in the game, a 360 with Kinect.&nbsp; I went online to xbox live and purchased (or attempted to purchase) my very first game:&nbsp; “Kung Fu High Impact.”</p>

<p>I entered my credit card information, and I was billed.&nbsp; Then the online system gave me an error.&nbsp; The money was refunded but I never got the game.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, I attempted to purchase the same game a second time.&nbsp; I was billed again.&nbsp; However, it never gave me the game and this time it did not provide a refund.&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft technical support.&nbsp; In fact, I contacted them three (3) different
 times over a period of 24 hours.&nbsp; I explained that if they could not immediately provide me with the game, then just refund my money.&nbsp; I was told that it would take ‘days’ to refund my money since they had to submit the claim to their superiors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told one time that it would take 2-3 days for technical support to address the issue.&nbsp; Yesterday, I was told by technical support that it may take up to 5 days!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is HORRIBLE customer service/support.&nbsp; I paid for the game.&nbsp; I have NOT been provided with the game.&nbsp; And worse yet, it takes DAYS to possibly be provided with a refund and/or resolution of the issue.&nbsp; I have already spent HOURS with technical support
 and I have made no progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This experience is inexcusable.&nbsp; I realize everybody said that online gaming on xbox was better than ps3, but I must say, I 100% totally disagree.&nbsp; I’ve NEVER had sooooooo many problems.&nbsp; In fact, I don’t EVER remember having to wait possibly FIVE (5) days
 before somebody ‘tries’ to resolve the issue for any other product that I have EVER purchased.&nbsp; And again, this is NOT an error on my part.&nbsp; I paid for the game.&nbsp; Online it shows that I paid for the game.&nbsp; But nobody at Microsoft can explain why I can’t be
 provided with a link to download the game nor have they provided me with a refund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE customer support, or lack thereof!!&nbsp; At this point, I told Microsoft to fix the problem.&nbsp; Since I can’t get a refund anytime soon, now I want them to fix the problem and provide me with the game. I’m particularly interested in
 seeing how long it takes them to fix their own screw up over a $15 game.&nbsp; Not only have they lost a customer, but worse, they have gained a tremendous amount of negative feedback because I am telling everybody how horrible they are handling their own mistake!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS:&nbsp; I was provided with a free 1 month gold membership the last time I contacted technical support trying to get this issue resolved.&nbsp; However, as I politely explained to technical support (or perhaps not so politely), if I CANNOT download the very first
 game I paid for, then what the hell am I going to do with a 30 day membership?&nbsp; NOTHING WORKS!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>it takes 72 hours to issue an refund and upto 90days for you to receive it</p>
<p>72 hours is ms' s side also 90days is your bank side as us to foreign cards can sometimes take longer</p>
<p>you can check at billing.microsoft.com to see if the refund is pending or issued</p>
<p>if it is issued then it would be pending at your bank</p>
<p>ok with your download issue</p>
<p>does your physical region match your account region?</p>
<p>this excludes vpn and us military bases which case your need to match your actual region</p>
<p>a link wont help you&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can do It yourself on the xbox.com website as long as you match the marketplace with your account region</p>
<p>download links will not work as xbox doesnt accept them</p>
<p>you may only queue to your xbox via the website or your console</p>
<p>fyi kinect games are region locked</p>

<p>Dear ngocphi,</p>
<p>Upon initially reading your email, I really thought it was a JOKE. &nbsp;But evidently, you are serious. &nbsp; I’m now even more disappointed in Microsoft. &nbsp;Hence, allow me to respond:</p>
<p>As for the refund, I stated above, “At this point, I told Microsoft to fix the problem. &nbsp;Since I can’t get a refund anytime soon, now I want them to fix the problem and provide me with the game.” &nbsp;Nonetheless, it deserves repeating that it should NOT take
 days for them to put in a ‘request’ for a refund. &nbsp;That is absurd! &nbsp;Microsoft made the mistake. &nbsp;They billed me immediately. &nbsp;They should have the ability to ‘refund’ me immediately. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, as stated above, “Then the online system gave me an error. &nbsp;The money was refunded but I never got the game.” &nbsp;This was the FIRST time. &nbsp;They refunded the money within 5 minutes the FIRST time they made the mistake. &nbsp;Therefore, there is absolutely
 NO reason whatsoever why they couldn’t refund the money the second time – other than HORRIBLE customer service – particularly since I spoke to three (3) different reps from Microsoft in 24 hours.</p>
<p>As for the inability to download the software, your response is even worse to this issue! &nbsp;It has NOTHING to do with my ISP and/or location. &nbsp;How silly! &nbsp; I paid for the game directly from Microsoft online. &nbsp;However, it does NOT show up in my queue. &nbsp;The
 xbox website specifically states, “Game content you buy in the Xbox Games Store is automatically placed in the download queue.” &nbsp;Hence, it has NOTHING to do with the ISP or the location. &nbsp;Your response is just plain WRONG and misguided. &nbsp;I am now even more
 aggravated!</p>
<p>Therefore, if you are a “rep” from Microsoft, I’d like to congratulate you on making my point on the HORRIBLE customer service. &nbsp;Your feedback is 100% wrong and/or irrelevant. &nbsp;Furthermore, they still have NOT fixed the problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for wasting more of my time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: &nbsp;If you do NOT work for Microsoft, then I apologize. &nbsp;I appreciate the time it took you to respond. &nbsp;However, if you are a representative from Microsoft, SHAME ON YOU!</p>

<p>ngocphi is not a MS employee. He is just a regular user trying to help you. And, he is actually correct regarding the account region and physical location match. If those 2 things are different, then you will encounter issues with purchasing and downloading
 items.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As much as you don't want to hear this, the only people that can offer refunds and correct the download history are phone support. Usually, they are pretty quick to issue codes when they can see an item in the purchase history that is not in the user's download
 history. I'm not sure why it has been an issue in your case, but your experience is not the norm.</p>

<p>I would say that it isn't really a bad customer support, i haven't got problems with them, the problem must be a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE customer, can you see? he has issues downloading a game so he receives a refund and again the s... really intelligent
 customer tries to download it again, so, if they give you a refund because you can't donwload it once and you try to download it again where's the problem? in the game of course, but they're giving you options and you stay there, of course you will get burned
 if you play with fire! it's just another PS3 FANBOY trying to make CS look HORRIBLE just like is IQ... LOL</p>

<p>I appreciate the negative feedback. &nbsp;Seriously. &nbsp;I deserve PART of it... but come on... &nbsp;I was with tech support THREE (3) times. &nbsp;ALL of them said it would take 'days' to issue a refund. &nbsp;That is absurd since the first time a refund got issued within minutes.</p>
<p>Second of all, the first person from microsoft said it would take 2-3 days for tech support to resolve the issue. &nbsp;The second person said it would take 5 days. &nbsp;Another problem!</p>
<p>Third, the reason why I tried to download it again is because microsoft said the problem was FIXED. &nbsp;Clearly, it was not. &nbsp;In fact, I contacted tech support a third time because microsoft emailed ME saying the problem was fixed and the game was in in my
 queue, but it was NOT. &nbsp;Hence, another mistake!</p>
<p>Fourth, in my humble opinion, it should NOT take FIVE (5) days to resolve the problem. &nbsp;That is ridiculous. &nbsp;You can hate me all you want... but come on... FIVE (5) days!? &nbsp; That is just plain HORRIBLE customer service. &nbsp;Even if I'm a ***, you shouldn't
 take FIVE (5) days to try and resolve the issue. &nbsp;I've never ever heard of a five (5) day call back period for any product - ever!</p>
<p>Fifth, you complain that I shouldn't have tried to download it again. &nbsp;So what should I have done? &nbsp;Just ignore microsoft when they say the problem has been resolved? &nbsp;Should I just permanently never go online again -- which defeats the whole point of owning
 the product? &nbsp;That doesn't make any sense. &nbsp;One would suspect that if you receive an email from microsoft confirming the purchase with download instructions, it would actually work -- particularly after contacting technical support!</p>
<p>Sixth, as to the "account region and physical location match." &nbsp;Perhaps I am mistaken, but that does NOT make sense to me. &nbsp;Perhaps I am just 'slow,' but allow me to explain: &nbsp;I paid for the game. &nbsp;It accepted my payment. &nbsp;It said it would be put in my download
 queue automatically. &nbsp;I also received an email saying it was placed in my download queue. &nbsp;But it is NOT there... so where could the account region/physical location even come into play? &nbsp;If they couldn't put it in my download queue, they should NOT have billed
 me for it. &nbsp;I haven't even 'attempted' to download the game because it has yet to be put in my download queue. &nbsp;All THREE (3) of the microsoft techs were stumped. &nbsp; And not that it matters, but I live in New Jersey, USA. &nbsp;Its a boilerplate 360 with no mods
 or anything... and it simply doesn't work!</p>
<p>So again... you can flame me all you want.. &nbsp;and I ACKNOWLEDGE that I definitely do sound like a ***, but come on. &nbsp;Put your biases aside and ask yourself, "Should customer service really take FIVE (5) days to 'try' and resolve the issue? &nbsp;Should the customer
 really have to wait DAYS to 'try' and get a refund despite talking to three different customer service reps? &nbsp; I don't &nbsp;care if that is ps3, microsoft, or friggin' Nintendo. &nbsp;THAT IS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MICROSOFT SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED.</p>
<p>And just so you know... they still have NOT refunded my money, have not fixed the problem, and have not contacted me.</p>
<p>PS: &nbsp;And just so you know.. the game IS in my purchase history, but it is NOT in my download history/quie... and none of the 3 reps could figure out the problem... &nbsp;And just so you know.. the last tech support guy from microsoft told me that I must erase
 my cache on my 360... but I had to explain to him that it was IRRELEVANT. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because the damn game does NOT show up in my download queue even on a pc computer -- therefore, I didn't even have to turn on the 360 yet since there was nothing to download!
 (he AGREED). &nbsp; Hopefully you can acknowledge my frustration... &nbsp;</p>
<p>But no worries about the flaming.. &nbsp;sometimes I deserve it.. but seriously.. this is TRULY just HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE... &nbsp;FIVE (5) days is pathetic... &nbsp;even assuming arguendo I am a ***... &nbsp;
</p>
<p>And not that it has any relevance whatsoever, but I've since read other postings on this very forum about people evidently having the same exact problem (paying but not being able to get the download)... &nbsp;</p>

<p>ok let me explain</p>
<p>you use a vpn you circumvent the region locks however you will alwsys fail with region locks at 99% for the best experience your account country and actual country must match</p>
<p>the purchase history and download history are completely different</p>
<p>purchase history only shows up on the computer when you are at xbox.com</p>
<p>download history only shows up on your xbox</p>
<p>since you want to know why its not on your download history</p>
<p>are you downloading It from your console</p>
<p>thats where you need to initiate the download</p>
<p>if your xbox.com account isnt the same as your xbox console then you need to download with the correct account</p>
<p>so since your forums account has 0 gamerscore I am thinking you arent logingin the correct account</p>
<p>unless you made the forums account seperately</p>
<p>if this forums account is where your download was used or purchssed you must download this profile to download the content</p>
<p>have you even done basic troubleshooting?</p>

<p>I purchased the game using my xbox 360. &nbsp;I entered my credit card information using the xbox 360. &nbsp;However, there is NO place to download from on the xbox 360. &nbsp;Therefore, I really do NOT think it has anything whatsoever to do with my region. &nbsp;Indeed, what
 more can I possibly do then go online using the 360, and enter my credit card information on the 360??</p>
<p>The only reason I'm on the pc is because I'm on here messaging you guys. &nbsp;I also went on the pc to communicate with technical support on the computer... and that is where I confirmed the purchase via email and/or in my account.</p>
<p>However, again, I purchased the game on the xbox and entered the credit card information on the 360. &nbsp;I do NOT understand how there could be ANY trouble with the downloads. &nbsp;Furthermore, THREE (3) different tech support people from microsoft were of no help.</p>
<p>Lastly, I downloaded numerous FREE demos with NO problems whatsoever on my 360.&nbsp; It was only when I finally went to 'pay' for the game that I ran into a snag.&nbsp; And now I'm spending HOURS trying to get it resolved since microsoft was of NO help and takes
 DAYS to try and resolve the problem.&nbsp; PERHAPS I AM WRONG, BUT TO ME, THIS IS A HORRIBLE WAY TO TREAT A CUSTOMER THAT IS ATTEMPTING TO BUY A GAME.&nbsp; And the way I figure it, if it takes them FIVE (5) days to get in touch with me for a system that is soon to
 be outdated, I can't imagine how long it will take them if somebody was to buy the newer xbox system coming out in a few months -- which inevitably will have technical glitches.&nbsp; This whole experience has seriously caused me to HATE dealing with microsoft.</p>

<p>sigh ok</p>
<p>you don't understand how region locks work</p>
<p>you need to read this</p>
<p>before you rule out anything</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/27/t/34.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../34.aspx</a></p>
<p>I’m getting “region” errors</p>
<p>In order to have the best experience on the marketplace, make sure that your account region and physical location match. Your account region was set when you first created your Gamertag and can be checked by going to
<a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://billing.microsoft.com</a> and clicking on “Personal Information”.</p>
<p>that being said</p>
<p>region locks do not apply to every single content this is why you can download MOST content out of region including demos</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>however most KINECT and a lot of m rated content like COD is region locked this is why you cannot download some content if you are outside your account region due to the international laws governing content being different in every region not to mention
 distribution rights</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you need to read your download history on your PROFILE</p>
<p>you can queue the download from the purchase history and make purchases online at xbox.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>xbox.com has a webmarketplace which you should make sure you are loged into the correct account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but your download history doesn't show up online at xbox,com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for the best experience with live or PS3 your physical region and account region should match</p>
<p>there are some region locked content in ps3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            games minimize to the task</h2>
                    <p><span>Greetings,</span></p>
<p><span>Having trouble with windows xp, In the last few months a problem is persistently getting worse. If<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am playing any of my games Age of Empires III, Morrowind, NeverWinter Nights, anything that's not windows. They minimizes to the taskbar with no warning. Internet explorer,Word, Media player all stay up but a white bar appears on the taskbar for a
 second then goes away. I have watched the activity of my system with the task manager under the processes tab. The two programs under my name ( user name ) that seem to be active I uninstalled and it still does it. This happens every few minutes and its driving
 me nuts.</span></p>
<p><span>Has anyone else had this problem?<span>&nbsp; </span>Thanks in advance.</span></p>

<p><span>Here are some solutions (and workarounds) to deal with the problem where games minimize to the Task Bar.</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Install and/or play the game using an administrator account.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Keyboard software has been known to cause this problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>
One player<span>&nbsp; </span>posted that by un-installing their Trust Silverline Direct Access keyboard software, all their games worked again without minimizing to the Task Bar.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Norton's AntiVirus (Internet Security) can cause the problem as well.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The<span>&nbsp; </span>workaround is to disable the program.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To do so, right click it's Tray icon.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One person wrote: "I just went to the Norton Anti-virus options, and turned off the Liveupdate auto update option.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It worked like a charm for me."</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One person wrote: "I finally found that if I open the command line, cd to<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the directory, then type the program name, it works!!!"</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Yet another workaround is to click the screen after you launch the game.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the problem persists, please try these additional troubleshooting steps. :-)</span></p>
<p><span>The most common causes for that problem can be solved with these few steps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the problem persists after you've tried these, please post back and we'll try some more solutions. Good luck! :-)</span></p>
<p><span>A. To see if it's a software conflict:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Temporarily disable Startup programs one at a time, starting with Firewall, Antivirus, and ad blockers using: http://new.jtsoft2001.com/windows/startup.php</span></p>
<p><span>You can lookup what a program does before you disable it here:</span></p>
<p><span>http://www.sysinfo.org/startuplist.php</span></p>
<p><span>B.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Run a virus scan at: http://housecall.antivirus.com Afterwards Download &amp; Run Spybot from: http://security.kolla.de to find any Trojans, Adware, or Spyware which could clog up your system.</span></p>
<p><span>C.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click My Computer / Rightclick the Drive &amp; Choose Properties / Run the "Disk Cleanup..." / Next Click the "Tools" Tab and run the "Error-Checking" and "Defragmentation" utilities.</span></p>
<p><span>D.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Go to the Windows Update site for everything under Critical and Recommended: http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com ;
<span>&nbsp;</span>Some games require a patch: http://www.avault.com/pcrl/patches_list.asp?letter=a</span></p>
<p><span><span>E.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Update DirectX and your Chipset, Sound, &amp;Video Drivers: For all Video / DirectX / Game and Hardware Issues, I have a Checklist of Solutions at: http://mvps.org/nibblesnbits/Video.html<br />

www.microsoft.com/security_essentials</a> and <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 and fix the issues.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Shut Down Mid Game Now Won&#39;t Load, Restore or Update</h2>
                    <p>I was playing a game and out of nowhere the Xbox shut down. I tried turning it on and it would keep quitting out after about 5-10 seconds. I then entered the startup troubleshoot menu and tried&nbsp;to restore factory default settings, I tried both, but they kept getting to a certain point and restarting. I then used the offline file updates.&nbsp;OSU1 &amp; OSU2 get to 72%, overall,&nbsp;then from there&nbsp;to anywhere up to&nbsp;75% it cuts out and starts again from 72%. OSU3 and Rectory Reset error 101 straight away. Has anyone else had this issue and found a way to fix it?</p>

    <title>Cannot add my Windows 10 computer to my Windows 7 homegroup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jon dow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot add my Windows 10 computer to my Windows 7 homegroup</h2>
                    <p>I am very frustrated with the whole Windows 10 Homegroup situation. I have a Homegroup on my Windows 7 computer. I cannot join that HG from my W10 computer. I enter the password and it says it is not correct even though it is. Why is this so complicated?
 Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to share my computers and printers on the same network. I have 2 Windows 7, 2 Windows 8.1, and 1 Windows 10 computer. How can I put those in the same Homegroup or Workgroup to share the folders and printers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the homegroup troubleshooter and it says I have a network problem but when I run that troubleshooter, it cannot find any network problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS keeps trying to get me to upgrade my PC's to Win10 but if I cannot share (EASILY) the folders and printers, they can forget that. Anybody have any step by step directions to make this happen? Thanks.</p>

<h2>            How to disable the &#34;Soap Opera Effect&#34; when playing full screen videos in Edge and other Windows 10 apps&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>I ran into the issue of being stuck with the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
"Soap Opera Effect"</span> when <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">playing full screen videos</span> with certain apps in Windows 10. Most notably "Edge" and "Films and TV" native app.
</span><span>I can't find a setting to disable this effect in each app and on forums. Not only I am not a fan of the effect, but it also adds a lot of contrasts and saturation to the image. Worst of all, it adds artefacts to the footage...
</span>Some old post (dating back as far as 2010) are offering workarounds that I wasn't able to perform in windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue is not present when using Google Chrome or VLC. It really look like a "Microsoft Apps" situation (maybe related to DirectX?)<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Configuration:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Windows 10 home </span></li><li><span>Version 1803 </span></li><li><span>Build 17134.345</span></li><li>Intel Core I7 6700 3.4GHz</li><li>32 GB RAM</li><li>GTX 1080</li></ul>

1 - I right click on the same video and select "open with"</p>

    <title>Windows 7 x64 Bluetooth problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 x64 Bluetooth problem</h2>
                    <p>Hiya,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having problems with Bluetooth on a new system I've built.
</p>
<p>Intel i5-3570</p>
<p>Gigabyte H77m-d3h</p>
<p>2 * 4GB corsair value ram 1333</p>
<p>500GB WD blue</p>
<p>On board graphics</p>
<p>Windows 7 SP1 Home Prem x64</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried 2 bluetooth USB adaptors</p>
<p>Belkin F8T016, </p>
<p>Conceptronic cbt2nano v3.0 </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Bluetooth devices I am trying to connect are<br />
an oldish Samsung mobile<br />
Plantronics backbeat 903 headphones<br />
E Blue BT501 headphones<br />
Unknown make headset with microphone</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Initially I was using the conceptronic adaptor but that did not work with the headphones even with the Toshiba software from the conceptronic website.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then I tried the Belkin one with the software from the Broadcom website. It all went ok and I managed to connect the headphones no problem, but the Bluetooth fails every time I restart the PC. In device manager there is an exclamation
 mark over the Bluetooth adaptor and it says “windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems (code 43)”</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In event viewer it says</p>
<p>Warning event ID 3 “a command sent to the adaptor has timed out. The adaptor did not respond”</p>
<p>Error event ID 17 “the local Bluetooth adaptor has failed in an undetermined manner and will not be used. The driver has been unloaded”</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have searched this problem and there seems to be a fault with windows with exactly the same code 43 and event ID 17 etc when Windows 7 PCs return from standby and there is a hotfix KB982046 which I have tried but that stops with error
 “the update is not applicable to your computer”</p>
<p>In the past sometimes changing the USB port worked, but even that doesn’t now.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have done a fresh install of windows with just the drivers and then installed the Bluetooth and still the same result.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Bluetooth adaptor works absolutely fine on my old PC</p>
<p>Intel<span>&nbsp; </span>E6750 o/c 3.4GHz</p>
<p>Gigabyte p35-s3</p>
<p>2 * 1GB OCZ 1066</p>
<p>500GB Seagate</p>
<p>Nvidia 8500GT 512MB</p>
<p>Windows 7 SP1 Ultimate x64</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Unable to access account via Skype ID login despite Skype ID being valid for others to contact me</h2>
                    I am trying to access my Skype account using my Skype ID, this results in an error 'no account found' type of message. The Skype ID is recognised however when others search for me on Skype and when they call me. I am just unable to access my account using
 the Skype ID as my login data. How do I resolve this issue? I don't want to cancel this account and start a new one and lose all the history of calls and messages in my current Skype account.

<p>Hi NYA,</p>
<p>To do tests and narrow down the cause, please share the following information with me:<br />
1.&nbsp;Does the issue occur to multiple users in your organization?<br />
2.&nbsp;Which version of Skype for Business are you using? How about the operating system.</p>
<p>In addition, if you are using a Windows machine, please access <strong><em>%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Lync</em></strong> to see if the Lync cache folder can be found. If yes, remove the contents in the folder and restart Skype for
 Business again to see if the issue can be resolved.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Henry Huang</p>

<p>Hi NYA,</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>To check if the cache folder can be found, you need to double click the ‘*** Email address is removed for privacy ***’. And if the issue persists after removing</p>
<p>the contents in the folder, I need some information below to further troubleshoot it:</p>
<p>1. Your Skype for Business client detailed version, like Skype for Business 2016 (16.0.6001.1038) 32-bit. To check it: Click the drop-down icon (close to the gear)-&gt;Help-&gt;About Skype for Business.</p>
<p>2. Check if the SIP email address is the same as your SFB login address. To check it:</p>
<p>a. Login to your Exchange admin center</p>
<p>b. Click recipients-&gt;mailboxes.</p>
<p>c. Double click the account you used to login to SFB, then click email address.</p>
<p>Please note you need to be the admin to check this.</p>
<p>3. I have sent you my test account via a private message. Please use it to communicate with others and then check if you can view the conversation history in your Skype for Business client.</p>
<p>I have sent you my test account via a private message. You can click the link below to read it:</p>

<p>Hi NYA,</p>
<p>According to the test results, it seems to be an issue related to your tenant. For this situation, please create two fresh new users and sign in Skype for Business using the two accounts to see if the same behavior occurs.</p>
<p>In addition, please click the gear icon &gt; <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong>. Go to
<strong>Personal</strong>, and select <strong>NONE</strong> in the <strong>Personal information manager</strong> section. Then restart Skype for Business to test.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Henry Huang<br />

<p>Hi Henry.</p>
<p>Interesting...</p>
<p>I made tests as you asked.</p>
<p>I checked 2 other users - the same issue. </p>
<p>Then I created new one, assigned a license and he can stor history successfully.</p>
<p>The only difference betwenn old and new users are that old users have been migrated from federated AD domain. And new one was created in domain, synced also in O365 and got license. Can it be the reason?

<p>Hi NYA,</p>
<p>Thanks for your efforts.</p>
<p>Based on your description, the issue seems to be related to federated users. Given the situation, could you please provide the following information for further troubleshooting?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Did you create any Skype for Business hybrid environment? Can you provide more detailed information about your current environment?<br />
2.&nbsp;If you have any hybrid environment, did you have some special configurations?<br />
3.&nbsp;Please create two new fresh federated users and try them to see whether the issue persists. We need to identity if any old federated accounts have problems or the issue is related to federated AD domain.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>

<p>Hi Erick,</p>
<p>We have never created hybrid environment. We used step-by-step migration Exchange 2007 to O365, but we don't use skype\lync at all. However, I see some attributes in AD like sip:*** Email address is removed for privacy *** with some users and it means that Lync (mostly Office Communicator)
 supposed to be started before I began working in my company. Just maybe...</p>
<p>I created users like *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and it works fine.</p>
<p>I will repeat test with one new user and let you know.</p>

<p>Hi NYA,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I understand that you created users like *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and it works fine. The issue seems to only affect old users. To further narrow down the issue, I’d like to confirm some information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Which migration did you use? <br />
2.&nbsp;Did you get any error message when migrating before?<br />
3.&nbsp;About “The only difference between old and new users are that old users have been migrated from federated AD domain. And new one was created in domain, synced also in O365 and got license. Can it be the reason?”, which tool (Dirsync, AADSync, or AADconnect)
 do you use to sync users from AD to cloud?<br />
4.&nbsp;Do you have SSO (ADFS)?<br />
5.&nbsp;Besides new AD users, you can directly create a cloud use and test it to see whether the issue will occur again.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>

 plays DVD without issues, it just crashes when I try accessing content on my hard drives.

            found the solution - on a dell forum no less. the solution to the problem involved turning on WMM for all three radios on the router. this is an odd solution, since with my old laptop and some of my other wifi N devices having this setting on actually
 slows things down. send/receive is now 585 mbps for both 5Ghz radios and 144.4 on the 2.4ghz radio. the 2ghz radio is only connecting at wireless n for some reason, but the two 5ghz radios are now connecting using wireless AC.

    <title>Red Dead Redemption&#58; Undead Nightmare Collection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pwn3rg0d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Red Dead Redemption&#58; Undead Nightmare Collection</h2>
                    
<p>Hi ! I recently purchased Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare Collection when it was on sale for 1000 MS points. Well at first i thought that i couldn't play it without the original RDR disc, so i checked it from internet. In this Part of a RDR Wiki: &nbsp;&nbsp;
 http://reddead.wikia.com/wiki/Undead_Nightmare#Undead_Nightmare_Collection&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It clearly says that i don't need the original RDR disc to play the UN-collection.. Well i then went and bought it, after i had downdoaded it i tried to play it just to notice a
 information box telling me to play the game i downloaded this for. So can i ask you guys working on Microsoft, are you trying to fool your customers or what ? I'd really like my money back or get this thing worked out some other way.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Pwn3rg0d</p>

<p><em>I just did a quick search and every answer I found said the same thing.<br />
<br />
1, If you download undead nightmare off LIVE marketplace then you need RDR to access it.<br />
2, If you buy the hard copy of undead nightmare from a store you do not need the original game.<br />
<br />
I do not know how accurate this is but like I say all the results say the same, so its a safe bet its correct.
<br />
You will need to purchase RDR to play.</em></p>

<p>GreyPilgrim has gotten it exactly right. If you buy Undead Nightmare Collection from the marketplace you need the original game in order to play it. Buy the Collection on disc and you will not need the original.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buying it on discs makes a lot of sense if you do not have any of the other DLC. The disc based version of Undead Nightmare not only has the excellent campaign but all the multiplayer DLC as well.</p>

<p>Tried several times to update; always get this status code: 4099-0000-3080-0506-8B05-0018</p>
<p>This code doesn't show up when I search for it on xbox support.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried restart, clearing memory, loading from USB (which didn't work either), same error code shows up.&nbsp; Any help?&nbsp; I've seen a lot of problems stemming from the August update...please
 don't tell me this is Microsoft's attempt to get me to buy a Xbox One.</p>
<p>If this is any relevance: I was getting weird errors about corrupted data files from Skyrim shortly before this started happening...</p>

<p>Hi, if you're getting corrupted data errors that would seem to indicate an issue with the storage device. I would start off by checking through the entire contents of your storage device for any files that show as corrupted or have a ! in yellow, any you
 find should be deleted.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Next try this, on the console go to settings/ system/ storage, highlight your storage device and press the following buttons in sequence on the controller LB RB X LB RB X select yes on the next screen, the console will restart and attempt to update again.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Here are the official suggestions for this error code.</p>
<p>-</p>
Problem
<div>
<p>You see the following error message when you’re downloading an update to your Xbox 360 console:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>System Update Failed</b> </li><li><b>Can’t update your console. Please visit www.xbox.com/support</b> </li></ul>
<p>The message is accompanied by error code <b><i>xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-8B05-0018</i></b><i>.</i></p>
<p><b>Note</b> The “x” digits vary.</p>
<div>
Solutions
<div>
<p>Try the following solutions to resolve the problem.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Solution 1: Try installing the update again.</b> Here’s how:<b> </b></li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Restart your console. </li><li>Press the <b>Xbox Guide button</b> on your controller (the large center “<b>X</b>” button).
</li><li>Go to <b>Settings</b> and select <b>System Settings</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Network Settings</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Wired Network</b> or your wireless network name (if you’re prompted to do so).
</li><li>Select <b>Test Xbox Live Connection</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Yes</b> if you’re prompted to update your console software. </li></ol>
</ul>
<p>If the problem is not resolved, try the next solution.</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Solution 2: Make sure you have enough storage space. </b>The latest console software update requires at least 190 megabytes (MB) of storage space (or 256 MB if you live in Japan). If you don't have enough free space, you need to move or delete some items.

<p>Hi there! &nbsp;I just posted this very same issue today! &nbsp;I have run through the entire trouble shooting guide and nothing has worked. &nbsp;Even trying to download the update to an USB and a disc. &nbsp;Anyways, I will probably send it in for repair as the unit is still
 under warranty. &nbsp;Glad I found your post....misery loves company. :)</p>

<p>There is another option that I have seen work, it does involve formatting the storage device though. That would mean losing your game saves unless you can copy/move them to cloud or a USB flash drive.</p>

<p>if you can still get the console to the dashboard go to settings/ system/ storage, highlight your storage device and press Y, the format option will become available. Select that and format the storage device. You may need the console serial number to do
 this, that can be found on a sticker at the rear of the console.</p>
