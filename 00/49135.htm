<h2>            How to remove a ghost app stuck in Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently noticed a ghost app stuck in Start Menu with the name 'ms-resource:AppName\Text'. I want to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afe71c7b-a8f4-470e-b000-79613fb7307a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afe71c7b-a8f4-470e-b000-79613fb7307a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I right-clicked on the app to bring up the app setting page which looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/678df50a-8257-43a0-8cd7-c9414170ba28?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/678df50a-8257-43a0-8cd7-c9414170ba28?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried repairing and uninstalling the app but this did no work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I ran PowerShell as admin and typed in the following command:</p>
<p>Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.Windows.HolographicFirstRun | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it failed to remove the app and advised me to see the event log. I then typed in the following command:</p>
<p>Get-AppPackageLog -ActivityID 307f1a06-7727-0006-4735-7f302777d401</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the screenshot of the PowerShell after running the above commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0aab3d8c-0baf-4df1-a703-f3555a8f12ae?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0aab3d8c-0baf-4df1-a703-f3555a8f12ae?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f96ee53-06e4-42fc-9f0d-26b09a737a0c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6f96ee53-06e4-42fc-9f0d-26b09a737a0c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I typed the following path in the File Explorer.</p>
<p>C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.HolographicFirstRun_cw5n1h2txyewy</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the path did not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I have a Lenovo laptop and use Windows 10 Version 1809.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all your steps but unfortunately, none of them solved my problem. I created a new user and signed in. That ghost app did not appear in Start Menu.</p>

<h2>            Microphone and Speakers not working</h2>
                    So last night while I was videochatting with my girlfriend over facebook my stream got really laggy. So I very stupidly opened task manager and ended a random process that I saw. But this morning&nbsp; when I tried calling it was as if it couldnt find the builtin
 mic or speaker. I think it may be because of that. as far as I could tell when I checked the 'Devices' tab under settings everything was still there and looked like it was on. I'm not very technology savvy so if someone could help me that be great.

<p>Hi Austen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following up on the status of you issue. Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incompatible audio device drivers are known to operate against the method that Windows follows. However, if you haven't performed any troubleshooting step yet, we suggest that you use the automated troubleshooter first to test the
 computer for sound problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter isn't designed to fix every problem but it is a useful tool to try first, as it can often save you time and effort. Run the troubleshooter first and then try to play an audio file. You may refer to the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong> and type <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search bar and click on <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>.</li><li>Follow the steps from the wizard to run the troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the troubleshooter can't identify the problem, try to go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt;
<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> &gt; <strong>Sound </strong>&gt; <strong>Playback</strong>, and then choose the default device and go to
<strong>Properties </strong>&gt; <strong>Levels</strong>. You should find <strong>Recording
</strong>or <strong>Microphone</strong>. Make sure that it's not muted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error ID 36887 can be caused by a corrupted download or an incomplete installation. For us to identify the root cause, we suggest to do a scan and fix by running an SFC scan. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start </strong>button.</li><li>Type in <strong>cmd </strong>on the search bar.</li><li>Press and hold <strong>CTRL+Shift</strong> key on your keyboard, then hit <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>A dialog box will appear, click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>On the pop-up window, type in <strong>sfc /scannow</strong>. ( Take note of the space after the letter "c" and before "/" symbol. )</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the on-screen commands and wait for the scan to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you encounter any challenges along the process.</p>

            It really doesn't matter what the Product Part Numbers are.&nbsp; What is important is from whom you purchase the product from.&nbsp; Software counterfeiters/pitates are cleaver when it comes to duplicating packaging materials.&nbsp; Purchase your software from a trusted,

                    <p>Some months ago my PC, which was running just fine on Win7, had a motherboard failure and came back from the manufacturers loaded with Win 10. I have three DSLR cameras, one of which Win10 cannot see! It gives an audio signal when it detects the camera linking
 and de-linking via USB but does not show it as present. The camera reports "initialising USB connection", then "disconnected".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general I am not a fan of Win10. Even less so now!</p>

<h2>            Empty Device List in the Device Manager in Windows 7 Ultimate x64</h2>
                    
<p>I run the full 64 bit version of Windows 7 Ultimate. I noticed some time ago that the list of devices in the Device&nbsp;Manager window&nbsp;had totally&nbsp;gone. I&nbsp;googled some troubleshooting tips including correcting the&nbsp;Windows Registry settings with no luck. I only
 have&nbsp;System Restore points saved from the time I found this problem onwards, so they are no use. Please anyone&nbsp;post troubleshooting&nbsp;to reveal the list of devices in&nbsp;the Device Manager when the Registry settings are already correct.</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problem with Seagate 1TB External HD, was working 1 day ago, now it&#39;s not.</h2>
                    <p>This Hard drive was working fine yesterday, but it's not today? &nbsp;I goto device manager and it comes up unspecified expansion, i click on properties and troubleshoot I get this message:-&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware because a previous instance of the device driver is still in memory. (Code 38)<br />
<br />
The driver could not be loaded because a previous version of the driver is still in memory</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i guess my question is, how do i remove this previous version so i can reinstall it? &nbsp; I've tried the Update Driver, it says it's upto date. &nbsp;I've tried the Uninstall all it does is remove the icon from the device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also downloaded the Sea Tools for windows, but when it does its scan it only picks up the laptops internal HD</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Seagate HD works on my other laptop with no problems whatsoever. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you in advance for any or all help :D</p>

<h2>            I have true duplicates of my &#34;C&#58;Users&#34; &#38; &#34;C&#58;Documents and Settings&#34; folders.  Any suggestions on what to safely delete without getting too technical&#63;&#63; Dave.</h2>
                    Hi. &nbsp;Here's the story.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought "Documents and Settings" was a virtual folder, but two utility tools and general observation indicate it's an active copy of the Users folder. &nbsp;I change one, and the other changes too.&nbsp;The two folders are identical, with the same permissions.
 ...Sharing is now turned off on both.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Computer works fine still, but I can't trim much more data... and don't know which copies to trash. My outlook.pst file alone takes up 10gig in each folder. However, &nbsp;I'm finally synching well with an iPhone after my Nexus broke, so want to be careful
 before deleting stuff whimsically or through too detailed a protocol.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To reiterate, my problem is that &nbsp; &nbsp;folder &nbsp;"C:Users\" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "C:Documents and Settings\" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 60Gig (each)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm on Win 7, 64bit Ult. Home Computer, only used by me.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any advice on how to safely free up duplicate files would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp; If I can get rid of &nbsp;the whole Doc and Settngs folder, even better.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks a lot in advance. &nbsp; Dave.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>

            You are not dealing with two folders but with two views of the same folder. It's called a "Junction Point" and it is like having two windows that go onto the same court yard. This also means that there is no duplication of files. You can confirm this by
 checking the amount of free space before and after deleting a 10 MByte file. The file will disappear from both folders yet the amount of free space increases by 10, not by 20 MBytes.<br />
<br />
In other words, leave it alone.<br />

<h2>            How to Disable Annoying Taskbar Popup Previews</h2>
                    <p>** This is for WINDOWS 8.1, not 7. **</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched and searched, and I can't find a way to disable those annoying popups when my mouse goes over the applications in the taskbar. I don't want these to appear. They block my work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried turning off taskbar animations in Control Panel. Doesn't work.</p>
<p>I have tried a reg editor. Didn't work.</p>
<p>I have tried editing the reg myself. Didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we get this as a functionality please? All I need is a CHOICE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or ideas or feedback would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I have looked at all of those links. I downloaded that reg thingy and did that too. I have even checked inside my registry to see if the value was really set to "off".&nbsp;</p>

                    Video won't show in my video library in WMP and won't stream to my TV or tablet because Windows Media Player shows it as "Other" media type instead of Videos. I ran the Fix-It and it will fix everything except the library corruption it seems to detect
 but refuses to fix.&nbsp;
<div>This has occurred out of the blue for the last several DVD's I've copied. These are perfectly legal copies of DVDs I own for my own personal use - copied to my hard drive for streaming to my TV and tablet and eventually to set up a media server in my home.

<p>Hi Roxan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the best thing about the Windows operating system is that it lets you customize some of its features depending on what you prefer. Microsoft always offers a decent range of personalization capabilities. If you're talking about the lock screen of your
 device, you may check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17185/windows-10-lock-screen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on how to personalize it.</p>
<p>

            The pictures I want and really like are the different each day ones when I wake up my computer and then log in after I look at that day's picture. &nbsp;I believe it disappeared when the last batch of updates loaded on. &nbsp;I am done thinking about it..... maybe
 someday that setting will come back. &nbsp;Thanks for your note however.

<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;No drive was found with an operating system&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 reset failed- Original Title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I used the built in reset function after my PC had a couple of performance issues and it did the first restart and started to count up in %.</p>
<p>It reached 66% and then restarted again and when it rebooted it came to a screen telling me no drive was found with an operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted support and have been charged £100 for a new product key &nbsp;- Can this issues be fixed so that it doesn't just delete the OS and leave you high and dry having to spend on yet another product key?</p>

<p>The BIOS was detecting the hard drive perfectly however windows' restore/reset function deleted the operating system so there was no operating system to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke to support and they charged me £100 for a product key to reinstall windows with since I had upgraded from 7. I installed that onto my SSD (not the previous OS drive) and then launched windows once installed - I hooked up the previous drive to find
 no data on it. Not even a trace of the OS being there previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore I have no reason to contact anyone other than Microsoft as no hardware has issues only windows had one.</p>
<p>The HDD works pefectly fine and has no damaged sectors and my BIOS settings were set properly and worked fine for a good year and a half before the windows 10 update where I checked through them and it worked fine until windows told me it had to "repair"
 itself and recommended a reset to default windows settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have anymore solutions as to why this has happened feel free to reply and not try to blame hardware on an issue cause your software.</p>

            <p>I already went through a long winded process with your support team in a chat after this happened and they came to the conclusion with me that the only possible way to fix it was to buy a new product key and reinstall from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know for a fact that the issue was caused by windows trying to repair/reset my pc after it thought there was an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After repurchasing another key and reinstalling to a new drive from before I hooked up the old HDD that Windows was previously on to find it had removed itself completely from the drive leaving a few empty folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just seems stupid that I had to pay £100 for a new product key all because Windows destroyed itself while running it's own repair tool to supposedly "FIX" my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I stated in my previous reply to this because I use the PC everyday it had to be solved quickly and so I couldn't really wait around a week for you guys to ask me to do stuff on a PC that windows had managed to wipe the HDD of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd just like to know why and how Windows can remove itself from my drive and the only solution your support team comes up with is to charge me £100 again for another key for software I already owned.</p>

<h2>            Instant On issues&#58;  Cannot disable, nor does Xbox wake up with voice command when enabled</h2>
                    
<p>So ever since getting my XO, I've had issues with the Instant On functionality.&nbsp; Only once in perhaps 10-20 tries has my XO turned in with the "Xbox ON" command.&nbsp; Kinect voice commands work very well in other areas so I know it's not an issue of calibration/noise.</p>
<p>At any rate, the second issue comes from the fact that I now want to disable Instant On and put the XO into Energy Savings mode.&nbsp; This is to supposedly help with my NAT/uPNP issues.&nbsp; I have unchecked the use of Instant On in the Power settings, but when
 I turn off the Xbox, the PSU stays on with a white light, signifying it's getting full power.&nbsp; Per the article I read this only happens when Instant On is enabled.&nbsp; Energy Savings mode is supposed to have an amber/yellow light on the PSU.</p>
<p>Instant on has proven to still be enabled by the fact that when I turn on the Xbox again, it's near instantaneous and everything is where I left it (e.g. a specific app minimized and in session).</p>

<p>Is the Instant On functionality bugged like so many other things?</p>

<p>Update: &nbsp;I realized I still had one of the instant on options checked (download updates) so I disabled that but now I have a weird new issue.</p>
<p>After disabling, I tried to power down the XO and it proceeded through its motions, but when the power light was supposed to go out, it just dimmed slightly. &nbsp;Both the XO and Kinect stayed on. &nbsp;As it sits in this state, it seems to be stuck in some sort
 of cycle.</p>
<p>The power light will eventually light up brightly, but the Kinect lights will completely go dark. &nbsp;Then the Kinect lights will come back on, but the XO power light will dim again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hitting the power button to try and turn it off will result in sound acknowledgement of the button press, but nothing changes with regards to its current power state. &nbsp;It just stays in this cycle until I unplug the PSU entirely.</p>
<p>Either my Xbox is broken or there are some bugs in this system with regards to power.</p>

<p>Holding the Xbox button for 5-7 secs will just restart console and not turn off.</p>
<p>I have same problem. Using the power saving mode, but I am not able to turn it off as ussual by holding Home button on controller and tgen Console off. It just freezes (kinect turns off), but console and controller still on.</p>

<p>I think it's rather software than hardware problem.</p>
<p>It sometimes turn off with no problem, but sometimes dont. Remind me of my laptop when some stucked process running in the background prevents it from turning off or restarting.</p>
<p>I chat with Xbox support, unplugging the cables and putting them back has solved it for now. Let see tommorrow..</p>

<p>Something is definitely wrong so I guess I'll have to contact them. &nbsp;I have all instant on functionality disabled but when I turn off the console the power brick remains on with a white light. &nbsp;The only time I can ever get it to go amber is to unplug the
 console completely, then plug it back in. &nbsp;But as soon as I turn it back on and then off, back to white.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask a question on this.<br />
<br />
Currently I get the same error:<br />
Invoke-CsUcsRollback : Failed to roll back the user from ucs mode as the contact list export from Exchange failed. Autodiscover failed with exception: StoreWebException: code=ErrorEwsAutodiscover, reason=GetUserSettings failed, smtpAddress= ... , Autodiscover.<br />
The error does not occur with all colleagues - only occasionally.<br />
</p>
<p>The environment is completely on-prem.<br />
I try to roll colleagues back to the SfB server via Invoke-CsUcsRollback.<br />
Are there dependencies here, e.g. with Remote Call Control?<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<p>Hello JIN,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting here.</span><span> As the issue in your side may have a different cause with the original one, so it is split in a new thread.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As per my knowledge, if you decide to move the contacts back to Skype for Business server or out of the unified contact store then you need to do two things. First,
</span><span>you must </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/skype/set-csuserservicespolicy?view=skype-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">assign the user a new user services policy
</span></span></a><span>which</span><span> prohibits the use of the unified contact store. Second, you must use the Invoke-CsUcsRollback cmdlet to "manually" migrate the contacts from the unified contact store back to Skype for Business
 Server.</span><span>&nbsp;So, please confirm if you have set a new services policy for the users firstly.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            You do not have permission to view or edit this object&#39;s permission settings.</h2>
                    <p>I installed the minGW in g: drive(other than c: drive ) and then uninstalled it. Even then some files left undeleted. Then I tried to delete it manually and I was not able to delete that. It said that I should have administrator permission to do this, however
 I(current user) is the administrator here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I tried to change the permissions, but got another problem. It said that I don't have permission to view or edit this file. Also it said "Unable to display current owner". When I tried to change that it again showed me the same problem.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Getting errors when you access or work with files and folders in Windows normally occurs if the folder's ownership has been changed. In order to assist you better could you please confirm a few things like:<br />
<br />
• Were there any recent changes to your computer prior to the issue?<br />
• Have you installed any third party folder lock software on your computer?<br />
• How many administrator accounts do you have on this computer? • Did you try logging into different admin accounts and check if the same issue exists on all the accounts?<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />
        </p>

<p><span>Just one administrator account.</span></p>
<p>

<p>I believe that the question is about *how to delete the file* or *how to change its permissions*, not about any specific installer or application.&nbsp; This is a generic question.&nbsp; I see many reports of people report having this same issue, without resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point is that it is possible to set the permissions of a file such that the permissions subsequently cannot be read or edited, even by and account with administrator privileges, and even when those administrator privileges have been applied.&nbsp; The question
 is, if a file is in that state, how can we take back control of the file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some things that are not relevant to the problem:&nbsp; System corruption.&nbsp; User profile corruption.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because this happens on working systems, that otherwise don't have problems.&nbsp; It is specific files that are in this state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some things that will not fix the problem:&nbsp; The GUI for accessing permissions, i.e. the file Properties -&gt; Security tab, cannot do so in this case, so we cannot use that.&nbsp; The takeown /f &lt;file&gt; command gets "access denied".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this isn't a "what's wrong" question, it is a "how to" question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some things that may be relevant:&nbsp; This is under Windows 10.&nbsp; The Windows 10 upgrade hid the Administrator account, but we can enable it again if needed.&nbsp; We may have Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; That doesn't have all the administrative tools that other versions
 have.&nbsp; Windows 10 Home may not grant even a user with administrator privileges all access to files.&nbsp; I'm sure we can all use the command line.&nbsp; If we need to log in as the Administrator account and run icacls, I'm sure we would all be happy to do so.&nbsp; If it
 requires installing Windows Subsystem for Linux, and doing file operations from bash, I'm sure we'd be happy to do that too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...if anyone knows the magic incantation to change a file's permissions when an account with administrator privileges is not allowed to see or edit the permissions, we would very much like to hear the trick.&nbsp; Thanks!!</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><strong>If your computer offends you, KILL IT.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I <em>rebooted</em> ( actually, only needed to <em>log out and log back in </em>

<p>I am currently experiencing this issue. I rang Microsoft and was answered by a lady by the name Vivian. She can't or don't want to help me and hang up. How nice Microsoft support. How can you create an operating system and don't want to help user&nbsp;when they
 are blocked from accessing their own files. Are you expecting us to pay? There should be a simple solution not frustration. If we don't do what we're told or created the problems ourselves then we can accept that. But this is not us this is the OS (Windows
 10) that's causing the issue.</p>

<p>This is still a current problem as I have just encountered this error with all the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually as administrator I am able to take ownership of a folder which I don't have permissions on, and then I'm able to give myself permissions to delete the folder. However with one particular folder I'm given no option to take ownership.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the folder properties, I click the Security tab, click Advanced and it says "Unable to display current owner." Then I click Change.</p>
<p>Normally, I'm prompted to select a user or group.</p>
<p>In the case of the folder I want to delete, I instead see the error message in this question's title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in my case, the problem seems to be ephemeral, and the folder became mysteriously deleted after testing it, so I won't be of much help reproducing the issue.</p>

<p>Yes, the "keep my files" option should keep your Edge database as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you need/want some additional assurances, it'd be a good idea to copy some of the files to OneDrive.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do this, you'll need to copy two folders... the DataStore one as you've listed above, plus the RoamingState folder at:

    <title>Windows setup could not configure windows to run on this hardware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cybot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows setup could not configure windows to run on this hardware message during repair install</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to do a repair install of Windows 7 Ultimate which came pre-installed on the system, but every time I run windows setup, it gets 99% done, and is at the completing setup phase and suddenly pops up with a message saying windows can not be run
 on my current hardware. Setup then does a rollback of widows. This is absolutely ridiculous.... I am attempting to reinstall the SAME version of windows that was already on the system! Windows 7 Ultimate has been on the system since the day it rolled off the
 factory assembly line. I have triple checked to make sure the image I am using to do a repair install is x64. I have checked to make sure the image is not corrupted by doing a test install on a fresh drive in another PC. that time I got as far as asking for
 the license key before I stopped (because I didn't have a license for that PC).&nbsp; I did find a support article on the dell support site surprisingly enough (why not the M$ support site too?) that said to press shift+F10 and start c:\windows\system32\oobe\msoobe.exe
 manually. which I tried, but when I started msoobe manually, I got as far as the screen that askes me about default IE security settings, then the screen went almost black. anyone just seeing the screen might think that the backlight had just turned off. you
 could dimly see the dialogs on the scree showing, but not well enough to see what you could select. the only thing that was clearly visible, and proved that the backlight for the display was indeed still active, was the mouse cursor was still clear as day.
 I tried restarting my pc, hoping I could pick up where I left off, but windows setup did a rollback instead. I don't know if a recent update is causing this, or if it is caused by the damage to windows I am trying to repair. I have never ever, in all&nbsp; my years
 of using windows encountered this message.&nbsp; the fact that it appears to not have an error code associated with it makes it all that much harder to diagnose. what can I do?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you run this type of Repair Install before ?</p>
<p>I'm thinking that the only way to run that type of repair install is to use a different build... Like an upgrade, or possibly a Downgrade...</p>

<p>different build? isn't there only one build of windows 7? 7601 its not really possible to downgrade to anything since the laptop came with windows 7 ultimate preinstalled. the anytime upgrade features were either never present or were automatically disabled
 by Microsoft because I have that version of windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am only trying to do a normal repair install of windows. it's something I have done millions of time dating back to windows 3.0
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some checking, and despite my thinking to the contrary, My system does have a product license key SLIC table embedded in the bios. and according to the key, the only version of windows 7 it will activate, is Windows 7 UIltimate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have never run into this message before. EVER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the image of windows setup I am using is for windows 7 ultimate and is an official M$ copy, obtained froman M$ source.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp; found a copy of and ran the windows 7 upgrade advisor, an hardware wise, it says I am good to go.&nbsp; there should not be anything keeping me from doing a repair install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could probably&nbsp;get around this weird and probably misleading message, if I could solve the problem of the screen going almost black after I tell the MSOOBE portion of setup to automatically get my updates.I tried turning the screen brightness level to
 max, but it did not help the read ability of what was on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know.... maybe some one could clone an existing Win ultimate environment (complete with the latest updates) and try doing a repair install to see if the error occurs for them too? I almost feel like blaming M$ for this.... I would not put it past
 them to pull something like this and block repair installs of windows 7 in order to force a move to windows 10. I mean, look how they plastered windowsXP with nagware at the very end.....</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to use a different build would be to try the Original Ultimate before SP1... You do realize don't you that some of these cumulative updates do if fact change the build number... There are a lot more numbers after the 7601..</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win 8 ad 10 it is much easier to use a different build because there are ISO's available for them..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally what I remember seeing when trying to run Windows from within Windows of the same build, that there was a message that Windows was already installed and something like boot with the media message...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is most certainly possible that there is something going on with an Update... I have noticed some different behavior lately, but at the moment I can't recall exactly what...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will see if I can test your problem on my machine... I have a lot of backup images already... Don't know exactly when, but hopefully today...</p>

<p>as far as I know it is not possible to do a repair install of windows 7 SP1 using Windows 7 RTM images. the image I am trying to do&nbsp;repair install with just has SP1 and what ever other updates and hotfixes that M$ decided to include with the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to do setup with AND with out dynamic updates, and the results are the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have both Windows 8 Pro and Windows 10 pro licenses, but I am hesitant to do an upgrade to either of those right now. I would not want the issues I am having right now follow me over to the new version of windows. When performing an inplace upgrade
 to a new version of windows, I always prefer to have any issues resolved before making the upgrade, even if that means performing a repair install of the current OS version (in this case windows 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have an Windows Ultimate iso from 2014 that I got from the digital river servers before they got shutdown. I guess I could try that one instead of the one I am using now... but as far as I can tell, the contents of the two iso's are the same. the only
 diference being in the name of the iso file.</p>

<p>it is from a Microsoft server. I don't have the exact address though. Normally, you would go to the Microsoft media page and download the iso. but since in all their wisdom, M$ still doesn't allow us OEM customers to download the iso's, I had to use HeiDOC.net's
