<div>Osx is all working correctly, however when I try to load windows I get "operating system not found"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to follow this guide:http://blog.alexmorales.org/gparted-windows-8-boot-camp-partition-missing-operating-system/</div>

    <title>dpc watchdog error requiring reboot since win 10 anniversary update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ssurloff  say:</h3>
<h2>            dpc watchdog error requiring reboot since win 10 anniversary update</h2>
                    <p>Right after&nbsp;my win 10 computer was updated with the anniversary update, it began intermittently failing with a dpc watchdog error &nbsp;requiring the computer to be rebooted to regain operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft level 2 support personnel seem unable to identify the cause of the problem.&nbsp; Their attempts to resolve the issue have been unsuccessful.&nbsp; They've provided generic responses and performed such things as spyware removals but the problem continued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset&nbsp;the computer with an image prior to the update and that has eliminated the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to do this twice.&nbsp; The first time, the update reapplied and the problem recurred.&nbsp; I re-imaged again&nbsp;and disabled windows update.&nbsp; The problem has not recurred but now the computer is running with windows update disabled so I am concerned about its
 ability to remain current and protected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked Microsoft support to escalate my case so that the cause can be identified and resolved as opposed to "guessing" at what might be causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me resolve this issue as I don't think running with win update disabled is a proper way to continue running.&nbsp; The only option I see is returning to win 8.1 if I can even do that at this point.</p>

            thank you very much for your reply.&nbsp; I will follow your instructions, however, I believe I will have to reimage the machine again back to a version having the update installed already.&nbsp; As soon as the error recurs, I will follow your instructions.&nbsp; fyi,
 one of the things I read mentioned to insure the minidump would be taken so I set that option to create a dump.&nbsp; When the error occurred previously, no dump was created.&nbsp; there is no&nbsp;minidump folder.&nbsp; hopefully, your process will provide an indication of what
 is causing the error so it can be resolved.&nbsp; Level 2 Microsoft support did look at event logs right after the last occurrence but, apparently, did not find anything that would correct the error from occurring.&nbsp; thanks again for&nbsp; your help.&nbsp; I will post as
 soon as the error recurs.

Mr. Gerry Cornell was kind enough to provide some debugging guidance on how to identify what is causing the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
The issue definitely appears to be the result of installing the anniversary update. the reason I say this is that I had backed off via an image taken before that update was applies.&nbsp; running with software before anniversary update did not have the problem of
 having to reboot due to the random occurrence of the dpc watchdog vlolation error that began to show after the anniversary update had been applied.&nbsp; To avoid further issues, I had to turn off windows update so the anniversary update did not reinstall.(( I
 had already run into that and had to reimage the computer again because it started to occur again.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
I had to wait to see if the problem went away while running without the update.&nbsp; The problem did not recur until today.&nbsp; It recurred today because the update was reinstalled on 10/27.&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned win update back on 10/24.&nbsp; The anniversary update was finally
 reinstalled on 10/27. Today, around 2pm, the DPC Watchdog Violation again appeared requiring me to reboot the computer.</p>
<p>the screen simply statues "the computer ran into a problem and needs to restart" due to a DPC Watchdog Violation.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Now that the issue recurred, I will now go through the steps Mr. Cornell suggested in the hope it will lead to identifying the real cause of the issue so I can do something to resolve it.&nbsp; Microsoft support looked at my computer during the previous occurrences
 but was unable to identify the cause, they just performed superficial, generic actions in the hope it would go away.&nbsp; It has not gone away.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

I'm hoping someone can help get this fixed. </p>

            <p>I have received no responses to help fix this issue.&nbsp; There does not appear to be any Microsoft support follow up, neither have I received any response from Mr. C. the one person that provide some suggestion on data to capture and post&nbsp;(which I did).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In pursuing my options, I contacted Microsoft again to find out if I have the option to just go back to win 8.1 since my computer ran fine on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what i'm left with:</p>
<p>continue to have the error occur on a daily basis (it seems to take place around lunch time; 11am-1pm every day) and have to reboot every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>again restore back to win 10 1511 image before 1607 update was applied and run with windows update turned off.&nbsp; this seems like a security exposure to me as I would then be frozen at the 1511 version of win 10 henceforth. ( I'm confused about what updates
 I would or would not be able to get at this point.&nbsp; I was told something can be done to stop 1607 from applying on my computer but am confused about the state that would leave me in as time went on.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>do a clean install of win 8.1 and have to and reinstall and reset everything on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is very disturbing and disappointing that my computer was prompted to install win 10, it installed and ran up until the 1607 update, then be told I have to run a crippled version of win 10 or backoff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping that by providing this info some fix can be identified as it appears to be recurring around the same time daily.&nbsp; I checked scheduled tasks to see if something obvious runs around that time but could not identify anything and&nbsp;can't understand
 all the various windows activities that show up as scheduled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopeing someone can help with this as I'm told this error is not just happening to me.</p>

            For two months, since the win 10 anniversary update was installed, my PC hasn't stayed up more than 2 1/2 days before crashing with the same DPC_WATCHDOG_RESET. I&nbsp;typically sleep it at night. I just updated the video driver to NVidia's 10-27 update for
 Win 10. That did not help. I'd sure like to know if Microsoft is working on this so I can establish a procedure more sane than just having dozens of open windows disappear with BSOD.

            <p>The splash screed pops up with an error message that you need to use the disk ?</p>
<p>This is what happens to me if I remove my noCD fix and try to run the game from the original
<em>speed.exe </em></p>
<p>with the disk in the CD/DVD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- This problem may or may not be brought to you courtesy of MS via Windows update<em> KB3086255.
</em></p>
<p>This is MS's DRM Blocking security 'update' that&nbsp; prevents <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
disk based</span> games that use SafeDisk from launching.</p>
<p>I have more details about DRM Blocking in my post at&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
--this thread--</a></p>
<p>- This game is unusual for SafeDisk DRM games in that there does not seem to be a<em> secdrv.sys</em> file on the games disk.
</p>
<p>This is the file that gets targeted by MS, so it may be something other than the SafeDisk DRM ?</p>
<p>Whatever that may be, using a noCD fix/hack works.</p>

</p><p>- Note that you should also patch the game to version 1.3 ( I prefer downloading patches from the</p>

<h2>            Windows&#39; Boot loader installed itself on my old hard drive.</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I had put together my new machine and installed Windows 10 via USB, in UEFI. I have 2 hard drives, my new one which'll be the main one and another one from my old computer plugged in, to transfer files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently the boot loader had installed itself on the old computers hard drive, as it had Windows 7 on it, though 10 is on the new one. I need to get it to where it can boot on the new hard drive itself. How can I do that?</p>

            Hi  NTekNiklaus
<br />
<br />Sorry, you will need to re-install Windows 10 on that drive
<br />
<br />It is not well documented, but if you have more than one drive connected when installing Windows 10, the installation routine can put the page file and/or the boot configuration files on the wrong drive
<br />
<br />The only way to resolve this, is to disconnect that second drive and re-install Windows 10 on the system drive . ..

<p>Thank you for your help but I have just fixed the problem by creating a 100MB partition called EFI on the new drive via DISKPART and then using BCDBOOT C:\WINDOWS to put the boot files in, no reinstall needed.</p>
<p>Besides, when I tried reinstalling it, something was preventing it from going past the part where you select the disk you want to install it on.</p>

<p>It always helps in situation like yours, to provide a Disk Management picture.&nbsp; From it, we can see where and what types of installs you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had you done a normal UEFI install with Secure Boot enabled, the System EFI partition would have been placed on the drive you selected, unless you already had a EFI partition on a different drive.&nbsp; To reinstall on a drive you would have needed to delete
 all critical partitions and used that unallocated space to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind, using bcdboot to place the boot files does not normally set up the recovery options for your new install.</p>

            Hi Doina, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />In the resulting Command window, run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />select volume E
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />remove letter=E
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC

                    <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">In windows 10 on my desktop: I clicked on my airplane mode button to turn it on. When I went to turn it off even though I click the button it didn't change
 anything. I restarted my computer to see if that would help, but after doing so it no longer gives me the option of turning off my airplane mode. On the task bar where the Internet option usually is it just shows an airplane instead. When I click on that it
 doesn't show any other options like it did before. I had to connect through ethernet to get my computer to connect. When I go to network settings I can't find the Wi-Fi option in there. And I don't see where to turn the airplane mode off in there anymore either.
 I dont have a wifi button on my keyboard which many have suggested.</span>

<h2>            Update and Bits service problems</h2>
                    <p>Recently got a new computer.&nbsp; It came with Windows 8.1 and I've recently upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; In both 8.1 and 10 I've had a problem with Windows Update Services.&nbsp; I had to do a computer reset of 8.1 in order to even download 10.&nbsp; My windows update is
 not working and at the moment BITS won't even start.&nbsp; It will see that I've got updates available but fails each time in downloading them.&nbsp; Right now the error I'm getting is Error 0x80246008.&nbsp; I believe (but cannot be 100%)&nbsp;windows update stopped working
 in both 8.1 and 10 was after I used the Norton uninstaller.&nbsp; I have run sfc /scannow and sometimes it comes back fine, and sometimes it says that there are files it found but could not repair.&nbsp; DISM has not been able to repair anything either.&nbsp; I've tried
 manually resetting my windows update components and I get several .dll errors.&nbsp; Here are the .dll errors I'm getting:&nbsp;

            <p>FWIW,</p>
<p>I run far and fast from anything using Norton code, especially its AV because its codebase was created in the earliest dark ages (parts might still be 16-bit and wrapped in 32-bit). If you uninstall any Norton product I've found it only removes the "new"
 Norton bits but because the original install either over-wrote or didn't preserve the original files, you're left with a broken machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you didn't say what your Norton uninstaller did (uninstall a Norton product? or uninstall a 3rd party product?), but hopefully a VSS (Volume Shadow Copy) or "Windows Restore Point" can get you back to before whatever was removed was installed. Of course
 that requires VSS to be turned on which is done only sometimes by the manufacturer who creates the factory Windows image on your machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Short of that...</p>
<p>Well, you can tinker with copying your files from another working Windows of the exact same version to your problem machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a Windows DVD, you can try running the repair option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If those fail I would guess you might have to do a factory re-install... and learn the lesson not to use a Norton uninstaller again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO and HTH</p>

            My computer came with Norton Antivirus and so I was using the uninstaller to remove the Norton that came with my computer.&nbsp; I have never liked Norton and therefore wanted something else.&nbsp; If I had to do a complete reinstall, how would I go about completely
 removing Norton from my computer?&nbsp; I haven't yet tried Revo Uninstaller, but everything else I've tried always leaves bits of Norton files around my computer.

            hey there! i am having the exact same problem. After updating to windows 10 i noticed my Norton was removed so i ran the removal tool. I have not been able to install any windows updates since then and am contemplating doing a windows 10 "refresh" to see
 if that fixes it / try re installing Norton to see if that fixes it!

<p>I've just had a message pop up to say I've been logged out as I signed in elsewhere. To my knowledge I have never logged in to my Xbox account on any other console and as i'm sitting in front of it I can't be anywhere else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've just updated via preview program to the newest version of the os which includes the dreaded Cortana but wondering if anyone else has seen this and if I should be worried about my account security?</p>

    <title>Game went on sale after purchasing at full price. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the leshy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game went on sale after purchasing at full price.</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought Forza Horizon 3, (exactly 1 week ago) and i saw it go on sale with gold 4 days after the purchase. I was wondering if there is a way to get a price change or a chargeback to the games current price. Ive done this with other games/companies such as&nbsp;League of Legends, so i was wondering if i could do it here. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Stuck at login, windows not responding</h2>
                    For no reason my windows 8 machine today now doesn't let me login anymore.<br />
<br />
The PC boots, get to the windows 8 login screen (the one with the green landscape, the tower, the clock)...<br />
<br />
That screen simply doesn't work anymore, I can't get the password login screen to show up, the mouse and keyboard seem dead.<br />
<br />
The keyboard is working cause I can get into the BIOS pre-boot and it's functioning.<br />
<br />
But I couldn't get into safe mode neither can I login to the machine anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The clock on the login screen is working so it's an indication that the machine did not "freeze".<br />
<br />
The symbol for network is also responsive, if I plug/unplug the network cable it properly updates the little icon.<br />
<br />
But the mouse and keyboard don't work at all so I can't login or do anything with the computer.

            I had this problem today. I solved it by forcing a shutdown. Not just pressing the Power button and letting windows do a shutdown, but holding it in for 10 seconds&nbsp;so windows can't hibernate the kernel (Essentially forcing a full reboot instead of the
 hybrid boot it normally does.)

            I did hundreds of shutdowns, wasted almost 8 hours trying to repair windows with everything I could find on the internet.<br />
<br />
Nothing worked.<br />
<br />
Solution ? As always, reinstall windows... And this time I'll make sure I stay away of those weird MS mouse/keyboard drivers that windows update installs every month and are good for nothing !

            i solved mine through force shutdown.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>if you have set your power button to <b>hibernate,&nbsp;</b>you might want to <b>
unplug</b> your pc from the socket while it is on. if you are using a laptop, remove the battery plug the charger, turn it on, unplug the charger then put back the battery.</div>
<div><br />
<div>although this method solved my problem, i recommend you to follow this instruction
<b>carefully</b>. I am not liable of any damage this method might cause.</div>

<h2>            Flash drive locks up on one computer. Works on all other computers</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a user who has a 2gb Ilogic flash drive. I have one computer (windows 7 professonial 32 bit) that the flash drive will not work in. When I plug the flash drive in the computer the drive autoplay will open the drive and I can see all the files. However,
 as soon as I click on a file the computer locks up. The computer stays locked up until flash drive is unplugged. You can not close the flashdrive from task manager to unlock computer. The files I am opening are small ms&nbsp;word files. The user states problem
 started when she went to save a MS Word file to drive. Here is a list of things&nbsp; I have tried to resolve this issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Tried multiple USB ports on problem pc. (Worked one time until the flash drive was ejected and then started having problems again)</p>
<p>2. Tried flash drive on other computers (same model) and it works with no problems on those computers.</p>
<p>3. Tried different flash drives on the computer with the problem and they work without problems.</p>
<p>4. I have formatted the flash drive (Fat32) and still will not work</p>
<p>5. Have ran windows updates.</p>
<p>6. Ran scan and fix utility on flash drive</p>
<p>7. Uninstalled the flash drive in device manager</p>
<p>8. Manually removed the driver located at C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\infcache.1 (Found in google search)</p>
<p>9. Drive shows up in disk management - Reassigned drive letter still same issue.</p>
<p>10. Ran system restore to previous day that flash drive worked on this computer. Same issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a feeling this has something to do with the driver of this particular flash drive. I am wondering even though I see the driver reinstalling if it is just using the bad driver again. If anyone has any ideas I would apprecaite it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Dependency Services or Group Failed to Start on Vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ldoyvey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dependency Services or Group Failed to Start on Vista</h2>
                    I have Window's Vista and a wireless internet connection in my house.&nbsp; The icon that shows if you are connected to the internet has a red x through in and it says " connection status unknown Dependency Services or Group Failed to Start "&nbsp; I am sometimes
 still connected to the internet when it says this, but it will disconnect while I am in the middle of something and I will need to re start the computer in order to get it back.&nbsp; I continue to have the message though.<br />
<br />
I have tried disabling the firewall.and it doesn't make a difference.&nbsp; Not sure if it helps, but I have Trendmicro Antivirus as well as webroot spy sweeper on the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought maybe it was the internet provider, but we switched companies and it didn't
 change anything.<br />
<br />
Please help.&nbsp; <br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Set ALL the Windows Services back to their defaults.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; Services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find at the top - right click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />

<br />
=================================<br />
<br />
After the above if needed re-install the drivers. If&nbsp;WiFi use the wired&nbsp;connection and if wired use the WiFi<br />
and if neither works download the drivers on another machine and transfer them on removable media.<br />
Don't&nbsp;forget to try&nbsp;tapping F8 as you boot and select Safe Mode with&nbsp;Networking.<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write
<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions. (The<br />
ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
<strong>Repeat above for network card (NIC)</strong> and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Vista loves<br />
updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests one just HIDE it as they<br />
are almost alway old and you can look for drivers manually as needed.<br />

    <title>Will registration key for XP Pro 32 bit work on XP Pro 64 bit&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexander1989_02  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will registration key for XP Pro 32 bit work on XP Pro 64 bit&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought the upgrade version of Win8 Pro and had installed XP Pro 32 bit. So the upgrade disc only let me upgrade to the 32 bit version of Win8. I've got both discs for the 32 bit and 64 bit version of XP Pro, full version editions, not OEM versions.
 The only key I've got (found) is the one that was installed on the 32 bit version. So in order to get the 64 bit version of Win8, will it work to install XP Pro 64 bit with key to the 32 bit and then upgrade to 64 bit Win Pro?
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>

To verify that your account is no longer a child account, we highly recommend that you get in touch with our Xbox Chat Support. They can definitely assist you with this matter.
