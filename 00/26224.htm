<h2>            Word 2010 &#34;print hidden text option&#34;</h2>
                    Each time I start word 2010 the print hidden text option is checked even though I unchecked the option before closing word previously.&nbsp; How do I fix the problem?

            Obviously the change is not being saved. I'm not sure where it is being saved to, so my first guess would be the registry, then normal.dotm.<br />
<br />
For the registry, close all of the Word sessions you have open, including Outlook. Start Word using "Run as Admin, make your change, close word, start word normally and see if the problem is gone. If it is gone, try rebooting to see if it continues to be gone.<br />
<br />
<b><span>Win7 &amp; Vista – in Start menu, select item then use &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;SHF&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; to start it in “Run As Admin” mode<br />
</span></b>
<p>
<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<br />
<br />
If that didn't work, then I suppose the setting is saved in your normal.dotm.&nbsp; So this time, start Word normally, then open NORMAL.DOTM for editing, make your change, close normal.dotm and save changes. close word. Restart word normally to see if the change
 was saved.<br />
<br />

<b><span>Changes to Default settings not being saved</span></b>
<p><b><u>Problem</u></b></p>
<p>Brand new PC.&nbsp; Windows 7.&nbsp; MS Office 2010 installed.&nbsp; Word 2010 will not maintain my default font of Times New Roman 12 even though I indicate it is to be saved as deault for all new documents.&nbsp; Same thing with the paragraph settings
 where I do <u><span>NOT</span></u> want the extra spaces between paragraphs that MS seems to think I should have.&nbsp; I click the box to indicate don't add space between paragraphs, click to save as my default and not saved.&nbsp; New documents have the factory
 set font and extra spaces.</p>
<p><b><u>Solution</u></b></p>
<p>Something seems to be preventing you from saving changes to the Normal template. That "something" is usually a poorly designed add-in, which you may want to disable. (For more on add-ins, see&nbsp;<a href="http://word.mvps.org/faqs/customization/CheckIfAddinsInstalled.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/faqs/customization/CheckIfAddinsInstalled.htm</a>.)</p>
<p>One of those bad add-ins appears to be the PDF printer driver that comes with HP computers. It installs an addin button to Office apps.</p>
<p>To work around the issue, you can modify the Normal template directly: In the Open dialog box (Ctrl+O), click Trusted Templates. Locate and open Normal.dotm. Make the desired changes, and then save and close the file.</p>

<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Set the default save doc type to .docx</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Close and open word to ensure settings are saved</p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Set the default font and font size</p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Change default save type back to .doc (word 03)</p>
<p>Next time you open word, all settings are properly saved</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>PowerPoint 2013 Presenter Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jathlu  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2013 Presenter Mode</h2>
                    <p>To preface, I'm an employee of a rental company, so our issues are usually client facing. Clients will require Win7 sometimes and Win10 other times; Office 2010, 2013, and 2016 get specifically requested. So this is, unfortunately, not something I can fix
 by simply upgrading to the newest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when we run a PPT in presenter mode, the primary screen being a laptop, the audience will see the slides, but the laptop doesn't show the presenter view.</p>
<p>The operator can still see the edit window of PowerPoint, though at the bottom of the screen in the task bar, you can see the three tabs that correspond to the edit window, the audience view, and the presenter view, but you can't select presenter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A fix we found is to select the "Show Desktop" button in the lower right. Click it again and then presenter view comes back. If you select in the window again, you'll be able to control the slideshow and proceed as normal. But this isn't acceptable, especially
 if we have to allow a client to operate the laptop themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A) What is going on? I've turned hybrid graphics on and off on the machine and the issue remains. I've changed the order of when I plug the HDMI and adapter into the machine and external display, and the issue remains. The only thing so far to fix it is
 the above clumsy workaround and sometimes a restart or reimage of the machine will return it to normal. Again, not really acceptable fixes for a live show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B) What can we do to permanently fix the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Our typical issues seem to be on HP ZBook 15 and HP ZBook G2 15, though I believe I've encountered it on an HP 850G1 as well. We're running Windows 7 and if I remember correctly, the only time we've had this issue is with Office 2013 or higher.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to compatibility reasons or an outdated display driver. To isolate the issue, we suggest that you update your graphic driver and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It's best to let Windows install device drivers automatically.</span> But if Windows can't find a driver for your device, you can look for a driver on the device manufacturer's website. Driver updates are often available in the support section of such
 sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some devices have drivers that you need to install yourself. If you download a driver that isn't self-installing, follow these steps. (You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Device Manager by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>
Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>System and Security</strong>, and then, under
<strong>System</strong>, clicking <strong>Device Manager</strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
</li><li>In the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.</li><li>Click the <strong>Driver </strong>tab, click <strong>Update Driver</strong>, and then follow the instructions.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</li></ol>

<p>Before going live, test to see if presenter view is visible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, it may be because it's been moved off-screen.&nbsp; In that case, you should be able to bring it back like so:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click the Presenter view tab on the task bar to activate the view</li><li>Press ALT + Spacebar, then press M, then ENTER</li><li>Use the arrow keys to move the window back onto the visible screen</li><li>Press ENTER to end the move.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If that's not it, can you tell whether the problem is more likely to occur (or only occurs) with specific version(s) of Office?</p>

    <title>Excel page size in relation to rows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel page size in relation to rows</h2>
                    <br />


<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p>I have an issue with Excel 2016: I have a spreadsheet which is meant to be printed as a report to a pdf. When i use it on an connected screen (res: 1920x1200), it fits 56 rows on to one page. But if i use the spreadsheet on the screen built in to
 my laptop (res: 1920x1080), it only fits 54 rows on a page!!! This means that I can not be sure of how many rows will be on each page, if printed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked before, but did not really get an answer that I could use. It may be that it is not the resolution itself that is the problem, but some other property of the screens I am using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to workaround this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>- Jeppe</p>

            Hi Jeppe80,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Try to fit the x page wide by y page tall in Page Setup.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Hi Vijay</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for the suggestion, I will try and write som VBA that fits the pages, before ExportAsFixedFormat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i think this is an issue that Microsoft shoul look into. Because if I set up a spreadsheet for printing on my computer, it will look different, dependant on which screen is connected. 3 examples:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Screen in laptop, res. 1920x1080: Will print <strong>54 </strong>rows (row height 14) per page</p>
<p>- Secondary monitor, res 1920x1200: will print <strong>56</strong> rows <span>
(row height 14) per page</span></p>
<span>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">- Secondary monitor, res 1920x1080: will print
<strong>56</strong> rows <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
(row height 14) per page</span></p>
<p>So if I make a template for printing, I can not deploy it to my organisation and be sure it can be printed/exported in the same format for different
 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will return with some feedback on you suggestion later...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

<p>Hey Hogleg95, Welcome to the Nokia Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry you are experiencing this problem, please first check with the developer of the application to see if it is compatible with symbian Belle, as many developers are still working on updates to adapt their applications to work on Belle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not the case and it is fully supported on symbian Belle, are you receiving any error messages whilst installing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps,</p>

This is the first time something like this has happened to me. I've synced earlier treos with multiple computers and an old Toshiba PDA with Windows CE with multiple computers. I'm thinking it has something to do with Windows Mobile and/or Vista.<br />

<p>David, you absolutely can sync your Treo 750 with two computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try deleting ALL partnerships on your device and ANY partnerships on your computers.&nbsp; Reboot the PCs and soft reset your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now establish a new partnership with one PC, sync then setup and sync the second PC.</p>

            <p>Hi Colin, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're unable to search for the emails that you have received from MSN,&nbsp;you can use the Sweep feature to erase all emails from certain senders. Please follow the steps I've provided below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Sign in to Outlook.com and go to you <strong>Inbox</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Look for&nbsp;one email&nbsp;that you have received from MSN&nbsp;and&nbsp;tick on box.</p>
<p>3. Click the <strong>Sweep</strong> tab on the Outlook.com's <strong>Menu bar</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Choose <strong>Delete all from...</strong></p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Delete all </strong>to delete messages from the sender. </p>
<p>There's also an option to&nbsp;not receive&nbsp;messages from the sender anymore. Just tick on&nbsp;<strong>Also block future messages</strong>&nbsp;and click Delete all, and then you're done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to post back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank&nbsp;you.&nbsp;</p>

            I'm having this problem too on my laptop. I tried to download the Netflix app and saw it was pending, so I went to look at the other things that were being downloaded and they were MSN Health &amp; Fitness app, Music, and another one that's blank. I think
 like 6 more were downloading with it, but the ones I listed all say "Try Again" and have error codes. I'm also on the build 10130.

            <p>Update&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;***FIXED*****<br />
<br />
I tried several things to fix this problem.</p>
<p>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"<br />
<br />
dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup<br />
<br />
WSReset.exe<br />
<br />
none of these worked<br />
<br />
I then noticed that the error code changed from to 0x80242021 &nbsp;to 0x8007000B when there was a usb drive inserted.<br />
At one time I had set this as the default location to install apps. I changed the default app install location back to the usb drive &amp; &nbsp;rebooted tried again it failed. I switched the default app location back to C drive and rebooted. I unfortunately rebooted
 my router at the same so when the store worked properly on boot I can't tell now which event caused it to work.<br />
<br />
The router was working properly for surfing, streaming and installing android apps but the 0x8007000B error has been tied to proxy/firewall errors in other posts. &nbsp;At least one time before my router has been seemingly working fine but rebooting seemed to have
 fixed a windows store error. If this is the case it is odd that i can make it through the process of acquiring the license before erroring out.</p>

<p>i've got the same error code on my phone (build 10536). This error happens only, if i try to install apps, which are only for the&nbsp;phone storage. I can change in settings the default installation-path, but there is no different, if i set it to phone storage
 or sd-card. Now i put out my SD-Card and the error is comming. What do i have to do?</p>

<h2>            How does ms office work for students&#63;</h2>
                    <p>hi</p>
<p>I just signed up for the free ms office using my school email but it doesn't allow me to download and work on my laptop.&nbsp; I have to submit assignments to a school website - doesn't look like I can do that with this version.&nbsp; Do i need to buy my license ie:
 its not free? Very confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please advise what is the best version for me to buy ie: conventional download vs "free" version which sees to be very limiting.</p>
<p>thx</p>
<p>Jack</p>

<p>To be honest, i think it would be best for you to ask your school what you need or how to submit your work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Plus, you say "I signed up for free MS office, but it doesn't allow me to download and work on my laptop"... What do you mean "it doesn't allow you"?? do you get an error, is it when trying to login, save your work, edit files, etc.... I mean, there are
 so many answers we need to have, but your the only one that can provide them. If you can give us more details as to what your issue is, we can try to help you. You do not say what version you have. To be honest, I have never heard of a "Free" version of Office.
 Can you explain more on what version you have. You might have "Office 2016 professional" or "Office 2016 standard" and it was provided to you at no cost, but it cost someone something. So,if you can, open up one or your apps and let us know what build you
 have. What version number and stuff like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Office products, so this might help you</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://products.office.com/en-us/professional</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you can, please try to provide some more details so we can give you a better answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

</p><p>Are you sure that you have not obtained the free version of Microsoft Office Apps?&nbsp; You have posted under Office 2016.&nbsp; The free version of Office for students is Office 365.&nbsp; You download/install it on your computer.&nbsp; See

<h3> j scott yaruss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 crashes with Canon 8350 printer</h2>
                    Hi&nbsp; I posted a question about this a bit over a week ago, but i think i accidentally marked the thread as closed when i went to reply to one of the emails. So, I'm posting again in the hopes of getting some help.<br />
<br />
Here's the original thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-word/canon-8350-printer-crashes-with-office-2013/5df6aff8-4c17-4481-8f40-31545d0cc2b0">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-word/canon-8350-printer-crashes-with-office-2013/5df6aff8-4c17-4481-8f40-31545d0cc2b0</a>
<br />
<br />
Here's the situation: My Canon 8350 printer prints just fine with all programs except Office 2013. When I print from excel, word, etc., then the program crashes immediately.<br />
<br />
This indicates that I've tried all of the standard things that have been recommended: changing printer driver, uninstalling and installing the driver, printing to a PDF and printing from there, creating a new user account, etc...<br />
<br />
I am using Win8 on a Lenovo 220x. System works just fine otherwise... Canon lists this printer as being Win8 compatible.<br />
<br />
Help?<br />
Thank you,<br />
Scott<br />
<br />

            <p>Jiri Adamek provided the answer in another thread and I thought I'd share it here for others to see! I followed the instructions and it solved the problem. SO, it seems that the driver was at fault, and I apologize to Doug for my intransigence. I'm happy
 to have the problem solved!</p>

            If you can print to the Adobe PDF printer or another PDF Printer such as PrimoPDF, then that definitely points to the issue being with the Canon printer driver.

    <title>How can I get messages to a contact group that has one bad address to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamilamadingdong  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get messages to a contact group that has one bad address to send to all of the good addresses&#63;</h2>
                    I have multiple contact groups set up in Outlook 2011. &nbsp;Occasionally, a message I send to one of these contact groups will get hung up in my Outbox. &nbsp;The only thing I've been able to figure out is that one of the email addresses in the particular contact
 group is not longer being used. &nbsp;But I'd really like to have Outlook deliver the message to all of the good addresses in the contact group and give me an error message regarding the bad address. &nbsp;But that doesn't happen...the message just stays in the Outbox
 and it isn't delivered to anyone. &nbsp;Then I have to send the email one by one to each address in the contact group until I discover which address is bad. &nbsp;There's got to be a more efficient way to do this. &nbsp;Help!!!

            Not sure if this will work but go to&nbsp;<b>Outlook</b> menu --&gt; &nbsp;<i>Preferences...</i> --&gt;
<b>Contacts</b> and disable the option <i>Check addresses of recipients before sending a message</i>.

<h2>            Office 365 outlook will not connect to gmail</h2>
                    <p>I mistakenly deleted my Gmail&nbsp; account from outlook 365 because I was no longer able to connect. When tried to re install Gmail in outlook 365 it gave me the screen saying "not you, change settings and troubleshoot". I tried all the recommended solutions
 with negative results. I was able to install Gmail on outlook live, but it wouldn't sync with outlook 365. After changing my password I was able to connect to Gmail with my Phone and Kindle. Help would be appreciated. Bob</p>

            When I looked at the Google 2 step protection it was not clear whether I would have to use 2 pass words every time would connect to google. So, for now I decided to establish a google&nbsp; account on my windows mail program. Thank for your efforts on my behalf.&nbsp;

<h2>            ActiveSync runs &#34;successfully,&#34; but not all calendar entries actually sync</h2>
                    I have a Moto Q running Windows Mobile 6 that I syncronize with my Windows XP laptop using ActiveSync 4.5.&nbsp; ActiveSync appears to run successfully (i.e., it says it's synchronized and doesn't give any error messages), but some new appointments that I entered
 in Outlook don't appear on the phone.&nbsp; I'm not sure, but I think some new appointments that I entered in the phone don't appear in Outlook.&nbsp; Has anyone experienced this before?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for the help,<br />

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have exactly the same problem. all of a sudden not all my calendar entries in Outlook are transfered to by mobile device.
</p>
<p>I have already tried to di and reinstall activesync. I have also tried to create a new Outlook profile and have also did a hard reset of my mobile device.
</p>
<p>Strange thing is that when my friend installs my Outlook Profile on his PC then the synchronization works. so the conclusion is that it seems to be a problem with Outlook.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for trying to help.&nbsp; Here's my update:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>I did run Detect &amp; Repair with no luck</div>
</li><li>
<div>I've tried to notice some pattern among those events that sync and those that don't but I don't see one.</div>
</li><li>
<div>I've also noticed that the same problem is now plaguing my contacts -- I'm not sure whether any are updating, but I am sure that some are not updating</div>
</li><li>
<div>I looked to see whether I have any kind of a sync filter in place, but didn't see anything.</div>
</li><li>
<div>On a related note, my Moto Q works on the Sprint network and
I think it runs Windows Mobile 5, not 6 as I previously wrote.&nbsp; Sorry about that...</div>
</li></ul>
<p>Any other ideas about how to make this work?&nbsp; Needless to say, it's very problematic to not have my calendars synchronized.&nbsp; Thanks for your help,</p>

<h2>            Builds 10547, ..., Windows 10 RTM&#58;  Unknown Device &#40;Net Tap630 or nettap60.inf&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Lately, I've been catching an Unknown Device appearing and disappearing in Device Manager. &nbsp;Since it's an unknown device, there's not all that much information on it. &nbsp;But, under Properties for it, I see references to&nbsp;Net Tap630 or nettap60.inf. &nbsp;From that,
 I go back to seeing the constant, recurring "Successful Driver Installation" of "Intel Technology Access TAP Driver (NDIS 6.30)" in the Reliability Monitor ("succeeded" seven times yesterday, alone -- EDIT: &nbsp;and it looks like this happens every time I bring
 my computer out of sleep mode). &nbsp;That event has the following additional information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Driver Management concluded the process to install driver nettap60.inf_amd64_ffac37a8a5fea6ea\nettap60.inf for Device Instance ID ROOT\NET\0000 with the following status: 0x0."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, that seems to be the same thing. &nbsp;AFAIK, this "device" is the Ethernet adapter on my motherboard. &nbsp;Yet, it still show up fine in Device Manager and I've got no problem with Internet/network access (that I know of). &nbsp;Right-clicking on either my adapter
 or the unknown device in Device Manager and saying Update driver software gives me nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 1: &nbsp;It looks like I've got the latest Intel drivers loaded for Windows 10 64-bit:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/71305/Intel-Ethernet-Connection-I218-V" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/71305/Intel-Ethernet-Connection-I218-V</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 2: &nbsp;I wonder if this is related to the Metadata Staging Failed error I've been seeing (they seem to happen at about the same time as the NDIS 6.30 driver re-installed):</p>

<h2>            transition &#47; migration from old plan to new one in OLP &#40;prepaid&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, has anyone heard of some special way to transition from old plan (midsize) to new one ( bp) &nbsp;in OPEN (before it expires) without actually buying new licenses and renewing?
</p>
<p>We were told by MS representative that it is possible to raise incident with technical support for O365 and they will just migrate plans as they are (without need of purchasing new licenses).</p>
<p>But no official document/guide/how-to is available.</p>
<p>Has anyone gone through such process?l</p>

<p>Hi Karol,</p>
<p>After consulting the relevant team, the answer is No.<br />
It's not feasible to switch Midsize plans to Business Premium plans without performing standard renewal process.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

                    <p><strong>As stated, I am more than surprised.</strong></p>
<p>I Love the windows phone due to no virus risk but the case seems to be different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I recently got my Lumia 630 connected to a PC in data storage mode and I am now battling virus. My pictures will no longer display and my apps now crash more often. Worst of all, my PC can no longer recognise the phone when plugged in so I can't go for anything
 back up and in that state, a hard reset would be a big loss for me.</p>
<p>Please kindly advise.</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
The Windows Phone won't be affected by the virus because of the secured operating system. To get this resolved, please make sure that the phone software and apps are updated. For the phone software, just go to
<strong>Settings&gt;</strong> under <strong>System</strong>, tap <strong>Phone update&gt;</strong>
<strong>Check for updates</strong>. For apps, just go to <strong>Store&gt;</strong> tap the
<strong>menu</strong> at the lower right corner<strong>&gt; Settings&gt; Check for updates</strong>.
<br />
<br />
After updating the phone software and apps, perform a soft reset. To soft reset the phone, just press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts.
<br />
<br />
Let us know the result. <br />
<br />
<br />
Regards. &nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi, I updated my Lumia 800 from Windows 7.5 to Windows 7.10.8862.144</p>
<p>I did this some 3 weeks ago april 12. Since then I cannot read my mail accounts, no synchr.&nbsp;(mail accounts are diplayed in grey in the settings)</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;the icons do not&nbsp;indicate when I received a text message or missed call.</p>
<p>Connected to zune today and checked for updates again. no results in solving the problem.</p>
<p>Zune states the phone is up to date and software 7.10 (8862) is installed.</p>
<p>The lumia states software Phone 7.8. This is confusing. I was expecting 7.10.</p>
<p>Mem free is &gt; 10GB.</p>
<p>Please help to solve this.</p>

<p>OK, that was easy to solve. It turns out that you have to turn your phone off and on after the software update.</p>
<p>Now both problems are solved. ........I never turn my phone off.:whistling:.</p>

<h2>            Still trying to get my issue &#40;Lost all ownership and admin rights after insider Prev update from 17666 to 17672&#33;&#41; dealt with by Microsoft support Tech&#39;s, has failed to provide solution</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The truth is that NO-ONE in tech support appears interested or indeed capable of solving these issues? Plastered right across communities since Jan last year, multitudes of users report very similar issues, after updates to Insider Previews, crashed
 OS's and unusable devices that no longer respond to any command or App? Have completely lost faith in SFC and DISM over these last 6 weeks because when run they find "no issues" that need fixed? even though no apps will run due to 1)Location error, 2) Failure
 to have enough permissions or 3)The Domain controller prevents your work-group from making such changes????? Never been in a domain, or work-group for 10 years and neither should i?? But i am and cannot get out of either?? Neither can any of the 8 or so tech's
 i have dealt with over this issue? No clue??? I however am almost convinced that the DC and WKGOUP are in fact Microsoft itself taking over control of people's system's while denying us access??? If i am correct, and the truth will eventually come out, i demand/request
 that you immediately remove your organization from all control on my device along with your Domain users from all access!! As you never asked, i never gave you approval for anything like it and never would have anyway under any circumstances, and you have
 gone way beyond users expectations, to sneak in unannounced and unwanted!!! Obviously why you would fail to ask because most would refuse such infiltration and intrusion, into their lives!!! I will say again that i am ordering you to remove yourselves completely
 from my device, comprehend? If i lose Isder prev then so be it!!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your Tech support dept and skill set of those employees there, both need an immediate upgrade and rebuild because how is it possible to go through 8 tech's in only 5 weeks about exactly the same issue's ?? They do not listen, They are not motivated
 and one can only assume, they do not care! Evidenced by failing to call back or return, having no clue or idea about similar issues over the last year and a half? Fail to provide ticket numbers preventing any chase up by customer's, like me, when you have
 a ticket no though no-one else will deal with you and messages to call back are not given and/or simply ignored. It is a very frustrating fiasco on top of an absolutely frustrating issue that is not at all needed or appreciated!! This is all just not good
 enough conduct towards customer's and is no way to provide customer service obviously essential when you use customer's as guinea pigs. To get treated like you do not matter or that your issue is just not important or worth any effort to address and rectify??
 How on earth do you justify having no solution to an 18 month old ++ issue?? while still updating many times over that period despite being well aware of some major issue's that are still not fixed meaning you knowingly, on numerous occasions, provided all
 your customers defective and useless updates that put all customer's at risk of fatal error's in their OS's!!! I can hardly compute what indeed your motives are? to accept such risk and the major brand damage caused? Along with dept's that cannot get on top
 of the issue? See the answer as to simply ignore any prob exists? and give customer's, like myself, the complete runaround with no practical solution that is very much your problem to address and fix to people's reasonable expectation!!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even today i read some community Q and A's in support forum's that directly advised that if they could not recover/re-install then their HDD had failed and see local repairer to buy another and provide help with the issue's?? Newsflash, that is why
 we are asking you? To fix your mess, HELLO! Unbelievably poor treatment and the totally wrong advice given by your developer's, head tech's and VIP's that you can not possibly accept as any option to give to the 100's of thousands experiencing very similar
 probs?? That some mass HDD failure goes no way to any sensible solution for your employees to suggest when out of ideas, or insufficiently trained, tasked and managed, for the job at hand?? I have 3 times recovered from dead HDD to almost fixed with my own
 limited knowledge only to have my gains reversed by the support tech's i mention during remote assist, leaving me back at square one. Two most recent Ticket Number's;1427825948 and 1430361999. On Monday gone, on ....999 support number i was informed that 1)
 Microsoft could help me no more, even though tech was Level 1?? After AGAIN returning my device to unusable state??? Which i pointed out was almost fixed on the weekend and he had caused more probs so his to rectify! According to him that was not the case
 and i should buy a new Windows copy, get my local tech to install and fix any remaining issues, as the support dept could no longer assist me( which they had not been anyway? meaning up 2 me to fix, if poss!! One thing i do know for sure is that it is not,
 in any way, a HDD or Device problem BUT a Microsoft corruption problem, intentional or unintentional? That in my case i insist and expect that you take some responsibility and sort this out for the people you have thus far built your business and reputation
 on and all of whom deserve better. I for 1 cannot and will not spend a cent of mine to solve your problem!!! The first task is reclaim ownership, give yourself back Admin rights, then delete or demote with reduced permissions other random users that are not
 you or system related, then it all starts to be easier to rectify anything else. As i had no folder/file access, pro gramme launchers, network control (no browser's would work) and was not permitted access to anything "run as admin" I could only get ANY access
 to UAC from Ctrl+aLT+DEL from the options &gt;Task Manager &gt; File &gt; run new tsk &gt; Netplwiz &gt; opening User accounts. You will notice that you belong to&nbsp; work-group, in a&nbsp; Domain where you have now been demoted to the lowest user with all others having more rights
 than you! The options under users box; add Edit and change account profiles, the one you want as other's do not work for you yet. Take yourself outa workgroup into top Admin group Demote everyone else to lowly user &gt; OK &gt; edit by deleting as many as poss &gt;ok.
 Taking you back to desktop where you should open file exp and on file tree from top down, change ownership back to you give only yourself total control, disable inheritance which gets rid of most users and common sense tells me that other users include, everyone
 with basic read, write permissions, system give all but full and modify, yourself as owner every permission and Network, read and write. However i am not at all sure, could possibly be wrong even, on who you need to give access with what permissions???? Seems
 to work but maybe causing other issues to become bigger. Those last 9 lines are very important and will help most immensely to regain some control. Have not seen that way round anywhere else, not even any of the tech's saw the possibilities and i just happened
 to stumble across it which changed immense frustration, and defeat, into a hopeful optimism instead of despair! Good luck</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is my 2nd or third time raising this issue via Feedback Hub over 4 weeks as well as three Community posts asking for help? None of which has helped at all, so far!! As a long standing user and insider member i should have been able to expect
 some response from management addressing my correspondence of issues, at least a call from a techspurt to assist me however they could, it would have been much appreciated and should it occur on this occasion will be most certainly appreciated as there are
 some very stubborn issues that your input would help resolve</p>

            Yep another ranter because of lack of reading what the BETA testing program is about. sorry no help until you read the agreement that you had to ok before installing the Preview, after reading come back and maybe we can help you, as for tech help strange
 that any of the tech's helped you as it has been posted many times no direct support from Microsoft when using Beta Preview.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes i read the agreement, yes i understand the risks and yes i was able to get limited support and despite the frustrating, seemingly hopeless, position of minuscule options and very limited computer literacy, or ability, i persevered, i persisted,
 i endured and was able to overcome all problems. To my great satisfaction and utilizing the underrated values of patience with persistence, i have learnt more in the last 10 weeks, about all things computer, than all years previous.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Considering that this forum, feedback-hub, Acer support forum and the 8 tech-spurts from Microsoft support, 4 of whom were escalated level 2's (using remote assist), were of little, if any, assistance or had any genuine interest/ability to provide
 relevant, helpful answers, once the extent of my issue and problems caused became apparent over the preceding 7 weeks of begging for some help, with this thread my last attempt at doing so!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Luckily i was not holding my breath expecting any different to the stock standard replies over more than 18 months of similar requests for help with very similar problems and issues to mine, that became apparent during my own fruitless quest for answers.
 To those sufferer's, and suffering, i say that there is infinitely more value in positive zeal and persistence than in despondency and throwing in the towel by losing hope that you have the necessary ability to work it through battles to win the war. Which
 everyone has the ability to do, as i have been so fortunate to prove possible, should they want to and refuse to let a machine gain the upper hand over you or indeed let negativity and lack of support steal your optimism and hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As you, Joe Namco, so brilliantly highlight with your less than useful reply to my request. So unremarkable and even less helpful than no reply at all, that i wonder if your time and great effort would not have been more studiously spent, learning
 of some methods, ideas and solutions for the problems and issues at hand that you had zero solution for, in your crass, ignorant and completely uninformative, or in any way helpful,, response.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To those with similar issues i have some answers that enabled me to win back control, none of which may be written, technically correct, known procedure, of individual assistance or logical relevance or importance at all but are offered as used by
 myself in combination, to win my war!! There does not seem to be any quick fix or shortcut apart from time consuming, repetitive concentration and attention to detail in&nbsp; logical and methodical manner that i believe is only effective by returning to a point
 in time where you are certain that everything was performing well which could be a long time previous, as i my case. If you can? save everything you can? as you will learn it is imperative to back up and save as much and as often as you can to a portable storage
 device? or lose many years and decades of your past in an instant, as i did!!! In many attempts over 8 weeks of my using the methods i used below, they took me from an unresponsive device and highly corrupted, high jacked OS, to an as new device with smooth,
 obedient and in control system, once again and as follows;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have a 4yo Acer Aspire AMD Quad Core&nbsp; laptop, since new. Pre-installed with W 8.1 that i upgraded to&nbsp; W 10 as soon as opportunity presented and joined Widows Insider in the fast ring, knowing sweet FA and hopeing for the best. I had
 no complaints and very few issues until some 15 weeks ago when i slowly had control taken until i completely lost ownership and all Administrator abilities after updating 17666 to 17672( if not for the many similarly affected, it may well have been coincidental,
 with consideration however very unlikely!!!)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is essential and imperative to your having success to start by restoring your ownership rights and regaining your Administrator&nbsp; privileges to give back much needed control, which does not sound too difficult if you say it fast, lol.
 The only way i was able to achieve this was through the User Account Control (UAC) which paradoxically needs elevated privileges (Administrator) to achieve (as does getting to the appropriate control area, frustratingly!). I wasted much time and energy in
 the initial 2 weeks pointlessly, without resolving this issue first,!! as all else depends on having all the ability to control back in your hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My only option at the time was to start my Acer into recovery mode by restarting 3 times to bring up the available options (All of which are worth multiple&nbsp; runs as often as you can because individually they can suddenly do something,
 that they previously did not, another lesson). However the options to go back to previous version, Reset, Refresh or Recover, not only refused to work but would not recognize any back ups, system images, restore points or devices they were on. Through this
 experience i found also that running Command Prompt from here( my only elevated option) did not have enough grunt to overcome my lack of ability to use it for the same problems from the desktop, with essential commands not recognized or unavailable making
 it not very helpful at all above basic tasks). From here i constantly ran start up repair for little joy from; Start up repair could not fix the issue &gt; taking 6hrs repairing until the sign in ?? Sometimes after one another sometimes days apart, to dubious
 effect. In Other Startup Options &gt; Restart &gt; Select the most useful to me were &gt; Safe Boot with Command Prompt (With no Admin Elevation until absolute ability regained, which was a bummer) and &gt; Safe Boot with Networking &gt; a godsend when no Internet access
 was possible? as no browser would launch!! So very frustrating and powerless.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Along with many of the ways that helped me, that i found and used to help me solve&nbsp; my problem one source was through watching as remote assist was being undertaken, albeit to no avail when taken in isolation with regard to solving my
 mounting problems but in this instance, the second ( of 3) elevated Tech sessions, as 3 initial and 1 Level 2 had already given up (Disappeared, un-contactable in fact!! GRrrrr!!) defeated by not being able to help overcome the issues required to launch into
 remote assist, having no browsers, right click start options, windows search from start etc, etc! A total nightmare that is actually sounding impossible as i think back and write, even to the extent of going to the library to download a bootable copy of&nbsp; desktop
 that despite method, Media Creation Tool or Rufus, device, old new USB or Seagate portable hard drive, formatting or anything else, continued to download with elevated privileges needed for it to run&nbsp; meaning i could not run it ( In fact any program, app,
 resource etc that had an Administrator shield attached would not select and if clicked froze the whole system for 15 - 20mins until notification &gt; This is not in a recognized location or has been moved or you do not have sufficient rights to use or your Administrator
 has blocked and prevented this action &gt; So go away! No! But that is what was meant!!) More petrol on the fire!!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This Tech asked me to &gt; Win + R &gt; bringing up the Run Box/Option &gt; Enter; http://google.com/ (NB: NO&nbsp; 's'&nbsp; on the http ) &gt; Bringing up an emergency, single tab browser, YAY!!! &gt; www.support.microsoft.com/help &gt; Where i could allow/enable
 Tech access/ability for remote support, Double YAY!!! Thought i was home? Not to be BUT an essential tool/command/method to have when all else has failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Using this method he remotely tried to download and open Internet Explorer, Edge, Firefox, Chrome and Opera to no avail and/or use, as permission denied to run, even when downloaded by US! Unbelievable, but emphasizing that first step
 as essential. He used creation tool to download W10 to clean install which began installing so lost contact with support, took 2 hrs to get to 98% &gt; Notification &gt; Windows has encountered an error which prevents continuing &gt; Reversing any changes and returning
 to previous OS &gt; which took another 6 hrs of no support call to check progress, no ability to contact him myself only 13 support no and in fact left 2 messages to ring me( Which support is very reluctant to do, if at all??, and will do nothing for you if you
 have an open support case number!!) Also leaving you powerless. This Tech was never heard from again!!! NEXT !!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After another 8 odd days until that case was closed i was able to enlist Tech 6 to my cause and using this method enabled remote access and had written 14 bullet points of issues for this tech that were major items needing attention along
 with the importance of taking time to read the problems listed. He did not see it that way and despite my pleading efforts (As he was doing tasks that did not work, wasting his time but if he read my notes he would have known and tried anything else!!) He
 never read any of the previous solutions that already failed!!! He did however instruct me &gt;&nbsp; Cntl &gt; Alt &gt; Del , together from desktop which brings up options &gt; Log out, Switch off, Restart, Sign out and Task manager then &gt; Task Manager &gt; File &gt; Run New Task
 &gt; Netplwiz &gt; ADVANCED UAC box with all users, status and role's with options ADD, REMOVE, PROPERTIES with Edit unavailable denied with Administrator only with ability and ADD usable but useless, both explored along with an advanced TAB that proved fruitless
 and a visited properties option, seemingly useless. Clocking off saying he would return when i was available, in 5 days time, leaving me gutted with no hope left. Deciding instead to visit Acer Support, Wipe and format device(factory reset) reinstall 8.1 and
 start again, having had enough!!! Alas, were it so easy?! You could not make this up!!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 'device's "C:" Drive has partitions from new one of which contains the ability to wipe and format the device which was good news. How to access it involved more written assistance requests and many hours of you tube Vid how to's?
 Only to discover that the disc maybe so badly corrupted as too need replacing because NO method would factory reset my device, so it must be unusable??!! BAD news but plausible!! OR as one Tech connected to Acer, online said "When Devices come with Windows
 Pre Installed (Microsoft OR the process??) Wipes/deletes the device's factory reset partition??? WHY?? So apparently Windows cannot be removed from the device using the Factory Default Option!!! Most likely, from MS viewpoint understandable if not enlightened!!
 From me, SIMMERING ANGER!!! and further hopeless despair!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A few days cooling off and thinking clearly, i was back&nbsp; to it trying everything again and again, just in case. Bringing me back to Safe boot with networking and &gt; Win +R &gt; Netplwiz &gt; AUAC &gt;&nbsp; Users &gt; GUEST/Guest , Administrators/Device
 Administrator, Paul (Me)/(lowly) User, Paulm(???)/User also, then &gt; Properties &gt; General/ tab/Group Membership &gt; Input Name etc &gt; Select &gt; Group Membership &gt; Options &gt; Choose membership Group &gt; User / Administrator / Other-Administrators(Domain or group) &gt;
 Selected Administrator for myself (to see as a test, with no hope involved &gt; APPLY &gt; OK &gt; return to initial User's box with options &gt; Paul / Administrator group &gt; WHAT THE??? NO!! SURELY NOT??!! No not dreaming, let's see &gt; Select Guest &gt; Remove &gt; Unable to
 remove account as protected by Domain management???? &gt; Same, same &gt; Properties &gt; Guest &gt; Group Membership Tab &gt; Demote Guest to lowly User &gt; Apply &gt; OK &gt; Administrators &gt; Group membership &gt; Demote to( Lowest of low) User &gt; Apply &gt; OK &gt; OK &gt; Select Guest /
 user &gt; Remove &gt; Denied as essential system user account, DAMN!! &gt; Select Administrators &gt; Remove &gt; Done and Gone (Dancing, yelling with joy etc). A win finally and so very significant turning point to get control back was simply unbelievable and something
 i had almost lost hope of regaining ever again.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From this point i had to methodically and painstakingly, file by file, &gt; Right Click &gt; Properties &gt; Security &gt; Advanced &gt; Change Owner &gt; Find &gt; Advanced &gt; Find Now &gt; Paul Administrator &gt; OK &gt; OK &gt; Notification - If you have just taken
 ownership close Properties and reopen to view or change permissions &gt; Close &gt; Right click &gt; Properties &gt; Security &gt; Advanced &gt; Disable Inheritance &gt; Add &gt; ME-Full Control &gt; Ok &gt; Add &gt; System-All but full control &gt; Ok &gt; Add &gt; Everyone-Read, Write, List &gt; Ok&nbsp;
 &gt; Add &gt; Network Service- Read only &gt; Ok &gt; Ok &gt; Select &gt; Guest-Administrator-Anyone you do not know &gt; Edit&nbsp; &gt; Delete &gt; Ok &gt; ETC then once again &gt; Add &gt; Repeat as previously Yourself-System-Everyone-Network Service &gt; Ok &gt; Close &gt; Repeat again and again file
 by file, folder by folder, location by location, Etc etc!!! In the end you will have both your Ownership and Administrator rights back which is not the final solution by any means but a solid foundation and necessary undertaking to progress further and restore
 your whole operation, along with a lot of logic, a small amount of common sense and a pinch of luck with a chunk of stubbornness and a large portion of persistence, thrown into the mix!!!! Good luck and i hope this assists many of you, as it would have me
 if available!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you have made it here then it is a story of epic proportions, all absolute truth but unbelievably only a summary of what a saga this whole unfortunate, situation has been and the very large amount of time and effort involved to make
 any progress whatsoever ( Long! Yes long and involved!!! But strangely cathartic, personally!!! And saved me from throwing my device into the river or smashing it into small pieces, with gusto and relish!!!! )&nbsp; Should anyone need, or indeed is brave enough
 to ask, for further&nbsp; assistance from this point i would be only to happy to help, cheers and once more Good Luck!!!</p>

            Interesting!&nbsp; but way too long to read it all, as it has been posted many times on here sometimes a "clean" install will get a Preview beta system up and running, I guess it was a good learning curve for you, as for tech support I think Microsoft will
 be very interested as support techs are not allowed to give support to Preview builds. as others have posted if you didn't start off by ranting you probably would have gotten some helpful tips.
