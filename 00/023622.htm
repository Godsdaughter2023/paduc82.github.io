<h2>            podcast novel problems</h2>
                    
<p>I will be listening to a podiobook chapter and partway through, the audio switches to a completely different book by a completely different author! Right in the middle of the file! It has happened more than once. I have deleted the book and reloaded the
 remaining chapters and it works fine, but when I'm on the road and can't sync for 2 days, it really sucks.</p>
<p>Secondly, how can I sort by filename or chapter instead of by date released? Alot of books are released in reverse order.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello Kelly,</p>
<p>Does it happen with many files? Have you noticed if the corrupted files were sync'ed together? I would also suggest you to void the content of the device and re-sync everything and check if this happens again. It could also be helpful if possible, to re-download
 these files from the original source. Please also check this thread that might refer to your issue too:<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/zune/thread/b9b5b814-0388-49c9-bbc1-f48b4f835f7a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/zune/thread/b9b5b814-0388-49c9-bbc1-f48b4f835f7a</a>&nbsp;Thanks
 for posting!</p>

            Hello deepak-2710 
<br />Please follow these steps 
<br />IMPORTANT: If your McAfee product came preinstalled on your PC:
<br />Activate your McAfee subscription before you try to remove your product.
<br />This is so that you keep your right to use the product (license) without having to buy a new subscription.
<br />To activate the McAfee software that came preinstalled, see TS102477.
<br /> 
<br />Step 1: Remove using Windows
<br />The standard Windows removal method is the best way to uninstall your McAfee products.
<br />
<br />Click the link for your version of Windows. You will go to Microsoft.com.
<br />Follow Microsoft's removal steps:
<br />Windows 10
<br />Windows 8, 8.1
<br />Windows 7 or Vista
<br />If removal succeeds, your McAfee products are now removed from your PC.
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT: Your PC will no longer be protected from viruses and malware. Ensure that you reinstall your security software as soon as possible to restore protection.
<br />
<br />If removal fails using the standard Windows removal method, go to Step 2.
<br /> 
<br />Step 2: Download and run the McAfee Consumer Product Removal tool (MCPR)
<br />You must only use the MCPR tool if the Windows removal methods shown above do not work.
<br />IMPORTANT:
<br />Always download a new copy of MCPR before each use.  
<br />This ensures that you have the latest version, and that newer McAfee products can be successfully recognized.
<br />MCPR cleans up only the components needed for reinstallation. It is not designed to clean up 100% of components.
<br />Completing this step requires a restart.
<br />Before you start:
<br />Bookmark or favorite this article so that you can easily get back to it.
<br />Save all open files.
<br />Close all programs.
<br /> 
<br />Download the MCPR tool.
<br />Double-click MCPR.exe.
<br />If you see a security warning:
<br />
<br />Click Yes, Continue, or Run (depending on your version of Windows):
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /> 
<br />At the McAfee Software Removal screen:
<br />Click Next. 
<br />Click Agree to accept the End User License Agreement (EULA).
<br /> 
<br />At the Security Validation screen:
<br />Type the characters exactly as shown on your screen. Validation is case-sensitive.
<br />Click Next. This step prevents the accidental use of MCPR.
<br />
<br />
<br /> 
<br />When the process is complete, you see one of the following messages. Click the one that you see.
<br />Removal Complete
<br />
<br />Cleanup Unsuccessful

<br />
You might want to look at the list of sites that are listed in the trusted sites list.&nbsp; If you have microsoft.com listed in there, you might alternatively want to remove it from that list and see if that helps before adding *.livefilestore.com.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>How do I disable confirmation prompt when emptying Deleted Items - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard winks  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable confirmation prompt when emptying Deleted Items folder</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Outlook from MS Office 2010.</p>
<p>I have the "Empty Deleted Items folder when exiting Outlook" option enabled.</p>
<p>Whenever I close Outlook I get a prompt that asks whether I want to Empty the Deleted Items folder.</p>
<p>Is there a way to disable this prompt and "just do it"?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is especially annoying when Outlook is closed because&nbsp;I am logging off (Windows 7). It forces me to cancel the log off to answer the prompt.</p>
<p>Not only that but if you right click the Deleted Items folder and select "Empty Folder" or open the folder and select all items then hit delete you are prompted one more time whether you want to empty the folder.</p>
<p>I can appreciate the need for caution but 99.99999% of the time I really do want to delete it. Answering the prompt is one more mouse move and click.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;don't find&nbsp;anything obvious in the options that will disable the prompt.</p>
<p>I seem to recall a check box on similar confirmation prompts that say "don't ask again".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> jeffreyroman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bing in my phone is slow or not responding.</h2>
                    When i press the search button and it takes me to Bing, sometimes is fast others really slow or not connecting at all. But i could open my browser search the same thing in Google.com and i get a results in less than a second. Whats going on with bing?
 Could it be that they are dedicating too many resources to Apple new Ios. I know they aren't running yet. But my phone was working fine at the beginning 2 months ago and now im afraid to search in front of my friends with androids or apples. Im glad im not
 doing any $100 bets...&nbsp;

<h2>            Lumia 620 moving user&#39;s exchange mail to deleted items</h2>
                    <p>We're just trialling WP8 with a view to replacing our blackberry curve devices in the coming months</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>unfortunately one of the Nokia Lumia 620 devices we have on trial keeps moving the user's inbox content to the deleted items folder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've spent some time narrowing it down to the device, but being new to the devices are struggling to move any further forward. We've tried wiping the device, and that hasnt helped</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any suggestions are welcome. Standard Lumia 620 connecting to Exchange 2010 SP1 via activesync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using this account on any other devices? </p>
<p>It`s probably syncing with other device. </p>
<p>Please check your email inbox on pc and then go on your phone to settings -&gt; system -&gt; email + accounts, tap and hold "Microsoft account", check if it`s syncing. If yes switch it off&nbsp;and see what happen.
</p>
<p>Hope it helps. </p>

            If you have Office 365 you cannot uninstall individual applications<br />
<br />
If you have Office 2013, then you can use this tip:<br />

this thread</a>. </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having this exact problem and it started about a week ago. Since then, when I type in my reply to some emails and send everything seems ok but I receive a reply from the sender saying the email is blank and has one or two Chinese characters. When I
 check the same email in sent items, i find that the text content that i typed in is gone and it now shows the same Chinese characters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can imagine, this is very frustrating especially since it affects only some emails and it does not seem like there is a common denominator in the affected emails. I can't seem to find any solution searching through online forums; I have tried the
 suggestions in this thread including changing the mail encoding but that does not seem to help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just run the repair tool and will wait to see if the problem comes up again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Office 365 ProPlus, Version 1808 (Build 10730.20334 Click-to-run)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Benjamin</p>

<p>Hello Benjamin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in our forum, since you may have different scenario with original thread owner, to better focusing on your issue, this post is split as a new thread.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the version you provided, if it is the latest version, then I suppose your office clients should be in semi-annual channel. Except for repair tool or SaRA tool, you can also try to
 switch to monthly channel to see if it works (please be kindly noted that after switch Monthly channel, all Office apps will be in that channel):

<p>Hi John,<br />
<br />
This issue has been fixed from the back end. Please check if the affected user has control to his own OneDrive for Business library now.<br />
<br />
For your reference: Generally, this kind of issue should be caused by the re-creation of the user account with the same UPN. We need to match the passport unique ID for the affected user from the back end to fix it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>SharePoint Library names changing when synced via OneDrive for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joegrube  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Library names changing when synced via OneDrive for Business Sync</h2>
                    
<p>We recently started having this problem occur, in addition to the multitude of other issues with syncing SharePoint libraries to local PCs.</p>
<p>In this instance, a user is syncing several SharePoint libraries to the PC via OneDrive for Business tool. However, when the libraries establish their folders on the local PC, the first synced library folder is named T, the second T1, the third T2. To make
 it more strange, these folders frequently change names while the initial sync is in process. For example, they will begin to sync with the proper folder name, then a duplicate with (1) appended to the end will appear and the original will become orphaned.
 Then, when the sync is completing, the folder names on the PC will change to the above T, T1. This is not for every folder. Some sync successfully without the name changing.</p>
<p>We are using SharePoint Online. The PC on which this is occurring is Windows 10 Pro at the latest release. The Office version is 2016 via Office365.</p>

<p>hi joe,</p>
<p>usually the onedrive for business synced folder replaces the library name with the “library1” or “library (1)” because a folder named “library” is already created in the user’s local directory. users can navigate to
<i>c:\users\user-name</i> and check the folders.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=87d88b07-f027-48f2-86d7-619731a7df4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d87d88b07-f027-48f2-86d7-619731a7df4d" /></a></p>
<p>if this is the case, we just need to delete the duplicate folders and sync the folder again to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>if this is not the case, please let us know by providing some screenshots of the affected folders for our investigation.</p>
<p>to upload screenshots, click <b>use rich formatting</b> in this thread and select

<p>thanks,<br />

<p>hi jerry,</p>
<p>this seems to be getting worse. we see the issue as above. however, deleting and re-syncing results in the same issues. i have deleted all libraries and done a full cleaning of the appropriate cache folders, etc. to start over. i have just begun syncing
 my first library, with this result.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ec116a02-482c-42f2-8ee8-36424584a19c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dec116a02-482c-42f2-8ee8-36424584a19c" /></a></p>
<p>i'll continue to sync libraries. i am sure that the issue with libraries being defined as t, t1, t2, will recur. just an fyi - none of our true library names in sharepoint are anything of the sort. we have no idea where the t reference is coming from.</p>

<p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>Several points need to be confirmed before moving on:</p>
<p>1. Does the issue occur to libraries in a specific site?</p>
<p>2. Does the issue happen to other users/other devices?</p>
<p>Besides, we may need to collect some logs for analysis.</p>
<p>To collect logs, I’ve sent you a private message about how to capture OneDrive for Business logs. Please follow the steps below to access the PM:</p>
<p>&nbsp; 1). Go to the your details section on the right side of the community site.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2). Click Private messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3). Click the subject title of the response to read the message.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>thank you.</p>
<p>here is an example of all of the libraries we sync when completed from a fresh sync.</p>
<p>this is occurring for multiple users/pcs. all synced libraries are in our single team site for our company.</p>
<p>i will collect logs when i have a moment and send them back to you.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are experiencing the exact same Issue in our Company. There are several SharePoint Document Libraries that change their name to T1, T2, etc.</p>
<p>It happens on all User's computers for a couple of libraries.</p>
<p>Resyncing (with deleting the files and clearing the cache) did not work. For test purposes we even set up a new PC. Same issue

<p>After a recent update the header in any word document is showing as a double image - even when printed out. When you click on the header it reverts to a single image, but after a few minutes it goes back to a double image.</p>
<p>Anyone got any ideas why this would be and how I can sort it?</p>

<p>There hasn't been an update to Office 2011 for at least a year, so I assume you mean an update to Mac OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the Word menu and choose About Word. Your version should be 14.7.7</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other version, install updates, test again, and reply here with the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your Mac is managed by an IT department, have them install updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise, make sure your Mac has a working internet connection before checking for updates. Install Mac OS X updates followed by Office updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Install Mac OS X updates first:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get Mac OS updates, go to the App store on your dock, and then click the Updates button to reveal available updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Then Install Office Updates</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get the update:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>1. Open any Office application</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>2. Go to the Help menu and choose Check for Updates</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>3. Let AutoUpdate check for and install updates</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>4. Restart your Mac</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any add-ins such as WebEx, Mendelay, EndNote, Zotero, TypeIt4me, etc it is essential that you install the latest updates for your add-ins.</span></p>

<h2>            Profile Phone Number Associated With Account&#40;s&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a personal .msn email account and a personal .outlook&nbsp; email account. I tried to use my cell phone number with both accounts, but promptly received an error message email to the 1st email I verified after verifying the 2nd email account. After thinking
 for a moment (or 3), now that you can sign in with a phone number how could you possibly only have 1 phone number for signing into 2 emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question:&nbsp; Is there any way I can use 1 phone number for security/recovery purpose with 2 email accounts?</p>
<p>Any workaround at all, or do I need 2 cell phones now?</p>
<p>I would certainly agree to link my accounts to 1 single profile, but I don't understand if my emails are Exchange accounts or not.</p>

<p>So you think that if someone is testing the technical preview they should not describe bugs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has issued "known bugs" for the latest preview version and if you encounter a bug that's not on the list, you SHOULD provide information in the feedback app, and post it here to see how widespread the problem is, or if perhaps someone has a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When people describe bugs, they aren't complaining that the OS should be perfect - they are giving feedback, which is what the preview is all about. &nbsp;It's their contribution to the work in progress. &nbsp;Insiders are volunteer testers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that people should comment on the parts that work, but they should also comment on the parts that don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Expect there to be problems, and it's expected that you report the problems you find.</strong></p>

<p>Ok, I have been running&nbsp; W10 as a "sole"&nbsp; OS on a HP notebook since day 1.&nbsp; This W10 PC is 1 of 4 and has a full load just like the other 3 with W8.1.&nbsp; I am also using Start8 from Stardock which takes away all of the nonsense about the W10 Start Menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 My whole fleet looks very much like W7 with Icons on the Desktop, Icons on the lower taskbar and a menu of FIles, Folder, or items such as Control.&nbsp; THis selection is all by my choice.&nbsp; You can not tell what O/S I have under the hood on any of my 4 PC's. &nbsp;
 There is just no transition to be concerned with.&nbsp; They all look the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also 1 click away from the Start Button to get to the W8 interface, if desired.&nbsp; I feel I have the best of both worlds.&nbsp; W10 under the hood but seamless back to beloved W7 that is desired by many.&nbsp; If I did not have Start8 on W10, I would just go back
 to W8.1, but running Start8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a couple of issues with 9926, the AMD display which I fixed by a change in the BIOS and a double fix by downloading the latest Omega driver.&nbsp; I reduced the delay on the Restart to 3 seconds so this is now an almost unnoticeable default to W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My W10 is about as smooth as expected on a Beta release.&nbsp; Cortana does not speak to me and I am a bit happy about that.&nbsp; I took that big ugly box away and changed to a small "Search" Icon.</p>

            <p>I'm using 9926 on my SP3 as it's only OS. I have a desktop w/ 8.1 I use for school, so I don't molest that machine much.</p>
<p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>The Tech Preview is meant to figure out the bugs, figure out what people like/don't like, and then figure out if they give options to set things up the way YOU want, or if there shouldn't be an option. The Start Menu being a good example. Don't like the
 desktop start menu? Switch to the tablet one. Or vice versa. And I'm going to bet even this will change over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they put the start menu back to the way it was in Win 7, with no access to live tiles and Modern apps, they are taking a huge step backwards from where they went with the innovative, but flawed, Windows 8 concept.

<p>

 That, to me, would be a huge step back.</p>

<p>@slerch666- No, I appreciate your comments.&nbsp; I was programming big computers in the days when the computing power of my PC took the space of a large house.&nbsp; It was the era of magnetic tape drives.&nbsp; My interest has remained to this day where I have a PC on
 each level of my 3 level house with 1 to spare for a W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also get to assist many folks that have no clue about their PC.&nbsp; The W7 interface and now Start8 allows them to select a little Icon or select from a list for the items that they want.&nbsp; I do admit that I could use any Start Button or interface that was
 presented to me.&nbsp; I just could not do it right now but give me a little time.&nbsp; During an new install, I often lose my access to Start8 and I am totally lost.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the list of little bugs in 9926, I was just about ready to threw in the towel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get my Start8 up and running and I love 9926 now.&nbsp; I am also on the "notice" list of the very large and active thread on the Start Menu and a lot of knowledgeable folks are giving comment.&nbsp; I can hardly get anything done with all the replies.&nbsp;
 What would my grannie take away from this?&nbsp; I take away something about round corners, square corners and how the human mind relates to this ****.&nbsp; I will just tell grannie if she wants to get to her bank, click on the Bank Icon.&nbsp;&nbsp; If she wants to get her
 email from Outlook (Office 2013), give the Outlook Icon a&nbsp; shot.&nbsp; If she needs to get to Control Panel, it is on list.&nbsp; If she wants to see her pictures on Onedrive, then click on the Onedrive Icon or choose from the list and then Pictures.&nbsp; There are no round
 or square corners which grannie likely can't see what shape they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's to Start8 or similar and here's to Grannie.</p>

            <p>My computing experience began at the ripe old age of 4 or so, on a...... TSR-80, then a Coco 3. I don't go back to magnetic tape, but my dad does. And he actually gave up on "playing" with computers at Windows 95. Now he's the granny in your comment, which
 is a little sad, and any and every change is ferociously resisted. Until I show him "hey Dad, it'll be OK, I promise. Watch this..." And usually? He "gets it." Not everyone does. ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to do Desktop Support at the company where I work for 10 years, before moving into scripting automated installs, and computer management. For me, I love the new car smell. Or whatever you want to call that new toy excitement. I want new, I want change.
 Not everyone does, and I get that. Having the option is good for people. For some it's just training wheels, for others, it's the WAY they want to work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't have to try the new Start Menu. I like the evolution, then the.... devolution? with Win 8 to Win 10. Somewhere in the middle there very well may be a happy median. I hope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for me, the Windows + typing to search for something is integral. It's ingrained in the way I do things. So much so when I work with a Mac I'm like "oh...... how quaint! Move mouse, press here, click there, type, press enter..." Not a dig on the Mac,
 just another nod to the way I work and my expected workflow.</p>

<p>Ok, netty2015. I Installed Windows 10 preview On Acer 5335 And Acer Company Has Stopped The Support After Windows Vista Was In It. And No Support Since. I Did The Full Install And So Far It's Not Doing To Bad Either. Now I Have Another Acer With Windows
 7 in it. But I Wanted To Start And See On How It Would Do On This Computer.</p>

            <p>I'm now using W10 as my primary PC.&nbsp; It runs a VM in Parallels on a Mac.&nbsp; I'm not a Mac fan boy, I just have it for support and Microsoft systems are my primary focus.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm liking the combination of tiles and recent apps on the Start Menu and would prefer pinned items instead of Places, but that's just preference.&nbsp; If I changed to the Stardock Start8, it would look like W7, so I don't see what the big deal is.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>now there are mayor issues with temperature (driver issues ( AMD))</p>
<p>i'll wait till newer build(s) and won't ruin my laptop by using it as a barbeque (temp over 100C during update and clean install)</p>

            <p>I am so glad to see someone else that uses Strart8 as opposed to the stock Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 TP start button.&nbsp; However - that aside I am very disappointed with the Windows 10 offering so far; it seems very "skitterish" to me with flashing scroll
 bars and the like all over the place.&nbsp; I have a desktop PC with a hex core CPU 16GB of PC2133 RAM and it took 25 seconds to open File Explorer after installing the latest 9926 build.&nbsp; I've always been at the forefront of Windows Technical Preview/Consumer
 Previews in the past and I have never had the problems with any of them that I have with Windows 10 TP.&nbsp; I tried to install it on my Asus Ultrabook but failed at the first hurdle - no drivers for the SSD so no install.&nbsp; I did an over&nbsp;Windows 8.1&nbsp;install but
 unfortunately I had the same problems with File Explorer (The scroll bar returns to the top after about 4-6 seconds and during that time I cannot select a program or folder)&nbsp; In the past the Enterprise version of the Technical preview was OK but not now.&nbsp;
 Suffice to say that I am sticking to my solid Windows 8.1 installation for the time being as the Windows 10 TP is on a separate SSD and I use the BIOS to select which OS I use to boot!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course my use of Start8 may change when I eventually get my Windows phone beck from repair ( Don't every buy from Simply Electronics -they have had it for repair since September 2014) as the Start Menu that comes with Windows 10 TP and presumably Windows
 Phone 10 is most definitely more suited to phones and tablets!&nbsp; As a final comment - I've still to find the Control Panel in 9926 build!</p>

<h2>            OneDrive client for business - doesn&#39;t remember credentials</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am syncing some files on my computer against my personal sharepoint site at my institution. The sync process itself works fine, once it does it.</p>
<p>However, after every restart of the sync client, I get a prompt asking me for credentials, despite the fact that I always click "Remember my credentials". How can I get the client to correctly remember the credentials (including the domain name that are
 part of it).<br />
I am running Windows 8.1 and Office 2013.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>Marten</p>

<p>Hi Marten,</p>
<p>To investigate the issue, I'd like to collect some information:<br />
1. Have you tried clearing the related credentials in Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Credential Manager-&gt; Windows Credentials?<br />
2. Could you let us know the version of your OneDrive for Business sync client? You can check it via&nbsp;Task Manager&nbsp;&gt; right click&nbsp;Microsoft OneDrive for Business&gt;&nbsp;Properties-&gt; Details.<br />
3. To investigate if the issue is related to your account, does the issue happen to other user accounts in this PC?<br />
4. Currently, are you connected to only one library?<br />
5. If it is convenient, could you try if the issue happen to other PCs in the same network environment?</p>
<p>Please let us know the information when you have time. We will help you further.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jim</p>

<p>Hi Jim</p>
<p>thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>1. Yes, multiple times. I have deleted all credentials that might possibly be related.</p>
<p>2. Thanks for the description of how to get there. The version is 15.0.4771.1000</p>
<p>3. It only happens to this computer. I have to say the following to it, as this only happened on this computer, as well:</p>
<p>For the first time, when I wanted to sync against the institutions' sharepoint, I used the wrong credentials and asked the OneDrive for Business client to remember them. The credentials I used were something like "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", as it is often
 used there. However, for this sharepoint, the username is "SOME_AD_DOMAIN\userid", which I use since then. Normally, the password dialog asks me for username and password and does not suggest a pre-saved password. However, recently I stopped syncing and removed
 all sync connections, including credentials, from the computer. After setting up this sync again, the password dialog proposed "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" as a username again. It looks like this is still stored somewhere outside of the credential manager and
 pops up from time to time? </p>
<p>On a windows 7 machine that was set up with the correct credentials right from the beginning works fine.</p>
<p>4. Yes.</p>
<p>5. Please see 3. </p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Marten</p>

<p>Hi Martenlastnamell</p>
<p>Please perform the following steps to completely remove the credentials first:<br />
1. Right click the OneDrive for Business icon on the taskbar and <strong>stop syncing</strong> OneDrive for Business folders.
<br />
2. Close all Office applications including OneDrive for Business.<br />
3. Reset IE settings and delete personal settings: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/923737#bookmark-manual%20steps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/923737#bookmark-manual%20steps</a>.&nbsp;<br />
4. Remove all the stored credentials in the credentials manager (Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; Credential Manager &gt; Windows Credentials).<br />
5. Run <strong>regedit</strong>.<br />
6. From Registry Editor, browse to:<br />
<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Identity</strong><br />
7. Delete the Identity folder.<br />
8. Open a browser and sign into the SharePoint site. <br />
9. Click Sync and sync the library again.<br />
10. If the issue remains, exit the OneDrive for Business sync client and re-run it as administrator to check the outcome.</p>
<p>If the issue persists and it is convenient, clear OneDrive for Business cache using&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">fix it tool</a>&nbsp;and try again.<br />
Note: You may resync all your libraries after clearing OneDrive for Business cache.</p>
<p>Let me know the updates when you have time, so we can help you further.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Sky</p>

<p>Hi Sky,</p>
<p>sorry for the delay, I have been busy.</p>
<p>I tried your suggestions from last time, without success, though. However, I haven't had the time to perform step 10 or the fix it tool, yet.</p>
<p>After step 9, the old credentials, that I entered the very first time popped up again.</p>
<p>However, I noticed (in contrary to a previous answer of mine), that this is not limited to the computer I described. I have another computer connected to that sharepoint server with the same account, running windows 7 enterprise. This computer never actually
 remembers the credentials, despite my clicking the "Remember..." button all the time. After a reboot I have to enter them again. If I use an office product (say Word 2013) to work on a file on the server that is saved in my local OneDrive for business copy,
 I have to login every single time I start Word.</p>
<p>Maybe the issue is rather in not remembering the credentials?</p>
<p>However, I will try step 10 onwards soon and report back.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Marten</p>

<p>Hi Sky,</p>
<p>so, resetting the cache and starting OneDrive for Business (OD4B) as admin has changed things a little bit, but not solved the fundamental problem. This is what I have now:</p>
<p>- When OD4B promts for credentials now, it does not suggest the incorrect credentials any more that I had entered initially. Instead, it just asks for credentials without a suggestion</p>
<p>- OD4B does not show the popup notification after windows login any more, telling me that credentials are required (until credentials are given, the taskbar icon has this yellow overlay, indicating a sync error). Instead OD4B shows no error symbol in the
 notification area and in Windows explorer, all files are checked green. However, as soon as I change something (save new file, save changes, delete, rename...), OD4B asks me for credentials. Also, Office applications do not know any credentials, but ask me
 to enter them every time I first save something the first time of an Office program session (OneNote, Word, Excel..)</p>
<p>Please note: after credentials are entered, syncs run smoothly. But I have to enter credentials 10s of times a day.</p>

<p>hi martenlastnamell,</p>
<p>sorry for my delay.</p>
<p>according to your description, the credential issue may be related to the office programs. please do the following steps first to check the outcome:<br />
1. open any office program, such as <strong>word</strong>. click <strong>file</strong> -&gt;
<strong>account</strong>. make sure you have signed in with the correct account and owned the
<strong>corrected connect services</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=22c0cafd-76a7-4e92-9942-ed92a4e6decc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d22c0cafd-76a7-4e92-9942-ed92a4e6decc" /></a></p>
<p>2. update the onedrive for business to the latest version via clicking <strong>
update now</strong> in the screenshot above.<br />
3. repair office with <a href="https://support.office.com/en-nz/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
online repair</a>.</p>
<p>once it is finished, please try again to see if you still need to enter credentials.</p>
<p>in addition, please upload screenshots which ask you to enter credentials for our analysis. note: to insert a screenshot, click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong>&nbsp;on this thread and click the <strong>insert/edit</strong> button.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<p>hi sky,</p>
<p>thanks for your reply. before i post the login process screenshots, i may have to check something with you. on the office account pages, i miss the options you marked in red, because (?) i chose not to use a microsoft account with windows 8.1 and office.
 therefore, it rather looks like this after starting word:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=07cee598-49a1-4e9b-8bc3-9d3385def2c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d07cee598-49a1-4e9b-8bc3-9d3385def2c4" /></a></p>
<p>because this blocks me from performing step 2, i didn't do this, yet. do i (really) have to use a microsoft account just to connect to my institutions sharepoint?</p>
<p>i have installed all windows updates available to me.</p>
<p>here are the screenshots. what i did is to restart the computer, look at the od4b client (+login there), open a word document on my hard drive that is in the od4b folder, edit it and save it.</p>
<p>first of all: after a windows login, the od4b client shows a sync error in the notification area icon. upon "sync now", it show this login promt to me:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=49099c61-135d-4a34-88bf-2420e6709f3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d49099c61-135d-4a34-88bf-2420e6709f3c" /></a></p>
<p>using the correct credentials closes the dialog upon clicking ok. i also clicked the "remember..." button.</p>
<p>then i opened a file in word that is in my local od4b folder. word does not prompt for credentials the account page after word start looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=092f909a-2966-4605-9e2b-f85f208d9031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d092f909a-2966-4605-9e2b-f85f208d9031" /></a></p>
<p>then i changed some words in the word file and clicked the "save" button. word then shows this:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6feaed7b-6ee5-4f47-abd6-4a89d951e74d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6feaed7b-6ee5-4f47-abd6-4a89d951e74d" /></a></p>
<p>i click the "sign in" button and get the same credentials dialog as before:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9760ced1-97b0-4027-a290-98b1d3c8d2ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9760ced1-97b0-4027-a290-98b1d3c8d2ac" /></a></p>
<p>after doing the same procedure as before, word asks me to click 'save' again because of the file version on the server. after clicking 'save' again, it saves the file successfully to sharepoint. when i view the file online with the online apps, i can see
 the changes being applied.</p>
<p>after this process, the word account page looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=9c42480b-f7cd-4f7b-bb3d-522870d8e530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d9c42480b-f7cd-4f7b-bb3d-522870d8e530" /></a></p>
<p>clicking "fix me" doesn't get me anywhere despite a working internet connection:</p>
