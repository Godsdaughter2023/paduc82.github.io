I think you should be able to access BIOS but perhaps only immediately after a power on.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should almost have whatever key is needed pressed before you power it on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then that would be why you cannot boot your "USB recovery either".&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. you would need
 to get into the BIOS boot devices menu to make sure that the USB device is ahead of the hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; (In fact, see below.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise as I understand it all keyboard intervention at boot time has been engineered out of W8.&nbsp; See the last 30 seconds of the video at the end of this blog post for the new procedure to get into the Advanced Options boot menu.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Not that I think your
 loop is showing any signs of such a feature.)</p>

<p>So, is the "Novo button" an alternate method of doing a Power on which avoids the usual uncertainty about timing the keystroke to get the attention of the BIOS setup?</p>

            <p><strong>Method 1: Restart the computer by force&nbsp;shut down.</strong><br />
Once the computer restarts check if you are getting the same error message. If the error message exists, perform Method 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Perform <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system/windows-8-stuck-in-automatic-repair-loop/ba3cbe68-4595-4e2f-8687-04375dc8b93f#">
Startup repair</a></strong><br />
I would suggest you to perform a startup repair using Windows 8 bootable DVD or USB drive and check if that helps.<br />
a) Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.<br />
b) In the ‘Windows setup’ page select the ‘language to install’, ‘Time and currency format’ and the ‘keyboard or input method’ and click on ‘next’.<br />
c) Click on ‘Repair your computer’ and select ‘Troubleshoot’.&nbsp;<br />
d) Click on ‘Advanced options’ and select ‘Automatic Repair’ and select the operating system.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 mail app&#58; Your iCloud settings are out-of-date</h2>
                    <p>Hello&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really hoping some smart soul out there has a solution to this head scratcher. I'm using a brand new MS Surface Book, Windows 10. On the Mail app I can't get my iCloud email to work. I get either the error above after attempting to sync, or this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We're having a problem downloading messages. Make sure you have a connection and your account info is correct, and then try again. Error code: 0x801901f5"</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ID and password are correct. I've spent 2 days removing and adding my email, reinstalling the app (used PowerShell), Googling for help and checking config settings, access via Windows Firewall (I'm not an AVG or Windows Defender user) and making sure
 my privacy settings allow access to Mail and Calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No joy. Does anyone have a fix?</p>

            <p>Fixed it! Here's what worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My iCloud email is protected with Apple's two step verification, so I&nbsp;needed an 'app-specific password' to sign into an app that's not provided by Apple, like Windows Mail&nbsp;which doesn't support entering verification codes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was pretty simple in the end (took 4 days of hunting down the answer though!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the steps (I did this via my MS Surface Book laptop):</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>sign into Apple ID with your iCloud email and password: <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage</a></li><li>if you're a two step verification user, your device (for me, my iPhone) will give you a verification code to enter after you put in your iCloud email password</li><li>in the 'Security' section, hit 'Edit'</li><li>in the 'App-Specific Passwords' section, hit 'Generate Password...'</li><li>enter a label for this password (I typed 'Windows 10 mail app')</li><li>hit 'Create'</li><li>an app-specific password will be created for you, in this format (case sensitive)
<strong>tmah-jdbq-rdby-gdes</strong></li><li>copy the password and hit 'Done'</li><li>now open up Windows Mail &gt; settings (cog icon) &gt; manage accounts &gt; select your iCloud account and enter your app-specific password then 'Save' -<em> do</em><em> not enter your iCloud email password, you just need to input the app-specific password</em></li></ul>
<p>Your iCloud email should now start to appear. Though I spent days fiddling around with the config settings, it seems Windows Mail pre-set config is correct, so you shouldn't need to change the incoming or outgoing email server settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Incoming email server:</strong> imap.mail.me.com:993:1</p>
<p><strong>Outgoing (SMTP) email server:</strong> smtp.mail.me.com:587:1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps someone. A word of warning though. If you change your primary Apple ID password, all your app-specific passwords will be automatically revoked and you'll need to generate a new one for any apps you want to keep using.</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>In regards to the transformer, yes you will want to order a new one. To do so, you will want to contact

</a>to place an order.&nbsp; </li><li>As for regions, yes your Xbox 360 from the US will not be able to play games from Brazil, due to region restrictions.&nbsp;
</li><li>To your last question, you will want to&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/change-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change the Region of your Xbox LIVE Account</a>. The steps to do so are in that support article.&nbsp;

Let us know if you have anymore questions, and have fun in Brazil! :D</p>

 If you don't have another account like this set up or don't have the password to it, you'll need to log into the built-in Administrator account. In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting
 up. This will get you to the right menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here. Once in Safe Mode, you will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode. At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows.<br />
<br />
If you have XP Pro or Media Center and were using the built-in Administrator account for your regular work and it is therefore the only user account on the system, there are ways to change the password for that account to a blank. Microsoft doesn't permit us
 to tell you how in these forums. Their house, their rules. Use Google or ask a local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place).</span>

<h3> ultraviolet1106  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dexion Evicus Glitch - Dawnstar Side</h2>
                    
<p>As with other posts, I have an issue whereby Dexion attacks me in the castle when I need to talk to him. &nbsp;All fixes mentioned do not work for me and I do not have a previously saved game to go back to.</p>

<p>The recent patch has not fixed the issue and it is frustrating to say the least. &nbsp;Does anyone have any new ideas I can try, please only post if you are talking about the Dawnstar side.</p>

<p>This glitch really has been going on too long.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I don't even know what glitch you're referring to. However, I can tell you that new Bethesda patches won't fix a lot on existening save files -- if anything, they tend to add more bugs to them.

<p>Patches "never" fix existing problems that have been saved. If you start "fresh" as in from the very beginning, you will see the corrections that the patch fixed. The beginning is where your in the wagon heading for Helgen. Not in the save that you did when
 you were level 1 from the past game. Sometimes your really lucky when a patch doesn't completely glitch out your present game. I know this sounds mean but, I learned it from my own experience. I started all over from level 68 to a brand new level 1 and so
 far at level 5 nothing wierd has happened.</p>

<p>I had same issue, I think is used a calm spell. Also I think once you down him (on his knees recovering) you can initiate dialogue long enough to update the quest. He will probably continue being hostile though. Hope this helps

<p>OHHHH, he's talking about the mothpriest glitch in Dawnguard. He wrote Dawnstar so the closest I thought was the Dreamstride save glitch.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There are only 2 ways I now know of to fix the mothpriest glitch from the Dawnguard side: use the master illusion spell or load an earlier save.

    <title>Can&#39;t access my external hard drives because of BitLocker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rae &#58;&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t access my external hard drives because of BitLocker</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Dell XPS 13 9360 with Windows 10 Home edition. Got my motherboard replaced recently. After that, I would always get asked for the BitLocker recovery key every time I start up my laptop. I got annoyed so I searched online for a solution. I found
 one saying to turn off the BitLocker encryption. I did that and thought that it was successful because the request for recovery key didn't appear upon start up anymore. However, when I plugged in my external hard drive I couldn't open it because it was asking
 for a BitLocker recovery key. Plugged in my two other external hard drives (one of them wasn't even password protected) and got asked for recovery keys too. I tried to use the recovery key for my laptop but that didn't work for any of the three. Note that
 I was able to access all of them before I turned off the encryption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searched online for solutions.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">First thing I tried was to enable the encryption again. But every time I click the button, it would always say "Something went wrong. Try again later."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1c95cc1-2e66-424b-b586-72001151f702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1c95cc1-2e66-424b-b586-72001151f702" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Next, I followed <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/article/ph/en/phdhs1/SLN297814/bitlocker-prompting-for-recovery-key-after-motherboard-replacement?lang=EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dell</a>'s tip (turn off BitLocker, activate TPM, then switch Bitlocker on again) thinking it suited my case. However, the TPM in the guide pictures was an earlier version of my TPM which is 2.0. The settings were quite different. I wasn't sure which ones I
 should click so I just enabled it without bothering to change the other settings. I thought I only had turn on the BitLocker and my problem would be solved but when my laptop restarted, I couldn't find the setting for turning it back on in my control panel
 anymore. Should I change the TPM settings?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56bf953b-5072-49ca-a779-9cc3c12c6a0f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56bf953b-5072-49ca-a779-9cc3c12c6a0f" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I don't know what to do anymore. I still cannot open my external hard drives. I tried reaching out to Dell but they said they don't have control over BitLocker issues and I should ask Microsoft for assistance. This whole issue is confusing me because:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1. I don't ever remember actively encrypting any of my computers and drives with BitLocker. I have never saved any recovery key. How did all these happen?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2. I am only using a Windows 10 Home edition. From what I've read, BitLocker is only available on Pro and Enterprise so how come my devices are encrypted and I'm being asked for keys?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Additionally, my old HP laptop running on Windows 7 Home is experiencing the same issue. It was reformatted about a month ago. After that, I couldn't open my external hard drives there anymore because I don't have the keys. I didn't pay much attention to
 it before because I wasn't planning on using my old laptop any longer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at wit's end now. I got three external hard drives (4.5TB in total) that are encrypted by BitLocker and neither of my two laptops can access them. Somebody help me. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business &#40;mac&#41; won&#39;t stop breaking up conversations into new threads, and now I can&#39;t access the new thread&#33;</h2>
                    <p>(I'm not talking about the setting under Preferences for "show Conversations in separate windows.")</p>
<p>
</p><p>For no reason I can discern, Skype is still arbitrarily breaking up conversations by starting new threads. There was no significant time gap between these messages. (this has been driving me crazy for months, will this ever be fixed? But that's not the point
 of this post...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a new bug related to this: I can't access the new thread!</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c995ca22-769b-4a5c-a6f3-e44470af7d60?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c995ca22-769b-4a5c-a6f3-e44470af7d60?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click, or double click, the new "no I didn't" thread, it opens the old one where I asked "Did you message me?" Couldn't have been more than a minute or two between me asking and her responding, so Idk why it even started the new thread. Doesn't matter,
 cause I can't access it! </p>
<p>
</p><p>It might have to do with the Skype integration into Outlook 365 web app. I got an alert in my browser in Outlook for a message I got yesterday, which is why I asked if she messaged me. It must be all out of sync, but Skype CANT be removed from Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its bad enough that Skype is scattering our convos all over the place, but this is even worse. I at least need to be able to open the new threads.</p>

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm well aware this is an issue that has affected many people - I'm only posting this after trying out all the fixes I could find short of a complete Win10 Reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The Issue</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't open the settings app. Additionally, I am also regularly unable to use the search function or the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also receive the following message in the 'closing apps' section when restarting, signing out or shutting down. "Task Host Window: Task Host is stopping background tasks. (\Microsoft\Windows\Plug and Play\Device Install Reboot Required )"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solutions Previously attempted:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the <em>SFC scannow</em> and <em>DISM Restorehealth</em> functions, neither detected or fixed any problems. I have tried the online windows store/settings troubleshooter, and the Win10 inbuilt troubleshooter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another post recommended updating my motherboard BIOS, so I have done that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also created another local user - settings app didn't work in that user either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System Information:</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 Home; Version 1709 (OS Build 16299.125)</p>
<p>My computer is a Lenovo Y700-34ISH Desktop (ideacentre)</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated!<br />

            Thank you so much Bruce!&nbsp; I have tried for so long to find that silly recycle bin and had no idea where it went and how to get it back.&nbsp; I was not able to get it from properties and the desktop tab which was the only way I knew how to possibly get it back.&nbsp;
 But going to the link you provided, it worked!&nbsp; Thanks again.

<h2>            Detailed Network Statistics</h2>
                    <p>First of all there is nothing wrong with my internet connection I have run a speed test using the same RJ45 cable from my desktop PC as I used for the XBOX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When running a speedtest using the speedtest.net website I get a stable 20ms ping and about 13Mbs download speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run a "detailed network statistics" from the xbox I get a RIDICULOUS 0.40Mbs download speed &amp; 23% packet loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please explain why this is happening it's so frustrating????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also got a NAT Type Open.&nbsp;</p>

            I would advise a hard reset, hold your power button for up to 10 seconds and unplug the console for at least 1 minute once it is off, if this doesn't clear up the issue, try a different ethernet cable, I advise CAT6, you do have a decently low speed (no
 offense) Most people around here including myself have 100mbps+. Also, you may try the following:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbanswers/forum/xba_console/guide-troubleshoot-and-fix-packet-loss-issues-with/8a671a01-2463-4415-be87-c9718d1f0ffd">click

<p>That is a big disparity between the two.&nbsp; Most of the times, its within the levels of tolerance, knowing that you're testing against different services, but this seems like there is a different issue than just regular networking variation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you describe your basic setup?&nbsp; You say it's wired, which is good for better performance, but what is it hooked to, do you have a router and modem, or all in one? What make/model of equipment do you have? What sort of connection do you have to your ISP?
 ect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd also do a reboot of your router and Xbox at the same time, fully powering down and unplugging the Xbox, and not booting it back up until the router is fully back up and re-established connection to your ISP.</p>

<p>Yea thanks for the reply I only have ADSL2+ down here in Australia... I have actually just done a full console reset and the download speed is now the same as the speedtest.net website which is great but the packet loss is still around 20%</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think all standard cables with Modem/Routers are Cat5e</p>

<p>Well the speed issue has resolved now after doing a console reset and uninstalling everything etc.</p>

<p>The network test on the xbox one isn't the most reliable,never has been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Always tells me i'm getting a faster connection than I actually have.</p>
<p>You said you use speedtest.net,you will get more reliable results from broadband speed test sites like them on your pc/laptop than you will using the one on the xbox one.</p>

<p>I hear what you are saying but the packet loss part of the test seem's to be pretty accurate especially when in game...is it worth putting the XBOX in the DMZ?</p>

<p>Be aware that the Speedtest.net website tries to locate the closest Speedtest Server to your actual vicinity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the Xbox seems to always test against servers based in Seattle Washington.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to manually set a Speedtest server that is in or near Redmond/Seattle.&nbsp;</p>

            The online pass was actually something EA tried to institute at one point. At this point they are discontinued but you should be able to claim it from the in-game store and it'll show as an add-on in ready to install for that game (it is free) and you
 should be good to go. If not, you'll need to contact EA for assistance.

I tried to do it that way, (from the game) and when tried to go into the in-games store it said you need to connect to xbox live yo access content.

    <title>sppsvc.exe adds 78&#37; longer boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slicedtoad  say:</h3>
<h2>            sppsvc.exe adds 78&#37; longer boot</h2>
                    First of all, my config (the relevant bits):
<div>i5-2500k @ 4.4ghz</div>
<div>8GB 1600mhz ram</div>
<div>128GB Crucial M4 SSD boot drive (windows and specific programs installed here)</div>
<div>1TB WD Caviar Black (users folder, other programs, documents/pictures/downloads/etc)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>MS Programs (other programs shouldn't be involved with&nbsp;sppsvc.exe I assume):</div>
<div>Windows 7 x64 Professional</div>
<div>Office&nbsp;Professional&nbsp;Plus</div>
<div>Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate</div>
<div>(all the above are registered with product keys provided by my college)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I first installed windows my boot time was basically instant. I never expected it to stay that way but I also didn't expect it to take over a minute, which it now does.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To calculate boot time (from power on to&nbsp;everything&nbsp;loaded),&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;using Soluto. It's still in beta but works reasonable well for a boot&nbsp;analyser.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyway, it was telling me that sppsvc.exe was adding 25 seconds. I assumed it was making an error and checked it by disabling sppsvc.exe (just temporarily). My boot time went from 1:02 to 0:37, that's 25 seconds, 78% more time, just for a ms product activator
 service! (0:25 is 78% of 0:37)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since all documentation on sppsvc.exe&nbsp;strongly&nbsp;advises against disabling it, I assume I'll need to find a better way to decrease it's impact.</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
                </div>

<p>i recently started playing gta 4 and eflc again and wanted to beat the 3 games all over again. i have gta 4 on disc and downloaded the other 2 episodes when they came out, as it turns out i can only play TBoGT but not TLAD, i looked for them in the marketplace
 and only found TBoGT but no TLAD.<br />
TLAD also appears in my download history but the error message 800700E8 appears, after all that i tried using my PC to download it to the Xbox but it says it isn't available in my region, i bought the game around 4 years ago when it came out and now i'm frustrated
 that i can't play my game and feel cheated out of my money :/ Help would be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Note: I live in Colombia</p>

<p>Hello. &nbsp;I'm afraid not all content can always be available for download. &nbsp;However, from what you described, it sounds like you already have the license? &nbsp;What might work is making a copy on a USB from a friend who has the game. &nbsp;You may still be able to
 play it that way, even if it's not officially available. :)</p>

<h2>            Context menus don&#39;t stay open on right-click</h2>
                    In some, but not all, Windows Explorer folders, when I right-click on a file or folder, the context menu opens briefly but then closes before I can choose an option. I can't find any rhyme or reason for which folders do it. I notice it most in one particular
 folder that I use regularly, but it also happens in other folders. I am running Windows 8.1 on a Dell Inspiron laptop.&nbsp;

            <p>It is most likely an issue with a shell extension. A shell extension is what lets other programs add their own options to the right-click menus.&nbsp; For example, all my right-click menus have this "Open in Notepad++" option, which came with my new Notepad++
 software.</p>

<p>
</p><p>A recently added program on your computer might be causing the issue; such as a shell extension option that crashes when it tries to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you recall adding any new or changed programs to your computer around the time this started happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, how long ago did it start?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have actually been putting up with it for quite awhile (a few months maybe?), using keyboard shortcuts or opening programs manually.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I did check in the programs and features list and uninstalled some things, testing after each to see if it was fixed. My first suspect was Dropbox. It was showing on the context menus that work but not on the ones that don't. Then I moved on to Fast
 Track Schedule 10, Quicken, Amazon Cloud Player, TurboTax, and Spotify - testing after each uninstall. All had been installed or updated within the past two months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is it safe to assume that updates from major software companies are less likely to cause such problems? I have updates from Microsft, Apple, and Adobe in that time period. And what about driver updates? Could they be suspect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tried to see if I could work around by moving files from an affected folder to a new folder. The context menus worked, briefly, then started misbehaving again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions you can offer will be appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's called "ShellExView" and lets you see these shell extensions and selectively disable or enable them.&nbsp; It can be great for troubleshooting the issue.&nbsp; Try turning off anything you don't need or recognize, or use it to narrow down what could be the cause
 quickly.</p>

            <p>I used the ShellExView tool to identify the culprit: Stuffit Deluxe 2010. I uninstalled, re-installed and updated the program but the problem persists. What do I do now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were only 7 non-microsoft context menus in the list. Stuffit was the only one that fixed the problem by disabling its context menu. But I use the program regularly and would like to have the context menus work. What can I do now?</p>

    <title>Left Thumbstick glitch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr soyaku  say:</h3>
<h2>            Left Thumbstick glitch</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason beyond me, my LS stopped working completely in Halo 4. All other games it's fine, but Halo 4 it just doesn't work anymore. What's the deal here? Controller is fine in other games. I prefer LS to sprint and it is a huge inconvenience to switch
 button layouts just to be able to use it again.</p>

<p><strong>What I've tried:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Re-installing Halo 4 </li><li>Restarting the X-Box </li><li>New batteries for controller </li><li>Other controller </li></ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> It ain't my controller.</p>
<p>So, what gives?</p>

<p>I have the same problem only it started AFTER I replaced the left thumbstick. Now the click is intermittent. It only happens in Halo games where left click is sprint. Rarely when you click it will STAY sprinting. Most of the time you have to HOLD DOWN the
 stick to stay sprinting. Sometimes it won't work at all. This all happens during the same game play. I replaced the left thumbstick because it was old and wouldn't return all the way to center. Now the left click won't work properly. I've tried 3 different
 brand new stick components from 2 different suppliers and the same thing still happens. &nbsp;All the new sticks check out on the multimeter. Does anybody have any clue?</p>

<p>OK, first things first. I've noticed this happening, but it seems to happen in games that are a bit laggy. With me, it tends to act as if I'm constantly holding the L-thumbstick down (BTW, I click once&nbsp; to sprint and I don't have to hold it to stay sprinting...
 don't know why some of yours wouldn't act that way?) Anyway, there are some games where I can sprint, stop for several seconds and then, without clicking the thumbstick again, as soon as I move I begin sprinting again. Normally&nbsp;I only have to stop for a fraction
 of a second for it to 'reset' and moving again resumes normal movement speed. It is actually pretty rare that it 'sticks', but it does happen enough that I've wondered what was&nbsp;going on&nbsp;with it. As I said though, it seems to happen in laggy games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-</p>
<p>I can tell you this however. I have a new controller that I got for my b/d... it's only a couple months old and using L thumbstick works fine for any other game(s). It only seems to 'stick' in Halo 4 MP and even then,&nbsp;it doesn't happen consistently. Also,
 clicking it again in an attempt to 'un-stick' it&nbsp;(even repeatedly) doesn't correct the issue either. I'm not convinced, in my experience, that it's a controller issue. That's about all I can add, don't know if it'll help or not.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I do have to ask though. For those of you who have replaced thumbsticks, where do you find the replacements? Also, are there any special steps needed to calibrate the new thumbstick after you replace it? IDK&nbsp;if I'm just hard on thumbsticks or what, but I
 seem to need a new&nbsp;controller pretty regularly just because of drifting / sticking thumbsticks. I probably have 4 controllers sitting here that are perfectly good working controllers&nbsp;except for that. If you guys could give me any info on finding replacement
 thumbsticks and/or any tips on how to replace them, I'd really appreciate it!</p>

<p>From what I know all you have to do is go to either eBay or Amazon and order an OEM part and replace it yourself... although if the thumbstick is loose and wont re-position itself then its the mechanical part that needs to be replaced and that is a real
 pain because you actually have to solder that piece on the motherboard...</p>

    <title>External Hard disk is not recognized after Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            External Hard disk is not recognized after Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Original title: XP Pro wants to install driver for external hard drive which was Plug and Play</p>
<p>I believe that&nbsp;using Windows Update may be causing problems (unintentinally or not) for Windows XP users.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a series of crashes with an older computer and&nbsp;reinstalling the XP Pro operating system, I discovered that MS Money would only install&nbsp;if it was performed prior to any&nbsp;Windows Updates.&nbsp; (planned obsolescense?) The issue had to do with the discontinuation
 of the registry file&nbsp;AUTORUN.INF in favor of some new and improved&nbsp;file via Windows Update.&nbsp; Before updates, the file existed and I could install MS money.&nbsp; After updates, the AUTORUN.INF file disappeared from the registry.</p>
<p>Now I have encountered a new problem,&nbsp;and I believe it is also a result of Windows Update.&nbsp; My external IDE hard drive, which worked perfectly before on this (newer) computer,&nbsp;is no longer recognized and wants to reinstall the driver.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that this is a Plug and Play device, and no drivers were required prior to the updates.&nbsp; I read somewhere in my many attempts to find a solution that the MS Plug and Play system has been replaced with a Universal version of this function (UPNP?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is on a newer, replacement computer, which&nbsp;did not come with&nbsp;a copy of the Windows XP Pro OS, and&nbsp;I cannot simply reformat the hard drive and start all over again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else encountered this, and if so, have you found a solution?</p>
<p>Duplicate Post Continued -</p>
Where has my external hard drive gone?
<div>
<p>I am running XP Pro on a Dell Optiplex PC with all the current Windows Updates (SP3, .Net4, etc.) and last month I added an external USB IDE hard drive. the hard drive enclosure is from MASSCOOL, and I used a 250GB Seagate Barracuda7800. The drive worked
 perfectly until this last week or so. I had Windows Update set to automaticlly update critical and security updates.</p>
<p>The external hard drive has disappeared from "my computer". I have tried plugging and unplugging into different USB ports, restarting the computer, but keep getting the "New Hardware Wizard telling me that new hardware has been detected and that I need to
 install the neccessary driver.</p>
<p>The problem is that Seagate provides no driver for this hard drive, as it is supposed to be (and was until now) recognized by the Plug and Play software of Windows XP. The Hard Drive Enclosure came with a mini CD, but this only contains software for using
 the unit as a back-up, not for storage.</p>
<p>I cannot fathom this sudden change other than to believe that something in the Windows Updates that were recently installed have revised the command structure, registry files, or the drivers themselves.</p>
<p>I know this is possible, because I saw what happened to any program that relied on the AUTO.INF file that was originally a part of XP. It resulted in programs like Microsoft Money and older versions of MS Office no longer being able to be installed by those
 of us who are not "technically enlightened"</p>
<p>Am I out there in left field, or have others encountered similar difficulties? And does anyone know how to solve this dilemma?</p>

<h3> winstoncollier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, version 1511, 10586 installation has failed &#34;something happened&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have followed the instructions in many messages here, I downloaded the ISO from TechNet, made sure it was the 64 bit version, mounted the ISO and ran setup.exe from there.&nbsp; This is a fully functioning 10240 Win10 Pro 64 bit system that was installed to&nbsp;
 an empty hard drive a couple months ago.&nbsp; I have not had any issues with it, except for the continued failure to update (via automatic update) to 10586.&nbsp; So I tired the manual process, and it goes through the analysis, it downloads 100% of the updates, then
 does the update to 100%, goes to the screen where it would usually reboot, gives me the message about rebooting and then...&nbsp;I get is the small grey popup "Something Happened" with the message "Windows 10 Installation has failed".&nbsp;Damned uninformative. And
 yes I am running on an administrator account, and running the setup.exe as administrator.&nbsp; I checked the administrative events custom view&nbsp;in the event viewer, nothing there.&nbsp; Looked at the "setup" in the Windows logs, nothing there.&nbsp; The last thing in the
 Apps log is the popup apparently, but no errors. So no help there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A scratch install is not a favorable option - I don't have that kind of time to waste reinstalling tons of apps on something that works now and should simply upgrade without an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone post something that works to remedy this Microsoft problem?</p>
