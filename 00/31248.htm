<h2>            windows paint program has lost its &#39;crop&#39; function and I can&#39;t seem to get it back</h2>
                    <p><span>Can anyone tell me how to get my 'crop' function back with my 'paint' program that is part of my Windows 7 home edition on my Sony Vaio laptop computer?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don't have ANY idea what happened to it as I just went to crop a downloaded picture and the 'crop' function was not available to use and has not been since.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I rebooted my computer but there is still no 'crop' function with my windows paint program.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I'm at a total loss as to the 'why' of this.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for any help on this.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p><span>I may have resolved the issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I think the white area under what we 'paste' to the paint program was extended all the way out, or some such situation and I don't understand it as of yet but when I made this white area just a small dot before I 'pasted' a picture I had no problem with
 the 'crop' function.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don't understand this but that is as much 'awareness' of the 'cause - effect' that I have been able to discover so far.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I just never have 'lost' the crop function before and was left not knowing what would cause this.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I'm still not clear on this but I do now have my 'crop' function back and am just thankful and relieved.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for the assistance and over time perhaps I will have a better understanding of how something such as this could happen.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 vs. Windows 7&#59; concerns about the direction Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john r moffett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 vs. Windows 7&#59; concerns about the direction Microsoft is going in</h2>
                    <p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have concerns about the direction Microsoft is taking the Windows operating system. Windows 8 was not a viable desktop operating system, and the speed at which Microsoft rolled
 out Windows 10 as a replacement makes it apparent that they got the message from their customers. I would like to start a productive discussion about how Microsoft could make improvements to Windows 10 that would make me and millions of others willing to update
 to the new version. Hopefully Microsoft will get the message again. Here are some of my main concerns that I know are shared by many other Windows users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Windows 10 is not as attractive looking as Windows 7. It is just too flat and plain looking. The interface alone is enough to make me avoid Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Users can’t change how it looks into something they might like better due to reduced customization options. If you like a 2D, flat look then you won’t mind, but I much prefer
 Aero over the current Metro/desktop hybrid.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Many users have complained about updates being forced on them, especially because some have actually made computers unusable. We should be allowed to control what we download
 and install if we want to.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. The Metro (winrt) paradigm is slow in many areas, such as launching so-called apps, which are distinct from real programs or applications.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Speaking of apps, they were originally intended for phones. There is no reason to design a computer operating system around apps. But of course MS is interested in selling
 apps through the app store built into the start menu, so that is why they have spent a lot of effort on making Windows 10 app-centric. This is a big downside as far as I am concerned. The limited functionality of apps makes them useful for small, limited devices,
 but it makes no sense on a real desktop computer. </span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">6. Windows 10 has more data collection/transmission (telemetry and tracking) than all other versions put together. I don’t want to use something that’s chewing up my bandwidth
 for activities that do not benefit me. Microsoft needs to be very upfront about all of the telemetry and tracking features, what they do in detail, and allow users to opt out after reading the detailed descriptions. If it all is truly for fixing problems,
 great, but that does not seem to be the only reason for the telemetry and tracking. But of course we don’t really know because Microsoft is being very vague on the subject.
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">7. I’m not allowed to control or even know anything about the vast majority of this collection/transmission process, and this reduces trust.
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">8. I don’t like being advertised to or given suggestions for things to buy in my operating system. Offer a store and let me choose to use it or not. Any store built into Windows
 needs to be something I have to open, not something on the start menu and open by default.
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">9. Many things that I use in Windows 7 have been removed or replaced with less capable versions. Things like WMC and DVD maker.
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">10. Microsoft’s take it or leave it attitude where they are going in a different direction (mobile computing/app store OS) and there isn’t anything the customers can do to change
 that, despite the fact that the vast majority of the Microsoft user base use desktop computers or laptops without touchscreens. Windows 10 is still not as good on desktop computers as Windows 7, so unless you have an urge to have a new buggy operating system,
 there isn’t any compelling reason to switch. However, MS is making the upgrade harder and harder to avoid if you leave automatic updates turned on in Windows 7.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">11. Microsoft's inability to recognize the sheer number of people who want a choice is a problem, for example the Aero interface, a choice that MSFT could easily provide in a
 very robust way. Why didn’t they improve on Windows 7 by offering both modes and themes? You could have the desktop mode with Aero themes and all the customization options in Windows 7, or the Metro mode for mobile devices, with its own themes. Users should
 have endless options for tweaking and changing every aspect of how Windows looks. Microsoft should be expanding choices, not limiting them.
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">12. Upgrades that do not respect my choice of default programs. I set my PC up the way I want it, not the way MSFT dictates. There are more than a dozen locations on the MSDN
 library where MSFT explicitly warns developers about respecting the User's choice. Take a peek at ShutdownWindowsEx or BroadcastSystemMessage. So why doesn’t MSFT respect my choice of browser?</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">13. Windows 10 brings me nothing that I can’t already do with Windows 7. I still use Windows 7 Ultimate, and Windows 10 pro seems like a big downgrade for me. I don’t see anything
 that would make me want Windows 10. At best it does what I already do like open my programs. At worse it looks like it was designed for small mobile devices and focuses too much on apps. There is not a single thing in 10 that will help me be any more productive,
 allow me more entertainment, or be any more fulfilling on my PC. Just because it’s the latest version does not make it better, just newer (and buggier).</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">14. Windows 10 has undergone surprisingly little change during its lifecycle, at least as far as most users can tell. Less than most other versions in the same timeframe. Windows
 10 today looks, acts, works<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>almost</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>exactly same as it did last January
 and it’s probably how it will be next January. Maybe it is a bit more stable, but forced updates still cause problems for lots of users by breaking things that were working.
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">15. Adding a phone based operating system to a desktop one was a poor design decision, and it is not too late to have two independent operating system development paths, one
 for desktops and one for mobile devices. Whoever thought it was a good idea to mash them together was just plain wrong.
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">16. It appears that Windows 10 was designed to run on older hardware and low spec systems. That’s great if you are running it on a phone or have an XP laptop from a decade ago,
 but what’s the motivation now for hardware manufacturers to push out faster products? Very powerful computers are becoming more affordable every year, but now Windows doesn’t need any of that increased horsepower.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">17. The default Microsoft online account. I don’t like that at all. I know you can shut it off, but I shouldn’t have to do that.
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">18. Windows 10, like it’s even more problematic predecessor, Windows 8, is an experiment, and the users are guinea pigs. The forced updates take virtually all control away from
 users, and so far the security rational for doing this does not seem to be panning out. Many Windows 7 users who don’t want the upgrade are shutting off automatic updates to avoid a forced Windows 10 installation. That makes for a poorer security situation,
 not an improved one. </span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">19. Very sparse information on what the OS is doing at any given time. Some people don’t care what their OS is doing as long as they can play Angry Birds. Others care a lot because
 they are technically oriented tinkerers. People who wanted their computer to be like a reliable toaster bought Macs, people who wanted a computer they could endlessly customize and tweak bought Windows computers. Not so much anymore. Microsoft is being very
 tight lipped about many updates, for example, a number of recent updates for all versions of Windows only say “an update to Windows Update”, or “makes the transition to Windows 10 smoother”. They might as well have said: “it’s supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!”
 Lots of other aspects of the OS functionality are hidden completely from users. There need to be options for getting more information about what the OS is doing, and why. Many of the concerns over Windows 10 are due to this opaqueness on Microsoft’s part.
 A much more open and honest explanation of various updates, and functions such as telemetry and tracking, would have gone a long way toward heading off much of the backlash against Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">20. I don’t use Microsoft browsers. I use Opera, which is based on Chrome. I don’t care about Edge. I also don’t want or need Cortana because I already have Dragon Naturally
 Speaking Medical version which does what I need. I don’t use apps on my desktop computers, so I don’t need the app page or app store. I realize others might want some of these features, but they are not an improvement over Windows 7 for most desktop users
 who have different software preferences. </span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">21. Lack of a paid-for Windows 10 Ultimate version (like the Enterprise version) is another glaring issue. Until MS comes out with an ad/app store/Metro/telemetry/tracking/forced
 updates-free consumer version that I can buy, I will be sticking with Windows 7 Ultimate. Microsoft would solve almost all of their problems by updating Windows 7 Ultimate with new features and improvements, including improved security features, and releasing
 it for sale at the original price ($299). This would allow people like me to happily pay and upgrade, and it would be another nice revenue stream. As it is now, they are offering me nothing that I would want, and lots of things that I really, really don’t
 want, in Windows 10 Pro. Maybe if they make a Windows 10 Ultimate version that consumers can buy, I will have another look. But right now, I have made sure all of my computers do not upgrade to Windows 10 automatically.
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It is not about going forward or backward, it is about giving users more choices, more information, more control, and more respect. That’s it in a nutshell.&nbsp;</span></p>

 click agree/accept/install/etc. Someone who has gone through the process can verify that.</p>

</p><p>However the part about turning off windows updates is undoubtedly true. I've done it already myself on Windows 10 just because I got absolutely fed up with it deciding when to install new updates and builds and dictating when I'm allowed to reboot. Sorry
 Microsoft, but your goal of delivering reliable updates and security fixes is backfiring at least for me and these other people who are simply opting to disable the service instead of play by your rules. I'll reenable windows update as soon as it's reverted
 to the old functionality.</p>

            <p>I narrowly avoided a forced upgrade by unplugging my machine.&nbsp; The pop-up appeared and I clicked on "LATER" but it started up immediately.&nbsp; My only option was to unplug it.&nbsp; Then I had to wait for it to do a whole bunch of stuff when I turned it back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't count the number of times in the last few days the pop-up keeps appearing.&nbsp; But I simply click on the upper right corner immediately and that seems to take care of it for the moment....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to leave it on to get the security updates for MS7...not sure if that is a good idea.</p>

            <p>Yes, one of my Win7 machines here got stuck on the "let's get started" page in Windows Update because I had not turned off auto updates soon enough. It required that I use GWX Control Panel to remove it. When I did I found two security updates that I could
 not get to because Windows Update was literally stuck on the Windows 10 update page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has openly admitted they were going to make it more difficult for people with auto updates turned on to avoid the upgrade. So for now the only way to avoid it completely is to turn off updates, and then on the second Tuesday of every month manually check
 what new updates are out, and only install the ones that are for security.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>OK Gage, so you only want more of the same stuff that MS has already put in Windows 10. Why do you want live tiles on the desktop? I feel like I am at Yahoo when I look at live tiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say you would like a Windows 10 Ultimate version. Would that be something you pay for to avoid telemetry, tracking, and forced updates? Businesses are not going to accept those things on their company computers, so the Enterprise edition is going to
 allow all things to be turned off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why would you want that if the current version of Windows 10 is so good?</p>

            <p>Not sure what you are talking about... I installed MS10 on my computer for a whole day.&nbsp; I spent a few hours trying to get it to look like I wanted it - couldn't really figure out how to get rid of those ugly useless tiles.&nbsp; Got hung up on something and
 decided to re-boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then asked me to log in.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have never logged into any computer I have owned.&nbsp; EVER.&nbsp; Not sure what happened with MS7, but likely a geek friend simply turned that function off&nbsp; for me.&nbsp; As I have commented elsewhere - I do not log into my refrigerator,
 my toaster, my air conditioner, my hot water heater, or any other APPLIANCE in my home.&nbsp; Why would I need or want to log into my computer?&nbsp; IT IS AN APPLIANCE.&nbsp; Perfectly understandable in an office that one would want security, but at HOME?&nbsp; That is a function
 you should have to turn ON, not go and look for in some obscure place to turn off....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I immediately took it&nbsp; back over to the Geek Squad and they put back MS7 on it (as it was before).&nbsp; My entire experience was working with MS10 for a single day.&nbsp; It was an unfortunate one....</p>

<p>Every time I turn my wireless headset on, I get disconnected from Xbox Live. I use the official Microsoft Wireless Headset. I've had it for about 4 months and this just started happening. Also I have another 360 in my house downstairs that I occasionally
 use/sync with my headset.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey there Cry!<br />If the wireless headset you are using have an digital transmitter that is close by to your Xbox, try moving it as far away from your console as possible. Also, make sure it is not located directly in between your Xbox and the router.<br /><br />If this did not improve anything. Try change the wireless channel on your router manually to 11. To do so:<br />Access your router web-config page and go to wireless settings. <strong>Channel</strong> should be found under this category.<br /><br />Post back and let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>So this problem is starting to occur for me... when I turn on my wireless headset in a Multiplayer Match (I can do it on the dashboard or on a game menu)... Xbox Live crashes. When I go to test connection after this occurs it says that I have no wireless
 adapter connected to my console but I have the new Xbox which has it inside. I was wondering if anyone has found a fix for this.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem as well, with the Xbox Slim saying I need an Ethernet Adapter whenever my mic turns off or disconnects, it's really frustrating as it requires me to remove the hard drive, test the connection, reconnect the hard drive and test
 again for it to work. I've had my Slim since January and it's just started happening, also I am using the official Wireless Mic.</p>

<p>The same thing with me! When I turn on my Wireless Headset/Bluetooth in the middle of a Live Session I get disconnected from Xbox Live, so when I want to turn on my headset I have to leave to the main menu so I can turn it on. When I am on my other Xbox
 this doesn't happen to me. I've contacted Microsoft, but they were confused about it, so I didn't get it resolved. One more thing though, I don't know if this would help, but it's not when I turn it on, It's when it connects to the controller or Xbox after
 you turn it on.</p>

<h2>            Connecting Logitech Speakers</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i am using Asus N46VM. I am trying to connect my Logitech Mini Boombox, i can connect it to my sister's Macbook Pro and it is so easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Atheros Bluetooth Suite, i reinstalled the driver and i could connect to it, but when i am going to use it, it says the device is disconnected. I cannot connect it back again so i removed it, when i tried to connect, it couldn't find the device
 though i've already set it in Discovery Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do? Getting so frustrated. No offense but setting bluetooth on windows 7 seems harder than in Macintosh.</p>

            <p>Hello Dewi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>I understand that you are unable to use the Logitech Bluetooth enabled speakers on Windows 7, but I would like to know more about the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you able to connect and use any other Bluetooth device on this computer?</li><li>Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li></ol>
<p>The issue may arise due to incompatibility of the Bluetooth driver with the Logitech speaker. So, I would suggest you to try the following diagnostic steps to know the root cause, apply the fixes and check if the issue persists:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to follow the steps provided in the following link to troubleshoot issues with Bluetooth devices:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-problems-with-Bluetooth-enabled-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot problems with Bluetooth enabled devices</a></strong></p>
<p>(<strong>Note: </strong>The article also applies to Windows 7)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If Method 1 does not help, try to run the hotfix available in the following link and check for the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth devices do not work correctly on a computer that is running Windows 7</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980396/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980396/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>

<h2>            Laptop Extremely Slow. Task Manager shows 100&#37; disk usage. Takes ages to boot</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a dell laptop.</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron 15R n5010</p>
<p>I have been using Windows 8.1 for a very long time and i haven't faced any problem till now. But about 2-3 days ago some problems started to occur.</p>
<p>When i start the laptop it takes about 40-50 min(after entering my login credentials) for just the desktop to appear. Even then the laptop is in an unusable state. After waiting for about an Hour more, the laptop starts responding but is still very slow.
 Somehow i opened the task manager and saw that my disk usage was 100%. there were no heavy processes going on but still the usage showed 100%. I noticed that the process that was performing disk operation was "System" and 1-2 processes more that come and go.</p>
<p>I have tried the following methods but still haven't solved the problem yet:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Run chkdsk /f /r utility (twice) from the command prompt before booting the OS</p>
<p>2) Started the System in safe mode but still no use</p>
<p>3) Started the system using the clean boot option but still no use</p>
<p>4) Tried disabling services like BITS,Windows Search,Windows Update,Superfetch but this didn't help either (i have re-enabled the services again)</p>
<p>5) Praying to God :P</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is any other thing that i should try, then please tell me. I am unable to do anything on my Windows 8.1 Laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Manpreet</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: The laptop is dual boot with Win 7 and there is no problem while using Win 7.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account Invitation Email Not Received so Account Still Pending.</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased a Windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>I have set myself up as an Administrator and 2 family members as standard users.</p>
<p>One of the accounts I have set up did not receive the invitation email from Microsoft for their account and their status is therefore still set to 'pending'.</p>
<p>Both users emails accounts are working ok (sending and receiving), however the user who is still pending is having problems opening certain apps such as photos. No error message is displayed but the apps do not open. The other user does not get this problem.</p>
<p>I therefore have 2 questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there a way that I can get Microsoft to resend the invitation email so that the user can be accepted.</p>
<p>2. Would this 'pending' state explain the reason for the user not being able to open certain apps?</p>

            <p>Hi Sujita.</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response.</p>
<p>Following your suggestion about using the remove and add links I can confirm that a invitation email has now been received and accepted, and that the pending status has now been removed. Thank you very much for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the original problem that I had hoped this was causing still exists. This is that one user cannot open certain Apps (Photos being one). No error occurs. Just no response.
</p>
<p>The other user can open all the apps that I can (including photos).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both users were set up the same. Both logon using a&nbsp;password (or pin if locking), and both have their email account assigned to their accounts. I was hoping that the pending issue was the cause as this is the only difference I could see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else that can cause this issue ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neil</p>

</p><p><span>1.The partition users want to extend is not a NTFS partition. Microsoft says extending volume feature in Disk Management only works to a raw or NTFS partition.</span></p>
<p><span>2.There is no unallocated or free space on hard disk or the space is not contiguous and after the partition which needs extending.</span></p>
<p><span>3.Users want to extend a primary partition, but, instead of unallocated space, there is just a free space right after the target partition.

<p>
<span>Currently, there is free partitioning software AOMEI Partition Assistant that can extend a partition without limitations.</span></p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I download apps to my windows 10 tablet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try to download an app from the Windows store to my RCA device I get an error code of "0x803F7000". I'm not sure what to do at this point, I have already restart my tablet, I have reset the windows store with the windows+R</p>
<p>&nbsp;"wsreset.exe" , I ran the trouble shooter for windows apps and nothing seems to be working.&nbsp;I hate to think that I wasted my money on this device but it is really pointless having it if I can't download anything on it. I just don't know what to do.</p>

<p>The above should help you determine if Vista (64-bit) Service Pack 1 (SP1) is installed.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Support for Vista Gold (no Service Packs) ended on Tuesday, 13 April 2010. Computers still running Vista Gold "will no longer receive software updates [e.g., SP1] from Windows Update" until SP1 has been installed (which will require that several Prerequisite
 Updates be installed first). See <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2010/04/13/end-of-support-for-windows-vista-with-no-services-packs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>That being said, free unlimited installation and compatibility support for Vista SP1 has been extended a third time &amp; now runs through 30 August 2010. Some issues may require more advanced support for which there is a charge.</p>

                    <p>I have a Dell Inspirion 531 computer. It has begun to send a message Microsoft Tunneling Adapter not working. Running windows 7, I do not know when this message first appeared. I have a new HP OfficeJet Pro 8500A it will not scan, but prints and copies,
 have not tried faxing. I had this mesage before I got this printer. I cannot tell you what the problem is. Windows support tells me it cannot find Teredo Tunneling Adapter when I seek inforation on the Microsoft site. Device manager gives me no information
 wbout what this adapter does.</p>

            <p>Have you looked through <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Search/Search?SearchTerm=Microsoft+Teredo+Tunneling+Adaptor">
older postings</a> for hints (at what it is and how you might fix your problem)?&nbsp; Not saying they will explain everything OR that you have the follow the advice that necessarily fixed (or got rid of in some cases) someone elses similar issue (some people may
 have decided to format and start clean) - but you may have a better idea of what is going on.</p>
<p>Essentially - it is an IPv6 thing.&nbsp; Unlikley you use IPv6 and fairly likely you have a third party firewall solution (not 100%, but up there...)</p>
<p>As for the Printer/Scanner issue, it maye be related in a round-about way - if this is a network printer - but is probably just another symptom of some of the problem and not the cause in this case.</p>
<p>I suggest you visit the <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/support-drivers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>Upgraded from windows 8.1 to windows 10, hoping the issue would resolve itself; but, it did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to open a PC game, I receive, "Access Denied: Please log in with administrator privileges and try again," when I am already logged in as administrator. This occurred recently when my OS was still Win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to uninstall/reinstall the PC game(s) as well as run as Administrator, but receive the same warning. How can this issue be resolved?</p>

<p>Hi scdrenn,</p>
<p>Word and Excel on that computer are probly (when they are being opened) being opened as Administor. To Disable it you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the file location of the Programs (Probly installed in to Program Files &gt; Microsoft Office</li><li>Right click on Word or Excel first </li><li>Then click on Propities </li><li>Click on the Compatibillity tab </li><li>In that list of Check Boxes, Unckeck Run this program as an administor. </li><li>Apply then OK </li></ol>
<p>If thats not Check then I'm out of Ideas! Hope you get them NOT runing as an Administor,</p>

    <title>Video streaming freezes and I must reset wifi adapter. Why&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tony debates  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video streaming freezes and I must reset wifi adapter. Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Overview:&nbsp; While streaming online video, the&nbsp;stream&nbsp;freezes.&nbsp; If I troubleshoot, it resets my wifi adapter and -- after I refresh -- all is well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A more detailed explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>I use an Acer laptop with Windows 8.1, Internet Explorer, Norton anti virus, and a wifi signal from a Comcast Cable router.</li><li>While watching a streaming video -- most notably Amazon but other sites, too --&nbsp;the stream freezes.</li><li>A&nbsp;triangular warning symbol with an exclamation point in it appears over my wifi signal strength icon on the task bar.</li><li>If I right click on the icon and select "Troubleshoot Issue", my laptop goes through the trouble shooting steps.</li><li>At the end, a solution window appears that says:</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">The connection between your access point, router, or cable modem and the internet is broken:&nbsp; Detected.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 90px">The default gateway is not available: Fixed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px">
</p><p>Once the troubleshooting is completed, I can refresh Amazon and restart the video where I left off.&nbsp; But within 10-30 minutes, I have to repeat it all over again ... again and again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what the issue might be?</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 &#8211; any date for the Windows 10 Version 1709 of a recovery image&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I installed way too many things on my Surface Pro 4 and I'd like to do a clean install.</p>
<p>I saw few options are available to make a fresh install of Windows. However, I think the best option for me is to download a
<em>Surface Recovery Image</em> (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a>); that way all drivers and default apps for the Surface will be
 correctly installed.</p>
<p>As of this date (11/12/2017), the Fall Creator Update (version 1709) is still not available to download. Any idea when will this recovery image will be? I don't really want to install the 1703 and THEN upgrade to 1709.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Please don't shoot the messenger. Microsoft creates new recovery images only if they will sell a particular Surface SKU preinstalled with the Fall Creators Update. Microsoft isn't selling SP4's anymore (they are not available in the Microsoft Store online). It seems unlikely that they will do another factory run of SP4's. So bottom line, don't hold your breath.
<br />
<br />If you reimage from the latest 1703 BMR recovery file and manually run Windows Update once, then go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a> and select Update Now you should then get the latest and greatest. Manually check for updates again and install whatever is available. Then use a product like Macrium or Acronis and make an image so that you have your own custom image for the future. 
<br />
<br />For what it's worth, there aren't any BMR recovery images yes for ANY of the Surface tablets, including the newest ones. 
<br />
<br />I'm sorry I can't give you the good news you were hoping for, but I hope the alternative of creating your own custom image (a one time pain..) is better than nothing.
<br />
<br />Please DO mark as answer if this was of assistance.

<h2>            My player stats and mvp questions</h2>
                    
<p>Since everyone here was so helpful on my last my player question I figured why not come again with another question. Ok so I am currently the best player in the nba says nba.com and I have the best shooting stats in nba history ( broke almost all shooting
 records except freethrow you know the 3 point, most points scored in a game, most field goals made those 3) and I have good assists ( averaging 5.6 a game I think I would have more but first starting out I had a shoot first forget the team and win mindset
 since they kept missing but now I get 5-13 assists a game and pass out a lot). I just got my shoe deal from jordan brand and have won the player of the week 6 times in a row and 2 more times after that ( got injured so I lost my status in the league) so I
 am back now with a 30 and 15 record 5 best team in the nba and im not on the mvp list!!! The usual players like d rose, kobe, and cry baby no ring lebron are there but im not and yet I am &nbsp;number one on the rookie charts!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go into league leaders I am 69th in the league as a point guard and 357th throughout the whole nba!! When I look at my stats is says DNO what does that mean? Please so I can try and fix this so I can become mvp and any mvp tips? I am halfway through
 the season 22 days till the trade deadline is over if that helps you find out where I am and I am a rookie.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  Hoyosko 
<br />
<br />Did you open the Store in Windows 10 or are you looking at the upgrades on microsoftstore.com? 
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation
<br />Click the link ˜Go to the store to upgrade or enter a product key
<br />Click the $99 button to make your purchase (the price might vary by region or depending on the edition you are upgrading from or upgrading to).
<br />Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase.
<br />Within 5 to 10 minutes, your system will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, your personal files, apps and settings preserved. 
<br />You won't get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase.

<h2>            Can&#39;t get my 360 wireless controller to work on my PC&#33;</h2>
                    I just got a game for my computer, so I wanted to use my 360 wireless controller for it. I went to the website and downloaded the software but every time I turn my controller on it doesn't show it on the Connections thing. It'll just turn my 360 on. I've
 read other topics and one suggested holding down that big X button in the middle and then go to "turn off controller" and I did that, turned it back on and nothing changed... I'm really confused...

<p>
<span>Hi RoflKnife93,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft answers.
</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask you few questions in order to get a better understanding of this issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the operating system installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to work without any issues?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the error message you get when you try to use the device?</span></p>
<p>
<span>Push the connect button on the Xbox 360 and the one on the controller simultaneously. The connect button is the little one next to the left button on the back of the controller, next to the
 ‘(((’ symbol. Find the same button on the front of the 360 console, then push them both at the same time, hold for 2 or 3 seconds (until the lights start to “spin” on the controller), then release it.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the issue still persists, then I suggest that you post in Xbox 360 forums since it is better suited in Xbox forums refer the link:</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Hacking Scam&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I made a big mistake!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My daughter calls me over saying her computer is being hacked. It showed a message claiming to be from Microsoft saying a virus is on her computer and to call the Microsoft Support number on the screen. I call the number,
 a woman with an Indian accent answers saying she is with Microsoft Support (there are many voices sounding like a call center in the background). She</span><span>&nbsp;says in order to help me I need to give her access to my daughter's
 computer and tells me to hold down "microsoft key + r key", then gives me a series of letters and numbers to enter into a box.
</span><span>Like a fool I do so, s</span><span>he downloads</span><span>&nbsp;GoToAssist&nbsp;</span><span>and starts scrolling around
 saying we don't have good firewall protection and there are 12 hackers hacking through it right now.&nbsp; She says "whatever you do, don't turn off the computer or router.&nbsp; This will launch their program".&nbsp; Then the line goes dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I call back and speak with a man with an Indian accent saying he can't tell which support person was helping me.&nbsp; He tells me to do the&nbsp;</span><span>"microsoft key + r key", then a series
 of letters and numbers again, then he tries to access&nbsp;</span><span>GoToAssist, but can't saying "oh no, this is bad, let me try something else and downloads Supremo.&nbsp; Now he starts scrolling around and says there are 12 devices
 connected to my daughter's computer and they're trying to access our other devices connected to our router.&nbsp; He says let me see who they are, computer code scroll down the screen, then a map of the world, then a "mug shot" of some guy named Nikolai.&nbsp; "Do you
 know him?&nbsp; Well, he's on your devices right now.&nbsp; Here let me block him. Okay, I've blocked him, but your firewall is exposed...&nbsp; Here's what you need, 1 year protection for $499 or lifetime for $1,999."&nbsp; I tell him that's a lot more then I expected.&nbsp; He said
 its less then many other firewalls and he pulls up a Google page showing firewalls for $2,500+.&nbsp; I tell him I need to check with a relative who is in computer security.&nbsp; He says okay, when you call back use this ext. to speak with me and gives me a "Customer
 ID #".&nbsp; He stresses "don't tell anyone else this number.&nbsp; If you do they can access you computer..."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We keep trying to reach our nephew and when he calls us back he confirms it was a scam.&nbsp; He says they can't access our Mac desktop, which has our banking info, etc.&nbsp; He asks me to download Teamviewer so he can get into my daughter's laptop to assist, but
 I can't get a browser up.&nbsp; The Microsoft Alert message is blocking the whole screen.&nbsp; We try workarounds but whatever they put on her computer blocks access to a browser or the outside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where things stand now.&nbsp; Her computer is shut down.&nbsp; It is a two year old machine with Windows 10.&nbsp; At this point, is our only option taking it in to someone?&nbsp; We live in the Bay Area of CA and even with two incomes are stretched thin, with Christmas
 a month away.&nbsp; Sorry for such a long story.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated- Evie's dad.</p>

            Hi Evie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That sounds like the Fake Virus scam which can emanate from a mistyped URL it occupies.  If you have a shortcut for Favorite/Bookmark of the site be sure to delete it.  It may have also set itself as your Home page or be lodged in your Browser Add-Ons or Extensions so you'll want to check there and run the scanners I give below.
<br />
<br />Close the Browser window using whichever method is necessary, as it cannot escape the browser unless you download something from the page.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot close the browser window, right click the Task Bar or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys to open the Task Manager, choose Show Less Details, highlight the browser and choose End Task. 
<br />
<br />If this fails hold the power button to Shut Down.  If you do this Edge may reload the page when it starts back up, but it will also give you an option to Start Fresh to avoid opening the previous tabs.  
<br />
<br />Also in Edge, if you try to X out of the browser WIndow, it may present a dialogue box to end the session.  The webpage is allowed to put text in the box but cannot stop it from closing the Windows when you choose OK, so that is safe to do.  
<br />
<br />If you called the scammers and they installed anything on your PC, open Settings&gt;Apps &amp; Features, choose Sort by Date, uninstall anything on that date you didn't install yourself. Then run a full scan with Malwarebytes.   In MB settings tell it to search for rootkits. You can turn off the trial version later in it's Account Settings.
<br /><a href="http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti_malware/tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found.  If you are seriously infected with Trojans or Rootkits that show up again when you re-run the scan after cleaning, post back for further instructions.   
<br />
<br />Then check System files for damage with System File Checker from <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />
<br />If you paid them anything, notify your bank that you were scammed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<div><span>Besides their getting money from you for doing nothing of any value,&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>since you let them into your computer, who knows what they did there or what confidential information they stole.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>So since you did, I highly recommend that you do both of the following immediately:</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>1. Do a clean reinstallation of Windows.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>2. *After* reinstalling Windows, change all of your passwords, especially any for banks or other&nbsp;</span><span>financial sites.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>Since they *might* have installed a key logger, simply changing your passwords without first reinstalling Windows may not be good enough.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And for the future, you should never let *anyone* take control of your computer unless it's someone you know and trust implicitly, both with regard to his honesty and technical skills.</div>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for not following up with you sooner.&nbsp; There was enough nasty stuff installed on my daughter's laptop that I decided to bring it in to a local computer repair store I have worked with in the past.&nbsp; They recommended doing a 'back to factory" wipe
 as the most economical and secure way to get ride of everything those nice folks installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to let you and the others in this group who have offered suggestions know, I did not pay the scammers anything.&nbsp; Their prices for firewall protection were high enough to wake me up and tell me something is not right here. My only losses are what I'll
 be paying the local computer repair store to wipe the machine and a bunch of my time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll never repeat this mistake again and my hope is that neither will my 12 year old daughter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you have a wonderful holiday season,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Evie's dad</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your message.&nbsp; As I just replied to Greg, I did not pay the scammers anything.&nbsp; Their prices for firewall protections were high enough to wake me up and tell me something is not right here. My only losses are what I'll be paying the local computer
 repair store to wipe the machine and a bunch of my time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's my 12 year old daughter's laptop, so thankfully there wasn't any <span><span>confidential information for them to steal.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask a question, please-&nbsp; Will a clean back-to-factory wipe remove a "key logger" if one was installed?&nbsp; I am not too tech savvy and would like to put my mind at ease after this experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going forward, I'll never repeat this mistake again and my hope is that neither will my daughter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Evie's dad</p>

<p>You're welcome. Glad to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, what you call a "clean back-to-factory wipe" will remove everything.</p>

            I had the same thing happen today Jan 14,2019. Only they called me and had me do a couple of things to&nbsp; pull up problems,and then wanted access.&nbsp; I stupidly did so without calling Microsoft, it is so hard to contact immediately. Igot off the phone, looked
 up scams with the name they gave, and called the bank to stop payment.&nbsp; I looked it up, Global is a name they use, and Microsoft will not call you.. hang up or they will have you in a panic.&nbsp; I also shut down my computer.&nbsp; Change passwords immediately.&nbsp; FTC
 has a case against them already.&nbsp;
