    <title>Why is Microsoft focusing Windows 10 on phones&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is Microsoft focusing Windows 10 on phones&#63;</h2>
                    <p>New releases of Windows 10 are put out to phones first, and so far in the case of #56 ONLY to phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is Microsoft focusing on phones instead of desktops?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple holds only about 4% of the worldwide desktop market but they own phones between Apple and Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft would have to GIVE AWAY Windows phones to try to take a large piece of the market and I don't see them doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But they are acting like desktops are irrelevant and only phones count.</p>

            They aren't only focusing&nbsp;on phones . Not sure where you get that. and 10056 was not a phone released. It wasn't released at all. 10051 was for phones and that was the 1st or 2nd release for phones. PC has had 5. Windows 10 is going to be universal. that's
 the point. An app you have on your PC will work on your tablet or phone

            <p>Microsoft has changed their revenue model. &nbsp;They are no longer interested in selling software useful for people to conduct their own computing needs. &nbsp;Instead, Windows 10 is designed to monetize its customers to generate revenue. &nbsp;Windows 10 is a "free"
 storefront for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cortana/Bing sponsored clickbait (like Google)</li><li>Microsoft/Windows/Metro/Universal Appstore sales (like Apple)</li><li>Xbox integration to spur sales of Xbox and Xbox software (like Sony Playstation)</li><li>Software subscriptions, e.g. music, onedrive, office 360</li><li>Data mining of personal information to sell (like Facebook)</li></ul>
<p>Microsoft thinks that by making the desktop computer act like a phone, it will make people want Windows phones. &nbsp;The new "start menu" on the Windows 10 desktop is taken directly from Windows 8 phone - I played with a windows phone last night and it had the
 same one column list of "apps", and tiles that Windows 10 has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing they are doing is saving money by firing software testers and using Windows 10 consumers as testers for Windows Updates before they roll out to paying corporate/enterprise customers. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2878026/microsoft-to-business-dont-worry-about-windows-10-consumers-will-test-it.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.computerworld.com/article/2878026/microsoft-to-business-dont-worry-about-windows-10-consumers-will-test-it.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>One may also consider that the people in charge of Windows Desktop, are the people who developed
<strong>Windows Phone, and they are no longer involving Windows Desktop leadership.</strong></p>

    <title>Error when opening PST files - &#34;Out of memory or system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error when opening PST files - &#34;Out of memory or system resources&#34; Outlook 365 ProPlus</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have an issue where when opening a PST file stored on a network drive, Outlook reports an error "Out of memory or system resources".</p>
<p>If adding the PST file by going to control panel &gt; mail &gt; data files, an error is displayed with code 0x80040119</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs only after devices are updated to Office version1705 or more, and has occurred for both 1705 and 1708.</p>
<p>It also only seems to occur if the computer has been updated from Windows 7 with Office 2010 at some point. The issue occurs for computers which have just had the update done, and for computers which have been upgraded to Windows 10 with Office 2016 (version
 16xx) over the last months, and then just got the Office 170x updates in the last month.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a computer is built directly with Windows 10 / Office 2016 (version 1705+) there is no issue, and the PST file can be opened.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the same PST file is copied to another network drive, or locally, the file opens without problems. ScanPST does not find anything wrong with the PST file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If another user logs into the same PC (with a fresh user profile), they do not have the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recreating the email profile does not change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is occurring across multiple PCs, and multiple users. Rebuilding a user profile seems to fix the issue, however I'd really like to avoid having to rebuild user profiles if it can be avoided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any thoughts you could provide.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we also faced this issue after updating from Office 365&nbsp;1701 to Office 365 1705 (on Windows 10 1607 Clients). Suddenly the PST files from the homedrive couldn't be opened anymore. Not all users but many of them are affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some investigations we could solve it by changing the user permissions on the affected network drives. It seems that Outlook needs at least Read-Permission on each folder in the path of the network drive. The affected users didn't have these permissons
 - after changing it the PST files could successfully be opened from the H: drive.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The Zune Software (Collection) uses the Windows "Library" concept - Basically allowing you to use a single folder to store all the pictures/music/video as is the design of the Vista and Win7 OS.</p>
<p>In the Zune Software&gt; Click Settings&gt; Click Software&gt; Click Collection&gt; - Here you will see the "Library" that the Zune software is Monitoring for Pictures.&nbsp; You have a couple choices here -</p>
<ol>
<li>You can use Windows Explorer (Start&gt;Computer (My Computer)) and copy to folder/pictures out of the "Library" that the Zune Software is Monitoring - Example - Copy Pictures/Me/MeSleeping to C:\Me\MeSleeping -&nbsp; This will put the pictures outside of the "Pictures
 (My Pictures) Library" that the Zune Software is Monitoring. </li><li>You can click the "Manager Seperately" (button) and the Zune Software will require you to setup the seperate "folders" that the Zune Software will monitor for each library - You will have to manually setup the Music, Videos, Pictures, and Podcast librarys
 - Note this may make your collection temporary blank if you don't configure the Librarys correctly.</li><li>You can manually "Manage" button the Pictures Library and manually set the folders you want the Zune Software to Monitor, excluding the folder you don't want monitored.</li></ol>

                    Sometimes Firefox freezes up with a grey screen for a few seconds until I click on the icon in the task bar that minimizes it. Then when I click again it is ok.

    <title>Word Highlighting Cannot Turn Off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markschroeder2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Highlighting Cannot Turn Off</h2>
                    <p>When I highlight a section of text that I would like to go back and edit, while composing normally in my document, I cannot turn off highlighting. I enter a space and the highlighting continues. When I bring up highlighting, it does not allow me to turn
 it off or "STOP" or give any other option. Hitting escape does nothing. Even if I add 5 spaces after the last word, it magically still keeps highlighting and still does not let me turn it off!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, if I cancel highlighting and go back and only highlight a part of the sentence I typed, and leave the last word "normal", then I can continue typing without the annoying "auto-highlight feature" continuing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plain and simple, I should always be able to turn on and off highlighting wherever I want within my document and not have to create a unique separation&nbsp; and condition within the sentence I am working on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its simple, On Highlight OFF Highlight On Highlight OFF Highlight, isn't it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bug that needs to be fixed.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>File corruption and application related errors are the usual cause why this issue is occurring. To provide an accurate solution, kindly answer the following questions:</p>

            Hello,
<div>unfortunately this has not worked, these files do not appear in the "recent file" &nbsp;on the file menu but only on the options for recent URL for hyperlinks. I work off a server but noticed that all files which are not going away from the list are all from
 my C drive, could that be a reason? In addition they are all word documents.</div>
<div>I have tried a long of things but I am running out of ideas.</div>

<h2>            Word hangs on print attempt</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10, and whenever I try to print a document on any program that program crashes. It happens with all programs. In particular, when ever I try to print the first time after a restart it works. After that, the program doesn't print at
 all. One thing that I know is that when printing on Word it gets a third of the way through "Word is preparing to background print..." and then it crashes. Anything will help at this point, as I have reinstall office already as well as reinstalling the printer
 drivers.

<h2>            ATP safe links policies somehow applied to Hotmail now&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Starting Wednesday, many URLs, if not all, in my incoming Outlook.com mail take the form of what you see below (I've lopped off the majority of it). It's a big mess and seriously obscures what the real URL is. Please tell me that this is a mistake. I get
 what the feature is about, but it's supposed to only be for high-end Office 365 plans, and even then it's configurable.</p>

feature</a>&nbsp;only for Premium users&nbsp;(it still says only "coming soon" on that page though).</p>
<p>2) And that Outlook Engineering will roll out a future release to improve the look of the safelinks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No word as to how they will be improved (no matter the improvement, it's not going to be the original URL, so it's still going to be a problem) or whether the feature will ever be optional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No word on when, either. Sad.<br />

            It turns out that you can expedite it: contact Outlook.com support, explain the issue, and ask for the Outlook.com Research Team to contact the Outlook.com Engineering Team to disable the Advanced Security Feature (Safelinks) on your account. It'll take
 a day or two.

            I'd recently installed Office 365 from my works coverage so thought it was to do with that somehow and was ready to uininstall it as it's really annoying but I am using my Premium paid Hotmail account in Em Client and it's still there so I am guessing
 this is the reason why, thanks for sharing.

<em>Thank you for contacting Outlook.com Support. This is Diana and I'll be assisting you today. I got your email and I see that you want to disable the (Safelinks) for your account. Let me help you with this.&nbsp;</em><br />
<br />
<em>The Outlook.com team has enabled premium features for Office 365 subscribers, including no ads and advanced email security. As part of these updates, you now receive a higher level of protection against malware and phishing threats. The Outlook.com service
 scans each link you click in your emails, and if the destination website contains suspicious content, you will be redirected to a warning page. We recommend that you do not proceed to any sites that trigger the warning page.&nbsp;</em><br />
<br />
<em>As part of this change, the links in some emails you receive will look different. The links will contain additional information related to the security checks that were performed. Over the coming months, new Outlook.com updates will improve the appearance
 of these links while still keeping you protected.</em><br />
<br />
<em><strong>At this time, Outlook.com doesn't provide an option to turn off advanced security on the links.</strong> If you're not able to use the links, I can refer this ticket to our escalation team to review.</em><br />

<h2>            Windows 7 IE 8 will not respond to external links</h2>
                    Running Windows 7 32bit on my HP Laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp; With IE8, if I click on an external link, such as another web site, nothing happens.&nbsp; I would be classified as an Experience User (used to develop software for a living).&nbsp; I've looked on a lot of forums and have
 tried all kinds of solutions, disabling addins, etc.etc.&nbsp; You can't uninstall IE 8 and reload it.&nbsp; All you can do prevent it from loading in Remove Programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you bring it back, it comes back with all the settings it left with.&nbsp; I went to Microsoft where
 you can do an IE fix that supposedly takes it back to original form.&nbsp; I elected to do that and even told it to delete all my settings, etc.&nbsp; It did do that, but did not solve the problem.&nbsp; When is MS going to address this problem????&nbsp; ps: Not having the problem
 on two Windows 7 64 bit machines.

<br />
<p>1. Assuming you've since reinstalled the McAfee application, see if this McAfee three-step fix resolves the problem:

<p>2. If still no joy, download/run the appropriate, newly-updated script(s) by IE MVP Kai Schaetzl:

<p>Tip: The file named <strong>ie8-rereg.all.zip</strong> contains all three (3) scripts below.</p>
<p><strong>If you have a Win7 32-bit computer:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then Run the script named
<strong>ie8-rereg.cmd</strong> &amp; reboot.</p>
<p><strong>If you have a Win7 64-bit computer:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then Run the script named
<strong>ie8-rereg.32on64.cmd</strong> to correct the problem in IE8 32-bit &amp; reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then Run the script named

I don't know whether you have tried leaving battery out for at least 10 minutes before replacing, which sometimes seems to be necessary before proceeding with the following.<br />
<br />
You might like to look at post from <b>nando61</b> just input "N93 update fix" into "Search Discussions" at top right of screen. Although different phone to yours, it seems to be a question of whether NSU can be "tricked" into reading phone.

    <title>Invalid Windows Handle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordito8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invalid Windows Handle</h2>
                    After openning a questionable email message marked as spam , I attempted to run MS Security Essantials update. I then received an error message explaining being prohibited from running this said MS Security Essantials update, (I didn't record the error
 code, though I probably received one, but I'm not sure about that), then without any action on my part, MS Security Essantials update then just "took off", then after about a half hour, this run seemed to "hang up", judging by the position of the "green bar"
 that indicates the portion of the run that has been completed up to the moment, it stayed at that position for about a whole hour.&nbsp; I checked "task manager" to see if the run had "hung up"; everything seemed to be normal, CPU activity, absence of "not responding"
 message). I then clicked on "help" in the error message "window" then shown, was routed to the "MS Security Essantial" web page, searched the "Virus and Malware" forum was led to a download of "MS Fixit" which I executed.&nbsp; I then checked "task manager", which
 showed that one of the 2 "MS Security Essantials" programs that was running before I visited the "Virus and Malware" forum was no longer running.&nbsp; The name of the one that was no longer running had showed that part of program name had included the word "Windows"
 following the name, "MS Security Essantials"&nbsp; And part of that word "Windows" was obscured.<br />
<br />
I then tried to run "MS Security Essantials" update again and received the message, "Invalid Widows Handle", "Click Help for more information about this problem"&nbsp;&nbsp; Error code:&nbsp; 0x80070578<br />

<h2>            Some semblence of UI consistency &#40;upcoming titlebar color and ribbon&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Now that Office 2016 is out, I would like to suggest that the upcoming "colored titlebar" ability in Windows 10 be tweaked so that it includes not just the title bar rectangle, but also the area behind the ribbon Tabs just like Office 2016. This will help
 minimize the rampant look and feel&nbsp;dissonance that plagues Windows nowadays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows nowadays&nbsp;is, well, unpleasant. The competing UI paradigms and colors across applications is just&nbsp;too much. Doing this will at least lend a little bit of aesthetic consistency.</p>

<h2>            Facing an issue to print an Email with Safari browser.</h2>
                    <p>Hello All:</p>
<p>
</p><p>having trouble printing email from my outlook account. things had worked fine for a while, but some time ago it went wrong. when i attempt to print, the preview shows just the background and header, but no text appears and the page prints as blank. it's
 likely a simple setting inadvertently changed, but i just can't seem to figure it out. i've made due, but it's finally reached a frustration level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>none of the topics in the drop downs really seem to apply so i selected sending, receiving etc as a default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance.</p>

 but e-mails. &nbsp;When I want to print an e-mail I have to copy it into a word document and print it. &nbsp;I am a MAC user. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10, How Do I Hate Thee&#63; Let Me Count The Ways - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10, How Do I Hate Thee&#63;  Let Me Count The Ways</h2>
                    <p>I've been using computers since the days of DOS and the Apple II.&nbsp; I've seen them through a LOT of changes.&nbsp; I have used every version of DOS and Windows (except Windows ME).&nbsp; I've taken the good and the bad.&nbsp; Windows 8 was the first version of Windows that
 I actually got fired up enough about to become a full-on cheerleader.&nbsp; I had been using Windows Phone from the very first (Samsung Focus being my first of many Windows Phones) and I was excited that the Metro UI was coming to my PC and laptop.&nbsp; I followed
 Win8 from the earliest--and roughest--previews.&nbsp; The bugs and not-ready-for-prime-time features didn't phase me because the
<em>design</em> was going where I'd hoped.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then came Windows 10.&nbsp; Cautiously, I have been working with the previews on a test machine.&nbsp; And without any reservation I can truly say I
<strong>hate Windows 10 from its very design to its execution</strong>.&nbsp; Microsoft, in it's ridiculous quest for a so-called single experience, has completely ruined
<strong>every single aspect of Windows 8 and, now, Windows Phone</strong> with what they are doing.&nbsp; People who insisted on living on the desktop forever and who couldn't seem to grasp the concept of live tiles and a Start Screen pushed hard for Microsoft to
 completely abandon Metro.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had zero issues with using a keyboard and mouse with Win8.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; The mouse gestures, in particular, were a fairly good imitation of what a finger could do on a touch interface.&nbsp; I quickly moved away from keyboard commands to mouse gestures and gestures
 on the trackpad on my keyboard.&nbsp; It was over a year before I bought a Surface Pro 3 and experienced Windows 8.1 in a touch environment.&nbsp; I easily move between them.&nbsp; Windows 10 pukes all over that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate the Start Menu, as a concept and as it's being executed.&nbsp; And what Microsoft laughingly calls Continuum I'm expected to believe that Windows 10 "intelligently" comprehends how I want to use my device.&nbsp; That's complete bull.&nbsp; Even if I try to
<strong>tell Windows 10 to go to Tablet Mode</strong> it always <em>forgets</em>, forcing me to frequently turn it back ON.&nbsp; I never want to NOT be in Tablet Mode.&nbsp; I want the
<em><strong>immersive user experience</strong></em>.&nbsp; I want live tiles without all this stupid garbage about "recently used" or&nbsp;ridiculously idiotic, virtually never-ending, vertical scrolling through the lame excuse for
<strong>All Apps</strong>.&nbsp; If I could stand in front of Nadella and the rest of the design team, I smack each one of them to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having Metro apps run on the desktop is so ugly and frustrating, I can't understand
<em>what</em> these fools were thinking.&nbsp; There was nothing wrong with the way they ran before, beautiful and clean.&nbsp; but now you can't tell the difference between legacy and Metro apps without effort--I have a problem with that!&nbsp; And, regardless of the type
 of program, the entire design of how they look and function is <em>horrific!</em>&nbsp; What is the deal with the title bars?&nbsp; They look like something a third-grader drew up!&nbsp; In fact, that's what
<em>most</em> of the operating system looks like.&nbsp; For pity's sake, why does everything look like a flipping hieroglyphic? With both Metro
<em>and</em> Windows 7 everything was at least <strong>bold</strong> so that you could easily see it.&nbsp; Now all you have are these ridiculously thin--and often small--vestiges of buttons and icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the lamest claims about Windows 8 was the "jolting experience of moving between desktop and Metro".&nbsp; That's just bull.&nbsp; The same people are falling all over themselves extolling the virtues of endless virtual desktops.&nbsp; Win8 is no more jarring than
 that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Win8 I could always count on <strong>easily</strong> swiping from the left to move through--or snap--running Metro apps to the screen, and easily swiping from the right to pull up the Charms, giving me access--<strong>consistently</strong>--to the context-sensitive
 Settings.&nbsp; This was simple, elegant, beautiful.&nbsp; Windows 10 introduces such a convoluted and idiotic thought process to navigation, settings, etc., that I get angry every time I sit down at my test machine--which I happen to be doing even as I type this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would satisfy me?&nbsp; Fair question.&nbsp; I want to be able to turn on Tablet Mode
<strong>permanently regardless of the device I'm using</strong>.&nbsp; I don't want to have to turn it back on every time I reboot or login or a program crashes.&nbsp; I want Tablet Mode to REALLY put me in
<em>immersive mode</em>.&nbsp; This means I should, by default, see the <em>full Start Screen</em>, with full-blown live tiles and groups, with
<strong>no ugly "Recently Used", no vertical All Apps (go back to the correct All Apps mode)</strong>, and
<strong>no stupid Task Bar</strong>.&nbsp; I want the search function to be exactly as it is in Win8--all I have to do is be on the Start Screen and start typing and I see
<strong>all results regardless of being local or on the web</strong>.&nbsp; I think it's just stupid that I have to go through all the steps Windows 10 requires just to search for something.&nbsp; I want Metro apps to run immersive and desktop programs to run on the
 desktop.&nbsp; I want Settings for programs to always be in the same place on the screen, completely contextually based.&nbsp; I want the panoramic views back and I don't want to ever see a stupid hamburger button again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is what will satisfy me.&nbsp; If you choose to NOT be in Tablet Mode, then you can have all the ridiculous design garbage they're executing that you want.&nbsp; But I know none of this is going to happen.&nbsp; Microsoft is hell-bent on this course of action and
 Windows 10 will continue to be the most ignorantly designed and executed operating system I've ever encountered.</p>

            <p>So, can't you just keep using Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't feel one way or another about<em> any</em> operating system. Whatever people use is their business. And if they're passionate about it, as you seem to be, that's ok too.&nbsp;I only know what works best for me. The user experience is highly subjective
 after all. </p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, for me, the modern UI, OneDrive, the Windows Store, Apps, and Windows as a service, mean absolutely nothing. I don't use tablets. I don't have a smartphone. I don't buy or run apps. I don't buy anything online for that matter.&nbsp;I do not participate
 in the social media circus and I do not use cloud storage for any of my personal files. Further,&nbsp;I'm not&nbsp;even remotely&nbsp;interested in any of those things. People have told me "try the modern experience, you'll like it". Uh, no thanks. It just doesn't fit into
 my workflows. At all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am sticking to Windows 7. It works just fine for my purposes. <em>I don't need</em> anything Windows 8, 8.1 or Windows 10 offers;
<em>I don't want</em> anything Windows 8, 8.1 or Windows 10 offers. If there are alot of XP and 7 users out there with similar thoughts, Microsoft won't&nbsp;convert them to&nbsp;Windows 10. That is, unless they can offer something&nbsp;users absolutely must have and cannot
 get anywhere else. I haven't seen it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And so, I can just keep using Windows 7...happily. Just like you can just keep using Windows 8...happily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Comparatively, I prefer the cascading style Start menu and the cascading style Favorites of Internet Explorer with sufficient flexibility and customizability in Windows 7 / XP...<br />
I also wish the Start menu in Windows 10 and the Favorites in Microsoft Edge keep the cascading style, certainly, maybe it's an unrealistic expectation...

            <p>I concur with the reply's as I do not use the Cloud as it can be and has been compromised in the past and just recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I will not upgrade to windows 10 which I feel is an infringement to the sensible and sane people of Microsoft users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like Microsoft is bowing to the Government security departments so they can watch what we are doing 24/7. Get real people don't vote for the 17 fed monkeys.</p>

            <p>I too was very angry when my Win7 was smashed by the 'free' upgrade to Win10 in Dec 2015 and then soon afterwards when my new Win10 PC was turned into the Critical Error&nbsp;wreck by the January WUs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I had some sympathy for you.&nbsp;My new Win&nbsp;10 OEM PC has now been resuscitated by HP, my OEM -

<p>
</p><p>I fell into your thread @ScubaDog2008(2) when I was looking for some of my earlier rants so that I can clean them up with my good news.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you've been a lucky lad, haven't you, with your one-man war on Windows10 - see below. Are Insiders allowed to double-/triple-post etc? I got shredded by a Moderator&nbsp;the first time that I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moral - as an Insider haven't you a duty to grit your teeth and work towards a solution for those poor ordinary folk who haven't got an OEM to go to for the resolution? You won't get many on your side will you with all these threads?&nbsp;

<p>Guess what? I can't find it in Market Place? Have I been trolled?</p>

<p>I couldn't find Nokia Music from the Marketplace either when I got the phone and followed those instructions. So I did a hard reset which reinstalled all the original sofware. Just changing the region settings brought Mix Radio to the app, no uninstalling
 was needed.</p>

                    I have a brand new Nokia E63 (same as E71). My memory card is suddenly corrupted, but I managed to fix it. I believe the source of the problem is the Remote Lock and the Device Lock of the unit.<br />
<br />
The problem started after I enabled the Device Lock and Remote Lock of my E63 unit. After a couple of hours, I tried opening my apps in the memory card. To my surprise, it's corrupted! I didn't panic because I'm confident I could retrieve the contents of the
 card with a memory reader device. But when I inserted my memory card to my PC, the card is unreadable. I had a feeling that the card must had been badly corrupted. But how? I just got this unit almost a day ago. I didn't do anything odd. I'm an OOP-Design
 Patterns oriented programmer so I'm not newbie when it comes to best practices.<br />
<br />
As I searched the web, I found that there are people who encountered the same exact problem. And their guess is also the Device Lock.<br />
<br />
So what I did is I disabled the Remote Lock and the Device Lock feature. I checked my memory card and it's still corrupted!<br />
<br />
I turn off my unit and turn it on again, but sadly it's still corrupted!<br />
<br />
I removed the memory card while the unit is on and then reinserted the card, and it worked.<br />
<br />
In summary, to solve this memory corrupted problem, try disabling the Remote Lock and Device Lock feature. To disable the Device Lock, revert the password to "12345" (Do not type the quotes). Remove the memory card (Use the remove memory card feature of your
 unit!). Re-insert the card to your unit and problem should be fixed.

            Hi,<br />
Thanks a lot for citing this problem and the solution. But I believe the memory card was faulty (possibly one in a million). Disabling the Device Lock and Remote Lock does help to clear a lot of other problems but security becomes a concern then! Security with
 a business phone is indeed a great concern! Isn't it? Any other solutions?<br />
<br />
I have some doubts about the new E63-<br />
1) Does it have a built in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec? Is this cited in the manual?<br />
2) Can it play videos recorded on a NOKIA 6233 i.e, 640x480, 15fps, 3GP?<br />
3) How long does it take to full-charge the battery with the supplied high efficiency charger?<br />
4) Is the headset/headphone/earphone shipped alongwith the phone have a mic in it to talk or it is just a earphone/headphone just for listening to music/radio? If its a earphone/headphone, is there any compatible headset available?<br />
<br />
Hope my doubts will be cleared. Thanks for your patience.

<p>Make that two in a million. I had the exact same problem on my phone, brought on by the exact same cause, but unfortunately, I had already re-formatted my memory card (Nokia straight out of the box, not 3rd party) when I found this post. Other problems that
 came with this remote lock bug which I'm still looking for solutions to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-applications that came with the phone that I hadn't installed yet (Solitaire, etc.) disappeared altogether</p>
<p>-applications on my memory card were gone, but when I tried re-installing them, the phone said they were already installed! (as in this popped out: "replace xxx with xxx?")</p>
<p>-flae63, as you mentioned on your blog, it appears the memory card is now locked with a password I didn't set. Any luck on solving this problem, or any of the above?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOW COULD ONE F'N GLITCH CAUSE SO MANY UNRELATED PROBLEMS????</p>

<p>i wonder if its a problem with this phone...i have faced a lot of problems with accessing data on the memory card...time &amp; again the songs added to the music player list disappear...the applications that i installed on the memory card are also sometimes
 "invisible"...when i try installing them again, it says these already exist...</p>
<p>have formatted the memory card quite a few times now...</p>
<p>luckily for me i took the backup of the memory card (that came in the box) &amp; phone on the very 1st day...</p>
<p>hence, every time i format the memory card, i copy the initial contents...</p>
<p>but its quite irritating &amp; frustrating...1 nite i go to sleep after listening to songs, the next morning it shows no songs found...have to restart the phone 2-3 times to find them again...</p>
<p>is phone lock &amp; device lock the same thing that you talking about? i have tried the phone lock but my memory card did not get corrupted...remote lock i have never tried...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as for your queries sidy_porche,</p>
<p>1) as per the specs mentioned on the site "Video recording file formats: .mp4, .3gp; codecs: H.263, MPEG-4 VSP" &amp; "Video playback file formats: .Flash Lite 3, mp4, .3gp; codecs: H.263, MPEG-4 VSP" also "Video streaming: .3gp, mp4, .rm" :smileyvery-happy:</p>
<p>i think the specs that you mentioned for playback will be compatible...d&nbsp; "640x480, 15fps, 3GP"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) 3GP videos are played...but its quite interesting...the phone plays some videos while says "file corrupt" for others of the same format...i had 2-3 video songs of mp4 format,they work absolutely fine...i then transferred some new mp4 videos &amp; they simply
 wont play...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) it takes exactly 2 hours ( you can see it on the clock&nbsp;:smileytongue: ) to charge from 0 to 100%...which is quite good coz a 1500mah battery gets charged in 2 hours...i had a 6265 earlier which took around 2.5 hrs to 3 hrs to get charged with the charger
 that came in the box...using the adapter, ca44 or something, it got charged in 1.5 hours dot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) ya the hearset has a mic...the best thing about this phone or rather one of the best thing is that it has a 3.5mm audio jack...you can insert any damn headphones (your fav ones) into it &amp; enjoyyyyy...even speakers that you attach to your laptop/computer
 can be used...its awesome&nbsp;:smileyvery-happy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i hope it helps :smileyhappy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks anupam149 for&nbsp;3) and 4).</p>
<p>For 1)&nbsp;its&nbsp;AVC codec I'm talking about. Many vids in youtube are now using this codec. So kinda problem to mobile users.</p>
<p>For 2) do download a sample video of 6233 from 'phonearena' 640x480 3gp; E71 640x480 mp4 and try it for real.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I faced the same problem with my E61i phone. Unfortunately by that time i had already formatted my memory card.</p>
<p>I had activated "allow remote lock" feature and set a message let's say message_one. Then i changed the message to message_two. Then i disabled "allow remote lock" but the memory card was still locked.</p>
<p>Then i inserted my card in Nokia 6500S phone and it asked for password. The trick is the password is still message_one. This seems to be a bug of Nokia business phones.</p>

<p>@flae63: thank you very much for posting / sharing the solution. you're the best, man! i'm very glad i found your post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i encountered the same problem. memory corrupted. if i can recall it correctly, here's how it happened:</p>
<p>- i connected my e63 to pc in "mass storage" mode and transfered some files to e63.</p>
<p>- a phone call came in</p>
<p>- i press 'mute' button cos i dont wanna to answer the call and i dont want to reject it either cos i'm in the middle of transfering a file.</p>
<p>- i click 'safely remove the device' from my windows and unplug the e63.</p>
<p>- and a moment later i found out that the memory was corrupted. some of my applications were gone also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>like you said, i did have the 'device lock' and the 'remote lock' turned on at that moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks to your post, i can turn my memory back to normal again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the problem remains, if we turn the 'device lock' off, how can we protect the data in our e63 in case we lost it?</p>
<p>any solution?</p>

<p>follow up to my previous post:</p>
<p>yesterday i encountered my first experience with memory corrupted problem.</p>
<p>as flae63's suggestion, i disabled the lock device and remote lock functionality, change the password to the original of 123456, remove the memory card, then restore it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>today i got the same problem: memory corrupted.</p>
<p>the lock device and remote lock have been disabled. so there must be something else causing this problem.</p>
<p><br />
any response from nokia regarding this problem?</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the new Yammer Desktop App installed (around July 2017). Unfortunately I had to rebuild my system. But I didn't pay enough for the yammer app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a possible way to get the client again? The client is in limited availibility as I understood.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I really liked the client.&nbsp;</p>
