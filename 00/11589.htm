<h2>            Can&#39;t backup Outlook 2010 - Locked File Error Message</h2>
                    
<p>I haven't been able to backup Outlook 2010 in five months.&nbsp; I get the following error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The process cannot access the file because another process has locked a portion of the file."</p>
<p>Type: Outlook Data File</p>
<p>Size 2.01 GB</p>
<p>What do I do to end this conflict?</p>

            I know this question is old, but the answers are not complete and can't help much because any program can be locking the file without your knowledge as mentioned by Somasundaram Pandiaraj. One possibelity and even be the Search Index, as it has happened
 to me. However it is strange that Search Index or any other one would persist for six months, as you say. To be able to do something, first you need to know what is locking the file. There is a little program to tell you that, Unlocker. It shows all handles
 on any file.<br />
<br />
You can downloaded it from Cnet:<br />

<h2>            Where are AutoRecovery files stored&#63;</h2>
                    I would like to recover a file saved with Word 2003's AutoRecovery. I have searched for *.asd and *.tmp files&nbsp;limiting the search to the date and approximate file size. I found two .tmp files but Word displays them as gibberish. I have also looked around
 in my AppData\Local\ folders and found nothing.

            Take a look in Tools &gt; Options &gt; File locations tab. Double click on the Autorecover Files file type to see the whole path that they are stored on.<br />
<br />
Note, ASD files are deleted if the file and Word is shut down normally.<br />
<br />
If you want a better file name search tool take a look at Everything from Void tools: http://www.voidtools.com/<br />
<br />
You can get a portable version that does not have to be installed and it can search the entire HD "instantly" because it hooks directly into the NT File System.&nbsp; I use it dozens of times a day.<br />

after a couple of hours of searching I have shut down Word. The folder <br />
pointed at by Tools &gt; Options &gt; File locations was empty. I appreciate <br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t open a Word 97-2004 protected document</h2>
                    I'm working on a Mac OS10.6.8
<div>In my applications folder I have two versions of Office, 2008, and 2001 which is the one I currently use.</div>
<div>Some years ago, I had written documents with <u>Word 97-2004</u>, which I needed protected by a password.</div>
<div>Today I find myself unable to open those documents again, because I am getting an error message; it's in french, but it translates like this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>Impossible to open because this document has been protected by a ciphering method which is not available in this country; please ask an unprotected document to the author...</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Of course I am the author and cannot provide an unprotected file since they were protected by myself! And I fear I could be unable to retrieve my documents, which are due to publication.</div>
<div>The 2004 Office version does not seen available for downloading anymore.</div>
<div>Help greatly appreciated, thanks in advance</div>

            Thank you, this is quite interesting.
<div>Maybe I didn't explain myself enough though: I had written and protected those files with Word97-2004, which I don't have anymore; now I do have Office 2011, but that is when I get the error message.</div>
<div>The recent versions cannot open older encrypted documents; of course I do have the password but don't even reach the point where I can write it.</div>
<div>I might try to reach Microsoft France, when I can deal with the idea of paying the incredible amount they require to get in touch with them directly...</div>
<div>Thanks again</div>

    <title>Wrong FROM address on Replies - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toby nixon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong FROM address on Replies</h2>
                    I'm using Outlook 2016, and have about a dozen email accounts in my profile. Most of them are IMAP accounts. I recently followed the instructions to remove my Hotmail account and add it back again to upgrade the type of server connection used. Prior to
 the upgrade, whenever I pressed REPLY to an email, the FROM address on the reply was set to the account corresponding to the inbox in which the message was received -- for example, if I'm looking at the inbox for *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and press REPLY, the compose window
 would open with *** Email address is removed for privacy *** selected as the FROM address. But now, after the upgrade, it doesn't matter which inbox I'm looking at -- EVERY reply has the FROM address set to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***! Seriously! I have to remember to press the FROM button to open the drop-down
 list and select the correct FROM address. If I remove the Hotmail account, it goes back to working right -- the FROM address

<p>
</p><p>I'm not getting a random FROM address on replies. If my Hotmail account is in my profile, then I get *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as the FROM address for EVERY REPLY, including all of my different IMAP accounts.<br />
<br />
When you say "What is your account's configuration", are you referring to Hotmail, or to the other accounts that show my Hotmail address as the FROM address when I do a reply? When I add the Hotmail account to the profile, I just use all the automatic settings
 that come along with adding a Hotmail account in Outlook -- no tweaking of any kind. As for the IMAP accounts, they're all configured basically the same way, connecting to a server I lease from a hosting service. But I haven't changed any of the configuration
 on those accounts. They work fine when Hotmail is not in the profile. When I add Hotmail to the profile, then all of those accounts have the same problem of showing my Hotmail address as the FROM address on replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think I should just delete the profile and recreate it from scratch, adding the Hotmail account first?</p>

            <p>I don't understand your advice. Do you think I SHOULD try recreating the profile? Are you recommendation that I create a second profile? Or maybe just try the second profile, starting with my Hotmail account, then add additional accounts and see if the problem
 reproduces?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>OK, I went ahead and created a second profile. The first account I added to it is for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I then added a second account (IMAP), *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I went to the Hotmail account and sent an email to my IMAP account, and went to the IMAP
 account and sent an email to the Hotmail account. After the test messages were received, I went to the IMAP inbox, viewed the message from the Hotmail account, and hit Reply. When I did that, the FROM address SHOULD have been from the IMAP account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
 But it was not -- even though I was in the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account, the FROM address was preselected as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is just wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem is not corruption in my old profile. The profile is some bug inherent in how the new Hotmail setup works, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>

            <p>I am having this problem as well. It's a nightmare. I have 2 accounts added in my outlook. One for work (IMAP) and one for private mails (outlook.com / EAS). When I am replying to an email sent to my work account outlook will set the sender adress to the
 private email !!! Meanwhile I was answering some of my work contacts with my private sender address because I forgot to change.
</p>
<p>I have the feeling that the problem started to occur when outlook was asking me to reconnect the EAS account because of the update on "outlook.com".

            One of my IMAP accounts is default, not Hotmail. But regardless, Outlook behavior has always been that when you Reply to a message the From address is set to the account on which the message was received, not the default account or any other account. That
 is now broken if I have Hotmail in the profile. It was not broken before the Hotmail upgrade.

            <p>I just installed the lastest Outlook 2016 update. The problem still exists. I have a half-dozen IMAP accounts configured. If I have no Outlook.com accounts set up, those IMAP accounts work great. But when I add my Outlook.com (Hotmail) account to my Outlook
 profile, it sets it up as the "Primary" account, and from then on every time I hit REPLY on a message, whatever account it is in, it sets to FROM address to my HOTMAIL account, not to the account in which the message was received that I'm replying to. This
 is just plain wrong. It is a bug. It needs to be fixed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Running two instances of IE &#40;as two different users&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I can run IE as two different users - one being the user that I am currently logged in as, and two being another user logged into a different domain (Win 7 - Shift/Right-click/Run as different user).</p>
<p>The question is, is there a way for me to permanently run one instance of IE as that second user? If I can save that setting, I can just create a shortcut and pin that shortcut to the taskbar. Today, my taskbar shortcut does not work because it gets clubbed
 with the "default" IE application.</p>
<p>There are some work-related apps that need me to be logged in to a different domain, so I do need this facility. Earlier&nbsp;I had solved the problem by using Chrome for all non-work things and IE running as the second user for all work things. But I would like
 to use only IE for all stuff.</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>1. Running IE as a different user permanently (always)</p>
<p>2. Pinning that shortcut as a different application on the windows 7 taskbar</p>

<p>Hey RPMM,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t know of a command to use in the Target: of the shortcut to always run the shortcut as another user. You can get this to work by using a .CMD script to launch Internet Explorer as another user. This can be done by:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>All Programs</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Accessories</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Notepad</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type/paste:</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>runas/user:*insert the account path here* "\"c:\program
 files\internet explorer\iexplore\" "</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>File</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Save As…</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Choose the location you would like the save the file (probably the
 Desktop)</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Change
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Save as:</strong> type to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>All Files</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>IE.CMD</strong> into<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>File name:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Save</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some examples of the runas command would be:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Domain name=TestDomain &amp; User Name (on domain)=TestUser</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>runas/user:TestDomain\TestUser "\"c:\program files\internet explorer\iexplore\"
 "</span></p>
<p><span>If you wanted to use runas for another local (not attached to the domain) user account:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Computer name=TestPC &amp; User name=TestUser</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>runas/user:TestPC\TestUser "\"c:\program files\internet explorer\iexplore\"
 "</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then open the IE file on your desktop. You’ll be prompted for the password to the user account and then Internet Explorer will open as the other user.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope that helps, look forward to hearing back from you.</span></p>

<h2>            Address not found</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been getting emails in my outlook.com inbox that state "Address not Found"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird part is these "mail delivery subsystem", undeliverable, "Address not found"...&nbsp; are coming from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** AND I am not sending anything to the emails listed.&nbsp; The emails that it says are failing look a lot like spam emails like
 *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I don't think these are spam or phising, all the links on the page go to google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look in my sent items I do not see anything going out to these random email addresses?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is someone spoofing my outlook.com email address to send out spam or something?? And I'm getting the bounce back on the addresses that no longer exist?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way how do I stop this?</p>

            Hi ,mattw112! How are you?
<br />
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community, I understand how unfortunate you are going through this problem!
<br />
<br />My name is Alessandro, I am an independent advisor and I am here to help.
<br />
<br />I understood your problem perfectly. Of course if you are not contacting this email the person who is doing is practicing SPAM because the messages does not stop. But if within the email has links we advise not to click because Hackers and people who commit Pishing masked their information in a misleading way to try to steal your password information among others. I recommend that you list this email in blocked senders and send the address to the Microsoft team to investigate the source of this email. 
<br />

<br />
<br />Hello Matt
<br />
<br />If you haven't sent any messages to this email address and there's nothing in your &lt;Sent Items&gt; folder then it would very very likely being a case of your email address being hijacked by a spammer and your address being spoofed.

    <title>How can I start using the Microsoft Office on my new Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I start using the Microsoft Office on my new Laptop</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I won this Compaq Mini computer as a prize from INTEL Nigeira. On trying to activate the Microsoft Office 2007, I used the 25 Character Product Key I saw at the bottom of the Laptop by following the Screen prompts when I attempt to use any of the Office
 Application Pre-installed, but a message pops up in red that "The key is incorrect. verify that you have the correct key, then retype it." I am double sure that there is no mistake in the characters I typed from the Certificate of authenticity sticked to the
 botton of this computer or is the 25 Character Product Key obtain elsewhere?. Please how can I solve the problem?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding your question about updating your Windows 7 phone to Windows phone 8.&nbsp; This is something that will not be able to be done.&nbsp; There are hardware differences required for the two operating systems that prevent this
 sort of update.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>

<h2>            Storage &#47; Size limitations for O365 Videos</h2>
                    
<p><span>Would you be aware of any storage limitations with O365 Videos? I understand Videos internally stores a copy in SharePoint Online and then a copy is pushed to the Azure media services which then creates few more video files
 of different sizes.</span></p>
<p>How will the overall storage be calculated?</p>
<p><span>Will the default 1TB per site collection apply for the O365 video portal (~/portals/hub/)? Any idea will every channel internally gets its own site collection? If that would be the case will there be a 1TB per channel limitation?</span></p>

<p>Hi Raghavan,</p>
<p>When you upload a video, you upload it to a specific channel. Actually, each channel is created as a site collection with 1 TB storage distributed without showing in the SharePoint admin center.</p>
<p>The original file is stored in SharePoint Online and it counts against your storage quota. The tenant used storage is made up of the video site collection used storage, group site collection used storage and site collections in SharePoint admin site used
 storage.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jerry</p>

<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To resolve this issue we need some clarification:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When referring to web-based OneNote are you referring to OneNote online:
</span><a href="http://www.onenote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">www.onenote.com</span></a><span>?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If yes, then note on OneNote online you can only search keywords within the same page in a particular notebook or within sections in the same notebook. You cannot
 search different notebooks in OneNote online.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may provide your feedback to Microsoft.
</span><span>Please take a moment to send us your feedback or feature request(s) by submitting your feedback in the following link.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 send&#47;receive message box does not close</h2>
                    
<p>This is a minor problem, but annoying. &nbsp;Occasionally when I hit the send/receive button in Outlook 365 the box titled "Outlook Send/Receive Progress" just sits there, does not close when completed. &nbsp;It closes most times, but maybe 1 out of 10 times it doesn't.
 &nbsp;I have to hit the "cancel" button to get the box to disappear. &nbsp;I could always select the "Don't show this dialog box during Send/Receive" option, but I happen to like seeing the progress box. &nbsp;I just would like it to go away when the task is finished. &nbsp;I
 didn't not have this problem with the 2005 or 2008 versions (never owned 2010).</p>
<p>Any help or advice that anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you. &nbsp;Darrell</p>

<p>Hi Darrell,</p>
<p>Based on my experience, the issue may have various root causes, for example, the connection between Outlook clients and server is not good. To narrow down the issue, I’d like to collect some information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Which <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Business plan</a> do you use? <br />
2.&nbsp;Where did you download the Outlook clients?<br />
3.&nbsp;Are you using Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2016 now (Outlook 365 should have a <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19#BKMK_Office365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
version for Office applications</a>.)?<br />
4.&nbsp;Can you send us your domain name of the account you set up in Outlook clients? We will help you check the status of service for your email account. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect them. Please click on the link below

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Tab A Office Suite Compatibility - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Samsung Galaxy Tab A Office Suite Compatibility</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
I bought a new branded Samsung Galaxy Tab A (WiFi Only) at last year. Microsoft Office suite comes pre-installed with this device.&nbsp;<strong>However, when I clicked a app (Word, Excel or Powerpoint), the app crashed
 suddenly.</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
After then, I searched those apps in&nbsp;<strong>Google Play Store</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>updating new version</strong>&nbsp;but I cannot find those apps on the store. I found apps
 Google Play Store links via Chrome.&nbsp;<strong>All of the pages says,” Your device is not capable for app”.</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
Why ? I cannot understand my device is not supported ?&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Via Microsoft's System requirements for Office for Android:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Office for Android™ can be installed on tablets and phones that meet* the following criteria: running Android KitKat 4.4 or later version and have an ARM-based or Intel x86 processor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
As you read the description, my tablet meet the requirements (<strong><em>9.7 inches screen,</em></strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>Lollipop 5.0.2 , 1,5 GB RAM and
</em></strong><strong><em>Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 8916&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>CPU</em></strong>). Are anyone encountered with this issue ?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">
Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I have a tablet, not a phone :) If I can open, I will reset settings however no GUI opened. (Standalone Office apps comes pre-installed on my Galaxy Tab A). Due to factory install of office apps, I can not delete any of them. In addition to this,
 Office apps not visible while searching them on Google Play Store.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">I found apps Google Play Store links via Chrome.&nbsp;</span><strong>All of the pages says,” Your device is not capable for app”.
</strong>So, I cannot use any Office app &nbsp;on My Galaxy Tab A. It think it is a critical issue for MS.&nbsp;Especially in agreement with Samsung for Office suite ...</p>

            <p>I have this exact same problem, and neither Samsung nor MS seems to have any solution or intelligible answer. When will the Office apps be updated so they work again? It's the whole reason i bought the tablet in the first place. A solution for a paying 365

    <title>N70 Screen Colour - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmteh  say:</h3>
<h2>            N70 Screen Colour</h2>
                    I've just got a N70 with 3, and my mate is with Vodafone using N70 too. Both the phones have same software version (2.0539.1.2).<br />
Does anyone know/noticed why the screen colour is much richer and nicer on the Voda N70, even though the brightness setting for both phones were set the same? I have been looking into all the settings, but just cant figure it out why. (both phones were using
 the same theme during the comparison) The screen colour on my phone just looks abit dull and yellow-ish...<br />
Also Vodafone allows Active Standby on the N70.<br />
Is it worth taking my phone back to the shop and maybe sign up for Vodafone instead?<br />
Would anyone here recommend 3 over Vodafone for any reason? (apart from the massive amount of free minutes)<br />
<br />
Cheers,
                </div>

            Silly question but i thought i'd ask.<br />
<br />
It's not the way your holding the phone is it, you may be holding it in a such a way that you've got a finger or thumb over the light sensor, therefore making the screen duller.

            No, I put both phones on the table side by side. I just took a picture of the two phones, it's not quite obvious in the photo, but you can still tell there is a difference. Is there a way I could upload and share the photo here?

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been facing the same issues for a few months now, getting a "<em>Something went wrong Please try again later. 0x80048103...</em>" message each time I try to sign in from an Office app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 precisions:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am purposely using a 2016 pro desktop version of Office and signing-in with my 365 credentials so it saves my docs on Onedrive</li><li>it worked perfectly for a year or so until it stopped working for no reason (or probably because of Windows or Office update that did not like the duplicity of versions?)</li><li>because I can't sign in I also have difficulties to send and track feedback from the feedback hub</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is a nightmare. I am losing a hell of a time and not benefitting from most offline-online features normally accessible via the 365 subscription I pay each month.&nbsp;
</span>I am sure it is a minor problem. Please help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Thierry</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had same problem (same error but with "Micrososft Store" and "Xbox" apps). Today I finded out solution. Maybe it will be helpfull also for you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Main step was to remove stored credentials (remembered username with password ) of problematic MicrosoftAccounts from Windows 10. I am not talking about removing account from OS. When I removed stored accounts informations, applications asked me for my
 username and password even they suggested me to use one of remembered accounts. And this approach worked for me to solve 0x80048103 error</div>
<div><br />
<div>Steps to solve this problem are:&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>1. run Powershell</strong></div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">WindowsButton + R</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">Type "Powershell" -&gt; click OK</div>
<div><strong>2. run app "Stored User Names and Passwords"&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">In Powershell type command</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">"rundll32.exe keymgr.dll,KRShowKeyMgr"</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">Command opens little window with title "Stored User Names and Password"</div>
<div><strong>3. remove problematic MicrosoftAccount</strong></div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">Select problematic account (click on it) in list (microsoft accounts starts with prefix "MicrosoftAccount:user=" )</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">Click at "Remove"</div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">Close "Stored User Names and Passwords". Click at "Close" button</div>
<div><strong>4. restart preoblematic app and try to login</strong></div>
<div style="margin-left: 30px">When app, after restart, will suggest you existing account, dont worry. After choose suggested account, it will ask you for password (maybe also fingerprint, and so on ... )</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good luck. Hope it help.</div>

                    Hi Guys I recently updated my N80 with NSU. Everything went ok, except for this message every time that I switch on my phone. "Unable to complete installation from the Memory Card. To install remaining applications go to App.mgr" I also have these strange
 copies under my AppManager. I have been told to use a Card Reader and delete a folder named Uninstall. I did that but this did not resolve the problem. Is there another way to do it or give me a directory using a Card Reader?? Thanks guys

            I had the same issue: Backup your data on a PC. Copy your data to a smartcard.<br />
<br />
Two possible solutions<br />
<br />
1. Use the Windows Explorer intergration and delete od programs from the memory card.<br />
<br />
2. Format the memorycard (check the backup on your PC!!)<br />
<br />
Reg,<br />

            <p>Yup, just ran into this today with my 950XL dual sim.&nbsp; After futzing around with tech support we hit a dead-end as they couldn't see the second sim which was need to re-register the phone.&nbsp; Assuming a bad sim card I went to the AT&amp;T store. After they messed
 around with it for an hour and changed out the sim card with no luck, they realized the issue is the shut-down of the 2G network.&nbsp; You can manually go into the settings and change which sim is used for data to make it the active one but it appears you can
 no longer have dual active sims which is the only thing that tipped this phone in Microsoft's favor making me buy it.&nbsp; If I had known this I would have sold this thing last summer when I had offers on eBay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now what to I buy? Can't stomach the idea of another iPhone after seeing the iPhone 6 persistent issue that Apple can't fix for my wife and I don't want a smaller Galaxy 7.&nbsp; Looks like I'm in between great options at the moment...wish there was a Surface
 phone.</p>

</p><p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Bio Enrollment is not enabled in&nbsp;Build 10049&nbsp;of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is the module that will implement Bio Authentication in Windows. It has been code named Windows Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is an article with more information.</p>
