<h2>            How to set a default download folder.</h2>
                    I discovered that there was a download folder inside of the download folder, so i deleted the one that was inside and moved all the files in it. and then, every time i tried to export something from the download folder, the system looks for download/download
 folder(the download folder that was inside of the download folder, the one that i deleted) and tells me that the folder is deleted. is there any ways to set the default download folder as the folder that i want so that i won't keep getting this error? it's
 driving me crazy. plz help.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>Setting up a default download folder will depend on what application are you using. For example, you are using Internet Explorer, you can change the default download folder by pressing
<strong>Ctrl + J </strong>on your keyboard to pull-up View Downloads window. You can click
<strong>Options</strong> to modify and select a new default download location by clicking
<strong>Browse</strong> and select a folder you want then click <strong>OK</strong>. In this case, we suggest that you recreate the download folder to avoid getting an error. Configure first your default download folder for you to delete the existing folder.

<p>Thank you for updating us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue still persists, <span>we suggest that you create a new user account with Administrator privileges and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to this support article for the steps on<span>&nbsp;</span></span>how to:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17197/windows-10-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set up accounts</a>.<br />
<br />
<span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching Start menu, Cortana, Search bar, Store and other Windows applications. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the
 issue is specific to a corrupted user profile.</span></p>

<h2>            Need to reboot every time I lose wifi connection</h2>
                    <p>When I lose wifi, I can see the network (and can connect with other devices), but when I try to connect on my pc, it will not work. &nbsp;I have tried turning off/on wifi, but that doesn't do it either. I don't want to have to reenter the code each time, but
 is there a fix so that I don't have to reboot every time this happens?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,&nbsp;</p>

<br />Could you please let me know if you see the camera in Device Manager? You can find out by following the below steps:
<br />- Press Windows key + x (or right-click the Windows start menu button)
<br />- Select Device Manager
<br />- Expand Imaging devices 
<br />- Do you see the external web cam here?
<br />- You might also see 'Other devices' in the list, expand this and see if the camera is showing up here
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes.
<br />
<br />Looking forward to your response,
<br />Nathan       
        </p>

<h2>            Microsoft wants to steal the consumers money&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I just read this off an article just a while ago.</p>

<p><em>"</em></p>
<p><em>Just like Sony’s PlayStation 4, the Xbox One includes a single wireless controller. As Microsoft revealed over the weekend&nbsp;, additional Xbox One controllers will cost $60–same as the PS4. That’s where the similarities end.</em></p>
<p><em>Whereas the PlayStation 4 controller has a built-in rechargeable battery, the Xbox One controller runs on
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">AA batteries out of the box.</span> If you don’t want battery life to get in the way of your play time on the Xbox One, you must purchase a<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> $25 play and charge kit</span>, which
 includes a rechargeable battery pack and charging cable. Either that, or you can keep your controller tethered to the console via a micro USB connection at all times. This connection will power the controller, but it
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">won’t charge your batteries.</span></em></p>
<p><em>Should you decide to buy a second controller,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> you can get a bundle with the Play and Charge kit for $75.</span> The grand total, then, is $<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">600 for the console and two controllers
 with rechargeable batteries.</span></em></p>
<p><em>It gets worse: If you’re into online gaming, you might want a headset to chat with friends. T<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">hat’s another $25&nbsp;with Microsoft’s console.</span> Add that to the cost of the two controllers and charge kits, and
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">now you’re up to $625.</span> And you still<strong> haven’t bought any games yet</strong>."</em></p>

<p><span>Microsoft what the hell is wrong with you guys?<br />

<p>This isn't news, Its been like this for the xbox 360. At the end of the day Microsoft is a company trying to make profit. They are not a charity that should just give their products away. I'm surprised Sony aren't charging more the company made a £160m loss

    <title>asus tek creative labs sound chip driver blocked in windows 7 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clauderarmstrong  say:</h3>
<h2>            asus tek creative labs sound chip driver blocked in windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    In 2010, I bought an ASUS Tek Crosshair IV MoBo that has a VIA chip rewritten by ASUS with Creative Labs' SupremeFX X-FI sound card. On initial Windows 7, 64 bit installation, this worked with the application drivers and user control panel.
<br />
<br />
However, when I updated Windows 7 with SP1, that driver and user control panel do not work, and in fact, on every start, I have to manually initiate the audio driver load operation, as there are no audio drivers loaded by Windows 7 startup, and those that are
 loaded by the system automatically in its search for drivers after my making the request do not load the Creative Labs' control panel sound console.<br />
<br />
ASUS has not updated the control panel since the first edition, so perhaps it does not work with SP1? Or, does SP1 now write a faulty driver that does not recognize, or even may block the Creative Labs' VIA chip drivers?<br />
<br />
That SupremeFX X-FI is one of the main reasons I bought this gamers' MoBo, as it has excellent sound management. I'd really like to have it work natively. Any ideas?<br />
<br />

            "Yes" to both. ASUS engineers altered the VIA chip, wrote the driver, and that 2009 console driver is not updated. With Windows 7 native, pre-SP1, that driver worked very well on this Crosshair IV board. The moment I loaded the SP1 update, the X-Fi console
 disappeared..<br />
<br />
With ASUS moving rapidly in the development of the Crosshair MoBo line, it seems they wrote a Windows 7 compatible driver and console for version IV, and Microsoft failed to adapt W7 SP1 to it. That's my guess, as I have seen how unique hardware becomes orphanware
 with OS developers' focus on more mainstream product.<br />
<br />
I hope I am wrong, but I've pretty much given up hope that either Microsoft or ASUS Tek would make Windows 7 SP1 and/or the ASUS Creative Labs' on the altered VIA chip work together.<br />
<br />
Oddly, the way I set the X-Fi chip up to produce sound still seems to work, as the sound sent to the external amp has the same crisper tones and fullness added back to the lossy codecs used for many videos. But, no console now to actually verify this as fact.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
I will be happy to enter the specs from the MoBo installer manual. Let me know if that would help.<br />

<br />
The manual for my MoBo is . . .<br />
<span><span>Version</span>&nbsp; <span>E5443 <br />
<br />
The last one listed.<br />
<br />
Turn-scroll to page xii. The "High Definition Audio" specs detail this hardware.<br />
<br />
On the driver DVD, under "Drivers" menu, the "VIA Audio Driver" and "Sound Blaster X-Fi" are the two affected drivers.&nbsp; These are listed on page 4-2 of the manual.<br />
<br />
On the ASUS support page, this is the driver listed under the "Audio" listing. . .<br />
<br />
</span></span><span>VIA Audio Driver V6.0.1.8100 for Windows XP 32/64bit &amp; Vista 32/64bit &amp; Windows7 32/64bit.(WHQL)<br />
<br />
I have tried many times to install it after the SP1 update, and the console does not appear. Perhaps I am missing something? I've spent many hours looking for solutions.<br />
<br />
ASUS isn't clear about the X-Fi console, but I think this is it . . .<br />
<br />
</span><span>Sound Blaster X-Fi Utility V1.0(R19) for Windows XP 32/64bit &amp; Vista
<br />

<br />
It is the final item under the "Utilities" listing. As you can see, the date on this is November, 2009.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Anyway, thank you for helping. I do appreciate you for this.<br />
<br />
</span><span><span>One further item that may help is the error popup when I try to run the console . . .<br />
</span></span>Umm . . . I see images are not supported. The popup message reads: "The audio device supported by this application is not detected. The application will exit."<br />

            <p>Its the hardware makers who are required to update/create new drivers, if they wish.</p>
<p>An MS sp update consists primarily of security updates and it is not unusual for this to break a third party piece of software/driver. Usually the third party produces an updated driver.</p>
<p>I think your best bet is the Asus forums</p>

            What I suspect is that I'm the paying fool to have bought either the OS or the MoBo.
<br />
<br />
At least AppleC has, or at least Had, the right idea, originally. "Control the hard and software, and developers of both follow guidelines that protect the source of income for both. Redmond never learned that, or cared, because there were double-speak marketers
 and lawyers by the hundreds to promo the trialware it markets to a lame-game public. But, what the heck, it's only money . . .<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the Rocket have a Rocket Block?<br />
Shotgun have Shotgun block?<br />
Gravity Hammer have a Hammer block?<br />
Does The Spartan laser have a laser Block?<br />
Etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The Shotgun got a range increase... the Sword lost the ability to swing faster if you melee and have ANYTHING block it...
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
What's even worse? About 90% of the time I get sword block, or I sword block, it's because I melee and hope for the best. It's all luck based!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Anyone else hate Sword Block <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-18.gif" /></p>

<p>Since I'm playing Free For All more often now, I have to say: The sword feels just worthless to me. I much rather rush the Shotgun and Grenade Launcher before I rush the sword.</p>
<p><br />
All the grenades being thrown, Sword Block, Shotgun, Sniper, DMR, they all make the Sword less deadly...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Sword Block stuns the sword user for a second, enough time for the enemy to step back and fire the last two shots needed to kill you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, what's with the sword still killing me when I get a Bulltrue, every time? o-o'</p>

<p>The Sword/Bulltrue relationship must be one of the things I've had to explain the most for the Forums, but it basically [very basically] goes like this:</p>
<p>Lag compensation recognises that the other player actually did hit you. While it's annoying to you, it's only fair, and prior to this system those with a better connection in a given match got this kind of advantage over those that were matched up from miles
 away.</p>
<p>Trust me, I am more than pleasantly familiar with this.</p>
<p>_____________________________</p>
<p>And I still think you may be understating the power of the Sword: it still destroys when it's used even at a mediocre level (in a roughly even match, of course) and can wreck if it's used properly.</p>

<p>Speedy~</p>
<p>I have to say that I disagree. &nbsp;Frankly, I don't know how to lunge and I hate that weapon...but (like Bob said) it's nasty deadly. &nbsp;A Rocket Lancher has 4 shots. &nbsp;You can get double or triple kills, but when you're getting 1, that's only 1 kill. &nbsp;The Sword,
 meanwhile, has 10 kills in it. &nbsp;Each kill takes 10%. &nbsp;A full, new 100% Sword has 10 kills to it. &nbsp;With the lunge added...the advantage of the Sword is just too much. &nbsp;Sword block (to me) is a positive thing in at least diminishing the god-mode of that weapon.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>No - Rockets, Shotgun, Hammer and Spartan Laser DO NOT have block. &nbsp;But they (all but the Shotgun) also don't have 10 kills. &nbsp;A Full shotgun has 30...but maybe they think that the shotty doesn't have lunge either...so that evens the two a bit.</p>
<p>I don't hate Sword Block...I hate the Sword.</p>

<p>This is just another example of Speedy latching on to the "cool" kids on Bungie.net who love to try and make their opinions fact and all that good stuff... They are so wrong in every way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, it's completely logical step in balancing the weapon sandbox. Halo 2 was without a doubt the worst balanced game in the series in terms of the Sword. You could run around with a BR and lure people into chasing you. You press Y and before you even
 have the Sword out you're lunging at them for an easy kill. Ruined CQC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Halo 3 improved on this by making a small animation where you have to charge the Sword up before you could attack with it. Much better than 2, but still a bit overpowered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Halo: Reach introduces Sword Block to help balance it even more. No longer is CQC completely decided by whoever has the Sword on tiny maps. With some skill you can time it to get a small chance to kill the other player.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sword Block doesn't effect me all that much. It's not based on luck. It hardly ever actually happens and even when it does I can still get the kill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Sword Block is such a big issue, tell that to the guys in this game:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Reach/GameStats.aspx?gameid=636952658&amp;player=MattKohl101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Reach/GameStats.aspx?gameid=636952658&amp;player=MattKohl101</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of them were able to Sword Block but I still easily got the kill. The only way I died was because of a lucky Plasma Grenade stick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only reason sword block would be there is for the range of the sword, but since shotgun now has more range sword block is completely unneccessary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, that has nothing to do with Sword Block. If you have a Shotgun, you and the Sword guy are already set for a battle. The Shotgun does usually win if you get the drop on the Sword guy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sword Block is there because it was still the end-all weapon at CQC. It was better in Halo 3 than 2 (Didn't it have unlimited ammo in Halo 2?), but still guaranteed you at least a Killing Frenzy with Active Camo or if you were on a small map.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sword Block is there for those WITHOUT a Shotgun or any other Power Weapon to defend themselves. It balances the Sword almost perfectly in the current weapon sandbox.</p>

<p>I do agree with the rest of your points in both posts, but I think Sprint + Evade - Sword Block still makes the Sword more dangerous in Reach than H3

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion. I had tried that earlier today and posted about it here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/file-history-cleanup-not-finding-versions-to/7a005e04-a293-48e6-a8a2-d20263d3289e?tm=1523897362750</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see in my post, even the cleanup option is not working properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the response to my&nbsp;post, it sounds like File History cannot be counted on to work as it should. It is frustrating that rather than tell users about this failure, Microsoft continues to encourage us to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Windows update  KB3140741 Destroyed my networking</h2>
                    <p>Right microsoft staff, i DO NOT want your false help here. "oh it could be a problem with your hardware, something to do with your programs please try all these useless methods" Your stupid latest update has prevented me from staying online for more then
 an hour. At first I though oh no worries it's just a minor bug. I tried literally every fix I could and nothing helped. I even completely removed EVERYTHING from my hard drive and reinstalled windows and still the problem stayed. I even wasted MY MONEY on
 a new wireless card. Bare in mind I'm young and I barely have any money to my name and now I've wasted my money on your &nbsp;incompetent update teams terrible work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is 100% your fault microsoft. This has nothing to do with me. This is on you. Now like i said i don't want your false help telling me to un install this or check for that. I want you to plain and simply tell me how to force un install this crippling
 update or how i can go back to windows 8.1. I've had this awful OS for over a month and you guys removed the option to revert from me which by the way is a stupid idea. I still have my windows 8.1 disc so if theres any way i can restore it from there that
 would be great.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If any real people would like to please give me a helping hand, i would be extremely greatful :) There are two errors that trouble shooter has picked up and thats "one of more protocols are missing from this computer" &amp; "windows could not automatically detect
 this networks proxy settings" I'm sorry if i seems frustrated and angry but this windows update has made me miss uni deadlines and has been frustrating me since the update came out. Thankyou hope to hear from... someone soon</p>

<h2>            Server 2012 R2 boots in safe mode only, in normal startup - black screen, mouse cursor blinks, keyboard numlock blinks right after windows boot logo</h2>
                    <p>Server is failing to boot normally, I can only boot it into safe mode successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you boot it normally, it goes through startup, goes past windows logo, and then enters black screen with mouse cursor in the middle, that blinks. At the same time as it blinks, there is also NumLock LED on the keyboard that blinks too. If I move mouse
 cursor on the screen, it resets back to the center after it blinks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the safe mode I looked through the event log, and I found that there was a security update installed on the day of the crash. I tried to uninstall it, but windows tells me every time that it was not able to complete it successfully and reverts it back
 when rebooting. So I can't get rid of it to see if it was the problem. The security update that is refusing to uninstall is KB4056895</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran SFC /Scannow command in CMD in Safe Mode, it ran, told me it fixed errors, but this problem still persists as I described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

<h2>            AOE 2 not working on Win 8.1 - Used to work fine - SOLVED&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I have been having a hard time finding out what is wrong with my computer. I had AOE 1 and the explansions (II and Conquerors) installed and never had any problems with it. I have not installed any other application, but today I tried playing the
 game and it just would not start. The game installs fine then when I go to play and it simply never starts.&nbsp; I don't get any compatibility or error messages. Age Of Empires 1 works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer info: </p>
<p>Processor Intel Core i73630QM running with Intel Graphics 4000 driver version 10.18.10.3308.</p>
<p>Apparently this is not the latest version, but when I try intalling the new one it says it is not compatible with my processor.</p>
<p>I checked the computer manufacturer website (ASUS) and I do have the latest driver available there.
</p>
<p><strong>Steps I have tried:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Downloaded and re-installed DirectX </li><li>run the game in compatibility mode</li><li>installed the KB3086255 update for secdrv.sys</li><li>Reinstalled the games</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>tried playing Age of Mythology and found the same issue</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>tried a different computer which was running on Win 7 and had the same issue.
</li><li>I updated this second computer to Win 10 and it still will not work. Same problem on both computers (Win 8.1 and 10). After launching the game, I selct "play" and nothing happens. Again, Age 1 works on both computers.</li></ul>
<p>Here is something I noticed. When I run the Direct X test I get a message saying files are missing (ddhelp.exe, dxapi.sys, d3dm.dll and d3dpmesh.dll).</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATES:</p>
<p>I re-installed the game in full installation mode and added the patch available at http://userpatch.aiscripters.net. It worked on my Win 10 computer.<br />
</p>
<p>I installed the Age of Empires 2 the Conquerors 1.0 update (available at http://www.fileplanet.com/83288/80000/fileinfo/Age-of-Empires-2:-The-Conquerors-1.0c-update) and the patch at http://userpatch.aiscripters.net. The game now runs on my win 8.1 computer!!!!</p>

 Again, Age 1 works on both computers.</p>

<p>Changed my Display to 1080p, detected display and disabled it...</p>

<p>Thanks Jared, but I've studied all the Xbox forum support back to front still with no help.... I updated the dashboard to the new view when I turned it on last night. I haven't actually used the console yet so it isn't a matter of the sound stopping working,
 it has never worked from the beginning.</p>
<p>Does HDMI support sound output without an AV cable, or do I require one?</p>

<p>Jared, I'm interested hearing what was the solution to your problem?</p>
<p>I'm having same kind of issues. Only thing that is different in our problems is that when I have Display Detection on, my sound won't work. When I disable the Display Detection, sound works but I can't watch movies from DVD or Zune.</p>

<p>Lack of Pain, thank you for your advice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I already have gone through all the things in that page and they didn't help. I also have been in contact with XboxSupport's Twitter account and also to Xbox Support by phone. From the Xbox Support I got the exactly same suggestions, but I
 have done everything; reset display settings, another TV, another cable etc. It also comes down to my Xbox. They also gave me a way how to delete the latest dashboard update and install it again, but it didn't help.</p>
<p>Now they want me to pay for the fixing of my console :( Little weird because this was caused only by the fact that I used my console in a VGA-projector and after it hasn't been working.</p>

<p>I just ran into the same exact problem &nbsp;you did, i've been using a VGA adapter and head set, the other day i plugged it into another TV to have no sound or video at all. &nbsp;So i reset the video settings and finally got the video working, but now there's no
 sound. &nbsp;I've checked the TV and Xbox setting and their all set how they should be, but still no sound from the HDMI cable. &nbsp;I've also used the standard component cables and got sound using them, just not through the HDMI cable.</p>

                    <p>I have an Asus P7P55D motherboard. ALL I wish to know is&nbsp;there anyone else who has this motherboard who has successfully installed Windows 10?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read a lot of answers relating to windows 10 installation failures. To&nbsp;upgrade your graphic/sound drivers ,installing dll files etc.
</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;had repeated update failures. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have not heard anyone mentioning Motherboard compatibility? Or is this a&nbsp;problem known by experienced IT experts ,Who think we all know about this.</p>
<p>I just wish I could receive simplistic answers&nbsp;by someone knowledgeable with my problems.</p>

            <p>Hello Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for showing interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the installation if Windows 10 starts, it automatically checks the compatibility of the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, to check with a specific motherboard model, you may check the support website of the manufacturer to see if the drivers are available or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Asus P7P55D motherboard, driver are not available for Windows 10.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=P7P55D&amp;p=1&amp;s=32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=P7P55D&amp;p=1&amp;s=32</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you may try to install the drivers in compatibility mode once you have installed Windows 10 and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do so,</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Firstly download the driver from your computer's manufacturer website and then install it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Refer (Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows)</span></strong></p>

            <p>Hello Sahil, thanks for response.</p>
<p>Your answers are good. However so far I have not been able to download Win 10. Update Failures so far about 14. Get error code C190011F using windows update. The Media Creation tool get error "Modern day Host has stopped working". Are these errors associated
 with my motherboard?</p>
<p>Appreciate your comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p><em>"I just wish I could receive simplistic answers ..."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>No such thing really, but the motherboard was released in '09 and I&nbsp; reckon there should be no serious issue.</p>
<p>While there are no Win10 specific&nbsp; drivers for the motherboard you would want to have
</p>
<p>the most recent available from ASUS.</p>
<p>Whether using the older drivers becomes a problem over time, is not a known known.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have a dedicated graphics card (shameful on such a nice MB ;D ) the problem could be due</p>
<p>to the older Integrated graphics. One poster here with an older version of Intel GMA uninstalled the</p>
<p>driver and was able to download. Too limiting imo.</p>
<p>(My AsRock motherboard (2011) has a new Chipset, Managment engine, and Realtek audio driver for Win10,</p>
<p>but these were not installed until after the update from Win7.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Apparently the error '<em>Modern day Host has stopped working</em>' can result from too little space on C:\ .</p>
<p>You need a fair bit of extra space beyond what the final install will total to allow for the Temp files while
</p>
<p>downloading and for various backup folders.</p>
<p>This can vary according to how big your current Window is because the update retains a copy of the three</p>
<p>Programs folders (maybe not everything within. ) as well as other User data to allow for rolling back
</p>
<p>to your current OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Some Anti-virus have been causing problems with the upgrade, so updating your AV&nbsp; to the most
</p>
<p>recent version may help as well.</p>
- I would also stick with using the Media Creation Tool for the upgrade.
<p>
</p><p>Protect yourself from the effects of Murphy's Law.&nbsp; If you have a spare HDD&nbsp; clone/image your current
</p>
<p>C:\ so you can painlessly change back if desired (or dual boot while experimenting and learning about Win10).
</p>
<p>Upgrading is risky enough, but rolling back is more so. </p>
<p>
</p><p>------------</p>
<p>[<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>EDIT:</em></span>&nbsp; Further to the comments above -</p>
<p>I have 'upgraded' to Win10 twice. I reformatted the Win10 HDD after two weeks on the first go because</p>
<p>of ongoing issues with the cumulative updates, and the Start Menu and Taskbar locking up.</p>
<p>While my second install did not initially have these issues (and with both installs I had no other real issues</p>
<p>and my games all ran well), the problems&nbsp; with the 'cumulative' updates persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not the updates that were a problem with the first upgrade. They installed properly when doing the second</p>
<p>upgrade, but subsequent cumulative updates have failed, Including the most recent one tonight.
</p>
<p>I haven't dared try installing the 'Fall (fail ?) update 1511 yet, but those who have not yet done an 'upgrade'</p>
<p>to Win10 may not have issues with this update either (judging by my previous re-update experience).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main issue with these failed updates is that Windows gets stuck in a loop of install - uninstall, and I have</p>
<p>to switch the machine off, and disconnect the internet to stop the routine.</p>
<p>When booting back into Win10 I have to then run the tool that 'hides' these failed updates to prevent the</p>
<p>situation from starting again.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short - Win10's update system is borked, as is evidenced by the many people posting with issues with both</p>
<p>cumulative and the 'new' major release . I <em>never</em> had issues with Windows updates on XP or Win7.</p>
<p>Do make sure your current OS is backed up, or personally... Don't install Win10.

<p>Still awaiting a reply from Sahil Microsoft support engineer, regarding&nbsp;motherboard comparability with Win.10..

<p>Any way thanks again for replies. Food for thought, do we upgrade or not when all programmes are working well with Windows 7.</p>

            <p><em>"Sahil Microsoft support engineer,&nbsp;</em><em> regarding&nbsp;motherboard comparability with Win.10</em>.<em> "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'support engineers', from my observations,&nbsp; are really just a pseudonym for call center, and mostly</p>
<p>cut and paste off a cheat sheet.</p>
<p>Often without fully reading the question, or so it should seem from the frequent irrelevant cut and paste responses.
</p>
<p>If you want a definitive (If, as I mentioned earlier, there is one) answer you will need to contact ASUS.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I have 283gb of free space on my hard drive."</em></p>
<p>- As long as that is on your C:\ partition there would be no issue with doing the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I am using&nbsp;Norton &nbsp;360 as my &nbsp;AV."</em></p>
<p>- Norton has had a reputation for causing issues such as mentioned for many years.</p>
<p>If you have the latest update it should be OK, but if not, it may be blocking the update to protect your OS.</p>
<p>- There will be no issue with the HD7850.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"do we upgrade or not when all programmes are working well with Windows 7."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly. Unless there is something in Win10 that you<em> need</em>, there is really no reason. Waiting until</p>
<p>near the end of the year from the 'official' release date should offer less overall potential for issues,</p>
<p>and there is no real benefit from DX12 currently.</p>
<p>For the most part Win10 functions about the same as Win7. The Start menu takes some adapting to, and</p>
<p>is loaded with what some regard as bloatware, which is tricky to get rid of (some can't be deleted at all).</p>
<p>There are fixes/workarounds, and there will be more as time goes by.</p>
<p>The link below shows how to be rid of some of the stuff that cannot be deleted -</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/224798/how-to-uninstall-windows-10s-built-in-apps-and-how-to-reinstall-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Uninstall Windows 10’s Built-in Apps (and How to Reinstall Them)</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Note that MS is pushing Win10 hard and subverting (because they have stopped publishing
</p>
<p>descriptions of what the updates do) people Win7/8/8.1 by installing updates to make these OS's
</p>
<p>more like Win10 regarding telemetry and DRM blocking (DRM blocking prevents playing many disk based games).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have over 150 games installed, and they all run well. There were some issues, but they were not too</p>
<p>difficult to fix. Three is one game I could not find a fix for (I've always used noCD's fixes for my disk based games</p>
<p>so the DRM blocking has not been an issue).</p>
<p>I have a couple of software that don't work properly which I uninstalled, but they were things I didn't really need,</p>
<p>and which will no doubt have a replacement soon enough. </p>
<p>However if you rely on an 'older' software that does not have a Win10 upgrade, you may not want Win10.</p>
<br />
<p>If you clone your OS, are curious, and like stuffing around with new tricks ( <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7e7dbd2-7c8b-47f1-a8d5-97f7bc96d20f" />) doing the upgrade is worth
</p>
<p>trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I can't offer more suggestions regarding your inability to do the upgrade.</p>
<p>You may find more information regarding the errors if you do some more searching.<br />
</p>
<p>Cheers - BD</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT: I just did the update to the new version (which, all new 'upgrades' will be getting )..
</p>
<p>Now I get to reset a lot of thing that have reverted to default. Great!</p>
<p>Including the bloatware, and some new bloatware that I had removed from the Start Menu - 'All Apps' section.</p>
<p>It is also doing the dictatorial Win10 thing by installing new drivers&nbsp; that I didn't ask for.</p>
<p>Including my Nvidia driver, which Win10 has oddly downgraded from 355.60 to 353.82 - So much for Windows</p>
<p>updates AI - I had blocked from being updated previously. <br />
</p>
<p>It's this &nbsp;Grand Poobah &nbsp; Big Brother Monopoly$oft&nbsp; knows best thing, which is part and parcel of Win10,</p>
<p>that is a major pet hate of mine. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/965d9a1d-f30e-4b6d-910e-6a05b0e88f4b" /></p>

            <p>Thanks BD,&nbsp;you have given me a&nbsp;lot to think about. I am going to sit back and wait for a while.&nbsp;At the end of the day Win 7 may come out the winner.
</p>
<p>I have a few simulation games and video editing software on my desktop and I do not want to lose them.</p>
<p>I do have win 10 installed on my laptop and it was a pain going through all the security to turn off the bits I did not want.</p>
<p>So we will see, thanks again for very helpful info.</p>

<p>Good day</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Gold subscription is used to maintain the servers and pay the salary/wages of the engineers working on them. Without the subscription we will have really bad gaming experiences as we will most likely be waiting a long time for the servers to come back
 online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox do give us something in return with the free Games with Gold every month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a fan of burgers, I think that means McD's, Five Guys &amp; Burger King should give me free burgers because I'm a fan of them because I don't want to pay for them and I can't enjoy them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point I'm making is Xbox Live is a service, it's a stable, secure &amp; consistent service with a dedicated team of professionals administering &amp; supporting it with hardware which has become the industry standard for online gaming introduced.&nbsp; None of that
 appears from nowhere &amp; has a cost involved, those costs have to be met from somewhere and well, just like my love of burgers, if you want a service, you pay for that service.&nbsp; There's plenty of ways one can reduce that cost, waiting for promotional offers,
 trading in old games, Microsoft rewards etc, but that service has to be paid for and if your devotion is as it's stated - which I don't doubt - the small cost will easily be outweighed by the benefits.&nbsp; I know Xbox live costs me less per hour than the price
 of a grocery bag in the UK (5p), small price to pay for what I get out of it!<br />

<p>Hi Angel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for voicing your opinion here on the forums! Xbox Live Gold is required to play any multiplayer game and a paid subscription is how Microsoft keeps their servers all over the world maintained, as keeping those servers up and running 24/7, 365 days
 a year all&nbsp;around the world costs a lot of money. It wouldn't be fair to make an exception for just one game or one person when paid games also need to pay for a subscription to play online.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
There are many ways to earn the Xbox live gold subscription. First you can look for deals to get the subscription initially. Then there is
<a href="https://news.xbox.com/2018/05/29/microsoft-rewards-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft rewards/Bing rewards</a>. This allows you to accumulate points from searches that everyone nowadays does and get points from purchases of games, DLC etc. With the points you can then turn around and purchase Xbox live gold subscription. As others
 have stated the fee is to keep servers up and running. With a live subscription you also get other benefits.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Example: if you just earn the search points a month its 15,000 points you can earn that's 500 a day for just searching different things on Bing. That equals 15 dollars in currency that is more than the price for a one month subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Since there is no further resolution and in an effort to minimize
 repetitive answers we will be locking this thread, but if you have any further questions or concerns feel free to come back to the Xbox forum (Do not repost the same question or thread as that would violate the

 be patient but am not doing a very good job.&nbsp; With that said....here I go again...</p>
<p>When I select RUN and key in Chkdsk /f and enter, I get the following:</p>
<p>The type of the file system is NTFS.&nbsp; Cannot lock current drive.&nbsp; Chkdsk cannot run because the colume is in use by another process.&nbsp; would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts?&nbsp; (Y/N)</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if I enter Y or N.&nbsp; Nothing seems to happen.&nbsp; Or at least nothing has changed.&nbsp; I cannot defrag.</p>
<p>When I try to defrag the c: drive, I get:&nbsp; Disk Defragmenter has detected that Chkdsk is scheduled to run on the volume: (C).&nbsp; Please run Chkdsk /f.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HELP!&nbsp; Someone told me that I would have to save all the stuff on my laptop that I wanted to keep and install a new hard drive.&nbsp; Is that the answer?&nbsp; Is there anything anyone can suggest that will fix this vicious cycle of run chkdsk, cannot run chkdsk,

<p>Try to Run it on Restart by Double clicking "<strong>My Computer</strong> " Right click<strong> C:\</strong> and select properties.</p>
<p>On the Local <strong>C:\</strong> Properties&nbsp; click on Tools tab and click on<strong>Check Now</strong> Button.</p>
<p>A Pop up window will open please check the two check boxes and click <strong>[OK</strong> ]</p>
<p>A confirmation window will open prompting you to run the chkdsk on Restart, please select<strong> Yes</strong>and Reboot your machine. Be patient as the procedure it can take a while to finsih.</p>
<p>Make sure to run a<strong> thorough</strong> scan for<strong> malware</strong> and<strong>viruse</strong> s on your system and also backup your data just in case the Hard drive really going!</p>
<p>Why you are trying this command, what is the reason?</p>

            It all started when I wanted to defrag....which I have always been able to do with no problem.&nbsp; The SYSTEM gave me the instruction to run the chkdsk /f.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rest, as they say, is history.&nbsp; OK, I did what you said to do.&nbsp; I'm going to close this and
 restart.&nbsp; I have the data backed up on an external hard drive.&nbsp; Will let you know if this works.&nbsp; And I will try to be patient.&nbsp; thanks

<p>I have the same problem! I can't run disk defragmenter, and even if I say yes to chkdsk it says that there isn't any direct access to the drive and restarts without any progress. Do you think my problem would resolve if I marked my drive as dirty? Also note
 that I don't have my XP installation CD, and have no means to backup my drive except for an 8 GB USB drive and a 4 GB online space provided by Norton. Also something that may be relevant I fixed my registry errors using CCleaner. I keep regular registry backups,
 but now that I notice a problem, I can't restore some of the backups (the one resulting from the first and oldest registry-fixing). It says : "Cannot access &lt;registry path&gt; : Error accessing the registry.</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>
I exported the registry values you wanted but when I paste them this site gives an error with a yellow sign and an exclamation mark. The error message is empty otherwise&nbsp; and nothing happens.<br />

<p>From the Disk Properties, Tools tab you choose the Defragment Now... button the message says:</p>
<p>there isn't any direct access to the drive</p>
<p>Or does it say something else and if something else, what exactly does the message say?</p>
<p>When you say it restarts, what restarts?</p>
<p>What are the details of the registry error you fixed with CCleaner (if you don't remember, say - I don't remember).</p>
<p>You can check the status of the dirty bit on any volume from a command prompt.</p>
<p>To do that, click Start, Run and in the box enter:</p>
<p><strong>cmd</strong></p>
<p>Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and then run the fsutil command on the volume of interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, to query the dirty bit on drive C, enter this command:<br />
<br />
<strong>fsutil dirty query C:</strong> <br />
<br />
Sample output: <br />
Volume C: is dirty<br />
Volume C: is not dirty</p>
<p>Type 'exit' to close the Command Prompt window.</p>
<p>If the volumes is dirty, the XP defragmenter will not run until the dirty bit is cleared.&nbsp; If you try to defragment a dirty volume, you will see a message similar to this:</p>
<p><strong>Disk Defragmenter has detected that Chkdsk is scheduled to run on this volume: (C:)</strong></p>
<p>This means that XP sees the volume is "dirty" and you can only clear the dirty bit with a check disk with error correction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A volume usually gets marked dirty after a power interruption while XP is running, aborted restart or ungraceful shutdown.&nbsp; Does any of that sound familiar?</p>
<p>First we need to see exactly what is going on and then you can fix things.&nbsp; You should not waste time trying things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide additional information about your system:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive?<br />
<br />
Fill in the blank:&nbsp; My system was working fine until: ____________________________________________.</p>

<p>When i choose "Defragment Now" and try to analyze or defragment a drive the message says:</p>
<p>"Disk Defragmenter has detected that Chkdsk is scheduled to run on the volume: (C:). Please run chkdsk /f."</p>
<p>I then tried doing that and it told me the disk was in use by another process and that the drive was locked and asked me if I wanted to schedule a disk check upon restarting, so I answered Y and it said that a disk check would run the next time i restarted
 my system. I then restarted and dskchk started working, but then it said it couldn't get a direct access to the volume.</p>
<p>I don't remember the registry error I fixed.</p>
<p>My local drive is dirty. My laptop has a charged battery life of about 45 seconds, so it often shut down unintentionally during blackouts, since I didn't have time to shut it down manually. Maybe this is also the reason why it is sluggish with 69% free hard
 disk space.</p>
<p>My System Specifications:</p>
<p>MS Windows XP Professional SP3 Media Center Edition</p>
<p>HP Pavilion dv6000 Laptop</p>
<p>Intel Core2 CPU T5600 @ 1.83 Ghz, 1.0 GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce Go 7400</p>
<p>I have a Norton 360, which was what informed me about my local disk volume containing errors.</p>
<p>I now started a new topic entitled "Chkdsk can't run because 'there is no direct access to the volume'"</p>

<h2>            &#34;Preparing Automatic Repair&#34; loop and cannot load Windows 8.1 installation media USB</h2>
                    <p>My basic problem is that when I try to boot normally, i.e. as my machine has successfully done for the past year or two, I get the blue windows logo boot screen with the spinning dots for a few seconds, then my machine appears to restart, then i get the
 same blue windows logo boot screen with "Preparing Automatic Repair" for a few more seconds, then another restart - an endless loop of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found numerous articles describing thi - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/how-to-fix-the-automatic-repair-loop-in-windows-81/bfc92bc7-031f-45d4-b623-bcb4847d32fd</p>
<p>...and and the most obvious first step seems to be to use the the installation cd/usb/dvd or create installation media per&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I use my Windows 8.1 installation dvd or my freshly created USB "installation media", i get the same results: &nbsp;The dvd/usb appears to load, such that I see the "press any key to boot from cd/dvd", then the blue windows logo screen with spinning
 dots for a few seconds, then a restart - also an endless loop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried tweaking the BIOS (even though it hadn't changed in years while reboots worked fine), but no change. &nbsp;I am able to load a live version of ubuntu 15 desktop via the same USB, and it seems to work fine. &nbsp;But for some reason, cannot seem to get
 past the blue windows logo with spinning dots screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>fwiw here is the main hardware:</p>

                    When I purchased my latest Window 10 2-in-1 in January it was possible to reveal the location of the place shown in the login screen picture. Two or three months ago this feature disappeared. I still see random pictures, when each one first appears I am
 asked if I like the photograph but I can no longer ask for details of the location. I find this most frustrating. &nbsp;

<p>Thanks for responding.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Windows Update confirms that I have the latest version of Windows 10 (64 bit).</p>

</p><p>It seems that Print Screen will not work prior to logging in. Perhaps I am using the wrong terminology to describe the screen. When I open my computer an attractive photograph of a scenic area is shown on my screen. This varies frequently and appears to
 be random. The photograph disappears when I log in and is replaced with my chosen wallpaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi - correct... you cannot use the Prtscr option at the log in stage... if you lock the screen by using
<strong>Winkey+L&nbsp;</strong> you should be able to snap it then... you should also be seeing the details there -&nbsp;as well as the 'like/not for me' options...</p>
<p>The loss of this information may be due to a network setting but&nbsp;first check if you are seeing anything in lock screen mode (this is assuming you have chosen Windows Spotlight for your lockscreen background.) - Cheers, Ric.</p>

<p>Thanks Ric. Using Winkey+L isn't doing it for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hadn't heard of Windows Spotlight and so did some research. I am using it. According to Wikipedia "For most of the images, no photo credits are available, but some do display information about where the picture was taken". Perhaps I have viewed all the
 images for which credits are available and am now being presented with random images selected by Bing. Liam</p>

<p>Hi Liam - I&nbsp;recall another contributor&nbsp;in this forum&nbsp;has created a link in Wikipedia naming many of the earlier pictures' locations - but new ones are being added all the time and they do usually carry some sort of info... sometimes it's promotional stuff
 for an MS product or other service, but there's usually something to read.</p>
<p>I'll get back tomorrow with a few settings you can check. - R.</p>
<p>Here's an example (from last year, but this is still how it should appear...)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/834e3d23-46ca-480b-a047-f16f888542e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/834e3d23-46ca-480b-a047-f16f888542e9" height="379" width="650" /></a></p>

<p>Hi again - These are the settings you should check - it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
may</span> change spotlight behaviour but unfortunately there seem to be many variables so no guarantees!</p>
<p>In <strong>Personalization</strong> - Lock Screen Settings - turn off all associated settings and apps (these can be turned on again later) - try toggling between Picture and Windows Spotlight a few times - using the Winkey+L check as you go...</p>
<p>If that makes no difference try checking Settings - <strong>Network and Internet</strong> - if you are on (or have set) 'Metered Connx' then Spotlight will not work correctly... otherwise try a Network Reset (towards foot of page) -&nbsp;note the alert that you
 may need to reset other network devices afterwards so only proceed with that if you are OK to do so.</p>
<p>If you are still not seeing any change just try switching to the 'Picture' setting in Personalization for a few days - then try switching back... beyond that it's really getting into sledgehammer/nut territory (clean installs etc.) so probably just best
 to stick with what you're getting if there are no other major issues. - R.</p>

</p><p>There's no option in Skype to configure which device will the notification alert appear. As long as you're using one account on both devices, the notification alerts should pop-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, please make sure that you're accessing the correct account on both devices and&nbsp;the notification settings are enabled on both platforms. If the issue persists, try uninstalling and reinstalling Skype.</p>
