<h2>            Black Screen on new Skylake i5 with Z170 and NVidia GTX970 with Windows 10 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>I completed a new PC build using below mentioned parts... I sometimes receive black screen... when it runs it runs fantastic but randomly on windows 10... crashes... with a black screen.</p>
<p>Completed build: <a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/p/GCXr4D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://pcpartpicker.com/p/GCXr4D</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check the event viewer after the crash and hard reset I see Event id 56 ACPI 5 application popup as one of the errors and when I go down the event log I see a NVAPI.dll failed at the time of crash... I will rule out PSU since power supply is adequate..
 Some of my leads after a lot of googling is as per below, if any body can comment to eliminate some of the items for troubleshooting.. it will be helpful, Thanks!</p>
<ul>
<li>any known issues with RAM, skylake processor and Z170 motherboard? If RAM is incompatible the computer should not event boot right? It runs at 60 frames most games when the computer is running...</li><li>any known bios issues with gigabyte but will that cause black screen randomly?</li><li>
<p>issues with windows update process?</p>
</li><li>
<p>I am going to try integrated GPU on i5 this week to verify and see if it is only the NVidia card driver that is causing the issue...</p>
</li></ul>

<h2>            Hyper-V VSS Writer</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>My backups are currently failing I have narrowed this down to the Hyper-v VSS Writer as when I stop the Hyper-V Virtual Machine Management service the backup succeeds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to disable the Hyper-v VSS writer without stopping the Hyper-V Virtual Machine Management service? Or is there a way to stop the VSS Shadow copy from using the Hyper-v VSS writer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

<h2>            Overcoming&#58;  &#34;you&#39;ll need to provide administrator permission to delete this folder&#34; - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just deleted Mozilla Firefox from my computer, but still need to delete my user settings, preferences, etc.&nbsp;(located in this location:&nbsp; C:\Users\C S\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox).&nbsp; Firefox states I need to get rid of these User Files so I can reinstall
 FireFox and have a clean slate / no user data or preferences&nbsp;essentially.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">When I attempt to delete it, this message comes up:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>"you'll need to provide administrator permission to delete this folder"
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">and when I click Continue, this message comes up:&nbsp; </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>"You require permission from DESKTOP-A8K3KI7/C S to make changes to this folder"&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">When I click on the Try Again button, it just repeats the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, In the Window titled: <em>"Change your account </em>type" my account is listed as
<em>"Local Account </em>Administrator" and the Radio Button is on the "Administrator" option and the "Standard" Radio Button option is grayed out.&nbsp; Also, this is the only User Account on this computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the above in mind, How can I Delete a Folder (or File) that requires so called Administrator Permission?</p>

<p>The original Halo was amazing, so releasing the same game with better visuals and sound is a no brainer really. Only had Halo CE on the PC, which had the first taste of Halo online before they built it into Halo 2, so hoping alot of that PC Online will be
 present in this version....release day pick up and reason to go Gold for me. I am a Halo fanboy</p>

<p>Well i'm not sure if there both on the same disk or the multiplayer is standalone, but that's pretty much the jist of it. &nbsp;Halo 1 campaign remade in HD, and the multiplayer is remade in Reach engine.</p>
<p>Personally i won't buy if for multiplayer, Reach multiplayer is lame.</p>

    <title>Power Cord Replacement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seanpwns7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Cord Replacement</h2>
                    
<p>So I got home from work today and my stupid dog had decided to eat the power cable connecting the brick to the wall. &nbsp; Called up 1-800-4MY- XBOX and was told my only solution was to "shop around on amazon or at gamestop" because Microsoft couldn't sell me
 a replacement. &nbsp;Only found one thing on amazon and it looks shady and ships from China. &nbsp;No thanks. &nbsp;Oh and I was told that if the cord I used wasn't an official Microsoft product, I would be voiding the console's warranty.</p>

<p>So in short, I can only use one type of power cord and the company that makes said cord AND the console it powers can't effing sell me one. &nbsp; WHAT THE ***?!?!?!?!?!?!!</p>

<p>Lucky,</p>
<p>&nbsp;You should be able to get a cord but it would be getting the entire power brick and cord. You can simply go to
<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://myservice.xbox.com</a> , register your console, then click replace an accessory, and select Power Supply. Granted I know you may not need the entire thing but at least you can receive
 an official replacement without having to worry about voiding your warranty. Hope this helps!</p>

            I hear what you say but what you report still suggests that the office server's password policy has been applied to your laptop. If you have a higher version of Windows 7 then you can use the policy editor to disable the complexity requirements:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Launch gpedit.msc</li><li>Follow this path: Local Computer Policy / Computer Configuration / Windows Settings / Security Settings / Account Policies / Password Policy. Double-click "Password must meet complexity requirements" on the right, then set it to "disabled".</li></ol>

<h2>            Is There a way to Shut Down Windows 10 When an Update is Waiting Without Updating&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent feedback on this issue to the Windows 10 Feedback Hub.&nbsp; I would like to be able to shutdown Windows 10 when an update is shown in the Start Button Power Options, but you can't do that currently.&nbsp; Options are:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Sleep</strong></li><li><strong>Update and Restart</strong></li><li><strong>Update and Shutdown</strong></li></ul>
<p>Shutdown (Without updating) This last one is needed, badly and is missing, currently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to in the event of threatening storms, have the option to Shutdown my Windows 10 PC without updating.&nbsp; Yesterday, despite great weather, we had a commercial power failure for three hours.&nbsp; Just like that.&nbsp; Updates were in the query.&nbsp; System
 did a scan disk upon restoration of power,, and I also did a manual scan when power came back and everything was OK, but I was forced to take the update, due to an unexpected power failure. Windows 10 needs a quick way to shut down without worrying about updating
 for reasons like these,</p>
<p>

            Hi JackPlatt,
<br />
<br />Another option for shutting down the computer is pressing the Alt Key and F4 key from the desktop.
<br />
<br />It will bring up a box to then select what option you wish to shut the computer down.
<br />
<br />Let us know if i can be of further help
<br />
<br />Thanks

            Answering your questions:
<div>1. Lenovo ThinkPad S230u (Twist)</div>
<div>2. I was running Norton Internet Security (version 21, which is supposedly Win 8.1 compatible)</div>
<div>3. I have no particular issue running SkyDrive, but after a blue screen reset, I frequently found that although my system indicated that I was connected to wifi, I did not actually successfully get any on-line content or functionality until I turned off
 and on the wifi connectivity.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried both disabling SkyDrive in the Group Policy editor and uninstalling Norton Internet Security. &nbsp;I am still getting regular crashes. &nbsp;The most recent one showed "MsMpEng.exe" as the process name in the MiniDump file, which I understand is part
 of Windows Defender.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Checking the disk for errors and running a virus scan both had no result - no errors, no viruses.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Still getting two or three BSODs per day.</div>

<p>Logon credentials are cached for a certain period of time so that domain users can log into their user accounts on the domain while off-site. Your credentials have expired and you need to do a clean install of Windows so you can use the machine at home.
 You can get into the computer by logging into the local administrator account so you can copy your data to external media such as a USB external hard drive before doing the clean install. If you don't know the local administrator's password (and you probably
 don't), then <span>there are ways to change the password for that account to a blank. Microsoft doesn't permit us to tell you how in these forums. Their house, their rules. Use Google or ask a local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad
 type of place). Or you could simply not bother booting into Windows and retrieve the data by one of the following methods instead:</span></p>
<p>1. Pull the drive and put it in a USB drive enclosure or use a USB drive adapter. Attach this to a computer running a working install of XP/Vista/Windows7. Use the working Windows Explorer to copy the data to the rescue system's hard drive and then burn
 the data to cd or dvd or copy it to an external hard drive. I prefer not to do this if I know the drive is infected because there is a chance of infecting the host system. In these cases, I use #2 below.<br />
<br />
2. You can boot the target computer with a Linux Live CD such as Knoppix or Ubuntu and retrieve the data that way. Here is general information on using Knoppix for data retrieval when you can't get into Windows:<br />
<br />
You will need a computer with two cd drives, one of which is a CD/DVD burner <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> a USB thumb drive with enough capacity to hold your data <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> an external USB hard drive. Download the Knoppix .iso and create your bootable CD*. If you are doing this in an older operating system (XP or Vista), you'll need third-party burning software like Nero, Roxio, or the free
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a> (Windows 7 can burn .isos natively). Burn as an image, not as data. Then boot with the CD you created and Knoppix will be able to see the Windows files. If you are using the USB thumb drive or the external hard
 drive, right-click on its icon (on the Desktop) to get its properties and uncheck the box that says "Read Only". Then click on it to open it. Note that the default mouse action in the window manager used by Knoppix (KDE) is a single click to open instead of
 the traditional MS Windows' double-click. If you want to burn CD/DVDs, use the K3b program.<br />
<br />
*If your computer only has one optical drive and you want to use that drive to burn data or need to test the drive, you can create a bootable USB thumb drive running Linux instead of a bootable CD. This website will show you how to do that -

</a></p>
<p>Information about doing a clean install:</p>
<p>Most laptops and many OEM (HP, Sony, etc.) desktop computers come with a factory restore image on a special partition on the hard drive. The factory restore process is normally invoked by pressing a Function key (like F11) at computer startup. There will
 be a message as to which Function key to press on the screen when you first start your computer. You can also refer to your computer manual, or the computer mftr.'s website, or contact its tech support to see how to restore your computer to factory condition
 since each computer mftr. does it differently - sometimes even between models.<br />
<br />
These machines also usually have a utility with which to create physical recovery discs in case the hard drive needs to be replaced or the factory restore image is somehow damaged. If you did not create the physical recovery discs and/or damaged the recovery
 image, contact the computer mftr.'s tech support to order a recovery disc set. This is normally very inexpensive, around $20-25.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7</a></p>
<p>And finally:</p>
<p><span><span style="font-weight: bold">User accounts - Recommended Setup</span>
</span><br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista and Windows 7 are multi-user operating systems with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be
 left alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista and Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily
 work and that account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may require more work than you want to do. Best not to get into a bad situation to begin with.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</p>

<p>your credentials (username/password) are saved in cache. I think that cache has expired and that's why you get the error.</p>
<p>If you are no longer member of a domain then you should be able to login to your computer using a local computer account. You need the specify the computer name instead of the domain name like this: &lt;COMPUTER NAME&gt;\&lt;USERNAME&gt;.</p>

                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>My new HP Probook G450 has fingerprint sensor login through Windows 10 Hello. I set this up and it was working fine. Now when I scan my finger it recognises me and the Hello Face winks but it will not log me in. I am connected to the internet, I read it
 does not work if this is not the case, which if true is extra crap! </p>
<p>If another user scans their finger it recognises them says Hello .... and the face winks! No login!</p>
<p>The facial recognition part of Hello was in the settings but never setup, but now it is not in the settings anymore.</p>
<p>There have been recent updates.....</p>
<p>Feature update version 1703 02.10.17</p>
<p>Cumulative update KB4041676 11.10.17</p>
<p>HP Development system V6.022.1</p>
<p>Recent BIOS update also 18 June 17&nbsp;Release</p>

<h2>            How can i go back to version 1607 &#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I have recently updated my pc to the newest version of windows 10 which is 1703 (creator update). I have encountered many mouse problems in old fps games and it is annoying so much . When I try to go back to the previous version which is 1607.. I receive
 the following message : "the files we need to take you back to a previous version of windows were removed from this pc". My question is : How can I go back to version 1607 without losing my files and apps ?

<p>Hello Yazan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the possible reasons why you're getting the <strong>We're sorry, but you can't go back. The files we need to take you back to a previous version of Windows were removed from this PC.</strong> error message is due to the update being installed for
 more than 30 days already or deleted system folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if some system folders are missing:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to the drive where Windows 10 is installed.</li><li>Click <strong>View</strong> tab &gt; Check the box labelled <strong>Hidden Items</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Note: Check if the $Windows.~WS and $Windows.~BT folders exists then the folders should now appear. If those folders are missing, it could be because you have recently cleaned up Windows 10 either using Disk Cleanup utility or any other third-party cleaners.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you’re sure that it’s been less than a month since you upgraded to Windows 10 or current build of Windows 10 and haven’t deleted those folders, please try to run the rollback feature again after performing a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still occurs, we recommend that you perform a clean install of Windows 10. See this article:
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10startfresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10</a> and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the result.</p>

<p>Hello sir, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First of all, I moved to the current version of Windows 10 two days ago which means it's been less than one month. I am running a clean up Software continuously and that could be the reason why my files are missed.</p>
<p>I downloaded the tool that you have mentioned in your reply. I am aware that this tool will perform a clean installation of the Windows but I have a question, after clicking accept on that tool, I move to a page which says : "Install a clean copy of the
 most recent version of Windows and remove apps that were installed on this PC. My question is : Does this mean that Version 1703 will be installed once again ? if yes, then how can this tool help me to install Version 1607 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second of all, I used that tool back when I was using version 1511 of Windows 10, back then, I created an ISO file of the current version of the Windows using that tool (version 1503 ISO file), fortunately, I still have a back up of that file on my PC. My
 question is : regardless of keeping the current Windows files and apps or losing them permanently, Can I use this file to roll back to version 1511 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waiting your reply, thanks.</p>
<p>

            Yes, it can run Windows 7, just make sure you have enough RAM, (1 to 2 GBs), the more the better.<br />
<br />
System Requirements:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver<br />
<br />
I recommend you use Windows 7 32 bit <br />
<br />
Are you sure you want to go with Windows 7 Ultimate? There are more affordable editions.
<br />
<br />
Windows 7 - version comparisons:<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/compare-editions<br />
<br />
The following are what makes Windows 7 Ultimate unique:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * DirectAccess: Give mobile users seamless access to corporate networks without a need to VPN.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * BranchCache: Decrease the time branch office users spend waiting to download files across the network.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Federated Search: Find information in remote repositories, including SharePoint sites, with a simple user interface.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * BitLocker and BitLocker To Go: Help protect data on PCs and removable drives, with manageability to enforce encryption and backup of recovery keys.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * AppLocker: Specify what software is allowed to run on a user’s PCs through centrally managed but flexible Group Policies.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) optimizations: Improved user experience for VDI with multimon and microphone support, which have the ability to reuse virtual hard drive (VHD) images to boot a physical PC.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Multilingual user interface: Create a single OS image for deployment to users worldwide.<br />
* Networ Boot License, VDI start of virtual discs<br />
* 4 Virtual Operating Systems<br />
* DVD Codec, Media Center, Subsystem fo UNIX<br />

<p>It took me a little to get what you're saying, but I think I understand. No, you do not have to send both back before they send you another. I am on a 2-Game plan as well. They will not send you more than 2 games if you already have a second out. It doesn't
 matter which in circulation it is. So for instance:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you received Game X in the mail, then received Game Z in the mail afterward, having two games at home at the same time... and decide to send back the second game, Game Z... GF will send you out the next available game in your GameQ once they receive Game
 Z, opening up another spot in your 2-Game Plan. You do not need to send back the first game (Game X), first. Nor do they wait to receive both.--As long as you have two, it can be any two. Hope I helped. (okay +50 for honesty, lol).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advice:</p>
<p>If you get a scratched/damaged game in the mail or a different disc in the sleeve than expecting. Report it, but don't request hem sending you the same game. Their policy is @@@ backwards. Instead of just sending you a replacement, they will micro-manage
 your account for you, inserting the game at the top of your GameQ. Meanwhile you're still paying for that extra game out. Time = Money in my book. So instead, request them to send the next available game. For some reason, if you request them to resend the
 same game, they try and bend you over. This way, they send out the next game immediately, without making you wait while you return the defective game. You can always put the game in question back at the top of your GameQ yourself. And if you are lucky enough
 that they send you the wrong disc instead of just a scratched or broken one... you get a free game to play out of it, assuming you haven't already played it.</p>

    <title>Weird Glitch Involving Dead Money - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emeraldr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird Glitch Involving Dead Money</h2>
                    
<p>I think I may have discovered a new glitch. Yesterday, my internet went down due to some "Technical Problems", and for some reason, the lack of Xbox Live stopped my Dead Money from being loaded, whereas Honest Hearts was. And because I was eager to play
 New Vegas, I carried on with wreckless abandon. Played for a bit, got a phone call from my internet provider, told me it was back on, reconnected to Xbox Live, then something weird happened.</p>
<p>When I loaded up New Vegas, Dead Money loaded, I got all my items back from the first time I completed it, then the message saying that Dead Money had loaded popped up, and it allowed me to replay Dead Money through again. This allowed me to get doubles
 of all the items. The game didn't break on me whatsoever, which surprised me. The wierdest thing though was when I first played Dead Money on this character I was a really low level, and I mean really low, I think I started it around level 2 or 3, back at
 the start of the game. And when I was playing it the seccond time, the enemies were all still low level. I mean, I could one shot a few of them.</p>
<p>Has something like this happened to anyone else? And is their any explanation on why this happened? I thought it was a cool glitch as it allowed me to get alot of caps from selling all the items, and .357 Rounds that I'd found. I've got so many of them now
 its unbelievable.</p>

<p>There's a trick to it. &nbsp;Grab all of the bars, then take them to the force field on the right coming back out. &nbsp;If you position yourself correctly then when you drop the bars they will fall on the other side of the field. &nbsp;Then when you're making your way
 out you can go to the other side of the force field, which is quite close to the elevator, and grab them. &nbsp;If you hurried, then you will have enough time to make it to the elevator even though you're over-encumbered.</p>

<p>It should not take 55 minutes. &nbsp;The walk from the force field to the elevator takes less than a minute, and you get transported straight back to the fountain. &nbsp;From there it takes less than a minute to reach the front gate, which transports you back to the
 Abandoned BoS bunker, where you can dump them in a container and grab them one or two at a time to fast travel wherever you want. &nbsp;It might take a few trips, but you can also safely leave them at the bunker until you need the caps. &nbsp;And those 37 gold bars
 are actually worth 10k a piece, for a grand total of over 350k.</p>

    <title>SD Card Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valandurix  say:</h3>
<h2>            SD Card Problem</h2>
                    <p>My SP3 has finally come to replace my laptop in terms of my mobile computer, sadly at the time when I got the SP3 I got the 64 GB, so I decided to put a SanDisk 128 GB SD Card as additional storage, now that they are relatively cheap. Now that I have the
 SD Card plugged in all the time, I have begun to experience several issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The connectivity to the SD Card drops, I can be in the middle of transferring a file, streaming a movie that is on the card, downloading a file on it and the connection will just drop. The SD Card is still plugged in, file explorer still displays the
 card, but not accessible. This happens randomly several times a day, which is quite annoying since I access the stuff on the SD Card constantly. I have gotten the SD Card replaced and have tried other SD Cards and I still have the same issue. The fix so far
 has been to pull the card out and pop it back in, which brings me to the next question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have met several people with other versions of the Surface and I have noticed that their SD Card slot is a spring loaded mechanism, which i have on my laptop and camera but I never really questioned on my SP3 considering how thin the surface was, but
 now I am wondering if I have had a defective SD Card slot this whole time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I am guessing that the SD Card and Touch Keyboard use the same controller because when the SD Card drops, the Touch Keyboard also becomes unresponsive for a couple seconds</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I get these issues fixed?</p>

            <p>Problem was solved by a firmware hard reset by a tech at the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem he explained was a possible corruption in the firmware, the firmware hard reset functioned almost like disconnecting the power from CMOS, it was combination of holding power and the volume up and then down, not sure how long for each, but it
 solved the problem, haven't had any issues since.</p>

    <title>Black Screen in Safe Mode or when running Win 10 install media. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Black Screen in Safe Mode or when running Win 10 install media.</h2>
                    <p>I know black screen errors are a dime a dozen. Mine seems to be different than any of the posts I have seen thus far. I will attempt to be as thorough as possible. After a reboot Windows 10 Pro went to a black screen. I saw my bios graphics and then a black
 screen. HDD led seems to indicate that it is booting. I used the autologin function to automatically enter my password when I boot up but it stopped working a long time ago and it says I have a wrong password and I hit enter then must click in the lower left
 to select a different user and then I can log in. I mention that because some black screens have had instructions to login blind and I have no idea how I could select the other profile to do that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use Windows Installation media from a USB drive I get the exact same issue. A black screen. No cursor. Same with safe mode. The only thing that I have been able to do to see anything besides black is to change a bios setting from legacy oprom to UEFI
 and Legacy Oprom. When I did this if I use installation media I see the win 10 logo and the circle before it goes to a black screen. My video card is a geforce 1060 6GB gigabyte windforce OC. My mobo is Asus z170-p Intel i7 6700 16Gb ram SSD drive by PNY.
</p>
<p>Here's what I have tried:</p>
<p>Note I got the same results with all of this</p>
<p>-Moving my monitor to the other DVI port on my vid card</p>
<p>-switching to onboard video DVI port(enabling it through BIOS)</p>
<p>-putting a TV into the HDMI port on both pcie and onboard. </p>
<p>-I have made new windows installation media</p>
<p>-I have tried running a windows 7 recovery environment. ( This wasn't black but it did appear to have 8bit color) due to file permissions and the like I couldn't try dism.exe or SFC.exe While trying to use takedown.exe and icacls to get access to the win
 10 install I saw a huge list of files as it took ownership of them all. I saw inside the recycling bin that many nvidia DLLs were in there. ? I don't know how to restore them from the command prompt though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is worth noting that I did recently update my nvidia video drivers to the newest ones as of Mar1st. Reinstalling is always the last resort for me once I become stumped but even that isn't an option for me now. Any advice or insight would he greatly appreciated.
 My video card has a displayport output that I have no way of trying but nothing has ever been hooked up to it so there's no reason the video is going there.

            <p>Hi Noah,<br />
<br />
Looks like you are encountering an issue with your graphics card displaying the video signal to a wrong or non-existing display monitor.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be a known issue after updating your display adapter drivers. We recommend that you perform the method below:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method: Extend Display</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If your system boots to a blank screen, wait for 30 seconds.</li><li>Then press the <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>P</strong> keys.</li><li>Press the <strong>down arrow</strong> keys twice, and press <strong>Enter</strong> to extend display.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the suggestion above doesn't work, feel free to post back so we can further troubleshoot.</p>

            I have seen this solution before. When I tried it nothing happened.

            <p>After troubleshooting EVERYTHING, I decided to reflash the BIOS putting it back to defaults. I have the ASUS z170-p BIOS version 3017. Reflashing it fixed ALL of my issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a Windows 10 problem after all.</p>
