    <title>Configure Start Menu for guest account from administrator account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Configure Start Menu for guest account from administrator account</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the IT department for a small library.&nbsp; We have several Windows 10 Pro computers available for community use. We have one computer that is private enough that people will use it to browse questionable sites (i.e. porn and gambling).&nbsp; We don't have filters
 for free speech reasons.&nbsp; I recreated the guest account through the PowerShell.&nbsp; I would like to configure the start menu for this account through my administrator account. I didn't see a Run as Administrator option.&nbsp; Can I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I think first you need to give consideration to your IT security policies and any potential liability.&nbsp; You mention not having filters for free speech reasons but are you really happy having someone looking at sites that could even be illegal?&nbsp; Also, a lot
 of questionable sites are well known for being sources of malicious software which could be infecting your network.&nbsp; If your entire network was compromised what would the impact be both operationally and on your data you hold?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I would give consideration to, just a quick list to start some thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up a small business server with a Domain for your site.&nbsp; Use this to configure appropriate access rights and management policies around system access and software installation.&nbsp; Properly manage the devices and the user accounts centrally</li><li>Enable a Web content filtering solution</li><li>Enable a DNS based security solution</li><li>Enable Anti-virus that also includes behavioural as well as certificate based protection</li></ol>

<p>Thank you for responding. I would love to do that because I understand the risks, but purchasing another computer and OS software isn't in the budget this year, nor is purchasing a more secure router.&nbsp; (We are an all volunteer library.) I am trying to lock
 down the computers as much as I can with what I have.&nbsp; I usually lock down networks so tight they squeak, but this is a different environment. I have asked for a web content filter, but the library board wants the computers open.&nbsp; I have set the filter in
 search settings to high to block adult content in searches.&nbsp; I also have AV, anti-malware software and I flush the dns cache regularly. If you have any other advice that would be great.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>Problem here is the library board wanting "open" but from the sound of it not wanting to pay for the security that will support an "open" network.&nbsp; Combined with them not understanding data security, legality of what users might be doing/looking at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which country are you in?&nbsp; If in the EU or transacting data on EU citizens GDPR next year is something worth bearing in mind that (if applicable) the library board MUST consider.&nbsp; I would have thought that operating in an insecure manner would be a data
 security risk.</p>

            I’m in the US. We don’t get government funding so the compliance laws don’t affect us. &nbsp;I have written a proposal to the Library Board for a server and upgraded router. We’ll see what happens. Thank you for your input. I think that is going to help with
 my propsal, because I have an objective recommendation from another IT professional.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are glad to provide the assistance required to help resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the information that you have provided, I suggest that you download the latest version of .NET Framework from the link below&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I thought it worth bumping this thread as I am having exactly the same problem reported here but not solved..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already done a ton of reading up on this and have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) .NET Framework 4.6.1 Web Installer (KB3102438)</p>
<p>b) .NET Framework 4.6.1&nbsp;Offline Installer (KB3102436) (See example below)</p>
<p>c) .NET Framework 4.6.2&nbsp;Web Installer (KB315802)</p>
<p>d) .NET Framework 4.6.2 Offline&nbsp;Installer (KB3102735)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In each case install fails with a "The system cannot find the file specified" error dialogue box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The log file is identical to that reported above (other than e: temp&nbsp;folder id) with the file being reported as missing being
<strong><span>x64-Windows10.0-KB3102495-x64.cab.</span></strong></p>
<p>It is unclear to me why the install folder&nbsp;is being is being temporarily placed on my e: drive (a HDD) rather than my c: drive (the SSD), not least as my temp environment variable is set to c:.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Included below is the error log (sorry can't make it paste in more concise).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also attach a screenshot of file explorer showing the e: temp folder contents which include the
<span>x64-Windows10.0-KB3102495-x64.cab file (until the install routine is closed following the error)</span></p>

            Latest Skype doesn't provide the Chat Export facility. This is one of the highest demanding features. 
<br />
<br />As a workaround, Click on that contact on left side to display all conversations on right side. Do CTRL+A to select all messages in the conversation. CTRL+C to copy and CTRL+V to paste in Word.
<br />
<br />You will not get good formatting but you will have chats.
<br />
<br />But if messages are limited in number in your conversation, below is the process to get excellent formatting. 
<br />
<br />On right side in conversation, right click on any message and click Select Messages.
<br />Now you will notice circles against all messages on right side.
<br />You will need to select all circles or limited circles to export. This is where my point of message is limited in number as there is no option to select all circles. You will have to select circle one by one.
<br />Now at the bottom, you have Copy enabled. Click that and now paste into Word.

 prompt would help. I restarted my pc and am now stuck at Scanning and repairing drive(C:):11% complete.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Chkdsk at times can take a very long time, depending. If it's still at 11% after a few hours of running, it's hung and the only thing to do is power down the system and have chkdsk run again. If it hangs again, you have a HDD problem.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Patrick<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for cross-posting from the Apple forum. But I really need to get this resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently bought an Airport Extreme and a Mac Mini. I installed OS X server and configured radius using
<strong>WPA2-Enterprise</strong>. My iPhone and family iPhone's are able to make a establish connection, and my MacBook is able to make a connection as well. BUT my Surface Pro 2 (Windows 10) CANNOT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Surface prompts me to enter my credentials (Username &amp; Password). I used the User Account credentials that I created in the OS X Server and then it ask me to
<strong>"Enter Network Security Key". </strong>I have no idea what that is. I searched online and I found this...</p>

<h2>            Lower part of LifeCam VX-5000 flickers</h2>
                    I installed a LifeCam VX-5000 on my laptop. The laptop is running Win7 HP 32 with 1.5 GB RAM and a 2.2GHz AMD Mobile Athlon and ATI Radeon 200. The lower third of the image, when using the cam in monitor mode, flickers and slides sideways. The upper portion
 is clear. The resolution is at the default of 640 x 480. The latest software and drivers are installed. Suggestions?

<p>Hey LilBro,</p>
<p>This issue was resolved in XP and Vista by applying the Hotfix availlable from Microsoft website. The issue was reported for an AMD chipset when the output resolution of the Webcam is set to 960 × 720 or to a higher resolution.</p>
<p>You may see the information here:<br />
<strong>Severe video degradation and a Stop error may occur on a Windows Vista-based computer when you connect a USB Webcam<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940059" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940059</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>You may experience severe video degradation and a Stop error when you connect a USB Webcam to a Windows XP-based computer<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949033</strong></a></p>
<p>However, there is no such report till date in Windows 7. Nevertheless, you may try lowering the video resolution and see if this helps.</p>
<p>Additionally, one of the following steps may resolve the issue:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Unplug the webcam and plug it back in.<br />
2.&nbsp;Close, and then reopen the LifeCam program.<br />
3.&nbsp;If you are connected to a USB 1.1 port, try connecting to a USB 2.0 port.<br />
4.&nbsp;If you are connected to a USB hub, try to directly connect the webcam to a USB 2.0 port on your computer.<br />
5.&nbsp;Make sure you have installed the latest drivers for your video card.<br />
<br />
Here’s the HP support link that has drivers for all HP products.</p>
<p><a href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/support.html</strong></a></p>
<p>See if you find any updated driver for your video card. Ensure that you install Windows 7 driver.</p>

 backed up.&nbsp; I have about 50GB to back up and there's plenty of space on the external drive. Any suggestions on what I can do?

<p>I don't remember if I formatted the external drive (I've had it for awhile), but it's the same external drive I used with my Windows 7 backups in Windows 10, and it worked fine for that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the confusion.&nbsp; I'm using Windows 10 "Backup Using File History".&nbsp; The other option in Windows 10 is "Backup and Restore (Windows 7)", which I used previously.&nbsp; My concern about using the Windows 7 backup again is that if my computer crashes and
 I need to restore the files with Windows 10, would they be restorable if someday Windows 10 changes and doesn't restore Windows 7 backups anymore?&nbsp; Every tutorial I find on the internet shows instructions on how to set up Windows 10 backup using file history,
 it's simple, I've followed it, yet it doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>

            The thing about using backup in the backup/restore(win7), is that the backup file located on external drive you created it on, all you have to do is double click on that file and it will start the restore of your back up. You do not need to use the backup/restore(win7)
 to restore from the back up file.

            if you want to test this yourself, create a folder and put copies of some things in it as docs or photos. then use BU/restore(win7) and back up that folder only by choosing let me choose what to back up. then after the back up is completed, delete the
 folder you created with things inside of it. Now double click on the back up file you just created on external drive and the process will begin for you to restore the back up. once you restore the back up, that folder your created and backed up will now be
 there again.

<p>I find the file history kind of a joke really. your system will already create back ups of your files and system files without using file history. to verify this just right click on a folder and select properties and then under previous versions tab it will
 load the copies of history for that folder it automatically saves itself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>here is an example of all user start menu folder. (AND I DO NOT USE FILE HISTORY AS IT IS OFF)</p>

            Thanks, this answers my question about being able to restore the win7 backup file (if Windows 10 does away with Win7 backup/restore, it won't matter). However, would double clicking on the win7 backup file ONLY restore to the original hard drive it came

<p>no, if you created this file backing up your personal files. And then windows 10 crashed and you had to reset or reinstall windows 10, then you can click on this back up file and it will restore what you saved in the backup. That is what it is for and used
 for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never heard what you are saying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with backup/restore(win7) is if you have not created at least one back up using the BU/R(7) app on a new install of 10, then it has no way of finding your old back up your created and saved before on external device because the mediaI.bin file
 would be missing to obtain the back up file information. That is why the back up file and the mediaI.bin file on the same drive with the back up you saved, will allow you to open it and then it would be able to run the restore process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why they tell people to use this to back up your personal files. (PERSONALLY I JUST COPY AND PASTE EVERYTHING I WANT SAVED TO AN EXTERNAL LOCATION)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do make sure I keep a fresh SYSTEM IMAGE, and if anything goes wrong, can restore system back to exact state it was when the Image was created. A MUST AND A LIFE SAVER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you would of course have to set up your user interface settings and install programs again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did an upgrade or updated windows such as installed a creators pack, then windows will save not just your personal files, but all your installed programs and user personal settings.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard drivers accidentally removed&#63;</h2>
                    Running Windows XP SP3. I had a Kensington USB mouse and a Microsoft PS/2 keyboard (split keyboard but used standard driver). I use eXceed to open xterms on my PC to remote UNIX boxes. The wheel click didn't always perform eXceed cut &amp; paste correctly,
 so I installed "Mouseworks" from Kensington CD. Didn't like it, so I uninstalled "Mouseworks" via Add/Remove Programs. Weirdness happened. Got an "updating drivers" message, PC rebooted, and now no keyboard works, not my PS/2 keyboard, not USB keyboard. I
 work from home on this PC so it requires a password and only a single account. Can't log in because no keyboard is recognized. I can use keyboard in BIOS/Setup mode but that's it. Is there a way to repair/reinstall keyboard drivers without actually using a
 keyboard. Right now, my PC is a brick...

    <title>Cannot browse photos in date order using Windows Image Viewer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertlee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot browse photos in date order using Windows Image Viewer</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm running windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.<br />
<br />
I have a folder containing some jpg photos. I view these photos in Windows Explorer (details view) and click the Date column to order by date.&nbsp; I now double click the first photo in the list to view it in Windows Image Viewer.&nbsp; I can now press the arrow keys
 on the keyboard to easily navigate through the photos in date order, just as they were in Windows Explorer.<br />
<br />
However, today something has changed.&nbsp; Now, when I repeat the above, the photos are always displayed in Windows Image Viewer in filename order, regardless of how they were ordered in Windows Explorer.<br />
<br />
I suspect that there's a registry entry that has been deleted or edited by mistake, but I cannot find anything anywhere to help fix this.<br />
<br />
Any help gratefully received!<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
<br />
Rob

<p><span><strong><span>Hi robertlee,<br />
I would suggest you to try the following steps and see if that help.<br />
</span></strong><strong><span>Sort Digital Photos According to Date</span></strong></span><strong><span><br />
<span>1. Open the folder with the digital photos in Windows Explorer.<br />
2. Go the View menu and click Details.<br />
3. Resize the window so it’s large enough to see all the headings.<br />
4. Click the column heading that says Date Modified or Date Picture Taken. The Date Picture Taken option is a more accurate way to sort photos according to date, but this information may not be available for all photos.<br />
5. Decide how you want to group the photos, if needed. If you have a lot of photos, you may want to put the photos in separate folders according to year, month, day or even hour.<br />
6. Make a new folder by going to the File menu and choosing New, then Folder. Right-click the folder and choose Rename. Type a name for the folder that describes the contents and includes the date or time period.<br />
7. Select the photos you want to move to the folder and drag them to the folder, or copy or cut and paste them in the folder.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Sort Printed Photos According to Date<br />
</span></strong><strong><span>1. Choose a system for organizing the photos. You may want to use envelopes or folders for each date or time period, or entire boxes. For small photos, you may want
 to use a card file, with dividers between each date or time period.</span></strong></span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><strong><span><span>2. Find a large table or empty floor space where you can carefully spread out the photos.</span></span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><strong><span><span>3. Use an date and time stamps on the photos, or marking on the back, to determine the date. If the photos don’t have dates on them, look
 for clues to the time period. For example, if you’re sorting family photos by date for an album, you may be able to guess their chronological order from the age of the children in them.</span></span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><strong><span><span>4. Make stacks of photos for each date. If you have a lot of photos to sort, you may want to sort them by general time period first, then
 sort them in more detail later.</span></span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><strong><span><span>5. File the photos in chronological order in the folders, boxes or card file. Depending on the types of photos you have and the date information
 available, you may want to organize them just by year, or in greater detail.</span></span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span><strong><span>6. Write the date on each file folder, box or card file divider.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>If the above steps fail, I would suggest you to perform a system restore to get back the previous settings.<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps: <br />
1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.
<br />
2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click next.
<br />
3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click next.
<br />
4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click Finish.<br />
</span></strong><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></span><strong><span><span> When you use System restore to restore the computer
 to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.<br />
Refer to this link for step by step procedure to System Restore<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212</span></span></span></a><br />
<span>The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.<br />

<p><span><span>We sincerely regret for the inconvenience caused.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us place the computer in a clean boot state and check if there are any software conflicts.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Clean Boot</span></strong><span> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when
 you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose
 some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected
 to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>H</strong><strong>ow to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>” to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></span></span></p>

The computer doesn't hang completely, i.e. I'm still able to launch programs from shortcuts, but mouse pointer is stuck too. When the taskbar freezes, the start button and Explorer freeze as well. Usually after a period of seconds everything unfreezes.</p>
It is extremely annoying when used to using win key for global searches to get stuck for 5 seconds for no apparent reason (task manager doesn't show any spike of activity).</p>

<h2>            Keyboard does not work in administrator account but works in standard user account</h2>
                    My keyboard doesn't work in the administrator account(to type Internet address or just any other programmes tt require typing),it only works for the keying in of password to the administrator account.however,when I create standard user account,the keyboard
 works fine.is there a way to fix the keyboard for my administrator account?because I have to resort to use the on-screen keyboard whenever I use the administrator account.thanks a lot in advance for any advice or help given.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Helpful hints</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Before you start using your webcam, follow these tips on security, operation and webcam etiquette.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>It’s highly unlikely — but not impossible — that someone would try to hack into your webcam to tap into the conversation or use the webcam to spy on you, says Payette.
 Sending recorded video messages via e-mail is more secure than real-time Internet chatting.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Here’s a little-known fact about some webcams: the user has the option to turn on a motion sensor function that transforms the device into a “nanny cam” so it’ll
 begin recording once it senses movement. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Don’t expect terrific video quality. It’s often possible to adjust the resolution by toying with the webcam’s software settings. But the higher the quality, the
 choppier the video frame rates. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Some webcams require an additional microphone to record audio, so check before buying.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Adjust your camera’s focus, point it towards your face and, most importantly, look right into the “eye” of the webcam so your friends on the other end see more than
 just your forehead. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Webcam netiquette and dress are just like real-life: be polite, be courteous, and wear something casual but presentable.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also refer to
<strong>Seeing is believing -&gt;</strong> </span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/1070D774-F55D-4575-ABA6-BC6B507AF8561033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/1070D774-F55D-4575-ABA6-BC6B507AF8561033.mspx</span></a><span>

<p>In Windows Live Messenger, if that is what you are using, click on the Help ? symbol, or the Help menu item, and look for "About Messenger".&nbsp; I believe the latest version is 2009 (Build 14.0.8089.7.26).</p>
<p>In the Tools menu item you have "Audio and Video setup...", how is your output in that?</p>
<p>What sort of Internet Connection do you have, is it reliable and fast enough for video and sound transferring?</p>
<p>What other programs are you running while in a video session, anything that could be grabbing bandwidth or processor power?<br />
<br />
Does your Laptop manufacturer have updated drivers available for your webcam and audio?</p>

            Hi Jordan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />HID drivers are more for touch.  For a wireless mouse you'd need it to install it's driver when you plug it in, which is always onboard already in the DriverStore.  
<br />
<br />Are you seeing any activity in the System tray when you plug it in?  In the Device Manager, does it show up so you can choose the Driver tab, then Update Driver Automatically.  If not
<br />
<br />If not try Change the batteries if wireless, try another USB port, reset mouse from button on bottom if available.
<br />
<br />Try the mouse in another PC to isolate if it's the mouse or Windows causing this.
<br />
<br />Try another mouse in this PC to confirm if Windows is the problem.
<br />
<br />Access the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Mouse, then Driver tab. First try Update this Driver &gt; Automatically, then Roll Back if available. If not choose Uninstall button, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Is there mouse software installed in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features? Uninstall it to see if the problem stops. This is unneeded bloatware.
<br />
<br />Adjust the mouse settings in Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Mouse, checking all settings including the Additonal Mouse Options box - check Settings on all tabs.
<br />
<br />Report back all results for possible other things to try.
<br />
<br />To check if Windows is causing this you can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<p>I have read most of what you said and will reply to that while I try the bottom most options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have 3 mice plugged in. 2 wireless and 1 wired. "windows is the problem" as when I plug the mice into other PCs they work just fine and all batteries where brand new before the problem occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as for the system tray when i plug the 2 wireless mice in they are totally unresponsive and do not show up anywhere and yes I do mean anywhere 'driver manager hidden list included' and when i plug the wired mouse in I receive the following statements:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a91faf5b-6e4d-4e2a-9cc3-c2e8d1fb8a1e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a91faf5b-6e4d-4e2a-9cc3-c2e8d1fb8a1e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>*please note that all three mice are plugged in at this time an yet none show up in the "Mice and other pointing devices" drop down list. and that the messages displayed accompanied by the windows USB connect and disconnect sounds show up if i move the mouse
 after a 30 second interval from hearing it last.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cannot roll back, uninstall or reinstall any drivers for my mice as they are unregistered in my device manager.</p>

    <title>I, too, am having HORRIBLE sleep problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daltonhavens  say:</h3>
<h2>            I, too, am having HORRIBLE sleep problems</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 a couple of days ago. At first everything seemed fine other than it was a little slow and some apps became unresponsive, but this was expected with a brand new version of windows. I'm sure these problems will be fixed somewhere
 down the road, but there are some critical issues which need to be addressed ASAP. The biggest and most unbearable bug that I have found so far, that many other people (specifically people who own HP laptops, it seems) seem to be experiencing, is that the
 sleep functionality doesn't seem to be working properly. At all. When i close the lid the screen goes blank, but I don't even think that the computer is going to sleep because the fan keeps running continuously and the WiFi adapter light on the keyboard stays
 on. So, if I have my computer unplugged while it's "sleeping" it dies very quickly. Also it's impossible to wake the computer from this "sleep" state. I just get a blank screen that never goes away no matter what I do, and I end up having to do a hard shut
 down. This issue needs to be addressed immediately because I really would rather not damage my almost brand new laptop by having to hold down the power button to get it going every time I close the lid. For now I suppose I'll just turn off the sleep functionality
 of my laptop and just shut it down when I'm not using it, but I'd really like to be able to put it to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I suppose it's worth mentioning that I have also been experiencing painfully slow boot times as compared to Windows 8.1, but this is an issue that I can bear for now, while the sleep issues I'm having a harder time tolerating.</p>

            <p>Add me, another HP Envy x360 Touchsmart user, to the mix, too. I've been experiencing this sleep/shutdown bug since the night I upgraded to Windows 10. Was probably one of the first people to get the launch release since the files had downloaded earlier
 than expected. At around midnight, I got the upgrade, waited patiently for it install and do some other stuff, and then went ham when everything was done. When I finally decided to hit the sack, I tried shutting it down and probably passed out thinking that
 it did, but unbeknownst to me, the power light was still shining and I could hear the laptop humming, which I found out when I woke up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I wanted to see if this problem could get fixed, I started searching all over the net for solutions and have found three so far that have been
<strong>temporary</strong>. Here they are and how they fared on my laptop:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Update Intel HD Graphics drivers from Device Manager</strong> - So basically you just go into Device Manager, look for "Display", update the drivers from Windows itself via the Internet, and shut down your device. When you shut the device down,
 you'll find yourself running into the issue, but if you hard reset one last time and turn your device back on, the fix should work.</li><li><strong>Turn off "Fast Restart" in power settings</strong> - Search "close lid" in the search box where you ask Cortana stuff, choose the result from Control Panel, and then click on the link that let's you adjust stuff that is greyed out at the bottom.
 Since it seems this change isn't instant, you have to do the same method of hard resetting your device one last time like above and turning it back on.<br />
</li><li><strong>Use the Troubleshooting Program to Troubleshoot the power settings</strong> - Search "Troubleshooting" &gt; Choose result from Control Panel &gt; Click "View All" in the sidebar &gt; Choose the troubleshooter that covers "Power" &gt; Let it do its magic &gt; read
 up on what the results are from the program &gt; restart your device (this time around I just restarted it instead of doing the hard reset trick I've mentioned in the other two solutions)</li></ol>
<p>After attempting all 3 of these solutions and letting my device boot from either hard resetting or restarting, the tests I did with the sleep mode function or the power settings or the shutdown settings seemed to work. It all comes crashing down after a
 couple hours of use of my laptop and I'm back to square one. I haven't really timed it to be sure, but it seems that if you attempt to do the sleep mode or shutdown process within an hour, the things seem to work, but once you go beyond that time limit, you're
 back to a device that won't sleep or shutdown properly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I truly don't know what to do at this point besides attempting other solutions others may come up with or waiting for Microsoft to send out an update that will finally fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If more is needed about my current set up, here are some specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make: <strong>HP Envy Touchsmart x360</strong> (not sure what the exact model number is since the bar code seems to be missing)</p>
<p>CPU: <strong>i5-4210U @ 1.7GHz / 2.4GHz</strong>GPU: <strong>
Intel HD Graphics 4400</strong></p>

            <p>I noticed that on my hp-envy the problem does not occur if&nbsp;i do not connect my usb-hub to the&nbsp;port that provides electricity even when the computer is off.
</p>
<p>Today there's been an update to Windows, but I do not know if this would help, because I could not figure out which bugs resolved.</p>

<h2>            Battery not detected&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I updated today Windows 10 (KB3213986), and now my battery either displays an empty Icon saying "Unknown remaining" or "No battery is detected". BIOS is up to date as well. Anyone else has this issue? Any idea how to solve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The battery still works when the laptop is unplugged but it shows the "unknown remaining".</p>

            <p>I have similar problem after KB3213986.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Model: Toshiba Satellite Z30-A</p>
<p>- Battery and charging was working fine before yesterday's update, Toshiba Health Monitor reported good battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update:</p>
<p>- After a clean start Windows detects the battery state, but after a short amount of random time it either reports 0% remaining or battery unknown. However, laptop keeps working unplugged.</p>
<p>- The battery could not be removed from this model (without removing the back that voids warranty), but I tried a power cycle by pressing the power button for 15 sec. Problem remained.</p>
<p>- There is no related error message in the event log.</p>
<p>- powercfg /energy reports an error: "Battery:Last Full Charge (%)" is 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can the update removed or any other advises?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Zoltan</p>

            <p>The first suggestion is reasonable but unfortunately it didn't work - there are more and more laptops around these days where the battery is not user accessible (I avoid those).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second suggestion I'd classify as a very unhelpful.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most (I hope!) people on this forum will be familiar with the Recovery Options in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something in the update has obviously borked the Toshiba's battery-life driver interface to Windows.</p>
<p>This a fairly recent (2014) laptop and on the Toshiba site, "<strong>Toshiba recommends Windows 10 Pro</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than the standard reply, which amounts to either uninstalling the update or reinstalling Windows, I'd suggest reinstalling the Toshiba drivers from the original disk or, if that is not at hand, downloading them from the Toshiba site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm an old Windows hand (remember Windows 3.0 anyone?) [and CP/M and Linux and BSD] and new to these forums (take a bow Andrew!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd rather hoped that MS had gotten away from the point where the standard answer to any problems was "Oh, just reinstall Windows..."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck Noreen - try reinstalling the Toshs' drivers first.</p>

            <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the same issue, however it has been this way before this update I believe. I am using a Razer Blade 2016. It seems that when I fully charge the machine whilst it is off, when I turn it on the following happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When it is plugged in the battery has a cross and it says the battery is not detected</p>
<p>2) When I unplug it shows a battery icon stating unknown battery life to remain</p>
<p>
</p><p>To work around this I find that plugging the power back into the laptop and unplugging it again helps display the battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft please can you fix this in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Zukum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems the problem has been fixed now. If you keep up to date with Windows insider previews the problem should go away, however they've removed time altogether from the battery read out so you'll only see how much percentage remains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>None the less all seems ok for me, hopefully it'll help your problem too.</p>
<p>

                    How do you stop coasting with a Touch Mouse in W8. &nbsp;Usually there is a coasting/no coasting option for touch pads and mice. &nbsp;I don't see it.
