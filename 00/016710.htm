<h2>            Outlook Drag and Drop Driving Me Mad</h2>
                    Simply filing emails in my many tiers of folders used to be easy.  Now, all of a sudden, it drops files prematurely in other folders, even while I haven't unclicked.  Worse stilll, it takes some of the folders and puts them elsewhere!  My mouse or my hands are NOT to blame.  What has suddenly happened - something changed in the last update. I am mad as ****.. I don't need this now.  Please help.

My data comes in to Excel 2016 in this date format (text). &nbsp;I want to sort, separate some data into other worksheets, keep track of hours worked per month with different colors per month based on date, color code different jobs, etc. but I can't get past the
 sorting. &nbsp;It is picking up the year or the written day of the week to sort on custom sort, but not the month or day.

<li>Select the dates</li><li>Find, replace, find what "*, " (do not use the quotes, just to show the space. Replace by nothing</li><li>Format the range as ddd, dd/MM/YYYY</li><li>You will now be able to sort.</li></ol>

<p>But here is a formula if you wish to use it. Then using Copy followed by Paste Special Values turn the formulas to values.</p>

<h2>            How is .net 4.6 bundled to the Windows 10 Insider Preview build</h2>
                    <p>I observed that with every new Windows 10 build the underlying .net AssemblyFileVersions get also changed while the AssemblyVersions stay the same and "pretend" to be a .net 4.5.2 while the assemblies actually seem to be .net 4.6 RC. For me, this raises
 several questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How exactly is .net 4.6 RC "bundled" with the Windows 10 builds</li><li>How / When will the bundling between .net 4.6 RC and Windows 10 be removed?</li><li>What .net version will be shipped with the final Windows 10 build?</li><li>When will the AssemblyVersions for .net 4.6 RC be updated?</li><li>How can I install .net 4.5.2 on Windows 10?</li><li>Is there more info on (potentially breaking)changes that are done to .net 4.6 for every new released Windows 10 build?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been having problems with my taktalkbusiness email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>a couple of weeks ago it stopped sending emails, it could receive emails but not send them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have been in contact with talktalkbusiness who&nbsp; asked me a few questions, like when did the problem start are you able to send emails via webmail etc.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>have you tried repairing the settings via outlooks repair function, YES before I contacted the less than helpful talktalkbusiness help centre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>They sent me a list of settings which was the same as the settings as I had been using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>settings is email address &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; plus password</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know the email and password are fine as I'm able to send emails via webmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have another computer set up which uses the same details and works fine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>but the normal computer I use doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thank you for your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to say that neither the repair or the uninstall reinstall worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I followed the instuctions as stated and then tried the email address etc didn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then uninstalled office, turned off the machine and turned it back on again and installed office 365&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was asked for my office 365 login to confirmed installation and then I went to outlook to setup the talktalk business email address..</p>
<p>
</p><p>still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>would you have any other suggestions?</p>

            For us to isolate the issue, is it possible to register/set up a different email address on your Outlook and check if the issue persists? And is it also possible to use IMAP instead of POP3?

<h2>            Windows Insider Service Under Services</h2>
                    <p>I was going through the services with build 16232 and I found this service. It was off and if you read the explanation it says this service needs to be enabled for the windows insider program. It was showing as off for me and I enabled it. If you are having
 problems updating to build 16232 you might want to check to see if this service is enabled. I don't know if this service is causing the download issues but might be worth looking at.</p>

<p>"Must be enabled" means "don't disable."&nbsp; It does not mean "must be running at all times."&nbsp; The service is started (event-triggered) and stopped by the software downloaded to your device when you join the device to the WIP.&nbsp; The service would not be contributing
 to the download issues because it would already be running.&nbsp; Windows Update would not be offering a build in the first place if it were off. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Enterprise Insider Preview, Build 17661.rs_prerelease.180428-1349</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Enterprise Insider Preview, Build 17661.rs_prerelease.180428-1349 update ran and rebooted my machine a little bit ago since then I get a blue screen crash when I run Vuze system reboots...blue screen is something like "irql not equal to..." tcpip.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-installing Vuze did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>Running the latest NIC drivers</p>
<p>Rolled back to previous version of Windows and problem was resolved</p>
<p>Windows update ran again and the problem was back...</p>

            As the problem is with the 3rd party app/software have you contacted the maker of such program, as this has been an ongoing issues with the Preview program from the start as the program is about testing Windows 10 and it's software/apps, not for testing
 3rd party apps/software at this point it would be done when a build is being ready for RTM, Microsoft makes the operation system, it is up to 3rd party developers/programmers to build/correct&nbsp; the code of such programs to work with the newer core builds of
 Windows 10, some do during beta but some wait until RTM time.

<p>I beg to differ...Microsoft should be very concerned with 3rd party software and it's compatibility to run on the underlying O/S...otherwise it becomes worthless as Microsoft doesn't yet produce it's own version of every program out there. Working and playing
 well with other software packages and device drivers was a lesson that should have been learned with the release of Windows ME, Windows Vista, and Windows 8 as they were all horrible flops when it came to third party software and drivers...The world pushed
 back and slapped Microsoft in the face for not being compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the point specifically, the stop message refers to tcpip.sys driver (a microsoft driver). Could it be a Microsoft generated Stop message about a Microsoft device driver should be addressed as a Microsoft problem in this preview release? Hmmm...just sayin'...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets focus on the issue, not the excuses. This forum is supposed to be about resolving issues not making excuses for Microsoft. They have a marketing department for that.</p>

            <p>If you are lucky, it should be at the current build of 14388 on the fast track.</p>
<p>However, if your unlucky, you are at least one or two or more builds behind. I wasn't having update problems until I hit 14366. I did a fresh install back then and I have been good up until 14383. Now I'm stuck again. I can now say I do sympathize with those
 who have been dealing with this problem on a regular basis and I do agree that Microsoft really needs to find a way to make these builds more accessible when this sort of thing happens. I've always been a proponent of clean installs and quite frankly, I've
 been quite surprised at how good of a long run I've had doing the continual updating thing on these builds.</p>

            I deal with the clean install thing by making an .iso of each new build and then use them to reinstall as needed. &nbsp;The ESD to ISO method works fine.

            Would never take anything away from the merit of Custom installs.&nbsp; We sure recommended them during the 7 to 8 era.&nbsp; The current Update process is way better than the past or so it seems.&nbsp; We do hear of issues suggested as&nbsp;being&nbsp;update derived&nbsp;&amp; that is
 certainly a drag.&nbsp; I must say , for myself, I have never had a snag w/ or from Updating.&nbsp; And, as an IT Pro, I do find the Updating we have now galaxies better than what we had before Win10.&nbsp; Really, like having reliable, fast, practically, zero-touch Builds.
 At least that has been my experience &amp; that of my colleagues.&nbsp; Maybe just good luck but, hopefully not, just that.<br />
<br />
And, certainly, having an ISO is always very cool... be it to install or to have as a 'safety net' if ever any catastrophic events down the road.<br />
<br />
On a personal note... I must say, the ease &amp; quickness of installing 10 (Update or Custom)... compared to pre-10 (eek)... wow, sure something nice vs the time, effort&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;steps it used to be.&nbsp; From a tech perspective things have improved a lot.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

            At the risk of putting a hex on my next upgrade, I've also got to 14388 without a hitch. Whilst I'm no Win 10 fanboi, (Win 7 is still my main OP) I've been impressed with how well the updates and upgrades have proceeded.

            <p>My experience is the same.&nbsp; I have only had one insider upgrade out of more than a hundred that failed and even that one succeeded on the second attempt.&nbsp; These are on a variety of devices ranging in vintage from 2007 to 2012.&nbsp; The time required for an upgrade
 (as opposed to clean installations) is dramatically shorter than previous versions.&nbsp; Another strength is the short time required to bring a clean installation up to date via Windows Update compared to Windows 7 which could take half a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to read about where we are headed with all of this next round take a look at the Windows Experience Blog about Windows 10 as a subscription service (I like to call it "Windows 365") at</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/07/12/announcing-new-subscription-options-for-windows-10-and-surface-for-businesses/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am curious how that development will show up for insiders over time as MS develops the concept of a Windows subscription option for consumers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the insider program development branches for purchased Windows versus subscription Windows?</p>

            <p>While I agree that the <strong>upgrade</strong> from one OS to another is pretty painless, I still have doubts about the
<strong>update</strong> process which can be fraught.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise that most users will never update as many times as we do on the insider program, but the bad installs, failed updates and not being offered updates that we see constantly on these pages must, when translated to the general user base, make a worrying
 percentage of rolling release failures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update proceedure needs to be bulletproof if any as-a-service rollout is going to be implemented. We as insiders and tech geeks probably have better broadband and wifi connectivity than most, as well as the abilities to troubleshoot problem installs.
 The world at large doesn't have that luxury.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think that the numbers are smaller than you suggest.&nbsp; Last I heard there are around 15 million insiders.&nbsp; Some have more than one device in the insider program, of course.&nbsp; The user base is around 350 million so insiders of all types would be about 4%
 of the user base.&nbsp; The number of posts in the insider forum represents a trivial number out of the user base (do the math).&nbsp; Of those the percentage that represents installation problems comes down to a very tiny fraction of the user base indeed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My assumption is that more users who have an issue seek help from a family member, friend, a technician or an IT department rather than in these forums.&nbsp; We probably don't see a representative view one way or another, good or bad, so I suggest that we cannot
 accurately extrapolate positive or negative results from our anecdotal impressions of forum activity.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A better way to get an impression is the online press.&nbsp; I know I am not seeing bad press about widespread problems with Windows 10 installation.&nbsp; YMMV.</p>

            <p>From my point of view as an enthusiastic amateur, I have completely changed from a follower of Windows 7 and being suspicious of Windows 10. But 2 years of being a Windows 10 Insider has completely changed my mind. Yes I have experienced problems from connectivity,
 sound, homegroup and updating. But by&nbsp;asking help from others, experimenting and not being frightened of resorting to clean installs from an iso, I have managed to get here on b.14388 with 3 computers and 2 with RTM builds. From buggy, unstable and crashing
 initial builds to now with a fast smooth system is excellent. Are there things I would change? Yes! Have I submitted them? Yes! Many times! But I look forward to continuing and hope that I can contribute in some small way with what knowledge I have learnt.</p>

Hi there, i am fresh for excel VBA. I have seen different posts on net sharing the VBA code which disable some excel function for security purpose. I have tried hours discover and learning the code, but still cannot make it as complete set.
<br />
<br />
Is for security purpose. My question is, how to efficiently, disable all possible for the function: copy, cut, paste, paste special..., print, save pdf, email for user access via VBA? The users are only able to input data without changing anything.<br />

            Once you give someone access to a file, you have effectively lost all control over it and as far as the use of VBA is concerned, the use may have their macro security set so that all macros are automatically disabled.

                    We have upgraded to outlook 2010 from 2007. My contacts and distribution lists from 2007 now appear in 2010. However when I change an email on a contact card and then go and click on update on their contact group the new email does not appear. IF I go
 to the contact group and delete the member and then add it in again then the new details do appear. AND funnily if I then change the email again for this member and press update on the contact list then the new details do appear. Does this mean I have to go
 to all names in the contact groups and delete and addin again in order for changes to contact cards to be reflected in the contact group when updated???

            Correct. Precisely the way its always been.If Update Now ever works, it will only be for Contacts and DL's that reside in the same folder in which they were orignally created. DL's in PST files have never survived transfer to a new location.

<h2>            Contacts and outlook</h2>
                    Greetings Ladies and Gents<br />
<br />
I have just purchased a T-Mobile Dash and I like it a lot. To the point, the Problem that I am having is I would like to use my computer to enter my contacts and the sync this with my phone. The problem is that I don't want to use microsofts outlook because
 it keeps on forcing me to use the full program ie: mail. I like the mail program that I have now and dont want to change it. Is there a way I can use my pc to enter my contacts and then import them into my phone. Thanks<br />

            <span>Outlook mobile was designed to be used with Outlook so unfortunately you have no real choice.&nbsp;
<br />
BTW, you don't have to use Outlook mail if you choose not to.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I was a hard person to convert to "office " but I would never so back, the functionality of MS Office has made a huge difference in how I have been able to work .<br />

            After you install Outlook, do not configure an email account.&nbsp; When you setup your sync, you get to choose the options to sync which contacts will be one.

<p>I have a new HTC Bell phone.&nbsp; I also,&nbsp;am not interested in using the mail feature of outlook.&nbsp;
I want to be able to sync from the phone to the pc.&nbsp; My main method of entering data will be directly to the phone.&nbsp; My main concern is to have a back up of all the files, including calendar, contacts, tasks, notes,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i plug the phone into the computer for the first time &nbsp;I get a message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be able to snychronize only files, folders and other non outlook items if you continue.&nbsp; To snychronize email, calendar, contacts, tasks and notes with this computer, do the following:</p>
<p>disconnect the device</p>
<p>run outlook</p>
<p>reconnect the device</p>
<p>complete the synchronize set up wizard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This concerns me as I&nbsp; want to be able to sync the calendar, contacts, tasks and notes
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does run outlook mean?&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it mean open the file?&nbsp;&nbsp; I opened outlook then tried again</p>
<p>It says that same message.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then when I click on ok, it says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the pocket pc sync set up wizard.</p>
<p>If you click cancel you can still&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy and move files between your pocket pc and this computer&nbsp;&nbsp; - and add and remove programs on your pocket pc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I go past this point will I still be able to sync the calendar, contacts, tasks and notes?&nbsp; I'm just not sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

I guess the problem is that outlook needs to be configured first.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no idea how to do that.&nbsp; I don't plan to use mail&nbsp;in Outlook. &nbsp; Can I set up profile without mail settings?

<h2>            IE11&#47;Win 8.1 - Sign Out of Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have Bing as my homepage in IE&nbsp;and just upgraded from Win 8 to Win 8.1 today. I just noticed that I am unable to sign out of my Microsoft Account from the top-right of the page on bing.com. Each time I try and sign out, the page refreshes and I remain
 logged in. This is not how IE used to function under Win 8.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had installed Bing Desktop, but then uninstalled it. Not sure if this makes a difference.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do not want to stay signed in all the time, so how can I disable the automatic sign in and stay signed out?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>--Phil<br />

<h2>            Unwanted Cell Reformatting to Date &#40;Excel&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I use Excel 2007 for many different applications, as do my team.&nbsp; We continually run into the issue where entire worksheets reformat themselves to dates.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if it was a text, general, or number formatted cell.&nbsp; It's very inconsistent on when
 it occurs, but is always when you open the file.&nbsp; It does it on regular simple worksheets or complex shared workbooks that multiple users on multiple machines all have access.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I must say that it gets quite frustrating.&nbsp; Any help available or is this just a glitch?</p>

            <p>*All the computers within our system are on a military domain.</p>
<p>*The problem has occurred regularly since we upgraded to the 2007 version and Vista.&nbsp; Never had an issue under 2003 and XP.</p>
<p>*The issue happens regardless of the type of spreadsheets we're using.&nbsp; Shared, exclusive, new, or old.&nbsp; All 11 of our computers and even other computers when we've sent the spreadsheets out.&nbsp; It's almost like a running joke....albeit not very funny!</p>

            Not quite sure what you're asking for with a "pre-formatted" cell.&nbsp; All of the cells were formatted properly before I started making the spreadsheet.&nbsp; Everything works fine...most of the time.&nbsp; But, like it did yesterday, I opened it and EVERY cell that
 was formatted as "General" was changed to dates.&nbsp; Only cells that had percentages stayed the same.&nbsp; It happened across the entire workbook, not just one worksheet.&nbsp; It does it randomly.

<p>What I meant about pre-format was to format the cells before entering the data.</p>
<p>Try to preformat the cells before entering the data on any of the test excel file which is saved locally on the machine. To do so open Excel &gt; Right click on cell &gt; Format
 cells &gt; Choose ‘Text’ under category in Number tab &gt; Click ok. Then enter the data into cell, save the file then reopen and check whether the issue reoccurs.</p>

            Thanks for the clarification.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; We pre-formatted the cells in question before the issue occurred.&nbsp; Many of the cells that are switching contain formulas; therefore, "text" won't work either....unfortunately.&nbsp; Our text cells don't seem to be switching...just
 the General and/or Number cells.

            <p>This is just a guess, but I have heard / seen issues with Excel 2007 files that were created from Excel 2003 files.&nbsp; I can easily imagine similar issues in 2010.&nbsp; I would suggest you open a a fresh workbook, save it (I presume you are saving as .xlsx or
 .xlsm), then copy and paste (and reformat if necessary) from the problem workbook.&nbsp; I think sometimes problems occur when a .xls file is saved as .xlsx.&nbsp; That's my theory.&nbsp; (<em>If you want an example of this issue, plot an X-Y scatter chart in Excel 2003.&nbsp;
 Open in 2007, save as .xlsx.&nbsp;&nbsp; Close and re-open.&nbsp; Hover the mouse over a data point in the chart, the values/coordinates that pop-up are off-set by half an inch!</em>)</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

            Thanks Rich.&nbsp; That is definitely a possibility on some of them, but we're also having problems on workbooks that were created in 2007 and being maintained in 2007.&nbsp; The Army isn't using 2010 yet.

            <p>You say "the whole sheet" get's reformatted, but what is on the sheet?&nbsp; Is it really just numbers, or is there text, or numbers formatted as text?</p>
<p>If you open a file in 2007 that was last saved with an earlier version of Excel, Excel recalculates all&nbsp;formulas when the file is opened.&nbsp; If one of your team still uses Excel 2003, that could explain why sheets are changing when you open them (and on an
 incosistent basis).</p>
<p>If you put the following in cell B1:&nbsp;&nbsp; =A1</p>
<p>and then type a date in A1:&nbsp; 8/4/2011</p>
<p>A1 changes to be formatted as a date, but B1 displays the date serial number, 40759.</p>
<p>If you click in B2, then hit enter, B1 is automatically formatted as a date.&nbsp; This shows how the date formatting could be contageous to other cells in the sheet.&nbsp; If everything references a particular column, and that particular column is for some reason
 turned into a date, then when all the formula are recalculated (due to the file being last saved by an earlier version of Excel), they will inherit the date format.&nbsp; (Am I making sense?)</p>
<p>So, with a possible mechanism for this happening (a) at file open, and (b) to "the whole sheet", we just need to figure out what is being interpreted as a date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you do the following: (1) check to see if anyone is still using Excel 2003.&nbsp; If they are, see if saving in 2003, then opening in 2007 triggers this issue.&nbsp; (2) examine your spreadsheets and look for something that is referenced (either directly,
 or indirectly via other cells) that contains something that could become a date.&nbsp; Any serial numbers&nbsp;containing "/" or "-", etc.?</p>
<p>That's the best I've got for now.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

            <p>Thanks again, Rich.&nbsp; All of the machines are using a Dept of the Army load of Vista and Office 2007.&nbsp; The problems started when they fielded the Vista/2007 combination over the XP/2003 load.&nbsp; The entire installation was upgraded at the same approximate time.&nbsp;
 We've encountered the issue on several different products since the fielding and sometimes when we've posted products to SharePoint or emailed them to different installations.&nbsp; They'd open them and everything was dates and we'd get hate mail back.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The wierd thing with this whole issue is the inconsistency.&nbsp; We can be in and out of the same workbook multiple times for several days with no issues.&nbsp; Open it up one more time and everything has switched to dates.&nbsp; I've been unable to pinpoint a specific
 trigger point.</p>
<p>My definition of the whole sheet is everything on the particular worksheet that contains a general formatted formula.&nbsp; This particular one is a complex workbook that contains 3 raw data sheets and several other compilation sheets with multiple countifs,
 sumifs, and vlookups.&nbsp; (Amongst other formulas)&nbsp; A lot of the reference areas are numbers formatted as text fields used as criteria.&nbsp; We don't have any issue with those cells and there are no dashes or slashes that can be construed as dates.&nbsp; We have one column
 with serial numbers with dashes and slashes, but it isn't referenced in any formula nor do these text fields switch on us.</p>
<p>This whole thing has me pulling my hair out!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I appreciate the help.</p>
<p>Mark</p>

    <title>When converting a Word 2007 doc to PDF, Page X of Y option does not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jenfrg  say:</h3>
<h2>            When converting a Word 2007 doc to PDF, Page X of Y option does not work in Footer.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I'm using Word 2007, and converting a word document to PDF using Adobe Acrobat 8. When I use the<strong>Page X of Y</strong>&nbsp;field in a footer, it displays correctly when printing from Word, but if I convert it to PDF, it displays as Page 1 of 1, Page 2
 of 2, Page 3 of 3, and so on.</p>
<p>While troubleshooting I discovered that the issue only happens with the Page X of Y field when in a Footer. If it is in the body of the document it views correctly after PDF: Page 1 of 5, Page 2 of 5...etc.</p>
<p>Based on suggestions outside of this forum, I have tried the following with no success:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turned off Print in Background </li><li>Turned ON Print pages in reverse order </li><li>Turned Off show formatting marks </li></ul>

<p>NOTE: If I use the Print to PDF option, the numbers display correctly, but that disables all Bookmark options that you get when using the Acrobat tab or starting the conversion from Acrobat.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks Stefan. I actually did find that article yesterday and attempted all suggestions without success. The only option I did not try was writing an Add-in for a corporate environment. The issue isn't with printing from Word necessarily, it's from the conversion
 process of the Word document into the PDF. That may very well point to it being an Adobe Acrobat problem, but I've had no success in finding an answer in their forums to date.</p>
<p>Thanks again though. :)</p>

            Well, the PDF conversion resembles printing (which is very clear with some third-party PDF converters where you actually use the Print dialog box), so it was worth a try.
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing the problem occurs with all Word documents, not just a particular one?</p>

Did you try using the built-in PDF option to determine if it's the document or the Adobe add-in? You might find the&nbsp;built-in Save as PDF will work and do exactly what you want. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Using the Word add-in from Acrobat 8.2.4 I have just created PDFs from a 200 page document using both {Page} of {Numpages} and {Page} of {SectionPages} to provide the number of pages and in both case the fields were correctly resolved, so Acrobat is certainly
 able to do this.<br />

<p>Absolutely worth a try - and I tried all the options in that link. Believe it or not, it's just SOME documents. I can take one document with the Page X of Y fields in the Footer, and convert it to PDF using Acrobat PDFMaker, and it will display the page
 numbers correctly after conversion. I can take another document, set up the same, and the page numbers do NOT display correctly. I can create a new Word document, add a Footer and insert the Page X of Y page numbering, and it will NOT display correctly after
 the conversion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some documents would, some would not, and I could not determine why. I'm using Office 2007, but many documents we work with are created in earlier versions, or are created for compatibility with earlier versions of Word, so I even "played" with that. Creating
 the document as a docx, doc, or docx with compatibility. None of those options seemed to make a difference.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I did find out that a coworker, who has Adobe Acrobat version 9 (I'm using 8.2.4) could consistently convert my "problem" documents and the page number displayed correctly. So, that tells me, whatever the intermittent problem, it appears
 to be resolved in the AA9. Unfortunately, upgrading from AA8 to AA9 costs a substantial amount of money. Time to ask for it to be budgeted for next year. :)</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

<p>Thanks Beth. I did try that, and it works successfully. The problem is that with that built in option, you do not get the same advanced functionality for the PDF, such as automatic bookmarks, linked TOC and cross references..etc. All of which are crucial
 to the documents I'm delivering.</p>
<p>As you can see above in my response to Stefan this morning, I did discover that it appears to be an issue resolved in Adobe Acrobat v9. I just now have to petition for funds to upgrade.</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance.</p>

<p>I agree Graham. Acrobat v8.2.4 is capable of successfully doing the conversion of the NumPages, but unfortunately for me, not consistently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see above in my response to Stefan this morning, I did discover that it appears to be an issue resolved in Adobe Acrobat v9. I just now have to petition for funds to upgrade.</p>

            <p>Hi Aswin.</p>
<p>I am running the latest AMD drivers for my discrete laptop graphics card (760M). Since my initial post I've come to realize that all modern apps are affected. The issue does not occur when I start the app, only if the app is minimized and I restore it. I
 have my performance settings set to disable window animations if that makes any difference. I am currently running build 10547.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            Build 14926 has brought back this behavior. When modern apps are maximized, there is a "scrunching" like effect the menus and title bars go through for about a second. It may be related that I have all window maximize/minimize animations disabled.

    <title>Exclude Dictionary File not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paradronmedic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exclude Dictionary File not working properly</h2>
                    As per (lots) of previous posts i don't know if this question has been asked/answered properly yet. So here goes...<br />
<br />
I am creating a lot of different types of training documentation all of which need to have a consistent approach and be proofed in English UK<br />
<br />
My issue is that i get plain text formats sent to me from both English US and English UK writers so i get a mix of the two spellings e.g. color vs colour and customize vs customise.<br />
<br />
I have an extremely irritating problem when copying text into a new NORMAL template and proofing in English UK that it doesn't pick up English US misspellings, so i played about and changed all of my settings; regional, language, keyboard, dictionary, proofing
 to English UK. <br />
To no avail.<br />
I then created an ExcludeDictionaryUS.dic file and added a list of English US words, i.e. color, customize, organization, fetal etc. and added it as a custom dictionary. and it works!... kind of...<br />
<br />
It recognises color and fetal as being misspelled however any ize, ization, izing words. i.e. catalyze, customize, organization, customizing it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Is there something i have missed or doing wrong? I'm totally open to any insight as this is driving me crazy.
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            If you are working in UK English, then your exclude dictionary needs to be UK English also. It works in conjunction with the UK English dictionary.<br />
<br />
Incidentally both ise and ize endings are valid in UK English, which is why they are not normally flagged as errors.<br />
<br />
Color, center etc are US only spellings and the UK spell check should pick up those anomalies.<br />
<br />
Note that none of this is relevant unless you actually apply the UK language parameter to ALL the text, and I strongly recommend turning off the automatic language detection.<br />

            Hi Graham<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response. <br />
I do appreciate that ise and ize are both valid so not normally flagged as errors I think my issue was more as to why the excluded dictionary wasn't picking then ize's up as errors when i'd written them in to an exclude file. I'm no expert at this though so
 i may have missed something out. Pardon my ignorance but could you expand on the following:<br />
<br />
<i>'your exclude dictionary needs to be UK English also. It works in conjunction with the UK English dictionary.'
</i><br />
I am using Custom.dic (which doesn't have any text apart from the UK LCID code) <br />
I have created an ExcludeUS.dic file located in UProof (containing just the words that i want excluded with and also with and without the # LCID US and UK codes as a prefix)<br />
<br />
<i>'Note that none of this is relevant unless you actually apply the UK language parameter to ALL the text'</i><br />
I'm not sure where i would need to apply this, would this not be automatic for each new document or would this need to be applied to all of the text each time?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help. <br />

            The ExcludeUS dictionary needs to be ExcludeUK. You are working in UK English not US English. It means exclude words from the UK dictionary, not exclude American words.<br />
<br />
As for the language - the default language is dependent on the Windows regional input language settings in Windows. However every character in a document may have its own language parameter, so just changing the default will not affect the language of imported
 text with a language parameter already applied. It will keep that language unless you apply a different language.<br />
<br />
New documents formatted with styles that have the UK language parameter will be formatted in UK English.<br />
<br />
Custom dictionaries may be language dependent or apply to all languages. You can only save words in the default custom dictionary.<br />

            Thanks Graham<br />
<br />
I wasn't aware that the file name needed to be in a specific format i.e. ExcludeUK.dic. I have now saved appropriately. All of my language settings are in UK English and i am typing directly into word as well as copying from other formatted documents.<br />
<br />
I now have the following in my custom dictionaries under the following languages:<br />
ExcludeUK.dic (default) (English US) (it doesn't mark color as a misspelling when set as English UK)<br />
Custom.dic (default) (English US)<br />
<br />
I have gone through numerous tutorials on building exclude dictionaries<a href="http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/excludewordfromdic.htm#Word_2007_2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/</a> but still have the
 issue of word misspelling some, (color, fetal) but not all (customize) words. <br />
I thought the purpose of the exclude dictionary would be to exclude (from CUSTOM.dic) any word that i wanted and flag it up as a misspelling<br />
<br />
Is there any straightforward way around this (I'm very happy for a step by step approach) or is it all conditional?<br />
<br />
Thanks again :) <br />

            Actually the file names are not correct for exclude dictionaries (fine for custom dictionaries) - it was merely the principle of language dependency I was trying to convey. See

            Hi Graham<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply, however this is the exact link (as posted previously) that i have been looking through for a step by step guide to creating exclude dictionaries but as detailed previously this doesn't seem to be working.<br />
<br />
Thanks for trying<br />

            Note that you don't create an exclude dictionary for Word 2010. The dictionary is already created, and you must use it. The one you want to use for UK English is ExcludeDictionaryEN0809.lex (this information is at the bottom of the referenced article).
 This and only this dictionary is the one that will be used when the language at the insertion point is UK English.

            Hi Suzanne<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply, I got as far as trying to find ExcludeDictionaryEN0809.lex in the extremely helpful and detailed guide in the referenced link, however, even after showing hidden files in Uproof i couldn't find the file described. only an empty (apart
 from the LCID code) CUSTOM.dic. <br />
I think that's where i thought i could create a new excluded list. <br />
<br />
I am on a works computer so i haven't yet tried if the same issue occurs at home.<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

            Where I found it on my machine was in C:\Users\Suzanne\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\UProof. Obviously, "Suzanne" is&nbsp;my profile name. I have four EN files and one FR, probably reflecting that I have at some point actually applied French (France) to some text.
 If I used other flavors of French or Spanish (thus bringing those proofing tools into play), I would expect to see other files appear.

            Hi Suzanne<br />
<br />
I double checked the filepath again as previously detailed to find my Uproof folder but i still just return with the 'blank' CUSTOM.dic as my only file. Again, I don't know whether this is something that is locally controlled by our administrators (I can't
 imagine that they would just take out the .lex files though)<br />
<br />
Is there any way that you know to that these can be imported? I've tried Microsoft's website but any reference to 'exclude dictionary' they link me to your site which is super helpful but unfortunately doesn't help me with my missing files.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
Natalie<br />

    <title>Trying to copy from excel and Paste Hyperlink into a Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenholman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to copy from excel and Paste Hyperlink into a Word document...keep getting too much space in document</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I have searched for an answer to this, but even MrExcel failed me on this one. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to take information gathered in Excel, and then transfer the information into a report template in Word.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, say a field consultant goes on a visit and meets with Mr. Tucker, president of Kelly's Heroes, on July 18, 2014.&nbsp; I want the consultant to be able to take their tablet, and using Excel, enter all of that into individual cells such as</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Contact</td>
<td>
<p>Mr. Tucker</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Title</td>
<td>President</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Company name</td>
<td>Kelly's Heroes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Date of visit</td>
<td>July 18, 2014</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>Now, in the Word document, I am trying to set up a template where this information can be transferred into a report to be sent out to a given business.&nbsp; So, I have been trying to copy from Excel and "Paste Hyperlink" into Word.&nbsp; I have tried to paste link
 as RTF, unformatted, HTML format,... nothing eliminates a hard return and space around the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say I want to incorporate the date into a sentence.&nbsp; I want to say, "Mr. Tucker, this report covers the visit made to your company, Kelly's Heroes, on July 18, 2014."</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I get is </p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Mr. Tucker</span></p>
<p><span>, this report covers the visit made to your company,
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Kelly's Heroes</span></p>
<p><span>, on
</span></p>
<p><span>Friday, July 18, 2014</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>!!!!! Very frustrating.&nbsp; Please help.</p>

            Using Copy and Paste, you cannot avoid the contents of each Excel cell being inserted into a separate paragraph.&nbsp; What you could to then however is select the data and use the replace function to replace ^p with a comma and a space (or what ever else that
 you might want.

            <p>It helps to know that I am not missing some kind of formatting issue, but I may end up with more editing than I want.&nbsp; I used the find/replace suggestion, and it does remove the hard returns.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I still end up with spacing issues (double spacing).
 I am trying to copy over, say, a name and address to use at the top of the page as a business letter.&nbsp; I can't seem to get it to single space.&nbsp; But, the whole paste link idea has lost steam due to the editing required in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is to have a standard Word template for a report.&nbsp; Then, I want to have another file that only contains the data that change from report to report.&nbsp; That way, I can quickly generate a new report from the new data.&nbsp; I'm sure there is a way
 to do it.&nbsp; Maybe I can do the whole thing simply from one Word doc to another.&nbsp; I'll give that a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, iAuditor may end up winning this technology skirmish. ho-hum :)</p>
