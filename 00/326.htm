<h2>            &#34;Click here to enter text box&#34; doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    I have set the protection for the document and the check boxes are enabled and work but the "click here to enter text" doesn't work on the first click, or the 50th.&nbsp; Eventually it will but is there a certain spot I'm supposed to be clicking in the box???

The two types of control are incompatible with one another and should not be used in the same document.<br />

<p>I've been looking at buying one because i hate not being able to transfer pictures etc over to the computer easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But i cannot find where the cable is meant to plug into my phone ? Only the micro sd card is the only place. Or do i need to get a card reader for the micro sd card?</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 &#124; Is there any module that you can add to word to allow to add 300 dpi compression of your pictures&#63;</h2>
                    <p>220 is ok, good on the printer but if you want to be able to zoom your document and read the text in the picture, 220 is just not enough.&nbsp; Especially that it will be converted to a PDF after to allow both visualization in Word and PDF format.</p>
<p>Converting every picture (PNG)&nbsp;myself would take a long time, but I was wondering if Word was able to do it?</p>

<h2>            Problems with writing text in Powerpoint</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>maybe somebody can help, i am not sure wether identified a bug.</p>
<p>If i open a text field &nbsp;it all starts normal. But if i use the copy/ paste function &nbsp;and open a new text box suddenly the cursor seems to be in an other modus. It look like the overwrite modus in word i guess. The cursor ist not any more at the end of the
 textfield , it is on the position of one letter before. This is irritating and makes it impossible to write well. Thus anybody has the same problem and know how to change this modus?</p>
<p>Thanks for help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you can get the screen to show the effect, then click on the <strong>smiling face</strong> in the upper right corner of the PowerPoint screen. Select

    <title>Alternatives to Domain Aggregate functions&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brobi04s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alternatives to Domain Aggregate functions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use Domain Aggregate functions quiet often. Sometimes they run in an efficient timely manner, but sometimes they take forever to run, especially if I have to use a DCount before a DSUM or DAVG.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read about how others have experienced the same issues which lead them to try other means of accomplishing the same results, but they never mention what other means they pursue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are some of the most popular alternatives to using Domain Aggregate functions?

            <p>That's because the "other methods" are different in different situations.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's not that the domain functions are any slower than running a query some other way.&nbsp; The issue occurs when&nbsp;they are used in ways that require them to be used more often than might be needed if a different kind of query (probably a Totals type)&nbsp;were used.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, I recommend you think about the algorithm you are using and try to find a way to set things up so a single query can calculate all the values instead of using lots of domain functions.&nbsp; If you have trouble doing that, post back with a Copy/Paste of your
 VBA code and we'll try to suggest some alternative approaches.</p>

            <p>I have listed the SQL for the Query that I am trying to run (Avail E) and the SQL for all preceding Queries. Running Avail E takes forever to run. Avail D takes under 2 minutes to run, but then it makes it difficult to toggle between screens if I leave Avail
 D open. If I append the data from Avail D into a Table and the run the DSUM in Avail E off of the table it speeds up the time used to run Avail E to about 5 seconds. It would be nice to not append the data to a table, but if that is what I have to do, then

            <p>That is a pretty complex compilation of data.&nbsp; I don't have the time to totally unravel all that, so I'll make a few suggestions that may help a little or a lot.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Potentially huge, if you haven't done it already, is to make sure you have referential integrity enforced on the relationships between all those tables.&nbsp; Also make sure you have&nbsp;an index on every field used in a WHERE clause and in the&nbsp;domain aggregate functions'
 where condition.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It may be significant to clean up the extraneous stuff in the queries.&nbsp; Delete the ORDER BY clause in all but the last query.&nbsp; Also, change the HAVING clause in Avail A to a WHERE clause (this can be done in the query designer by changing the strEmploymentStatus,
 strGeneralTitle and Leave_or_Training fields' Total row entry from GROUP BY to WHERE).&nbsp; Those same fields and any other fields that are not used in any subsequent query&nbsp;should have&nbsp;their Show box unchecked.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Probably most important is the DSum in Avail E.&nbsp; This is the kind of use of a subquery or domain aggregate function that really slows things down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember that something like the sum of a sum over partial datasets&nbsp;is the same as&nbsp;the sum over the entire
 other fields needed in the final query (only the Sup Name field?) and join it to the first query to pick up all the aggregated values.</p>

<h2>            Gmail will not sync in Outlook for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several email accounts running on Outlook for Mac 2016, one of which is Gmail. All of them sync automatically and perfectly, except for Gmail. I believe this has been a problem for several years now - does anyone know why, and whether there is a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Philip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this situation, I suggest you create a test profile in Outlook for Mac and configure your account to see if the issue still happens.</p>

            I have a new N95 and had the same problem as you because your provider has branded the phone, so I found the nearest Nokia Service Center and they updated mine under the Nokia warrenty (show them my receipt). Since the did it I have had no problems with
 ver. 20.0.15...:)

<p>Just to give you the full idea of the problem.</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) tells me that I need to update, because it has not been updated for 7 days. In the past it always updated automatically. Anyways, I figured that I would just do it manually, but when I try to do this I get this exact message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virus &amp; spyware definitions update failed</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials wasn't able to check for virus&nbsp;&amp; spyware definition updates. Make sure your computer is connected to the Internet and try again</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click 'Help' for more information about the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error Code: 0x80240022</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error Description: Microsoft Security Essentials&nbsp;couldn't download the definitions updates. This could be caused by a missing system file, and incorrect system setting, or a problem with a registry file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now if I click 'OK' nothing happens, but when&nbsp;I click 'Help' it just brings me to this site. I didn't see a video about this problem, and I also tried to google it, but didn't find a solution. When I tried to re-download it said that I already had one or
 more copies, and that if I wanted to re-download, I would have to uninstall and then redownload.</p>
<p>I was wondering if this could be caused due to a lack of memory?</p>
<p>My system: Windows XP with Intel Pentium 4 Processor.</p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>

<p>First, you&nbsp;can always download signatures from the Malware Protection Center:<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Definitions/HowToMSE.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Definitions/HowToMSE.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the excellent advice above, you should check to see if you can receive updates from Microsoft Update or Windows Update.&nbsp; Your problem may be outisde&nbsp;MSE, since we usually just use these operating system's update mechanism.</p>

<h2>            N95 8GB buttons not functioning</h2>
                    
<p>I've had my Nokia N95 8GB for 2 yeras now, when all of a sudden some of the top media buttons have stopped working, preventing me from accessing messages and contacts which is a complete pain. I have tried taking the phone apart to clean the board and performed
 a hard reset, but to no avail. Has anyone ever had this problem and have any solutions? Also, would I have lost all my contacts from reseting? &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated as it's becoming increasingly frustrating not being able to read my &nbsp;new messages!</p>

<p><strong>The likely cause of problem is the connecting foil cable between phone's main body and the sliding/screen section. It can easily be replaced with new unit which costs about $20. Make sure you purchase a quality unit. I purchased 2 (very cheap) units
 from China and 1 unit in USA and all did not function properly. Ended up buying it from reputable source, double the cost and it did work. This is your best option, just replace the part.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Other option is to use a Bluetooth keyboard. I used a mini bluetooth keyboard with my N95 and it controls all keys and shortcut funtions, etc. Not sure if you'll be able to configure keyboard at this stage (without use of some buttons).</strong></p>

<h2>            Nokia 6288 - Modem issue</h2>
                    
<p>I seem to be having a problem with my Nokia 6288. I would like to use my phone as a modem, the problem i am facing is that whenever i connect my phone as a modem through USB, the connection is made succesfully. But whenever i attempt to go onto a site i.e
 like the 3 Homepage it does not seem to work. I have made sure that my mobile has the correct settings for my network provider, i am able to load 3's homepage on my phone without any problems at all. I have also made sure that the settings used in PC Suite's
 "One Touch Access" is set to "3 United Kingdom Modem", the dial up connection is made succesfully as a local area network connection icon appears in the system tray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you think is wrong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions are more than welcome!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am initially after the amount of time it takes for the archive to start processing a mailbox and moving email to archive and when this is complete how often the archive policy task runs.&nbsp; Also is there a way of manually starting the default policy against
 a mailbox?</p>

            Hi Rob,<br />
<br />
By default, the <strong>Managed Folder Assistant</strong> processes a mailbox once in seven days in Exchange Online. So the archive policy will take effect on a mailbox within 7 days after the archive mailbox is enabled. And you can use the
<strong>Start-ManagedFolderAssistant</strong> cmdlet to immediately start messaging records management (MRM) processing of mailboxes that you specify. For more information, please refer to the following article:<br />

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 710 email accounts no longer working with SSL no answers from vodafone and Nokia won&#39;t support this phone</h2>
                    I have a Nokia Lumia 710, have been using it happily for a few years, having both my windows live email account and my own email accounts via a web services company. Yesterday, both my own email accounts stopped working on the phone, while the windows
 live hotmail account continues to work. My own accounts work fine on all my other devices using the correct settings IMAP with SSL. &nbsp;They stopped working on the windows phone, contacted vodafone, my phone company, who were unable to provide technical support
 for a windows phone, and nokia, who don't provide support for it either (don't know why) and there is no windows phone support number in the UK. I eventually figured out if I went back to old the pop and no SSL settings that the email would work, obviously
 I am not going to do that, but does anyone have any suggestions as to who to get this working again ? I have tried all the suggestions on the support pages, going back to insecure settings seems to be the only solution. &nbsp;Or
                </div>

            <p>Hello Robert:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having getting some emails to sync.&nbsp; The Windows Phone 7 does in deed support non Microsoft account emails.&nbsp; The issue you are having is related to the certificates on the phone, account settings
 on the phone, &nbsp;the email provider or your account in general.&nbsp; As this is not an issue on other devices it seems the account as&nbsp;whole is not the issue so that leaves us with the certificates, account settings and your email provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would suggest you do is delete the email from the phone and re-add the account.&nbsp; I would first suggest you add this account by going to settings &gt; emails + accounts &gt; add account &gt; other account.&nbsp; Once you do this sync the account and verify
 if the issue continues.&nbsp; If it does, delete again and try adding it back via the advanced setup option.&nbsp; You may need to contact your email provider to get the specific settings details required to add the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, go to settings &gt; time + date &gt; turn automatically set to OFF &gt; set the time, date and time zone manually.&nbsp; Once you have made this change, sync your accounts again and see if you notice any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue continues the next thing to do is try emailing a copy of the SSL certificate to yourself and opening this on the phone and installing it.&nbsp; I have seen this work with customers that have issues with Outlook Exchange accounts.&nbsp; You might find
 more information related to this in other posts here, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/search/search?SearchTerm=custom+SSL&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=WinPhone&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=&amp;ContentTypeScope=&amp;x=9&amp;y=10#/WinPhone///1">

            <p>Hi Mark</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt reply. I had already tried all your suggestions, also doing a factory reset (lost all my apps and some non-synched data). I can confirm that I cannot now use an IMAP or POP account with SSL. I don't know how to send an SSL, surely
 it is just an option on your email setup ? This email setup is working correctly with SSL on all my other devices, iPod, samsung galaxy, and had been working for sometime on my windows phone : at some point in the past a year or two ago, my web services company
 advised we should be using SSL, and until Thursday, I had been doing this successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have got a workaround, setting up new windows live email accounts for each of my actual accounts and forwarding to them, this is working fine, except for the fact I don't know for certain the windows is using SSL ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To answer your questions :</p>
<ul>
<li>Make and model of your phone. &nbsp;Nokia Lumia 710</li><li>Current OS version.7.10.8862.144</li><li>Current firmware revision. 1600.3036.8858.12460</li><li>Country you are located in. UK</li><li>Regional setting of your phone. UK</li><li>Language setting of your phone. UK English</li><li>Speech setting of your phone. &nbsp;all speech settings off</li><li>Exact error message and code you receive.originally error message was 'not up--to-date' with error code 80004005, when deleted account and added back message is 'attention required' with same error code</li><li>What is the email provider you are having issues with, AOL, ymail; rocketmail, etc....? &nbsp;machighway.com : issue is plainly not with the email provider, as all other devices (iMac, windows laptop, samsung galaxy and iPod) work correctly. The issue
 is with windows phone.</li><li>How are you connected when you try this, WiFi, cellular data, both? both</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So, to conclude, in addition to this not working, &nbsp;I have still got unresolved questions :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there a windows support number in the UK, as I have had other problems, and so does my friend, we need actual assistance, not cruising technical forums we don't understand.</p>
<p>2. Is it safe to use windows email accounts on a smartphone ? Do they use IMAP/SSL as advised by my web services company, machighway ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Can I get my paid for apps back, I would particularly like to get back Rail Planner which cost £4.99.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Roberta</p>

            <p>Hello Roberta:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; We are disappointed to hear you are having this issue with your email still.&nbsp; At this point it does look like the issue is the security being used.&nbsp; This could be that the phone is simply getting the incorrect information, the
 certificate being used may be using an unsupported file type, the certificate may be corrupted or the certificate may have expired.&nbsp; At this point you will need further assistance from the email provider regarding the certificates or you will want to move
 forward with one of the work arounds available to get your email syncing with the phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of those work arounds is what you mentioned regarding setting up Microsoft accounts and having the emails forwarded to that account.&nbsp; The Microsoft account uses ActiveSync and not IMAP to deliver emails.&nbsp; From my findings it does look like Microsoft
 accounts use SSL to securely deliver mail.&nbsp; You might want to contact <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/getsupport/hostpage.aspx?oaspworkflow=start_1.0.0.0&amp;wfname=msa&amp;pesid=10123&amp;locale=en-ie&amp;wf=0&amp;ccsid=635134699774807516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft account support </a>here to see if you can further confirm this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing you might consider at this point is working with your mail provider regarding the account settings and your certificates.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>I would start by discussing the account settings with them.&nbsp; I would specifically focus on ports used for outgoing SMTP server information&nbsp;and incoming email server.&nbsp; When you are discussing this, please focus on the port number.&nbsp; I have seen a specific
 issue related to AOL emails where the port that is auto populating is incorrect and changing this corrects email issues.&nbsp; You can see more about this issue here,
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-sync/nokia-lumia-error-code-800c0000-wont-connect-to/133ac1b0-98ea-4653-a151-fba16135e2f5?rtAction=1414357579910">

</li><li>Secondly you might ask them about getting a copy of the SSL certificate sent to your email.&nbsp; Have it sent to an email you are able to access on the phone or forward it to one that can be accessed on the phone.&nbsp; Once you do this, open the email and download
 the certificate to the phone via the email.</li><li>Finally, inquire with them what format the certificates being used are in.&nbsp; If they are unable to tell you this see if they can give you the file extension used for the SSL that should tell us enough to verify if it is supported.</li></ul>
<p>When it comes to live assistance for your Windows Phone there is live chat available here, &nbsp;<a href="https://support.live.com/default.aspx?productKey=oepzunechat&amp;locale=en-us&amp;st=1&amp;wfxredirect=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.live.com/default.aspx?productKey=oepzunechat&amp;locale=en-us&amp;st=1&amp;wfxredirect=1</a>
 .&nbsp; They will help you the best they can when it comes to issues on your phone.&nbsp; As we have discussed the issue here is the phone getting proper information regarding your account.&nbsp; There is going to be very little more they can offer that has not been discussed
 on this forum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to the application.&nbsp; If this application is still on the Store you would be able to download it again if you reset the phone with the same primary Microsoft account.&nbsp; Go to the store and search out the application.&nbsp; If you are presented with a
 buy button, tap this one time.&nbsp; You should be informed that you already own the application and be given an option to download.&nbsp; If you are not able to find the application or if you are asked to buy it again, contact live support and they will be able to
 further assist you with this.</p>

</p><p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>

            <p>Although an old question, just to add an answer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Phone 7 did not support anything else than SSLv3 for POP3, IMAP, and SMTP. Back on 15th October 2014, many providers like&nbsp;MacHighway turned-off SSLv3 and changed to TLSv1 because of SSL-POODLE. Windows Phone 7 supports TLSv1 everywhere like the Internet
 Explorer and for Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) but not for POP3/IMAP/SMTP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check whether your E-mail provider still supports SSLv3 via a UNIX computer and the command</p>
<p>openssl s_client -connect jimbo.machighway.com:993 -ssl3</p>

    <title>Merge outlook express email account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamsokolic47  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merge outlook express email account</h2>
                    My outlook express had some kind of meltdown, eliminating hundreds of emails from the Sent folder. More important, when I send an email, it gets to the recipient, but doesn't show up in the sent folder as ever existing. So I opened an outlook account under
 a different email address. I was wondering if there is any way to merge the older account into my new outlook account and if so, how?

            Are you still using Windows XP? That's the most recent version of Windows where Outlook Express runs. Do you really mean Outlook Express? You posted in a forum dedicated to the web-based mail service called Outlook.com, which is completely different from
 Outlook Express.

<h2>            Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 10041 - desktop and task bar&#47;tray issues - Asus T100</h2>
                    <p>I installed WIN 10 Build 10041 on my Asus T100. &nbsp;All seemed to go well with the install. &nbsp;However, after I enter my login credentials and the desktop loads up, it seems to get stuck in a loop. &nbsp;First the desktop background will load, then the taskbar will
 load, and lastly the icons on the desktop will load -- but at this point, the entire process starts over again, and loops (all desktop and taskbar icons disappear, and then load up again... only to disappear about 6 seconds after loading). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open a browser if I'm quick enough, and browsing is not impacted (though I can see the taskbar/tray continue to cycle through loading over and over). &nbsp;I cannot access Windows Explorer, Search, or anything on the Start Menu. &nbsp;The Start Menu will appear
 briefly, but not long enough in this 6 second cycle/loop for me to click on a program or app. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if anyone else has encountered this bug. &nbsp;If so, is a workaround or fix available?</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi&nbsp;Jeff,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft forums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced, I will surely help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the steps listed here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I suggest you to disconnect all the external devices and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If the issue persists, I suggest you to hard restart the computer and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode and check if the issue persists. Safe mode Starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings
 and basic device drivers and services as possible causes.<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

</span><span>Let us know the update after you try the above steps.</span> </p>

<h3> benwallis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 receiving meeting requests as plain text. Also cannot send meeting requests.</h2>
                    Hi All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My copy of Outlook 2010 only receives meeting requests as plain text (but not actually readable). When I try and send a meeting request the message sits in the outbox and I get an error "0x800CCC13 Cannot connect to the network, verify your network connection
 or modem" during send and receive. But as I can send standard email fine this can't really be the actual problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have made sure that the "Read all standard mail in plain text"&nbsp;check box is un-ticked as described here&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/outlook-2010-meeting-request-text-only/c53870e9-ff84-4d9b-b659-605cdfa7a690">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/outlook-2010-meeting-request-text-only/c53870e9-ff84-4d9b-b659-605cdfa7a690</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also tried an Office repair (via Add/Remove Programs), a new mail profile and a clean re-install (including removing any relevant registry keys that I could find after the uninstall (<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\
 and&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\)</span>. Neither had any effect on how the meeting requests are processed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also if I set the account up on another computer meeting requests are processed and revived correctly so it is not the account.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I log in as another user (even one which has never used the computer before and so should have a newly created user account) on my PC and set up the email account in Outlook then the problem is persists.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This behavior makes me think that this is an issue with the Outlook installation but I thought I fully removed it before I re-installed it- was I incorrect in that assumption? I am at a point where my next step is a re-format and re-install of Windows
 but any advice to allow me to avoid that would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The computer is Windows XP Pro SP3 and the email account is set up as an IMAP connection to third party hosted Exchange.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry for the frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may occur due to security reasons.</p>
<p>Which security application is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may start with launching Outlook in its application safe and then sending the meeting request to check if this behavior persists.</p>
<p>Click <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span>, go to <span style="font-weight: bold">
Programs,</span> go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Accessories</span>, click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Run</span>, type <span style="font-weight: bold">Outlook /safe </span>(note there is a space between<span style="font-weight: bold"> Outlook
</span>and<span style="font-weight: bold"> /</span></font>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">File</span><span> tab.</span>
</li><li><span>Go to </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Options.</span> </li><li><span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Add-ins.</span> </li><li><span>Clear all the options.</span>&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>If the issue persists, restart the computer in Windows Clean Boot and check if the issue occurs:</p>

            Hi Aravinda,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for you reply.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The computer is using McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.8.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Starting Outlook in Safe mode has no effect on the issue, still can't send meeting requests and they are still received in plain text.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I start in Clean Boot mode (using this&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>, method 2,&nbsp;as the computer is XP). Outlook will not start- after flashing up a set up window a couple of times I get an
 error saying "Microsoft Office cannot verify the license for this product. You should repair the Office program by using Control Panel.". If I start in normal mode again it is fine- I am assuming this is to do with a lack of networking.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have also tried removing McAfee VSE and trying the meeting requests- this also makes no difference. So I reckon it is not that.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there anything else I can try?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the issue also occurs in Windows Clean boot, I would like to know how the internet connection is configured for your computer (Dial-up, Satellite, Wi-fi or High speed)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using a wireless router to connect to the internet, you may by pass the router and connect directly and check if the issue occurs.</p>

<p>Hello Diane:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is Version 1803 (Build 9126.2152 Klick-und-los)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not using the default setting with port 110 for outbound, instead, I am using outbound port 995, inbound 587, automatic. At different times, as this problem has randomly appeared 3 or 4 times, out of the blue, I have used different combinations of these
 setting until suddenly, miraculously, the test message went through, which meant the problem was fixed. Then, a week or two later, the same problem would re-appear. This time, all the different combinations of settings have had no positive result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What completely befuddles is me that a setting works for a long time and then all of a sudden it does not work any longer, and the repair function fails. Why would something that worked minutes ago for weeks at a time, suddenly no longer work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the path to this, since one of the error messages says to contact my ISP, I have contacted the ISP, which does not support Outlook via its technical service, nonetheless went through the options with me and concluded on the very solid ground that my browser
 is working, my inbound is working and my Webmail works and everything on the same account in my Android smartphone works, that the fault does not lie with the ISP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

            You have click to run - i wanted to make sure it wasn't the (buggy) new Windows Store version. 
<br />
<br />What exactly happens when the send fails?  
<br />
<br />In File, Account Settings, open account settings dialog then double click on the email account. Click More Settings. On the outgoing server tab, do you have the option selected to use the incoming mail credentials to send? 
<br />
<br />Do you access the mailbox using multiple computers? When you use POP, it puts a lock on the mailbox which prevents other clients from accessing it until the lock is removed shortly after it is done checking for new mail. This triggers a password dialog, which fails if the lock is still on - and both send/receive should fail.

<p>Here is the exact error message I get once the sending of e-mail has failed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fehler (0x8004210B) beim Ausführen der Aufgabe "*** Email address is removed for privacy *** - Nachrichten werden gesendet": "Timeout beim Warten auf eine Antwort vom Postausgangsserver (SMTP). Wenn Sie diese Meldung weiterhin erhalten, wenden Sie sich an Ihren Serveradministrator
 oder Internetdienstanbieter."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the option checked to use incoming mail credentials. I also tried unchecking that and re-entering the password. That also did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also access my mail account using my android phone. There, using the Android version of Outlook, sending and receiving works. The only other place I access my account, which is with a local cable company, is Webmail. I use no other laptop or desktop computers
 to access my e-mail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from trying port numbers 465 and 587 for outgoing, there are the following 4 encryption settings: (1.) None, (2.) SSL/TLS, (3.) STARTTLS, (4.)Automatic. So, following assorted online advice, I tried all possible combinations, some of which worked intermittently,
 some for weeks, some for months, but the problem always returned. Now that the same problem has returned, all the possible combinations have ceased working and only the STARTTLS and Automatic settings coupled with port 587 do not block INCOMING e-mail as well.
 I really wish I could get an answer to why it would be that a setting that works for weeks at a time, all of a sudden, from one moment to the next, STOPS working. Why would that be? It's not viruses. I run Kaspersky and I also do cross checks regularly with
 Windows Defender. My system is new, virus-free, Trojan-free, completely patched and up to date. Can I possibly get an answer as to why I see these changes that disable my system, when I have done nothing to change anything and I am completely virus-free and
 up to date?</p>

            That is a time out error. Did Kaspersky install an outlook addin? if so, disable it. Disable all email scanning in the utility too. Some of the 3rd party AV programs hook into the smtp port to scan mail as its sent - this could be causing problems.

            Miraculously, without my actually doing anything at all, yesterday evening, the problem fixed itself. Of course Kaspersky, just like any other Antivirus program, is set up to catch viruses, malware, Trojans, etc. in incoming e-mail - and maybe on outgoing
 mails as well. Disabling that would defeat the purpose, wouldn't it? Also, Kaspersky has run fine and uninterrupted whether Outlook was running or not. So if you are correct and the problem is a time out error, this time out lasted pretty much a day or two.
 And that is not good. If you google error&nbsp;<span>0x8004210B, you will find no shortage of people experiencing the same problem and getting all sorts of answers, and, of course, offers of software to run that supposedly fixes Outlook and other Microsoft
 problems. I used to have 3 different programs running with my Windows 7 computer, just to keep Windows and MS Office from going off the rails. Enough computer gurus would tell me that I was out of my tree. But nobody actually had any solutions, apart from
 going to the local computer shop for a couple of hundred dollars or so, uninstalling and reinstalling everything, or calling in for support, which used to be $50 or so and then it was around $200, just for the privilege of talking to a Microsoft employee to
 fix problems with Microsoft products. The pattern that has emerged so many times, is the notion that the fault lies never with anything from Microsoft. No, it is always, according to Microsoft, every time, without fail, a problem with something or someone
 else. Even the software itself, when Microsoft product do have problems, have error messages that put blame elsewhere. Like this time, check with ISP, which is unrelated. Or, disable a vital function of your antivirus software, which is another shot on one's
 own goal. Alternatively, I could just use Defender, right, but Defender is a case of you get what you pay for. It's free, which is nice, but it also does not catch everything. There is always, always, always blame for other things. Never, ever, ever, an inward
 look towards why it is that there are always issues with Microsoft products. Granted, Windows 10 is better. In fact, when I first installed my usual 3rd party "fix-it" programs, those derailed Windows 10 completely. So I uninstalled all but one, which all
 computer gurus use: C Cleaner. So far that has not messed anything up yet. But isn't there ANY institutional pride within Microsoft to deal with all the issues, apart from placing blame elsewhere with such overwhelming consistency? I mean, think about it honestly,
 disable my Kaspersky from checking my e-mail program? I have a counter-suggestion for you. Apart from probably sharing the contents of my computer with Vladimir Vladimirovitch Putin (which I can probably live with), take an example from Kaspersky. Kaspersky
 works without fail, all the time, every time and customer service is awesome and free. The microsecond I find out that they provide an OS, I will switch to that. I am also deeply offended by the new notion I heard, which is that the OS and Office will, in
 future only be online, with the intention of having a monthly bill for every computer user and then all files and software reside with Microsoft. So 10 would be the last OS. I can only hope that competition and perhaps regulators will come along to stop that
 overreach. But back to my original problem. 2 days worth of time out error then? Really? I will also return to my previous question, which was not answered, which I see as part of a larger pattern with Microsoft: Why does your Outlook-internal repair program
 not fix the problem? Why would that be? Error&nbsp;</span><span>0x8004210B has quite a following online. It is mentioned in this forum and many other places online. That means necessarily that Microsoft is aware of this glitch. The response is the offer
 of little manual fixes like changing port numbers and encryption protocols and, of course, assigning blame elsewhere, such as to the ISP. You repair program fails and offers no solution. Does your repair program ever actually fix anything or is it part of
 the larger plan to have everything go online, grab everyone's data and if they fall on hard times and can't pay the bill, tough tacos? Why would Microsoft knowingly, consciously choose to have an inoperable repair program?</span><br />

<br />No, not really. It will still scan attachments and html messages if you open them and warn you at that time (if the exploit is in their database), rather than as you download the messages. Scanning email has been know to corrupt messages and cause other issues - this is why Microsoft Defender doesn't scan email. Kaspersky is definitely better than McAfee, Norton, and AVG at not corrupting email - those three should not be used to scan email. 
<br />
<br />It's more efficient if the email server scans - then blocks or warns about potentially infected attachments and identifies spam.

            It is very clear that the problems are known by Microsoft. I return to my original and unanswered question: "Why does the Outlook-internal repair program not work?" Microsoft knows that there are problems. It has a repair program, rather than to fix it
 such that the problems don't occur in the first place. And Microsoft chooses consciously to have an inoperable repair program. Why is that?

            You know, I develop products for a living. Before I put anything out there, I make sure it works. I never get to the point of having lots of complaints and then people's systems don't work, and then they buy products whose reason to exist is exclusively
 to fix MY products (are you kidding me?), and then they have more problems.... Diane, divorce yourself for a moment from the whole computer thing and think about the CULTURE within an organisation that is necessary for such conditions to exist in any realm?
 Would you accept it from your doctor? From police? How about from tools in your husband's mancave? Yeah, we're not really sure why it doesn't work and we won't talk about the fact that we put annoying repair programs in that don't do the job and CONSTANTLY
 blame everyone and everything else for our products. In what realm would you accept such a thing as a customer of any goods or any services, Diane? And then you find out, OH, there are only two competitors. And the other guy is more expensi

<h2>            N8&#58; How to transfer music to new microSd card</h2>
                    
<p>Please only provide advice related to the N8 for this post, as I won't try things that are for other phones - thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently got a Kingston 16GB Class 4 microSD (from a reputable source - not ebay - and yes it is a genuine 16GB microSD) for my N8 and want to transfer my music to it, to free up space for photos and video on the phone itself.&nbsp; What I thought should be
 a simple process, thanks to Nokia, has turned out to be a non-trivial exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I naively copied my MUSIC folder to the microSD (F), and then deleted the MUSIC folder on the E drive, and refreshed the library.&nbsp; It went through the process of seemingly refreshing for ages, number of tracks clocking up, but then told me the music library
 was corrupt and showed nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After playing for a while, I decided to reverse the process, put my music back on E and deleted the MUSIC folder from the F drive.&nbsp; Refreshed library and I was back to square one (thankfully), and everything worked as before, but, of course, I still hadn't
 got my music across to the microSD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I searched these forums and found loads of people had had the same problem.&nbsp; It seems that, (as is often the case) the refresh of the library has bugs, and keeps old files somewhere on the device that should be deleted by the refresh process for it
 to work properly, but hang around causing problems (<em>thanks Nokia - your software guys strike again</em>)&nbsp; Despite trying to find these 'private' folders, they do not appear to be anywhere on any drive on my N8 (and, yes, I did have show hidden files set)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, simple question is, how can I successfully transfer my music to the microSD so that it just works?&nbsp; Do i have to delete all 1400 tracks and reload them onto the F drive, and if I do this, will it sort the library problem.&nbsp; Ideally I would appreciate
 a tried and tested method from someone who has actually DONE it, as I don't want to screw my N8.&nbsp; Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi mikwag,<br />
<br />
I recently did it this way, you can skip the early steps if the music is already on a PC. All my music is DRM free.<br />
<br />
1. Connect phone to PC in Ovi suite mode then using windows explorer (or the systems default file manager if using mac or linux) copy all of the music to the computer.<br />
<br />
2. Once copied delete the music from the phone (again using the computers file manager), disconnect it then refresh the library. It should now be empty. If it's not empty at this stage don't proceed.<br />
<br />
3. Either connect the phone with the memory card inserted to a PC or use the card in a reader and copy the music from the PC to the card.<br />
<br />
4. Disconnect then refresh the library and it should now be ok.<br />
<br />
If not try again from the start but use mass storage mode instead of ovi suite mode. Be sure to "safely remove hardware" when using the N8 in mass storage mode.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't help let me know and we'll try to troubleshoot it further. It may be a hidden file somewhere in the music folder causing the hassle.</p>

<p>hi there! just a little doubt here as no reports were made...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it better to sync music files with ovi music or via mass storage?</p>
<p>with my N95 i allways used ovi music to transfer music to the phone.</p>
<p>Now with N8 as i got two separate destinations i have trouble selecting the memory card as my main destination for music files. With Ovi music it allways selects the mass storage as default but i don't want that, i want to be able to transfer music via Ovi
 music directly to the memory card but i can't seem to find any option within the program to do that.</p>
<p>I find that is faster to transfer music with Ovi music.</p>
<p>Any help would be apreciated, thanx</p>

<p>Hi Psycho - sorry it took me longer to reply than I said - been too busy to try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did steps 1 &amp; 2 successfully, but don't have a capability to access the micro sd except via the phone. &nbsp;So I transferred the music to the microsd via the PC connect. &nbsp;It didn't work - endlessly 'searching for music and podcasts' - stopped this and got 'refreshing
 library' and finally killed this using 'open apps' and X. &nbsp;I think I need to get a reader and then try your process again. &nbsp;Really annoying that Ovi Suite doesn't just provide a 'Move music to microsd' option. &nbsp;I can't be the only person who has this requirement
 ..... Oh and I am Windows 7 and there is no 'Safely remove hardware' available for the N8. I click on the normal icon, but the N8 is not listed as one of the drives I can safely remove, just my usb hard drive. &nbsp;Nor can I do it by right-clicking on it.</p>
<p>I am still having problems downloading a CD I have bought from Ovi Store - already had the price credited to my account once, bought it again, but it still won't download. &nbsp;Nokia really need to get their act together.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;have exactly the same problem with my Nokia 5800.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have tried many ways to transfer music from the phone memory to my 8gb microSD card, and yet nothing works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now have no space on my phone memory and cannot store anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There must be some method to do this.</p>

<p>Can you not use file manager in the phone ? Hilight a folder, option, copy to folder. Copy files to F memory card, then delete original file !</p>

    <title>How to make Outlook suggested meeting times overlap with tentative - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to make Outlook suggested meeting times overlap with tentative attendees&#63;</h2>
                    When using the scheduling assistant, the suggested meeting times on the right side only show times for which all attendees are completely free (i.e. tentative commitments are not included and considered&nbsp; as busy).&nbsp; Is there a setting that can be applied
 such that I can also include time slots for which attendees are&nbsp; marked as tentative?&nbsp; This way I can see all options and choose the slot which has the least amount of tentative conflicts (or none if I prefer).

            <p>Hi.&nbsp; No that is not the problem.&nbsp; I'm trying to schedule a meeting.&nbsp; Outlook scheduling assistant shows me several suggested meeting times, based on my invitees.&nbsp; The scheduling times suggested are only for blocks of time where all invitees have no other
 meeting and are completely free.&nbsp; These are very limited suggestions in our organization because folks&nbsp;tend to have a number of tentative meetings already on their calendars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to have the suggested times also include times when my invitees already have tentatively accepted a meeting.&nbsp; This way, if there is a time for which let's say one or two invitees are tentative, but everyone else is free, then I can call them and determine
 their true availability.&nbsp; In order find times for which no invitee is "busy" but one or more are "tentative", I have to manually scan across the timeline.</p>

            <p>Its supposed to show free times first then other suggested times based on availability and list who has a conflict.&nbsp; If its not working well, try moving some people into optional - it should do better with fewer people as required.
