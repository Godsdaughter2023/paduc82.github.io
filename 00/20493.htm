<p>I think I may have resolved the issue already</p>
<p>I rolled back IE9 to Default setting and script error went away.</p>
<p>But I checked Internet Option settings in Advanced tab as you suggested an the Configuration</p>
<p>was already set to the setting you have instructed in your reply to me.</p>
<p>Hopefully the error has been resolved and will no longer be issue.</p>

            If you get it free, maybe. 
<br />
<br />But it is not likely worth paying for it right now.  Don't forget, Standard is also a step down from Pro in features. 
<br />
<br />Frankly, if you need to ask the question, I strongly believe it is not worth it to you because you do not appear to have an identified NEED for any of the relatively few new features in 2016.  
<br />
<br />This page lists the new features added to Visio 365/2016. They are not added to Office 2016 one-time payment license:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-s-new-in-Visio-2016-798f4f39-2833-486b-9ae9-55162672102e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-s...</a>
<br />
<br />but you should look in the Sept 2015 entry to identify new features that were added to 2013 to make 2016.
<br />
<br />Here are some more what's new articles. Thye all say much the same thing, but may emphasize different points:

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />When I said don't buy 2016 now that is because 2019 was announced to be released "some time second half 2018".  That is anytime between now and Xmass. My personal guess is it will be out around school start, Sept or Oct. 
<br />
<br />Sooo, 
<br />
<br />OFFICE 2019 FREE UPGRADE OFFER OPTION
<br />MS wants us to switch to 365 away from the 1-time payment licenses.  They made a number of changes to the license terms to make 365 a better deal for some people. But for others, one-time payment licenses are still better. 
<br />
<br />MS has announced that 2019 will be released "some time second half this year". Well we are there, now! The specific date is still unknown. In the past, when they finally got around to announcing the general availability release date they also had a “free upgrade offer” to keep money coming in during the last couple of months. In the past the offer was buy the current Office during the “qualifying period” and you will get a “free upgrade” to equivalent bundle of the new release of Office. Long ago there was an “upgrade” license that depended on and replaced the older version, but MS discontinued that "upgrade" type license in 2010. So if we are lucky the "free upgrade" will give you a standalone license for 2019.  That would give you both the 2016 and 2019 licenses continuing to work.
<br />
<br />Can you make due with the Online version of Outlook till that offer is made? If not you could get the monthly subscription to 365 until the offer is made. 
<br />
<br />You can also get a free 30 day evaluation of 2016 Pro from technet: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-office-365-proplus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/eval...</a> 
<br />
<br />that may be just enough time to get to the offer.

<br /> 
<br />    •	Eligibility: You must purchase, install, and activate your Office 2010 or Office for Mac 2011 product from October 19, 2012 to April 30, 2013.
<br />    •	Redemption Period: You must redeem the offer at Office.com/offer before May 31, 2013.
<br />
<br />IS THE 2010 TO 2013 “PRE-LAUNCH OFFER” AN “UPGRADE” LICENSE THAT REPLACES THE 2010 LICENSE, OR IS IT A “FREE, ADDITIONAL” FULL LICENSE
<br />
<br />I was given a full, standalone Office 2013 Home &amp; Student Product key when I redeemed the “free upgrade offer”.  I have no way of knowing if that will apply this time.

            Batteries are odd sometimes.<br />
<br />
Some features drain the battery quicker (<a href="http://e.g." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">e.g.</a> Bluetooth, 3G etc.) so if you're not using them, don't have them on...<br />
<br />
Other things you can do...<br />
<br />
Let the battery run down completely a few times before charging - this should be done at least once a month anyway really... in my opinion anyway lol<br />
<br />
Try a new battery.<br />
<br />
Take it to a <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,,77483,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Service Centre</a> and tell them about it, they'll test the battery and/or phone and see if they can sort it. It could be as easy as a Firmware update... Which firmware version are you on?

            The problem being i dont want to pay for a new battery because they are expensive especially if its not the problem the other battery ive tried is fine in the Nokia 6630.<br />
How would i check my Firmware version ?

            What network are you on?<br />
<br />
Did you get the phone from an operator or SIM free?<br />
<br />
Either way I'm pretty sure there's an update available, I'm sure someone will know here.<br />
<br />
You'd be best taking it to a Nokia Service Centre and they should be able to sort you out :)<br />
<br />
Oops, just read you got it from Nokia... So don't worry about the network bit... just the service centre.

            I'm not sure what Nokia's policy is on faulty batteries... I know Dell regard the batteries on their laptops as consumables after 1 year, so if there's a problem with it before then, it's covered, if it's after that, you have to pay for a new one...<br />
<br />
Does anyone know Nokia's 'Official Stance' on the subject?

            Only DELL provides. No Nokia or any other mobile co., provides. I think LG use to give a standby battery for costumers.

    <title>Imported images randomly disappear and reappear in Word 2013 document - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Imported images randomly disappear and reappear in Word 2013 document</h2>
                    <p>I'm working on an assembly guide that is somewhat heavy on imported images. I have taken the photos using an iPhone and imported them directly into the document. &nbsp;I have done some minor formatting of the images (crop, size). The images randomly disappear
 or show <em>only part of the photo</em>. If I click on where the photo should be, the photo's border shows up but the photo itself does not. I have read some of the other posts and tried numerous things like bringing the photo forward or backward, going into
 Word options and making adjustments to the advanced settings, but nothing seems to help. Like I said before, many times part of the photo is visible. If I zoom in and out a few times sometimes the image comes back but sometimes I have to completely quit the
 program and restart. Any suggestions? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've included examples of what I'm seeing below. The first screenshot shows the page as it should be, the second screen shot shows the partial images.</p>

            <p>272 MB is about 10 times larger than my largest file, but it is still workable. Well below the 2GB limit that requires 64 bit Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DPI is good, but if you are only showing them at 8% height and width, you have really HUGE images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on one, and SAVE picture to your disk. Then open it in your image viewer.&nbsp; I expect the picture will be MUCH larger than your screen size, you'll have to do a lot of scrolling to see the whole image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expect you could resize the images down to reduce the file size and make it open faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way to do this is probably this:</p>
<ul>
<li>make a copy of the file</li><li>add ".ZIP" to the end of the file name&nbsp; ie test.DOCX.ZIP</li><li>open the ZIP folder in Windows Explorer</li><li>navigate to the ... .DOCX.ZIP\Word\Media folder where the images are stored</li><li>use a third party tool to resize the images</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Office 2010 or earlier you can use Picture Manager&nbsp; to resize the images. If you have a later version, I can tell you how to get Picture Manager free.

            <p>There's a couple of other oddities. Look at the General Date and Short Date in the lines above the black bar.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>?Date(); CDbl(Date())</p>
<p>
</p><p>and copy and paste the result to a message here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I didn't see an answer to my question about the Windows Regional Date/Time settings. What is the setting for Short Date? Again - close Access; click the Start button; select Control Panel, then Clock, Region and Language, then Region and Language.
 What's in the Short Date line?</p>

<p>I will assist you with the issue you are facing with IMAP emails in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need information to assist you:</p>
<p>Do you get any error message when you try to receive emails in Outlook?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to change the incoming port number from 987 to 993 and use SSL from the drop down for the encrypted connection and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the result.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 630 phone issues</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Lumia 630 from last 2.5 years but I have been facing a very strange problem with it from the past 10 days or so:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I can't receive any SMS on my phone, checked with service provider everything is fine. I am able to send SMS but not receive any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Whenever I open the Messaging window I start getting all other notifications of my mailboxes that I have configured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I do not receive any notifications that I have set in the Notifications center ie. phone call notification, email notification or any other notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; The notification comes only when I open the Messaging window and these notifications inspite of clearing notifications do not get cleared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. When I am recording a video, towards the end the phone just hangs and cant save the file at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. The pictures in the photos section suddenly go missing or corrupt and then after few days again resurface. I fI go to the files section I can see the file but in the photos section I cant see that photo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the storage space on phone as well as SD card, both have enough of free space. I have tried soft shutdown, hard shutdown...everything but the problems do not seem to resolve.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also another strange thing thats happening is earlier my phone used to heat up a lot and I needed to recharge it at least 3 times in a day inspite of hardly using the phone. My phone used to shut down even if the battery showed remaining % as 35% to 38%.&nbsp;
 Off late from the past 10 days when the above is happening my phone has stopped heating (which is good) and I dont require to charge it frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help resolve the above issues if anyone has faced them earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>A frustrated Lumia 630 user.</p>

            <p>I would try running the Fix It utility in the following KB article to see if this helps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Before running this Fix It utility, make sure you have SP1 for Office 2010 installed and also make sure you close out of all of the Office programs.</p>

            This started happening just a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; No problem for last couple of years.&nbsp; The account server is Time Warner Cable which is really now Spectrum.&nbsp; The mail account is IMAP.&nbsp; One change could be switching from Time Warner Cable system to Spectrum.&nbsp;
 But if that was the case wouldn't a lot of others be having the same problem?&nbsp; That is the only change that I am aware of.

    <title>Onedrive for business serious problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leereynolds1023  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onedrive for business serious problem</h2>
                    
<p>So, I sit down at my computer to set up the onedrive for business sharing for my colleagues. We currently use Dropbox, and have recently undertaken a subscription to Office 365, and I assumed I could set up sharing files on everyones computers so we could
 all work from the same file structures.</p>
<p>After wasting an entire day, mainly because I was unable to digest the utter stupidity of the problem I was facing, I have drawn the following conclusions....</p>
<p>1. I can share a folder on my Onedrive for business which can be seen on my colleagues phone via his onedrive app. He cannot however see the file I shared on his desktop file explorer. &nbsp;This renders this feature useless to the way we work, as we need to
 be able to share the files in file explorer. NOT in an internet browser</p>
<p>2. I can share files using the Sharepoint group I set up for our users. This is fantastic, we can share files on file explorer. We cant however share the files using our phones.</p>
<p>We work in and out of the office. It is important we can do both. &nbsp;Dropbox managed to provide this service with minimal fuss and effort. I simply cannot believe you do not have an equivalent service available. We are now committed to a subscription service
 to Microsoft, and we are not prepared to spend more money running dropbox accounts alongside purely because your equivalent &nbsp;service does not even come close.</p>
<p>Either I am missing something and there is a simple fix to either easily browse sharepoint files on a mobile device, &nbsp;to share files within Onedrive for business where they at least show up in the sharee's directory on their file explorer or... we have made
 a grave mistake moving over to your product.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any help on this matter.</p>

<p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p>For your concerns, please allow me to explain them one by one:</p>
<p>1. If we shared a file with another member, this file is not feasible to be directly synced to our local computers. It will be displayed in the Shared with Me section of that member. Shared with me is a view returning all documents shared with you in others’
 OneDrive for Business libraries. So, if you want to sync those documents to your local computer, you need to access their OneDrive for Business libraries and sync them one by one.</p>
<p>I understand it might be inconvenient for you. So, I’d like to explain that OneDrive for Business is more like a personal library than a common share place. If you need somewhere you can contribute together, I suggest you use the SharePoint team site instead.
 Please see: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Should-I-save-my-documents-to-OneDrive-for-Business-or-a-team-site--d18d21a0-1f9f-4f6c-ac45-d52afa0a4a2e?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Should I save my documents to OneDrive for Business or a team site?</a></p>
<p>You can easily manage the common files in a team site and sync them to your local computer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, share files via Files Explorer is not available now. In this situation, could you provide your feedback via
<a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive/category/86090-onedrive-for-business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Uservoice</a>?&nbsp;Understanding your experience helps us to make our product and service better for you and others.</p>
<p>2. Generally, we can share files in OneDrive mobile. To clarify the situation, could you confirm the following?</p>
<p>1) For “we can share files on file explorer”, could you provide the detailed steps you used for our reference? Some screenshots would be appreciated.</p>
<p>2) Regarding “can’t however share the files using our phones”, is there any error messages? Could you provide some screenshots for us?</p>
<p>Note: To upload screenshots, please click <strong>Use rich Formatting</strong> in this thread and select the
<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> icon.</p>
<p>Please post back if you have any updates.</p>

<p>1. If I sync a new library to the onedrive for business app on the laptop to the URL of our sharepoint location in the cloud, I get access to the sharepoint location via file explorer and can collaborate with my colleagues as we would have done with dropbox.
 As I said, this works perfectly. The problem is there is no way to access these files on a mobile device without browsing to them with the browser set to desktop view. This is no good for us. As I said maybe I am missing something, but this seems to be the
 case. This is a massive shortfall for anyone moving to your product from Dropbox.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;As I said above, there are no error messages, There is just no sharepoint app, or anyway of linking our onedrive apps to the sharepoint location.</p>

<p>Hi Lee,</p>

<h2>            Section segregation apparently not working</h2>
                    I have a journal I am formatting in MS Word 7 and have created the various sections I wish to format.&nbsp; The first section I wish to print double-sided, so I set the margins to Mirror and "Apply to: This Section."&nbsp; The margins are mirrored throughout the
 document.&nbsp; I have broken the links to Previous Section in the header and Footer and set up my "Different Odd &amp; Even Pages" headers which also show throughout the document.&nbsp; Please advise why I cannot isolate my changes to the desired sections.&nbsp; Thank you.

            <p>"Mirror margins" and "Different odd and even" cannot be selected for a single section; they're all or nothing settings (unlinke "Different first page," which can be enabled for selected sections). Word's assumption is that, if you're doing to duplex the
 document, you're going to duplex all of it. There's no requirement that the mirrored margins be different, so you can certainly set them to the same on both sides, but if you are wanting a larger left margin on all pages, then that can't be done.</p>
<p>Since you're going to need two separate print runs, anyway, however, you can turn "Mirror margins" off after printing the duplex section.</p>

<p>One way would be to open the table (not the form) in design view and remove the 0 that Access all-too-helpfully puts in the Default Value field. Leaving it blank will cause new records to contain a NULL (no value, undefined, don't know what's there) value
 rather than a zero. You would then probably also need to run an Update query updating the fields from 0 to NULL.</p>
<p>If it's just a matter of display - e.g. you want to type 0 into a field, or do a calculation that gives a zero, and have that result shown as a blank, you can use the rather obscure "four value format". Set the Format property of the form textbox to</p>
<p>"Currency";"Currency";"";""</p>
<p>to display (in order) positive values using your computer's current regional setting for currency values; negative values the same; zeros as an empty string; and NULL as an empty string. Each of the four formats can be customized; for example you could use</p>
<p>"$#,##0.00";"($#,##0.00[Red])";"No Balance";"UNKNOWN"</p>
<p>if you wanted to get fancy.</p>

                    <p>In older versions of Office; vertical text was accessible from the Word Art section.&nbsp; Stacking text vertically with the characters properly oriented like these ones are. Some suggested that only certain fonts were able to do this and that none came with

<h2>            Missing OneNote notebook--Computer crashed and can&#39;t find folder with notebook</h2>
                    My computer will not start up, but is luckily still under warranty, so I have to send it in to be repaired. Tech support said that they would have to wipe my hard drive, though, so I took my hard drive out and accessed my files via a SATA cable with another
 computer. I copied all of the files, and am about ready to send it off. One problem: I cannot find my main OneNote notebook under My Documents &gt; OneNote Notebooks. The only notebook that appears in this folder is one that I have hardly used. This is a problem
 because I have a ton of info and things that I need in my personal notebook. How can I find it?

            Where was your notebook stored? Is it on Skydrive? If so, you don't have to back it up because you can re-download it from there. If it was local, then you would have to find where it is on the disk by searching or browsing. There are also backups taken
 by OneNote at the following default backup location: %localappdata%\Microsoft\OneNote\14.0\Backup, from which you can recover the notebooks.

<h3> jamiepattison  say:</h3>
<h2>            Predictive text issues</h2>
                    When i had a Nokia 820 few years ago (running 8.1), the predictive text was brilliant, I rarely had to type in the word manually.<br />
<br />
A year ago i upgraded to the Nokia 950 Windows 10 phone and predictive text seems to have gone backwards. I've had many updates applied since and i believe the latest update is also applied but there is no improvement.<br />
<br />
Everytime i swipe to write a word, its always the wrong word, so im having to go back and then either amend manually or pick the word within the list shown. Since i used this feature a lot on my prev phone i have lost the habit to tap each button to write a
 text/email, so its a little frustrating.<br />
<br />
Is there something i can do about this or have Microsoft changed this feature for some reason?

            Thanks for your reply. I know your trying to help but my original thread states<br />
<br />
"<em>Everytime i swipe to write a word, its always the wrong word, so im having to go back and then either amend manually or pick the word within the list shown. Since i used this feature a lot on my prev phone i have
<strong>lost the habit to</strong> <strong>tap each button to write a text/email</strong>, so its a little frustrating</em>."<br />
<br />
The first response i could not follow as i couldnt find those files. The second response turns off predictive text - which i dont want.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What i would like is for it to work like 8.1 in that it finds the correct word i.e. if i swipe "is" it enters "it's" i swipe "being" and it enters "bring". This seems to happen a lot with other words but these are just an example that even common words are
 showing up incorrectly.

            <p>I have the same problem. I have all the options turned on that I want, it just doesn't work very well anymore.</p>
<p>I was using a Lumia 920 with Windows Phone 8.1.</p>
<p>I am now using a Lumia 650 with Windows Phone 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously I hardly ever had to type a word. The predictive text guessed the next word without even typing a letter!</p>
<p>For example, if I type "See" the next word suggested would be "you", if I selected that, the next word would be "later".</p>
<p>Now if I type "See you" the next words do not include "later", even if I type "l" or "la", "later" is not coming up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I start a lot of messages with "Hi darling", but if I type "Hi" the next suggested words are "hun" or "mate", I never use those". If I add a "d" I get suggestions for "dad" or "dave", I never chat to a Dave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, it is just broken now for me, which is a great shame.</p>

    <title>Problem w&#47; Internet Explorer 11 tabs not closing in Task Manager - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem w&#47; Internet Explorer 11 tabs not closing in Task Manager</h2>
                    <p>I've been having a tab-closing problem with IE11 (Win 7).&nbsp; </p>
<p>With multiple tabs open, if I close one (or more) tab, the IE screen properly shows the tabs closing.&nbsp; In Task Manager, the multiple "iexplore.exe *32" processes remain the same however.&nbsp; I wouldn't care about the activity in Task Manager, except that IE
 eventually locks up, usually sooner than later, requiring me to shut down "iexplorer.exe" through Task Manager.&nbsp; This has been going on for at least a month and am unable to figure out why this started and how to fix it.</p>
<p>I've tried everything I could find on the Internet.&nbsp; I've turned off all add-ons and extensions, with no change. &nbsp;I've used MSConfig to start with no startup items and only Microsoft services running, as well as no Microsoft services running, with no change.&nbsp;
 I've used the Turn Windows Features On or Off function to turn off IE, reboot, and restart IE, with no change.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I use Microsoft Security Essentials with auto updates.&nbsp; I use IE with auto updates.&nbsp; I've run Malwarebytes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The only clue I've found, and I'm clearly not competent to proceed from here, is when I ran the System File Checker today following the directions from this page
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</a>.&nbsp; In the text files are a two sets of error messages:<br />

<p>
</p><p>That is often a sign of interference by another network process such as a software firewall or proxy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use Resource Monitor (resmon.exe) to check with its Network tab.&nbsp; E.g. if you see sessions with an end-point in your machine, instead of killing IE try
 killing whatever is holding on to them.</p>

            <p>Hi Robert, </p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response.</p>
<p>More system info:&nbsp; I use the built-in Windows Firewall.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a home PC&nbsp;cabled to a wireless router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resource Monitor was easy to get up. There's a Network tab to the right of the Overview tab as well as a Network&nbsp;section under the CPU section.&nbsp; When I click the Network tab I see "iexplore.exe" preceded by an unchecked box in Processes With Network Activity.&nbsp;
 I see that checking the box affects what's visible in the Network Activity section.&nbsp; When I open and close IE tabs I'm not recognizing any clue about which process might be interfering with the IE lockup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This is probably where I'm in over my head, as, per your example, I'm not sure what I'm looking for with regards to "sessions with an end-point".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,<br />
John</p>

<p>
</p><p>Does this happen with all sessions?&nbsp; If not, watch what happens with normal ones.&nbsp; The connections are quickly dropped.&nbsp; Usually after a few seconds you won't see anything there.&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, sort by Remote address.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you see any there which are 127.0.0.1&nbsp;
 that would be a clear sign that you were connected to a local proxy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then whatever was listening on that port would be your other target.&nbsp; Note that you can monitor all tasks at once by clicking the box for the Image column header.&nbsp; Then you can uncheck
 ones that you aren't interested in seeing listed.&nbsp; You could also then sort the Listening Ports by Port to see if there were any there with 80.&nbsp; Hmm... it may not be that easy.&nbsp; I just used Fiddler.exe to check for more ideas and saw that in fact the listening
 address is shown as IPv4 Loopback and the Port does not have to be 80.&nbsp; YMMV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            <p>Did it maybe also start after October, 2016 Windows Updates?</p>
<p>Several other persons reported this issue of tabs closing hangs IE.<br />

And "offcoarse" this "bug" is also inside November, 2016 Windows Updates, </p>

            <p>The only time a session closes quickly is when I close everything at once with the red x / upper right corner button.&nbsp; If I'm watching Task Manager and closing a single session it may take 60sec or longer.&nbsp; None of the addresses were the 127.0.0.1 you mentioned.&nbsp;
 I don't see any duplicate addresses shared between iexplore.exe and svchost.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noted the other response Meelinda (below) regarding the Win October updates.&nbsp; This might have been about the time my system started behaving this way.&nbsp; I haven't compared my PC with my laptop updates (also Win7/IE11), but my laptop doesn't have this IE
 freezing issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling the Oct updates.&nbsp; The ones I could remove didn't affect this IE issue.&nbsp; KB3188740 will not remove (no remove option appears), and KB2952664 automatically reinstalls, even though I have Automatic Update turned off at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm kinda brain dead from this about now.&nbsp; Tomorrow I'll probably bring in the laptop for some side-by-side comparisons for any additional clues.</p>

            <p>Hi Meelinda</p>
<p>Yesterday I rolled back IE11 to IE8 and then reinstalled IE11.&nbsp; I had expected the system to just recognize IE11 still lingering on the PC and turning it on, but it went through reloading from Microsoft.com, so maybe starting fresh will help.</p>
<p>I was originally going to restore Win7 to&nbsp;an earlier point, before&nbsp;IE went nuts, but it turned out that I had no earlier points to restore from, as all the KB uninstallations I did crowded out the older restoration points....sigh....</p>
<p>Anyway, I currently don't have KB3185330, it didn't reinstall.&nbsp; Before I uninstall KB3197868 I'm going to spend the day doing my normal work on the Internet and see if I still experience the IE lock-up problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I'll post an update.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>
