<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>USBOblivion&nbsp;is a portable freeware that is designed to erase all traces of USB-connected drives and CD-ROMs from the&nbsp;Windows registry.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you are sure that you want to clean the traces, remove or disconnect your USB Drives, check the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><em>Do real clean</em><span><span>&nbsp;</span>box and click on Clean. By default the save backup .reg file check-box is selected. This
 is good, as before removing the traces from the registry, they get backed up in the form of a .reg file, which is saved in the user’s Documents folder. Should you feel the need, you can always restore the deleted keys using this backup.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if you need further assistance.</span></p>

<p>If you don't want to trace any information from the Windows registry, you just need to uncheck the save back .reg file option when using USBOblivion. In that case, there will be no chances of restoring those keys once it is being erased by the application.

<p><br />
No definitive answer, but, system restore is usually the first line of attack when you face problems.<br />
<br />
If you remember a date when your Start button was present, use that date as your restore point and do a system restore.</p>

    <title>Games with Gold activation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calinvaradi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games with Gold activation</h2>
                    <p>Hello!<br /></p>

<p>I live in Romania, and I got an XB One. Registered to UK, because Romania is off the map and we don't exist as customers.&nbsp;<br /></p>

<p>I pay my Gold and EA Access services monthly, and even though I barely have any spare time to play, i do love collecting games, physical and digital.<br /></p>

<p>For us&nbsp;romanians&nbsp;there are some problems with game activations, mostly with the XBox360 games. Usually I could activate those by using a VPN and being seen as I'd actually be in the UK. Not lately though. Been trying for a good couple of days to activate Army of Two on my account, and boy did I run into problems.<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Via mobile XBox application, while trying to use "Play on Xbox One" thingy I get error code 0x00000005 CV ITP8J3JYskyF9mfc<br /></p>

<p>On XBox One I get "Sorry, your purchase cannot be completed at this time. Please try again."<br /></p>

<p>On XBox 360 I get the error code 80150017<br /></p>

<p>On PC, WITH VPN active I get returned to the same location when trying to click on buy and I think I'm not logged in properly either, as I can't see my user name, just "Sign in" after signing in.<br /></p>

<p>On PC, WITHOUT VPN I can log in properly, click on buy game, then I get "Sorry, this offer is not valid in your region."<br /></p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>So what can I do to be able to add the 360 games without feeling like a third-grade citizen? As my country isn't "supported", and I can't fake existing into an accepted country&nbsp;anymore.&nbsp;<br /></p>

<p>Will switching country block all future Gold games from my console or even my account with the purchased games? Do you plan on adding a Romanian version of the store? Sony has it and I love it!<br /></p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>Have a nice day!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey there, im not sure how to solve most of your issues and i live in the UK and most things are fine for me i've never had those problems, but i know trying to use a VPN or changing console/account region will not allow you to make purchases with a different region store so thats why your getting the purchase error&nbsp;"Sorry, your purchase cannot be completed at this time. Please try again." To solve that you would need to go to an external website and Buy xbox money cards the redeem codes then change region and you will then be able to make purchases in what ever country you are looking for. ( BUT WHEN BUYING REDEEM CODES FROM EXTERNAL WEBSITES MAKE SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT CURRENCY CARD YOU ARE LOOKING FOR)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The problem is not buying the games, but redeeming them when they're free as Games with Gold. I can buy the games with zero issues, bought quite a few with my romanian card while on my London-registered account&nbsp;:D&nbsp;Redeeming the XB360 ones is harder than performing brain surgery while drunk.</p>

    <title>UEFI Secure Boot in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            UEFI Secure Boot in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2"><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Just as you need a battery to start a car from which the fuel power takes over, similarly you need a firmware to start the computer and bring it to a minimal functional state from which the operating system takes over.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The firmware called <strong>BIOS</strong> is a first generation computer program in the processor's assembly language which is executed by the processor to directly control the hardware. This provides the foundation for building
 an advanced software platform by adding logical layers incorporating increasing functionality at each layer. The core layer is an abstraction of the hardware components&nbsp;into software&nbsp;objects which are further developed through the layers into
<strong>Hardware Drivers, </strong>and finally coupled to a well-defined User interface at the peripheral layer. Once this platform&nbsp;called
<strong>Operating System</strong> gets built, the complexity of the hardware and its I/O functions&nbsp;are controlled by simple software commands from the User interface. The Operating System internally translate these commands into a&nbsp;string of low level instructions
 for communicating with the processor which in effect&nbsp;directs the hardware devices to send or receive data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Windows 8 has re-engineered its boot method by adopting
<strong>UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)</strong> as the new firmware standard while continuing to support the legacy BIOS (Basic Input Output System) firmware standard for machines with old hardware which are not UEFI compatible. UEFI brings in
 newer features in the platform firmware alongwith a newer set of policies and specifications to comply with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c5b029f-0ad1-499f-a82a-f5e2ffeb98b9" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Platform&nbsp;Firmware</strong> provides the first set of instructions that run when the computer is switched on. After the&nbsp;platform firmware finishes detecting hardware and initializes the system, it passes control to the Bootloader
 program of&nbsp;the Operating System (OS). &nbsp;Platform Firmware is embedded in non-volatile storage like programmable read-only memory (PROM) or flash memory&nbsp;that's directly attached to a motherboard. Firmware also resides in hardware&nbsp;devices&nbsp;like video cards and
 storage controllers as a driver&nbsp;program contained in dedicated memory chips.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The BIOS firmware program in 16-bit assembly language are a sequence of&nbsp;hardware specific instructions directly executed by the&nbsp;processor from its 1MB addressable memory space in what is termed as
<strong>Real Mode</strong><strong>. </strong>The function of the BIOS&nbsp;is transient during the boot process, after which the processor's Real Mode 16-bit environment gets disintegrated and the OS establishes an advanced platform structure called
<strong>Protected Mode </strong>utilising the 32/64-bit capabilities of a modern processor to access the entire system memory. In protected mode, programs run on an OS rather than directly on the platform as in Real Mode.&nbsp;The OS interfaces with programs as
 a virtual platform and undertakes the task of centrally&nbsp;managing the allocation of memory and other hardware resources to programs, instead of each program having to manage the memory on its own as in Real mode. The OS in effect emulates as a high performance
 platform for programs, by efficiently managing the entire hardware through a set of high level device drivers. Protected Mode was phrased to imply that memory is protected from erroneous over-write as is possible in Real Mode, where each program is free to
 write to all memory locations irrespective of its use by another program.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">In&nbsp;the UEFI firmware, only the platform initialisation tasks are performed in Real Mode,&nbsp;after which the UEFI builds a rudimentary operating system on the platform to enable 64-bit Protected Mode for&nbsp;launching the subsequent boot
 / firmware program in a high level language.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">UEFI originally called EFI, was developed by Intel as a modern alternative to the PC BIOS. Now it's supported by an industry consortium. UEFI in essence, is a light-weight operating system, written primarily in C language, that
 the computer loads at boot time. Being an operating system, UEFI interfaces the computer hardware as a virtual platform for running firmware programs. The primary function of the UEFI is to boot an operating system, but it can also be used to run pre-OS&nbsp;utility
 programs such as networking, disk management, back-up/restore hard drives, edit boot configuration&nbsp;parameters and execute driver programs for hardware test diagnostics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify"><strong>BIOS FIRMWARE</strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">BIOS firmware was developed using assembly language for the earliest PCs in the 1970s. Although BIOS is still the most prevalent firmware type, it is limited to a 16-bit processor level program with low
 level instructions directly executed by the CPU;&nbsp;AND one megabyte (1 MB) of addressable memory space. A modern 32/64-bit processor has to emulate in 16-bit (Real Mode) in the BIOS platform as BIOS standards were developed for 16-bit platform.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">A BIOS is the very first program that is executed once the system is switched on. The function of the BIOS program is to control the hardware platform till it identifies and executes the Bootloader program.
 The BIOS program has three phases – Hardware Initialisation, attend to BIOS configuration change request (if any) by user, boot the Bootloader program from a Hard Drive Or boot into a maintenance environment from an Optical / USB drive.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">The BIOS program is stored in a ROM which can be changed only by a BIOS Flash Update utility. The BIOS stores its hardware initialisation parameters, boot data and system date-time in a CMOS chip&nbsp;which
 permits&nbsp;quick change to&nbsp;the BIOS configuration data. The CMOS chip is an ultra-low current static RAM (NVRAM)&nbsp;powered by a coin cell (CR2032).</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">The ROM acts as a storage device for firmware programs to reside in a passive state and gets activated when they are loaded (copied) into memory for execution by the processor. In the system initialisation
 state, when memory is not ready for use, the processor executes the first codes directly from the ROM and this ends with an instruction to copy the ROM codes into memory (RAM).&nbsp;The BIOS program in RAM, Data in NVRAM, and all embedded memory locations in devices
 containing its driver program as a BIOS subroutine, are consolidated by mapping them to a single memory-address-map to serve as an uniform logical memory structure for the entire system. The BIOS program use the logical memory address and the memory map serves
 translate the logical memory address into the physical address of a memory location within a Device ROM or RAM. Normally the processor executes instructions sequentially from the logical memory. A memory reference in an instruction is used to access a subroutine
 on a device ROM Or transfer program control to another location in the RAM.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">The BIOS program had gone through numerous revisions with almost every new version of PC until it evolved into the UEFI. The following table tries to depict the typical memory utilisation of BIOS as it
 reached towards&nbsp;its end-of-life phase.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8ed18f4-45b2-4610-9f92-75e5ebf0bb67" /></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">When a system is switched on, the system memory (RAM) is empty and therefore the processor doesn't really have anything to execute. The processor is thus hard coded with the first instruction (JMP FFFF0h),
 which is to Jump (JMP) to the memory location (FFFF0h) mapped to the BIOS ROM to begin execution of the BIOS program.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">The first routine within the BIOS ROM performs the Power-On-Self-Test (POST) and Hardware initialisation tasks. The system memory (RAM) is then initialised and loaded with the BIOS ROM program. This is
 followed by a second Jump instruction to shift the program execution to a location in the RAM. This process is called Shadowing and is done because execution from RAM is much faster than from a ROM resulting in reduced boot time.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">The second jump instruction takes the processor to a part of the BIOS program (now in RAM) which identifies those devices which must be available for user I/O and system R/W operations - keyboards, video
 adapters, SATA storage controllers and Optical Disc Drives. Devices are accessed either by the memory address bus or by a dedicated&nbsp;I/O bus consisting of device I/O ports. These devices has a self-contained driver program in a ROM (called OptionROM) directly
 attached to the device. The BIOS calls&nbsp;those OptionROM driver programs (subroutines) to invoke the device functions.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">At this stage, the processor checks for an user control signal (interrupt) sent via the keyboard which sets a flag indicating a request for change of the BIOS Configuration. If the interrupt flag is found
 positive, the BIOS executes the BIOS GUI program which allow an user to modify the BIOS configuration data from list-options, and save it into the CMOS RAM. The PC restarts to load the latest changes in the BIOS configuration.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">The final phase of the BIOS program is to identify the Boot device from a list of boot devices, defined in descending order of priority in the boot configuration. The BIOS searches for the master boot
 record (MBR) in the first sector of each boot device (Cylinder 0, Head 0, Sector 1), starting from the device at highest priority, and loads the first available MBR into memory location 0000:7C00h. MBR contains three pieces of information:&nbsp; the master partition
 table, the disk signature, and the master boot code. BIOS transfers program control to the memory location 0000:7C00h and the master boot code executes, which locates the active boot partition from data in the master partition table, and loads into memory
 the Bootloader program (NTLDR) of the OS. At the point, when the MBR boot code&nbsp;loads the NTLDR Bootloader, the BIOS relinquishes control and the OS assumes control of the computer system. The NTLDR Bootloader executes to chainload or bootstrap the OS loader
 (winload.exe), kernel, drivers and finally complete OS program.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify"><strong>BIOS Vs UEFI</strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">UEFI require hard discs in GPT partition structure, instead of the master boot record (MBR) partition structure that is used in BIOS. MBR is limited to addressing 2TB of Hard Disc Space and 4 primary partitions whereas GPT addressing
 space is practically unlimited and a GPT disc can have up to 128 partitions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>If Windows 8 is already installed using Legacy BIOS, it can't be converted to UEFI. A new OS installation will be required.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The BIOS is essentially a set of platform instructions (routine) in 16-bit assembly language of the processor, whereas UEFI is an Operating System that accomplishes the platform tasks through 64-bit programs in the C-language which
 is far more efficient than the BIOS routine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">While the startup program in both BIOS and UEFI must reside in a ROM/Flash storage, BIOS extensions are limited to device support through OptionROM, whereas UEFI extensions can be an application or device driver program which can
 reside on any type of storage - Hard Drive / Flash Drive / OptionROM or even a Network location.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The UEFI firmware is platform independent, and so device drivers are required to have standard commands to communicate with the device controller. The device controller electronics is responsible for translating these commands
 into input signals in the native format of the device. This makes it possible to test and develop standard drivers and applications irrespective of the implementation. This enables a driver to be universal type for a specific hardware, reduces the complexity
 of supporting new hardware, and helps computer manufacturers update and maintain firmware more rapidly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Boot Up Time = Hardware initialisation time + Kernel initialisation time + User session initialisation time.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The processor speed is the determining factor for the Hardware and Kernel initialisation time which is nearly the same for both BIOS and UEFI. Fast boot is actually due to partial hibernation of the User session when Fast start-up
 is enabled in Windows (8, 10) under Power Options in Control Panel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The BIOS starts the OS boot process at the first sector of a Hard Disc containing the MBR boot code. The MBR&nbsp;boot code&nbsp;and also the Bootloader program of the OS in the&nbsp;System partition are vulnerable to malware attacks during OS
 runtime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The UEFI eliminates the need of a MBR boot code&nbsp;by triggering the OS boot process directly from the EFI SYSTEM PARTITION (ESP) of a Hard Disc. The Bootloader in the ESP is fully concealed and isolated from access by programs running
 during OS runtime, thus securing&nbsp;the Bootloader&nbsp;against malware attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The UEFI Core firmware that comes on the motherboard ROM is open-source licensed, which allow Device and OS vendors to incorporate&nbsp;their own proprietary UEFI firmware as extension to the UEFI Core Firmware. This makes it possible
 to include at the firmware level, almost any other service that is possible by the main OS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Another new feature that comes in UEFI is the <strong>
Secure Boot </strong>process, which prevents malware from busting the firmware. Unlike an elaborate anti-malware application,&nbsp;Secure Boot&nbsp;is a simple safety measure&nbsp;designed for the UEFI firmware environment. Although functionally simple, it mandates some stringent&nbsp;compliance
 from all third party hardware devices and programs that must hook to the&nbsp;Platform Firmware. To remain flexible, Secure Boot is provided as an optional feature that can be enabled in UEFI and this is the topic of discussion in the next section.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Conclusion !</strong>&nbsp;In the days of 16-bit Windows 3.1 of the early 1990's, a PC used to boot to 16-bit Disk OS (DOS). DOS used the BIOS services for all I/O operations. Windows had to be started by typing the command
 "WINDOWS" at the DOS prompt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">That BIOS-DOS platform concept is revived&nbsp;in UEFI, with UEFI performing the dual role of BIOS as a boot agent and emulates DOS by providing a pre-OS command line interface called EFI Shell, for running firmware commands and scripts.
 Moreover it allows 64-bit Windows to be launched from 64-bit UEFI platform rather than 16-bit BIOS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">BIOS has 3 modes of operation – Boot Mode, Setup Mode and Update Mode. The Boot Mode is used to boot an OS; the Setup Mode is used to configure the boot and other firmware settings and the Update Mode is used to update the firmware
 version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">In addition to the 3 modes of operation, UEFI has a fourth User Mode. In the User Mode, the EFI shell is called by an user to run firmware commands and other utility programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The absence of firmware utility programs in BIOS, led to the emergence of many popular third party tools distributed as "bootable CD" like the BartPE and Acronis True Image. The primary objective of these bootable CDs was to provide
 a repair environment in case of a System breakdown. Starting Windows Vista, Microsoft provided their own Recovery and Repair firmware shell based on Windows PE (Preinstallation Environment) on a System Reserved Partition, which could also be used to create
 a bootable CD&nbsp;through Windows Control Panel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">In UEFI based systems, firmware utility programs comes pre-installed as part of system maintenance tools built upon UEFI as extension programs, located in the EFI System Partition of the Hard Disc.
<strong>In Windows 8&nbsp;UEFI systems, the Recovery Shell on Windows PE continues to remain as the default repair environment. However the EFI shell can be additionally used to install and&nbsp;run customised diagnostic and firmware programs.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">

</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify"><strong>UEFI SECURE BOOT</strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The UEFI has implemented a Security System during boot, called "Secure Boot" which essentially comes to securing the firmware components in the boot process with a digital signature that the platform validates&nbsp;with a trusted key.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">In most PCs today, the firmware environment is vulnerable to malware function during boot,&nbsp;when the original MBR bootloader&nbsp;has been&nbsp;replaced with a malicious loader called Bootkit. Bootkits own higher privileges than the OS since
 it has to load the OS, and thus gains the ability to manipulate the operating system and its security measures from controlling them. Bootkits gets installed through a vulnerability in the OS or in disguise through an apparently genuine software program. Once
 installed they are very difficult to detect, unless they engage in disruptive activities. They mostly work as spywares collecting user information.<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><br />
<strong>In Windows XP,</strong> the function of the BIOS is to transfer control of the platform firmware to the Bootloader&nbsp;of the&nbsp;OS by executing the Master Boot Record (MBR), which is a small program located in the first sector of the computer hard disc that
 tells the computer how the hard drive is partitioned, and how to load the operating system. The MBR is susceptible to boot sector viruses that can corrupt or remove the MBR, which can leave the hard drive unusable and prevent the computer from booting up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Windows 7 </strong>confines the Bootloader program files&nbsp;in the first partition of the of the Hard Disc called "System Reserved" - a 100 MB primary active partition automatically created by system at the time of Windows
 7 installation. The Bootloader files in this system partition&nbsp;are fully&nbsp;concealed and isolated, thus eliminating the chances of corruption by malware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Windows 8</strong> further extends the secure boot implementation of Windows 7, using trusted keys in Boot Manager to ensure that only properly signed and authenticated components are allowed to execute. In addition, firmware
 access is limited to user control without any programmatic interface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The Secure Boot process is owned by vendors who are certified by UEFI to digitally sign their
<strong>firmware files (images) </strong>which forms part of the firmware system. These trusted vendors share their trust key with the principal trust owner of the platform, generally represented by the OEM, who has to authenticate the digital signature on
 every&nbsp;image with its trust key, before allowing them to execute.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Windows 8 boot process is secured in three phases – Secure Boot, Trusted Boot and Early Launch Anti Malware (ELAM).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Secure Boot</strong> is localised in the UEFI firmware environment, from the ROM which being write protected acts as a safety device for the resident firmware to execute freely without authentication, to locations outside
 the ROM where the signature of all firmware images are authenticated before allowing them to activate. Secure Boot ends with the loading of a certified Bootloader of the OS into memory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Trusted Boot </strong>takes over from where Secure Boot leaves off, to manage the booting of Windows components using trusted certificates. The Bootloader loads a trusted Windows 8 OS loader, the OS loader loads a trusted
 Kernel, and the Kernel in turn loads authenticated Windows components as part of the OS boot process. At the point when Windows needs to load third party device drivers, Trusted Boot launches the Anti-Malware driver and hands over the task of malware identification
 to the Anti-Malware system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Windows 8 has prioritised the loading sequence of its Anti-Malware program so that it loads before any device drivers where rootkits are located.
<strong>This process is called Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM). </strong>Regardless of whether you are using Windows Defender or a different anti-malware product, Windows 8 has tweaked its load process so that security software runs first. By being launched
 first before any third-party driver, ELAM is able to detect malware in the boot process and prevent it from initializing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">UEFI is a community effort by many companies in the personal-computer industry to upgrade the pre-OS environment. The UEFI Forum is a collection of chipset, hardware, system, firmware, and operating system vendors. The forum is
 responsible for developing, managing and promoting UEFI specifications. Microsoft is a board member of this forum, and the forum is open to any individual or company to join free of cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Microsoft has further extended the UEFI security policy in Windows 8 certified systems built by OEMs,
</strong>to ship systems with secure boot enabled by default, which can only be switched On/Off by direct user access, and have no programmatic interface to prevent malware from disabling secure boot. Also Firmware update in ROM is allowed only through OEM's
 signature validation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The UEFI Secure Boot Keys are Trust Keys consisting of a key pair – private and public. The private key is secret to the owner of the keys, and the Public Key is distributed openly. These keys have 2 separate implementation as
 Public Key Encryption (PKE) and Digital Signature. The purpose of PKE is to render confidentiality to a message by encrypting it with the public key and then sending it to a recipient via an open channel, who can only decrypt the message using the secret private
 key. The purpose of a <strong>Digital Signature </strong>is to authenticate a software object by encrypting it with the owner's private key and enclosing the public key for ready decryption of the object, and openly distributed where confidentiality is not
 the requirement. In actual practice, the unencrypted object is accompanied by its digital signature which is decoded at the receiving end and compared with the unencrypted object for a veracity check. However encrypting an entire object produces an unduly
 large Digital Signature which&nbsp;is therefore reduced by a hash function.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">A hash is a complex algorithm which produces a unique ID from the binary of a software object. The purpose of the hash is to prove the integrity to a software object. A hash of an object's binary is further encrypted and used as
 a digital signature to accompany the original unencrypted object. The receiver receives the unencrypted object and the digital signature enclosed by&nbsp;its public key and the hash function. The receiver uses the public key to unencrypt the signature and retrieve
 the hash; it then uses the hash function to derive the hash of the received unencrypted object. These two hashes if found identical, confirms the identity and the integrity of the received object.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">In the UEFI platform, the secure boot process is owned by an entity which could either be a Platform Vendor or an OEM or even an Enterprise. This entity is the owner of a Trust Key pair that enables&nbsp;the&nbsp;root of trust on the platform
 and acts as the primal trust anchor from which the secure boot trust chain in built. The owner is responsible to digitally sign the firmware files (images) in the first stage boot process located in UEFI motherboard OptionROMs with its private key. The platform
 is supplied with the public key and the hash function, together called the Platform Key (PK) stored in the NVRAM. Platform security is enforced by PK which validates the digital signature of each image, before allowing them to execute. The PK thus provides
 the foundation from which the authenticated boot process is built.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The UEFI specification mandates two additional trust databases:<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; The Key Exchange Key (KEK) database</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Allowed Signature (db) database</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">KEK database is comprised of vendors who provide the second stage trust anchors in the secure boot chain. The KEK database contains the Digital Certificate,&nbsp;issued by UEFI Org. to vendors who are approved as a Certification Authority
 (CA) to sign their respective firmware images. These UEFI certified OS Vendors, Hardware Driver Vendors and UEFI application vendors are trusted to sign their own firmware images&nbsp;located in UEFI System Partition&nbsp;of Hard Drive,&nbsp;as part of the second stage Secure
 Boot process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Only PK is authorised to write the vendor's digital certificate&nbsp;into KEK, which acts as a reference for validating the vendor credential presented during the boot process. Vendors who are defined in the KEK are allowed to write
 to the Allowed Signature (db) database and Forbidden database (dbx). Like the platform security owner, these vendors maintain a pair of trust keys called Vendor's Production CA, of which the private key is used to sign its firmware&nbsp;images and the public key
 is provided&nbsp;in the Authorised Database (db) to authenticate the firmware&nbsp;images&nbsp;at run time. The Forbidden (dbx) database is also known as the Revoked Signature or Black List database. This database identifies the revoked keys of UEFI drivers/programs that
 are no longer trusted and may not be loaded.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">A trust chain is established where the root trust holder PK loads trusted vendors in KEK, and the KEK vendors loads trusted firmware images authenticated by the Allowed Signature (db) database. Thus PK in effect have a trust relationship
 with&nbsp;the images&nbsp;in db, and alongwith the images that is directly signed&nbsp;by it, PK reposes its trust on&nbsp;the entire set&nbsp;of firmware images that is part of the Secure Boot process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The Allowed Signature database contains the public keys of all images located outside the OptionROMs that are part of the UEFI Secure Boot&nbsp;or&nbsp;the Windows Trusted Boot process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">During Secure Boot, the Platform Key (PK) validates the signature of firmware images executing from Option-ROMs in the first stage, and subsequently uses the trust keys in db to validate the signature of device drivers and bootloaders
 which are to be loaded from UEFI System Partition in Hard Drive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">As per the UEFI Specification, the chain of trust terminates when the UEFI hands over control to an operating system. During Trusted Boot, Windows continues to use the db to validate the signature of its OS loader, Kernel and Device
 Drivers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Beginning Windows 8, Microsoft provides their own proprietary UEFI in Laptops manufactured under Windows 8 logo program. In assembled PCs,&nbsp;Windows UEFI can be installed from the Windows 8 installation media which has to
 be combined with Windows OS&nbsp;installation. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">There lies a catch however. In a PC with dual OS requirement, of which one is to be Windows 8 and another non-Windows, there can exist only a single UEFI as the platform firmware. If&nbsp;Windows UEFI&nbsp;assumes the role of&nbsp;platform firmware,
 the extent to which Windows UEFI will support the booting of other operating systems from within its own UEFI, is a policy&nbsp;matter that is ongoing evolution amongst OS vendors as part of the UEFI committee. One thing is clear though; PCs manufactured by OEMs
 under the Windows 8 logo program, will not permit dual OS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><br />
If Dual OS is a pre-requisite&nbsp;for a PC, then the safest choice as of now, is to install the operating systems in&nbsp;Legacy BIOS mode. With some time to invest, it can&nbsp;be a worthwhile effort to study and investigate the compatibility of the other operating system
 in&nbsp;Windows UEFI environment, at least after disabling Secure Boot.<br />

<p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">THE&nbsp; UEFI&nbsp; ELEMENTS</span></strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">UEFI firmware was introduced by Intel as an upgrade to the age-old BIOS which has to be customised for every other firmware type and maintained for its life time. Besides the BIOS was increasingly becoming the target of bootkits
 which remained generally undetectable by the Anti-malware system. The UEFI Firmware controls the computer before the OS loads and is a miniature OS itself. The UEFI Core Firmware comes embedded in the motherboard on a
<strong>Flash Storage - used as a Read-Only-Memory</strong><strong>,</strong> which is backward compatible as a BIOS firmware, the reason it is called
<strong>UEFI BIOS.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The UEFI BIOS </strong>has two basic functions -&nbsp;<strong>launch</strong><strong> the Bootloader</strong> to hand over platform control to the OS
<strong>AND </strong><strong>provide the Shell </strong>to manage the computer hardware. The Shell is the user environment which has a command line interface termed
<strong>EFI Shell</strong> and also a graphical user interface abbreviated as<strong> GUI</strong>.
<strong>The EFI Shell</strong> is used for executing platform commands, scripting, and running UEFI utility programs.
<strong>The GUI </strong>is used to achieve the fundamental task of UEFI firmware settings and these parameters&nbsp;are stored separately in a
<strong>CMOS NVRAM. </strong>To simplify the BIOS to UEFI transition, the UEFI BIOS has the same look and feel as that of a BIOS GUI.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Thus UEFI BIOS has&nbsp;4 modes of operation – Boot Mode, User Mode, Setup Mode and Update Mode.
</strong>The function of the Boot Mode is to boot the OS. In the User Mode, the EFI Shell is called&nbsp;by an user to run utility programs. The Setup Mode is used to configure the UEFI firmware parameters. The Update Mode is employed to update the version of UEFI
 BIOS from a USB stick while the platform is in firmware state. UEFI BIOS can also be updated from within the OS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The UEFI&nbsp;Flash&nbsp;is structured into distinct regions for its boot module, runtime module and data module for initialising the platform hardware.</strong> These modules are stored in 5 separate Volumes of&nbsp;the Flash namely
 – UEFI Boot, Management Engine, Platform Data, Gigabit Ethernet and Flash Descriptor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Each Firmware Volume can have multiple logical partitions for dividing the main module into smaller functional components. The UEFI Boot specification segments the Boot process into 6 phases with definitive guidelines for developing
 the firmware script for each phase. <strong>The UEFI Boot Manager controls the program flow across the 6 phases as described below.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c72cdbb-3ff2-4f28-b7c5-d65e37ef3928" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Security (SEC) phase: </strong>When the system starts up, the CPU Cache is flushed and the processor executes the platform reset and initialisation routine directly from the Flash. Since the processor is in Real Mode, it
 operates through an Assembly Language Program specific to the firmware. Here the Power State determines whether to apply a Hard boot (Power-up from Shutdown) or a Soft boot (Resume from Sleep). On a Hard boot, the CPU Cache is initialised with codes from the
 Flash to enable a memory model that permits Stack based C-code to be executed with only a few limitations. The processor switches from 16-bit Real Mode to 64-bit Protected Mode and prepares hand-off to the PEI phase. The Security terminology is actually a
 misnomer as there is no security verification of codes executing in this phase. It is assumed that malware cannot target the Flash as the Flash update can happen only through signature verification.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Pre-EFI Initialisation (PEI) phase: </strong>
The PEI tasks are performed through the Stack Program in the CPU cache. PEI determines the Hard/Soft boot carried-out by SEC. On a Hard Boot, the PEI initialises the RAM&nbsp;with the UEFI Program contained in the Flash ROM. RAM initialisation does not happen on
 a Soft boot as the OS environment is retained in the memory during Sleep State. PEI also loads certain modules to ensure that the platform has sufficient resources for the following DXE phase to operate the high level UEFI program in C-code.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Driver Execution Environment (DXE) phase: </strong>
This phase is designed to be platform independent, where the Device Drivers are loaded into memory and executed. Secure Boot is enforced as the UEFI opens interface with devices to load their driver programs from locations external to the BIOS ROM. Most of
 the UEFI system initialisation&nbsp;takes place&nbsp;in the DXE phase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Boot Device Selection (BDS) phase:</strong>&nbsp;BDS interprets the boot configuration data and decides on the Boot Policy to be employed. It further works with DXE to determine if the device drivers required signature verification.
 Accordingly the MBR boot code&nbsp;is loaded into memory for Legacy BIOS Boot Or the Bootloader program&nbsp;is loaded from the EFI partition for UEFI Boot. It also allows an user to enter Setup and choose the EFI Shell or an UEFI application as the Boot Device.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Transient System Load (TSL) phase: </strong>
<span>Depending on the Boot Device selected in the BDS phase, the firmware boots an OS loader or the EFI Shell or an UEFI application.</span></p>
<span>Depending on the Boot Device selected in the BDS phase, the firmware boots an OS loader or the EFI Shell or an UEFI application.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Run Time (RT) phase:</strong> Here the UEFI Program&nbsp;is cleared from memory and released to the OS. Run time service occupy a small amount of memory to be called by the OS as during UEFI BIOS update.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>-----</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The UEFI BIOS containing the EFI Shell is open-source licensed, which allow it to execute third party UEFI programs. Since an UEFI program is nothing but a UEFI firmware, it essentially means that the UEFI BIOS can support
 other UEFI firmware. This&nbsp;aids&nbsp;Device and OS vendors to provide their own proprietary UEFI firmware as extension to the UEFI BIOS.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">These UEFI&nbsp;BIOS extensions reside on an EFI Drive in FAT32 format of a Storage Device, which is sequestered&nbsp;to prevent contamination by malware. The EFI storage device&nbsp;can be connected either local or external or from a network
 location to the UEFI computer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The EFI Drive could be an <strong>EFI System Partition (ESP)</strong>&nbsp;in FAT32 format of a Hard Disc, Or an "EFI-compatible" Option ROM, Or a FAT32 Flash Drive. In Windows 8 PC, this partition is labelled as
<strong>System. </strong>Going forward, the abbreviation ESP will be often seen used to refer to the System Partition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The UEFI extensions on an EFI Drive can be an application or a device driver or a service that runs in the UEFI environment. Thus UEFI is a collective product of the Platform manufacturer, Device and OS vendors. In a Windows 8
 OEM PC, the OEM does the UEFI integration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Bootloader</strong> manages the UEFI Boot List composed of file path of all boot programs, and boots an OS loader from the ESP of a Hard Drive automatically at system start. The EFI Shell can alternatively be called
 by user to run an UEFI application or a Device driver&nbsp;and even boot an OS loader.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>To make&nbsp;an UEFI application bootable from a Removable&nbsp;drive</strong>, the drive
<strong>must</strong> be in FAT32 format and the application file <strong>must</strong> be as named BOOTx64.EFI (case insensitive). Further, this file
<strong>must </strong>be placed at the root of the drive in a specific directory structure as &lt;Drive letter&gt;\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">A classic example of this is the Windows 8.1 Recovery Tool which is created on a USB Flash drive (from a PC with UEFI BIOS) has the same generic filename and boot file path - is a UEFI bootable Recovery Environment based on Windows
 PE OS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The EFI Shell </strong>is&nbsp;provisioned by the Firmware Vendor&nbsp;<strong>(FV)</strong> like Intel /Gigabyte /MSI, Or
<strong>OEM</strong> like IBM /HP /Dell etc, Or an OS Vendor <strong>(OSV) </strong>
like Microsoft. It comes embedded in the UEFI ROM when provided by the FV. It is installed as an UEFI extension on the ESP of&nbsp;the Hard Drive by an OEM or OSV. All vendors except Microsoft&nbsp;incorporate the standard open-source version of the EFI Shell (SHELLX64.efi)
 developed by Intel Corporation into its UEFI firmware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>In Windows 8.1 PCs, </strong>Microsoft provides their own Command Prompt in the Firmware environment which has a command-set different from the&nbsp;Intel version; and the UEFI BIOS is also customised by Microsoft – the reason
 it is called a Windows UEFI.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Starting Windows 8, Microsoft provide their own Recovery Shell built upon
<strong>Windows PE (Preinstallation Environment)</strong> - a lightweight version of Windows OS, that can boot both from BIOS or UEFI. This
<strong>Recovery Environment (Windows RE) </strong>is installed on a separate Recovery Partition&nbsp;and has a graphical user interface with the Command Prompt, Repair Utility Programs and UEFI BIOS setup mode represented by icons on a dashboard. Once Windows RE
 boots in, it takes control of the platform replacing UEFI. The Windows RE file&nbsp;system&nbsp;(albeit hidden) can also be&nbsp;copied to a Pendrive as a bootable application, through Control Panel &gt; File History &gt; Recovery (at the very bottom) &gt; Create a Recovery Drive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Windows 8 thus provide 2 distinct firmware environment:</strong> Recovery Shell in Recovery Partition and UEFI in ESP. Unlike Recovery, UEFI is customisable by an user to develop, install and run&nbsp;UEFI applications for specialised
 use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>An OEM can also distribute systems </strong>
on the ESP of the Hard Drive, which would add additional functions to the UEFI firmware provided by the motherboard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>To develop an UEFI application,</strong> it requires knowledge of programming in C language, thorough understanding of the UEFI standard and UEFI specifications, acquaintance of UEFI Developer Tools, Libraries, Syntax,
 and a computer supporting the UEFI standard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Microsoft provides UEFI application signing services for Windows 8 UEFI platform free-of-charge, subject to compliance&nbsp;of certain Terms and Conditions which gets revised as policies evolve. UEFI signing is a service provided by

</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The UEFI BIOS can be configured to boot the system either in UEFI or in Legacy BIOS mode.</strong> The Legacy BIOS mode is effected by a
<strong>Compatibility Support Module (CSM)</strong> within UEFI firmware, which emulates the BIOS boot process by executing the boot code&nbsp;from MBR.
<strong>This type of UEFI came to be known as UEFI BIOS.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Evolution of Platform Firmware are classified as:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Class 0:</strong> Pure BIOS Firmware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Class 1:</strong> UEFI&nbsp;Firmware which emulates as BIOS only. No UEFI support is provided. This was used by Platform Manufacturers to transition to UEFI standard while essentially maintain a&nbsp;BIOS platform, as most OS of
 that time were not UEFI aware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Class 2:</strong> These Platforms support both UEFI and Legacy BIOS via CSM. Majority of platforms shipping today are Class 2 platforms.

<p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify"><strong>The User is responsible for defining the Boot Policy and Boot Configuration Data (BCD) in the Setup Mode.</strong> Both the Boot Policy Settings and the Boot Configuration Data are User chosen
 boot parameters, from List-options in the Boot Menu of the UEFI BIOS and stored in the NVRAM. The NVRAM is the common area for use by Firmware Vendors, OEMs, OS Vendors and even Users to store Firmware parameters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The User has to set&nbsp;the Boot Policy as UEFI Boot or Legacy BIOS Boot in the Setup Mode which is the last topic of this section.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>BCD comprises of the Boot List, Boot Order and Bootable Storage Types.
</strong>The UEFI Boot List consists of Boot programs&nbsp;such as OS loaders, Device drivers, UEFI applications and optionally the EFI Shell. Boot&nbsp;programs are identified by their file location called Boot File Path. Thus the UEFI Boot List is a list of Boot File
 Paths arranged by the Boot Order Priority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The UEFI 'Boot Programs' are&nbsp;still referred by the legacy&nbsp;term 'Boot Devices'</strong><strong>,</strong> as it inadvertently got&nbsp;inherited from the BIOS terminology, where firmware programs could only reside on devices
 in Option ROMs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">BCD also defines the allow/disallow boot permission to&nbsp;Removable Storage Types such as Optical Media, USB Flash, External Hard Drive and Network Drive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The UEFI Boot List in the NVRAM provides a two stage boot process.
</strong>The UEFI Boot Manager launches the bootloader from the boot list, and the bootloader then boots an OS loader from this boot list in NVRAM or from an OS list maintained separately by the bootloader in the ESP. This depends on the bootloader design of
 an OS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The Setup Mode allows an user to arrange the boot order of programs or create a boot file path in the NVRAM. Similarly the bootloader also allows an user to modify the boot order of OSes. The first OS installed on a computer provides
 the Bootloader, which then acts as a nodal application for booting all OS loaders including that of other vendors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>In a Windows 8.1 UEFI PC, </strong>windows installs it bootloader named
<strong>Windows Boot Manager (WBM)</strong> in the ESP of the Hard Drive having path ESP\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\Bootmgfw.efi and the
<strong>Windows OS loader </strong>in the OS partition C:\Windows\System32\winload.efi. During installation, Windows automatically creates the Boot File Path of WBM in the NVRAM and OS loader file path in the WBM's OS list. The UEFI Boot Manager launches the
 WBM and the WBM boots the OS loader with highest priority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Though the OS loader name winload.efi is common for all Windows edition (7, 8, 10-preview), nonetheless each loader have a distinct boot file path as each windows edition must be installed on separate partitions in a multi-Windows
 system. Microsoft allows other OS to be installed only when its OS loader is signed by Microsoft. This ensures that other systems does not interfere with the UEFI Policy established by Microsoft.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The WBM will display the&nbsp;Windows OS list for the user to choose an OS – only if there are multiple OS installed. Otherwise,&nbsp;WBM will automatically boot the default OS loader, failing which it will launch the Windows Recovery Environment&nbsp;from
 the Recovery Partition. <strong>Windows RE </strong><strong>contains all the necessary tools for Repair / Recovery / Restore / Change start-up settings.</strong> The properties&nbsp;of the Windows Boot Manager and OS loader(s) can be seen by executing the command
<em>bcdedit</em> in command prompt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The UEFI Boot Manager identifies the Bootloader in removable storages like DVD or USB Flash by the default boot file path &lt;Drive name&gt;\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI which is then automatically booted.&nbsp;The bootloader will launch the Shell
 which can either be a GUI dashboard or the command line EFI Shell. This default bootloader path is automatically appended to the UEFI Boot List when the removable storage type is allowed with boot permission in the BCD.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The default boot file path ESP\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI in the ESP of the Hard Drive is used by OSVs and OEMs for different purposes.</strong> Some OSV use it as the default Bootloader path without defining a boot path&nbsp;in NVRAM,
 some use it to boot the EFI Shell ( by re-naming the SHELLX64.EFI as BOOTX64.EFI ) and Microsoft use this as a Fallback Bootloader ( by holding a copy of bootmgfw.efi renamed to bootx64.efi ), in case the Windows Boot Manager path in the NVRAM is lost or damaged.
 Conflict can arise in a multi-OS system, if more than one OS tries to stake claim of this default boot file path.</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: justify"><strong>The UEFI provides an EFI Shell as a command line interface
</strong>for executing platform commands, scripting, running UEFI utility programs and also performs as a bootloader by being able to boot OS loaders.
<strong>In fact, the&nbsp;platform command set can perform all the platform functions except being able to disable the security policy of the platform.
</strong>In the embedded version, the EFI Shell must be added explicitly to the UEFI Boot List to enable it as a boot program. It can then be set as the first boot program in the boot list for launching by the UEFI Boot Manager, when it is necessary to manually
 choose an OS loader / UEFI&nbsp;application at system start. It can alternatively be set to boot last as a remedy option, in case of a system failure. Once in the boot list, the EFI Shell can also be manually booted at System Start from the shortcut Boot Menu (Boot
 List) activated by a BIOS specified keystroke, and then selecting the embedded /built-in /internal EFI Shell from the boot list.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>In Windows 8.1 UEFI PC, </strong><strong>the Command Prompt in Windows RE is used to run firmware commands, scripts and utility programs.
</strong>Once WinRE boots in, it takes control of the platform replacing UEFI. You can get into the Windows RE from within Windows 8.1 through Start &gt; PC settings &gt; Update and recovery &gt; Recovery &gt; to the right beneath Advanced Start-up, click Restart now.
 The PC restarts to launch the Windows RE from the Recovery Partition. Alternatively you can use the Recovery Pen Drive, created through the Control Panel Recovery applet, to boot into the Recovery Environment. From the initial recovery screen, navigate to
 Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Command Prompt. If Windows Boot Manager in the ESP fails to boot an OS loader, it will automatically launch the Windows RE from the Recovery Partition. The Command Prompt is capable of performing more advanced system maintenance
 and repair tasks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>It should be noted that the Command Prompt has two separate existence.
</strong>One runs in the Windows OS environment (C:\Windows\System32\CMD.EXE) and the other runs from Windows RE as a firmware shell&nbsp;as mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The CMD.EXE can run programs in the OS partition but cannot run programs in the ESP
 of the Hard Drive. The Windows RE Command Prompt is meant to run&nbsp;the firmware commands and scripts integrated to&nbsp;the Windows PE OS. Unlike the Intel EFI Shell, Windows RE is&nbsp;not an UEFI program and not in ESP,&nbsp;and therefore it cannot be set as a boot program
 in the UEFI Boot List of NVRAM. Instead the Recovery Pen Drive can be used to boot Windows RE&nbsp;at system start. This has the added advantage of being used as a boot device in case of a hard drive failure.</p>

</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The Boot Policy in UEFI BIOS is implemented by
</strong><strong>Enable/Disable switches for UEFI Boot, (CSM/Legacy/BIOS) Boot and Secure Boot in the UEFI BIOS boot menu settings,
</strong><strong>which must be set according to the Partition Table on the Hard Disc Drive.
</strong>The standard combinations are UEFI Boot on GPT partition and Legacy Boot on MBR partition. Secure Boot can optionally be coupled with UEFI Boot to allow only signed drivers to execute in the UEFI Firmware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">While Windows 7 has had support for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), the standard method for booting remained as legacy BIOS. This is because Microsoft did not endorse UEFI as a partner program or projected Windows
 7 as&nbsp;UEFI&nbsp;compatible, and most people were unaware of the existence of UEFI on platforms which emulated as Legacy BIOS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">This changes with Windows 8, with UEFI being the new standard for Platform Firmware and is mandated as part of Windows 8 certification requirement for OEM PCs manufactured under Windows 8 Logo program.&nbsp;Windows 8 continues to support
 Legacy BIOS for installation on PCs with MBR partition. MBR/GPT partition can be used when total disc space is less than 2TB. For space greater than 2TB, GPT partition is a must.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>In a Windows 8 UEFI computer, the UEFI BIOS can be user configured for the following possible Boot scenarios:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>(i) With UEFI Boot = enabled and Legacy Boot = enabled,</strong> the firmware will first attempt to boot through UEFI without secure boot, failing which it switches to Legacy BIOS boot. This configuration can be used for
 assembled&nbsp;computers with Dual OS of which one is UEFI compatible and the other is not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>(ii) With UEFI Boot = enabled and Secure Boot = enabled,
</strong>the firmware permits only Secure UEFI boot, by validating the signature of all software components executing within UEFI. Booting will get terminated if signature validation fails at any point. This configuration is intended for Windows 8 laptops where
 the hardware remains permanently sealed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>(iii)&nbsp;With UEFI Boot = disabled and (</strong><strong>CSM/Legacy/BIOS)</strong><strong> Boot = enabled,</strong> the computer will boot into a BIOS environment. Meant for computers using MBR partition, like older&nbsp;PCs upgrading
 to Windows 8.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>You can enable / disable Secure Boot with UEFI Boot. Legacy Boot will
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">automatically</span> get enabled, Either if UEFI Boot Or if Secure Boot is disabled. This is because Legacy Boot must become the default boot without UEFI Boot, and Legacy Boot must act as an alternative to the UEFI Boot
 without Secure Boot.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>The </strong><strong>choice for UEFI Boot&nbsp;OR Legacy Boot must be set prior to Windows 8 installation, depending on the MBR/GPT Hard Drive partition table to be used.
</strong>After installation they must&nbsp;not&nbsp;be changed. Changing them will not allow the system to boot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The EFI Shell / Command Prompt can also be used to configure the BCD and Boot Policy by running the platform boot configuration commands in User Mode.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">To ascertain the type of Platform Firmware on a Windows 8 computer, open Run ( WinKey+ R ), type "msinfo32" and click OK. This opens the

</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>UEFI BIOS boot settings is specific to an OS and must prelude to&nbsp;the OS installation. For UEFI Boot, it is essential that the Motherboard, Processor, HDD Partition Table and the OS conform to 64-bit operation.
</strong>UEFI Boot will not be possible, if any of these component is not 64-bit compliant. Further if a DVD media is used for OS installation, the DVD drive must also be 64-bit capable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The Motherboard is implicitly 64-bit if it has an UEFI BIOS ROM. Just need to ensure that a 64-bit processor is in place.</p>

 A 64-bit version is the one required for UEFI Boot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Finally the Hard Drive must have GPT partition, which is actually a standard developed for UEFI of being 64-bit. Since BIOS boot is possible only with 32-bit MBR partition table, GPT partition allows BIOS boot by reserving its
 first sector with MBR type data called&nbsp;Hybrid MBR. Hybrid MBR allows you to address 2TB Hard Disk space and additional space beyond 2TB will be in GPT partitions which cannot be used by a BIOS based system. The only situation that demands Hybrid MBR partition
 scheme, is when a machine must support dual boot for a UEFI system alongwith a legacy BIOS system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">During installation, Windows creates a GPT EFI System Partition (ESP) for UEFI Boot Or a MBR System&nbsp;Partition (SP) for Legacy BIOS Boot. ESP/SP contains the Windows Boot Manager (WBM) and other firmware programs which are concealed
 and isolated in both the partition types. WBM in ESP/SP loads the Windows OS loader winload.efi / winload.exe respectively from the OS Partition.</p>

</strong>While enabling Secure Boot, ensure to choose the command which loads Secure Boot database with the trust keys (PK, KEK, db, dbx) and the command which installs the Platform Key. If you do not find any of the above Boot switches in UEFI BIOS, then your
 motherboard isn't UEFI compatible. The exact procedure varies, as UEFI BIOS is specific to a motherboard make and hardware type. You must read the UEFI BIOS documentation carefully and follow the steps mentioned for UEFI configuration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Insert the Windows 8 installation disc and boot the PC. Press the appropriate key to enter the UEFI BIOS setup and verify that the Secure Boot Key Databases and the Platform Key are installed. Ensure that the Optical Drive is set
 as the first device in the Boot Order. Re-boot and press any key to boot from the DVD disc for the installation process to begin. To boot from a Flash Drive, &lt;USB Boot&gt; and &lt;Boot USB Devices First&gt; options should be enabled, in the boot menu of the UEFI BIOS

<strong>Partition 2: System (100MB FAT32)</strong> contains the Windows 8.1 UEFI extensions - applications, device drivers, Windows Boot Manager files and other&nbsp;programs that are intended to be run before the&nbsp;operating system is booted. This partition is also
 known as EFI System Partition or ESP. The contents of this partition are sequestered.<br />

</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Finally one word of caution !</strong>&nbsp; In an assembled Windows&nbsp;8 UEFI computer, it is highly probable&nbsp;that some of the hardware devices&nbsp;will not work, as their Driver/ OptionROM are not Windows 8 UEFI compliant and therefore
 not in the Allowed Signature database. This stringent signature policy demands Windows 8 PC to be manufactured in a standardised process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">As an example, installing Windows 8.1 from a DVD on an UEFI Platform with Secure Boot will not be possible if the storage controller (driver) embedded in the Optical Drive Firmware&nbsp;is not signed and authenticated by the Platform.
 Starting Windows 8, Microsoft has also withdrawn native support to DVD firmware and programs, thereby shifting the entire DVD framework on to the DVD manufacturer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">In such a situation,&nbsp;the only alternative to get the PC working,&nbsp;is&nbsp;to disable the Secure Boot in the UEFI BIOS.&nbsp;Disabling the Secure Boot followed by&nbsp;re-enabling it, regenerates the trust keys in the signature database. This offers
 a possibility to add the trust key of a newly connected hardware device.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>In fact, it is a better strategy to install Windows UEFI with Secure Boot disabled. It can subsequently be enabled after successful Windows UEFI installation, and&nbsp;ascertain the working of all Hardware Devices.</strong></p>

            Very helpful article, but I am looking for something quite practical. &nbsp;Where do I get the KEK and DB certificates for Win 8.1? &nbsp;I'm building my own PC using a Gigabyte board with UEFI and Win 8.1. &nbsp;I'm following the instructions from Intel that point to
 keys that don't exist on the MS site:

            <p>Hello John,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think the UEFI BIOS is that of Gigabyte and not of Microsoft. The Secure Boot option is a Win 8 proprietary&nbsp;security feature applicable only on Microsoft Windows UEFI OS.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows UEFI OS can&nbsp;only be installed at the time of Windows 8 installation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The other&nbsp;meaning of proprietary is "My way or the highway" when it comes to taking control of the Platform :)</p>
<p><br />

            So if you are using Windows 7 Home Premium how&nbsp;can you&nbsp;check what kind of boot sequence your computer has? I have an Acer Aspire model 5349-2592 that I use and I&nbsp;checked one day to see if Windows 8 and/or 8.1&nbsp;can be installed but I got a message saying
 my firmware isn't&nbsp;compatible for secure-boot. Everything else was&nbsp;compatible except my gadgets and firmware. Is there any way to make my firmware&nbsp;compatible or&nbsp;can I install without secure-boot? I got this laptop on December of 2011.

            <p>Hello Curtis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My reply to your queries:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The boot sequence is defined in the BIOS typically under Boot Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptops have customised hardware drivers implemented by the Laptop manufacturers for the specific firmware configuration. Upgrading to Windows 8.1 require drivers which are compatible. If Windows Upgrade assistant has determined that the laptop is upgradable
 to Windows 8.1, then it means that hardware drivers will be provisioned by Microsoft either through the Win 8 OS or from Internet. In any case it is also advisable to check with the Laptop manufacturer, if the specific model is recommended for upgrade. In
 such a case, driver support can also be availed from the OEM and it is a better option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, UEFI Secure Boot is recommended only for new Laptop Models. Older models may/may-not function with Secure Boot. From a upgradation point,&nbsp;Secure Boot is&nbsp;possible only if signed drivers are&nbsp;made&nbsp;available&nbsp;by the Windows 8 OS or the Laptop Manufacturer.
 However with&nbsp;un-signed drivers, it should be possible to install Windows 8/8.1 in Legacy BIOS without UEFI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop manufacturer does not recommend OS upgrade of your model, then the upgradation process has to be experimented with. For this you must create a "System Image" of your existing Windows 7 Home Premium OS, preferably on an external Hard Drive,&nbsp;and
 then try upgrading&nbsp;/&nbsp; clean&nbsp;install Windows 8 under BIOS/UEFI. If the upgradation effort fails, you have no&nbsp;choice but to restore the system image of your OEM.</p>
<p>

            <p>Superb explanation of UEFI and I truly appreciate all that you have done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please unravel for me the boot manager file for I am not able to see it where you say it is supposed to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last phrase of the fourth paragraph under Table of Firmware Possibilities near the end of your article:&nbsp; &nbsp;"( which contains the Windows firmware bootloader named Boot Manager located at \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\Bootmgfw.efi&nbsp;)."&nbsp; The file "Bootmgfw.efi" is
 not in the ISO I downloaded and the installation USB created from that ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This UEFI issue resurfaced for me when I was installing Windows 10 Preview on dual UEFI boot.&nbsp; That same file is not in the ISO for Windows 10.&nbsp; Perhaps it is contained in the "BCD?"&nbsp; Or maybe I just err in not seeking it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I see there is:&nbsp; Fonts (file), resources (file), BCD, cdboot.efi, cdboot_noprompt.efi, efisys.bin, efisys_noprompt.bin, and memtest.efi.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is that Bootmgfw.efi?&nbsp; It is the same in Windows 10 Preview as in 8.1.</p>

    <title>Xbox Music App Does Not Show Album Art - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geoffc1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Music App Does Not Show Album Art</h2>
                    <p>The Xbox Music App (build 2.2.177.0) is showing the Album Art for only about 1% of my music collection. The other 99% of the Albums are shown with the default blank Album cover. See
<a href="http://sdrv.ms/1ckGuar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdrv.ms/1ckGuar</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Music Collection is held on a WHS 2011 system (so it is properly indexed, and the index shared with the Xbox Music App). Each Album is held in a separate folder; all the tracks for an Album have the Album Art contained in an ID tag, and each folder also
 has the Album Art contained in a separate folder.jpg file.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I use the Xbox Music App to open an Album folder, then it will display the Album art contained in the individual files (see
<a href="http://sdrv.ms/17RLTyj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sdrv.ms/17RLTyj</a>&nbsp;), but it doesn't display Album Art in the main collection view.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows Media Player and Windows Media Center are both able to construct and display the Album Art from the tags and folder.jpg files, but the Xbox Music App seems&nbsp;unable to do so.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do not have the "retrieve metadata and Album Art from the internet" switched on, simply because the quality of the metadata from the Microsoft online service is abysmal, and full of errors. I learnt that lesson back in the days of Windows Media Player
 and Windows Media&nbsp;Center. Both WMP and WMC are&nbsp;able to construct and display the Album Art from the tags and folder.jpg files, but the Xbox Music App seems&nbsp;unable to do so.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there some way to force the Xbox Music App to read the Album Art from the tags or the folder.jpg files?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Update: I think that the Album Art image files are held in the folder:C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.ZuneMusic_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\ImageCache\20</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Interestingly, the majority (99%) of the files in there are of the form: &lt;long string&gt;_badrequest, with file size of 0 kB.
</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally resolved the problem!</p>
<p>It is not problem of WinRT after all, since it calls into shell32 for getting thumbnails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably I had two problems:</p>
<p>1. For some reason the music folders in Windows Explorer had "Display file icon on thumbnails" (under [View]-[Options]-[View]). But just removing this checkbox and cleaning the thumbnail cache with disk cleanup wizard did not resolve the problem.</p>
<p>2. I had dbPowerAmp R14 CD ripper installed. It had its own shell extensions. Recently the R15 was released and I had to uninstall the old version. It helped. After R15 was installed the problem was back. Shell integration code was breaking things for some
 scenarios. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try these steps:</p>
<p>1. Remove your folders from Windows Explorer "Music Library". [Desktop]-[Libraries]-[Music]-[Properties]-[Remove].</p>
2. In Xbox Music [Settings]-[Preferences]-[Collection]-[Choose where to look for music on this PC] remove all other folders. Allow for Xbox Music to notice that collection is empty.
<p>3. In Xbox Music [Settings]-[Preferences]-[Media Info] turn Off automatic image retrieval from internet. This will ensure that no artworks from wrongly matched albums would overwrite your hand-made collection which you trust more.<br />
4. Close Xbox Music by dragging window down. Make sure to slow down at the bottom of screen and wait while window flips. It shows that program was really closed, not just frozen at the background.</p>
<p>5. Run "Configure dbPoweramp". In [Music Converter] tab uncheck all checkboxes in [Windows Explorer Integration] section.
</p>
<p>6. Run "Disk Cleanup" program. Select your primary drive. Uncheck everything except "Thumbnails". Run it and it will invalidate all Windows Explorer thumbnail cache files.</p>
<p>7. In Windows Explorer add back your music folders back to the "Music Library". [Desktop]-[Libraries]-[Music]-[Properties]-[Add...]</p>
<p>8. Make sure that for all Music Library folder and all subfolders [View]-[Options]-[View]-[Display file icon on thumbnails] is NOT checked.</p>
<p>9. Make sure that in Windows Explorer you now see all artworks when you select large icons.</p>
<p>10. Run Xbox Music. </p>
<p>11. In Xbox Music [Settings]-[Preferences]-[Collection]-[Choose where to look for music on this PC] you may add additional folders except those that are in Music Library. I would suggest to add them to Library itself.</p>
<p>12. You should see that Xbox Music scans your collection in background and starts to display artworks</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case it may be some other 3rd part soft that installed custom shell extensions. Try uninstalling it or see if it allows opt-out from shell integration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<h3> jde1234  say:</h3>
<h2>            Realtek RTL8168&#47;8111 PCI-E NIC Ethernet Adapter Driver does not work in Windows 10</h2>
                    I'm so lucky I got to find this out today.&nbsp; Driver 8.18.621.2013 was installed on my 8.1 machine&nbsp;and failed to work after updating to 10. Used another computer (thank god I hadn't updated it!) to get the driver again from Dell and Realtek,&nbsp;installed both
 with no success. Bought a USB Ethernet dongle and&nbsp;during installation I noticed&nbsp;it installed the same Realtek driver!&nbsp; Of course it failed too and&nbsp;I sadly had to&nbsp;revert back to 8.1. I would consider buying another Ethernet card, but I don't trust Microsoft's
 Compatability engine because it claims the&nbsp;Realtek RTL8168/8111 PCI-E NIC Ethernet Adapter is compatible. Maybe that's true, but the driver ain't. Thanks Microsoft for the colossal waste of time.&nbsp;I thought you were making a comeback, but it's more like a last
 hurrah. Too bad.

            Yep, ditto that. The driver installs, seems to be running, but the Microsoft Hyper-V driver never attaches to it, so guess what - no network. It's kind of weird. But&nbsp;the problem seems to be on the HV driver side, because the RTL driver loads with no errors
 and all the I/Fs seem to be OK. Anyway, hope MSFT can fix this issue. Me too - going back to 8.1. Schade.

            <p>I was able to fix my missing Realtek network controller problem by sharing an internet connection from my smartphone and restarting windows 10, after a reboot windows update installed my missing Realtek network controller (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Realtek
 8111D chipset (10/100/1000 Mbit) on motherboard Gigabyte GA-EX58-UD4P</span>) as&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller" in device manager.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(to share an internet connection with your Android smartphone and its USB cable&nbsp;connected&nbsp;to your PC : parameters &gt; network &gt;&nbsp;share connection &gt; USB [labels may be different as i don't have
 Android in English])&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Regards.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: just to be clear i previously tried to install the Realtek driver available on their website ("Win8, Win8.1 and Server 2012 Auto Installation Program", 8.038, dated 2015/5/27) using their installer (failed, controller not found), but then also manually
 by right-clicking&gt;install the "rt630x64.inf" file in the driver unpacked folder "Install_Win8_8.1_8038_03232015/Win8/64", so either that or windows update during a reboot fixed the problem for me.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for that post. The "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller" was the key. I was able to do this a little simpler though. If you go into device manager, select the NIC that's causing the issue, go to properties, Update Driver,
 Browse Computer, Pick from list of drivers, then select the </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller. Click Next and voila, it's perfect. No internet connection required (except of course to read this post).

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Do you have mcafee security software installed? If yes, disable it and try to copy the contents to the cd.</p>
<p>Issue could be caused by any/all security software. Disable them on a temp basis and try.</p>
<p>Perhaps, doing a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a> to minimize the interference of non-MS software should help you to transfer files to CD.</p>
<p>Not to forget, you could try with a different cd. What is the cd itself has a problem????</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

            Hi DarkMono, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. 
<br /> 
<br />If you re-installed Windows and still have that error then it has to be hardware. Especially since the problem started after it was hit by a ball.
<br />
<br />ID41 with no Bug_Check - The main cause of this issue as you have described is hardware related :                 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2028504/windows-kernel-event-id-41-error-the-system-has-rebooted-without-clean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/202850...</a>  
<br />
<br />You can try removing ALL power then reseating the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug.
<br />
<br />Try swapping out any parts you can to see if that helps.
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem?
<br />How long has this been happening?
<br />Have you installed any new software or hardware drivers since you started experience this problem? If so, what are they and are they designed for Windows 10?
<br />Have you checked the manufacturers website or contact support find out about compatibility, updates or support for Windows 10?
<br />Do you have a system restore point created you could go back to? 
<br />Does the problem occur in other user accounts on the computer?
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703?
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from?
<br />

            OK.
<br />
<br />If you have an issue with freezing you could try restarting the computer in Safe Mode and gather the minidump files there.

    <title>How can I view the fax activity log for errors and successful sent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tigerwizard  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I view  the fax activity log for errors and successful sent faxes&#63; Need to print part of it too&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>I need to get the fax log from today to display</strong> so I can then figure out<strong>how to print the log that shows several attempts to send faxes that failed and that made it.</strong> I cannot get a fax dialog to open except to start a FAX.
 The log that came up when I did this as my workaround did not list any activity. There is a call log in here somewhere.</p>
<p>Using Windows 7 and the internal modem of my laptop to fax. It is not that faxes will not send but that I need to see the activity for one recipient's repeated failures to receive and what was reported for each attempt. It is critical that I produce this
 log data.</p>

<h3> mhaffy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 - Windows Could Not Search for new updates Code 8024800A</h2>
                    Running 64 bit Windows 7 Home Premium and all fine until recent batch of updates when mouse cursor statrted to jump and screen then froze. No luck with restore points so I had to resort to recovery using Acronis 12 full back up that i did at end of January
 2013. Acronis recovery successful and computer seemed fine. Updated/patched Norton and ran full scan. Updated and ran Spybot - no problems found. Updated and ran Malwarebytes, again no problems found.<br />
Adobe and Java 17 updates advised and I installed these and then thought that I should check for windows updates.<br />
Ran windows update several times only to get following with cross in red shield:<br />
Windows could not search for new updates<br />
An error occured while checking for new updates for your computer.<br />
Error(s) found:<br />
Code 8024800A Windows Update encountered an unknown error.<br />
<br />
I clicked on get help and ran that fix it file. Seemed to indicate that it had found errors and presumably fixed them - Green tick showed along with fixed and no other issues flagged in log.<br />
<br />
Tried to run updates again, as instructed, and exactly same message.<br />
<br />
Windows driving me mad as have spent most of day working to get to this stage!<br />
<br />
Solution would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance<br />

    <title>Windows 10 font problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bhargav1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 font problem</h2>
                    <p>I have lenovo G50(i5 5th gen, AMD 2GB-intel hd dual Graphics, LCDisplay)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fonts on my pc looks normal while browsing web, but as soon as I launch programs like notepad or office, they look like calculator fonts(where we can't see curvy fonts,pixels can be seen). Is anything wrong with my screen? And if yes, then why they
 look perfect while on browser? Even HD movies look crystal clear but I don't know what's wrong with office/notepad fonts. Any idea?</p>

    <title>Display driver failed to start, black screen and loud fan noise - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Display driver failed to start, black screen and loud fan noise</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have got a problem with the pc i built 5 months ago and i hope to get some insight about the root of the problem. Never had this problem before but it has occurred twice in the past two days.</p>
<p>Basically, I was gaming when the monitor would show no signal, there is a loud fan sound (GPU fan would be going full powered). I can still hear the game running in the background for a minute. Have to restart pc and the problem would be gone temporarily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event viewer, i see the warning "Display driver failed to start"-event 4115 and error "The description for Event ID 14 from source nvlddmkm cannot be found" event 14.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Havent changed anything about the pc and this started happening. I perform the Furmark3D stress test for 20 minutes and the temperature of graphic card was stable at the maximum of 67 degree C so i dont think its a graphic card failure due to intense gaming
 (had played the game many hours in the past and no problem)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build:</p>
<p>motherboard: asrock b250 pro4</p>
<p>graphic card:MSI armor gtx 1060 6GB</p>
<p>PSU Thermotek 650W (the recommendation for the build was around 480W)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It would be great if anyone has had a similar problem and got a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also can the display driver failed to start warning be caused by a hardware failure or is it independent of a faulty hardware?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love to read your replies.</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>
<p />

<p>June 9, 2018 have had the same issues for a month, used DDU from 3DGuru to remove display drivers installed newest driver, appeared to work for 1 hour then same issues came back, unexpected black screen, GPU fan full max, and a hard reboot to bring back

            I've literally given up gaming altogether because of this issue. I cannot even play for half an hour the games I used to play for hours on end without a glitch on Windows 7. Enter Windows 10 and its disastrous updates. Suddenly my "display driver failed
 to start", and then the same happens to my onboard video, and then comes MS Basic Display Driver and now I don't have a proper computer anymore. Windows 10 has destroyed my computer life. Maybe that is MS's plan. To make people stop using computers.

<p>Yep! I have had that too. Safe mode failed. And hundreds of "Automatic Repair has failed". Not to mention troubleshooter fails (why did I even click there?). Maybe MS is trying to set a record for most fails in the history of personal computing, as well
 as trying to end the era of personal computing altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what angers me the most are the unavoidable, unblockable, constant hacking attacks they call automatic updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that they insist on calling their product a service, even though it has every characteristic of a product, only to justify bypassing the user's decisions on what should be done with the computer that was bought with their own hard earned money.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or maybe Microsoft is planning on buying us all computers as a part of their "service", in order to make it more justifiable that they should mess around with it whenever they wish and against the user's will? Now THAT could work, MS.<br />

            Having the exact same issue with my comp. &nbsp;Built it back in March, ran fine fine until June when i got my first Driver failed to start error. Black screen, fan goes full throttle, have to do a hard reboot. &nbsp;I took it to my local PC rapair shop and they
 could not isolate the issue. They said its possible it may be caused by the monitors or even the video cables. Unfortunately this was not the case, i tested two monitors and cables and the error is still happening. &nbsp;My last option is to do a clean install
 of windows but i doubt that will work because i believe windows is the cause of this. &nbsp;If anyone discovers a fix PLEASE post it.&nbsp;

<p>this morning I accidentally bumped into my PC case, and this issue instantly started, so I got into the case and pressed the GPU card into the MB, I did not see any movement or anything to lead me to believe there was any component not secured or seated
 incorrectly, and that apparently solved the issue...</p>
<p>&nbsp; check to make sure the GPU is getting enough power and solid connections from the MB, check all cables are securely attached...</p>

            I also have the same problem, including the fan going full throttle.&nbsp; Also, when this happens, this computer cannot be accessed by other computers on the network.&nbsp; So this problem has NOTHING to do with the display driver.&nbsp; The message is simply what the
 computer software interprets the problem to be.&nbsp; The fact that the fan speed can no longer be controlled and the computer cannot be accessed over the network is evidence that the Windows program has ceased to operate.&nbsp; I don't know the answer, but I am expecting
 another call back tomorrow by a Microsoft tech.&nbsp; This person will be the third level of escalation.&nbsp; I'll report back if the problem gets solved.

<p>i have read that the problem might have been improper connections on the cpu board and the gpu not getting enough power when running games. You guys might want to give those connections a wiggle.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me personally the problem went away by itself without me doing anything and haven't had the problem since i posted this thread. good luck with your PCs.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for your suggestions, IP.&nbsp; In my case, the problem occurred shortly after installing v1803.&nbsp; I have an 850W power supply and the problem will occur even when the computer is idle.

    <title>Two skype accounts associated with the same e-mail how to access each - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgesbolssens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two skype accounts associated with the same e-mail how to access each one separately&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received an e-mail that I have skype credit that's about to expire. I wanted to log into my account, but I have 2 accounts associated with one e-mail address. One is denoted by a Skype handle/username I've had for years, the other one is denoted by my
 e-mail address; this is a skype account that I've created a few weeks ago, based on that e-mail address. This was done because I couldn't remember my password for the first one and urgently needed to call someone on skype. At the time (in a panic situation,
 I admit) it seemed easier to quickly create a new account than to go through a password reset request procedure. I thought getting into the first one again would be trivial, but it's not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I want to log in to my original skype account, I get a password reset procedure for the new one because my e-mail address is the microsoft account for that new one. Hence, I have lost access to my original skype account where all my contacts reside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone could point me in the right direction or if somebody from microsoft could just delete the second account so I can get into the first one : that would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>GB</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;GeorgesBolssens,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>In order for you to log in to your original account which is denoted by Skype username, you will be needing to do a password reset. I'm afraid there is no other option for you to gain access to that account.
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>To reset your password, simply follow the steps below:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Access this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Problems signing in?</a><br />
2. Enter your <strong>Skype name</strong> and click <strong>Continue</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- <strong>If you are logged in automatically</strong>, please log out and access the link again. It is possible that you are automatically logged in to Skype using your email address, that is why instead of changing the password for your original account
 you were asked to change the password for your second account.</p>
<p>- <strong>If it's possible for you to use a different or private browser</strong>, that is much better. This will ensure you are not automatically signed in to Skype and be able to reset the password for the correct account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You will be routed to <strong>Recover details page</strong>, under the<strong> Sign in
</strong>button click <strong>Reset password</strong>.<br />
4. Then choose <strong>I forgot password </strong>and click <strong>Next</strong>.<br />
5. On the&nbsp;<strong>Recover your account </strong>page, type in your <strong>Skype name
</strong>if it was not automatically populated, then type the <strong>Captcha</strong> and click
<strong>Next</strong>.<br />
6. You will be then routed to&nbsp;<strong>We need to verify your identity </strong>page and will ask which security method would you like to use to retrieve the recovery code.<br />

<h2>            Winning fireworks in Solitaire</h2>
                    
<p>Anyone else find the opening BANG of the sounds you get for completing the daily puzzles a little disconcerting?&nbsp; Solitaire and Mahjong are essentially quiet games and being made to jump out of your skin when you complete the task isn't much fun.&nbsp; Love the
 fireworks but would definitely prefer the winning sounds to start more gently - please -&nbsp; before someone has a heart attack from fright.</p>

<h2>            Undo&#47;Un-sync Administrator Account tied to a Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So long story short is I was logged into a local account. I've seen other posts about using the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 153, 0, 1)">built</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;in
 admin account but nothing that said anything about not the built in administrator's account but an account that was local and in the administrators group.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So anyway I logged into the store as one of my children. When doing so I accidentally choose to login instead of "just to the app" and now my child's account has some sort of weird merge with mine.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I still login locally with my local password however it's enforcing their account restrictions now on mine but I'm still listed as an administrator but unable to do anything.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I don't have the option to create a local account as it's not there it just says "manage my ms account". I did create a local account so I could login to the web and unrestrict my child's account so I could
 browse the web and what not but I have ton's of stuff tied to my profile and wonder if there is any way to "unscrew" this massive screw up.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Any help or advice would be appreciated. I'm on Windows 10, latest updates to 12/27/17.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Removing the device from online and remove any app logins hasn't helped. I'm at a loss. The next step was to close their account and hope that would untie it somehow but MS says they don't really remove
 accounts for 60 days and still not sure that would help...</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that there are changes made on your administrator account after logging in to the Microsoft Store as one of your children. For us to resolve the issue, we suggest that you switch the administrator account to local account and switch it to your own
 Microsoft account. To change account types on your computer, follow these steps:</p>
<p>

<li>In <strong>Cortana </strong>search, type <strong>control panel</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the list.</li><li>Under <strong>User Accounts</strong>, click <strong>Change account type</strong>.</li><li>Select your user account and then click <strong>Change the account type</strong>.</li></ol>

<p>The account is already an administrators account.&nbsp; The issue is now that where normally you would see the option to change to a local account instead of a MSA is missing.&nbsp; The only option there is now&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">manage
 my ms account.&nbsp; The account is set as a local administrator account but somehow it's also tied to my Child's MSA.&nbsp; The login is still using the local account name and password but now when I look at the account it has the MSA email of my child.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have tried using the built-in admin to fix the issue but can't.&nbsp; I can't delete the account and create a new one because there is way to much information under that profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Here are a few pics showing what the issue now is.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for your quick response. Since we can't change the account type of the user account, the next option that we can do is to create a new local user account and transfer the data of your current user account to the new one, then delete the affected
 user account. For your reference, check this article on how to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a local user or administrator

<p>I don't know if you tried System restore the old way through control panel.</p>
<p>But this is what I found is in config restore with Win10 it's turned off. Why don't know. There are some restore points saved somewhere in the system. So you could try.</p>
<p>Another way is to use a large Thumb or Jump drive save your children files etc.. and remove all there info remove there accounts and repair your admin account.</p>
<p>Or fine someone that know computer language that can go into admin CMD prompt and remove that password that now embedded into windows. I myself have not got that far yet. If I find away I'll message you back. Good Luck</p>

            <p>This update was repeatedly failing on my PC too, as was a previous cumulative update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to fix the problem on both occasions by performing a "standalone update" by manually downloading the update file (.msi) from the
<a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Update Catalog">
Windows Update Catalog</a>&nbsp;site, and executing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates went through a more visible process, completed successfully, and recognized properly after a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think there are problems with automatic download and update of large patches, probably in the download phase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
