<h2>            How do I let someone take control of my computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The person from McAfee said the problem could only be fixed with a software update, so they have to know I want the additional feature and agree to add it. Nevertheless, the person wanted to take control of my computer to see what could be done to fix any
 problems that could be fixed. It couldn't be done. I had clicked three different times when asked to let this person take control of my computer. Each time it was a different pop-up, so there was plenty of protection, but I did want this to take place. And
 the person could not do anything, and asked me to do what was needed. I had no idea what to do. The person asked me to get help and I didn't know who could help. The person finally had to give up. If there is something a person can fix, I would like to know
 what. I did get one error message saying a certain file didn't exist. I had downloaded a LogMeIn app and apparently there was supposed to be a file containing the word "LogMeIn". &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Display properties of desktop link</h2>
                    I have an icon on my desktop that is a hyperlink to Google News. When I double-click it, it opens as a small window on the desktop that I then have to maximize. I would like to have it open as a maximized window. Unlike application icons, hyperlink icons
 don't seem to have a property that allows one to set the display size. Is there another way around this, such as with a registry hack or something?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            There may be a better way to do this but one workaround could be:<br />
<br />
- Create a New Shortcut to Internet Explorer (go into the Start Menu, right-click IE icon, choose copy, then Paste Shortcut onto your desktop).<br />
<br />
- This gives you an application icon with the Maximize option on it.<br />
<br />
- You may want to rename the Shortcut to something like "Google News"<br />
<br />
- Inside the "Target" field that is already provided in the shortcut you will see something like this in there:<br />
<br />
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"<br />
<br />
- After the last quotation mark, you can add a space and then pass IE a parameter of the Web site you would like to open such as:<br />
<br />
<br />
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" <a href="http://news.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://news.google.com/</a><br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe" http://www.microsoft.com/<br />
<br />
This gives you an application icon with the Maximized option and forces your browser to open to the page you specify.

<h2>            Audio problems&#58; Acer aspire 5755G 9669.</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I have an Acer Aspire 5755G 9669, and when I am to plug in speakers or Headphones, earbuds.etc The sound that is emitted is the left side, to the device i'm using.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>I've gone into Control panel&gt; Hardware and sound&gt; Manage audio Devices and Right-clicked the default speaker device, and clicked test.</div>
<div>All that happens is that the left side test works, but the right side is silent. (both speakers play, but the left side plays to both speakers. Like say someone talked to you in one ear, and you heard it equally in both.)</div>
<div>I've tried downloading Virtual audio devices to try to fix it, but nothing seems to work. it is not the headphones that i'm using, because when I unplug the device and use the default speakers on the laptop, it works perfectly, both speakers play left-right
 audio.</div>
<div>Everything sounds normal with the sound with headphones, but any sound that is supposed to play on the right speaker is muffled, and deceases the quality when playing games, listening to music, and most definitely watching movies.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did download an upgrade from Realtek, to upgrade my audio driver ( unwittingly ) and it changed it to a Microsoft brand audio driver?</div>
<div>I wanted to fix this because I also get two types of BSOD's, that occur PERFECTLY once every month. One of them is MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.</div>
<div>I can't remember the other one.&nbsp;</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d7bfb56c-5aa7-4ee3-8eca-9d6f969982d3" />&nbsp;I've done everything, that goes from Windows Help &amp; Support to other answer sites. HDMI, and bluetooth audio
 works flawlessly.</div>

            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hi Kyle,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue. Please answer these questions for a better understanding:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the system architecture of your laptop? Is it 32 bit or 64 bit?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does it happen only with the speakers/earphones that are connected to the 3.5 mm audio jack?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the current version of the Realtek Audio Driver installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This could be due to the audio drivers or some hardware issues with the audio jack or the sound card. I would suggest you to try the following troubleshooting method and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Method 1: Run the Playing Audio Troubleshooter</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the instructions given in this article to run the
<b><i>Playing Audio Troubleshooter</i></b> and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/open-the-playing-audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><i>Open the Playing Audio troubleshooter</i></b></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check the troubleshooting report and let’s know the details. You may also try the suggestions given by the troubleshooter and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Method 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the Audio Drivers from the Acer website</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow these steps to uninstall the audio drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press “Windows Logo” + “R” keys on the keyboard and type “<b><i>devmgmt.msc</i></b>” in the “<b><i>Run</i></b>” command box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double-click on “<b><i>Sound, video and game controllers</i></b>” to expand that category.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click on the sound card and select the option “<b><i>Uninstall</i></b>”.
</span><span>On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<b><i>Delete the driver software for this device</i></b>” you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the restart, you may </span>
<span>you may again open the <b><i>Device Manager</i></b> and then click on the “<b><i>Scan for hardware changes</i></b>” button at the top of the
<b><i>Device Manager</i></b> window and check if the operating system detects the sound card device and installs an appropriate driver for it automatically. If the drivers are installed automatically, then check if that resolves the issue.
 If the issue persists, then you may update the sound card drivers and check if that helps. Please refer to this article:</span></p>

            My computer is a X64 bit<br />
I downloaded a realtek audio driver from their website, and it changed my driver to a Microsoft brand driver.<br />
HDMI, Bluetooth and any wireless headphones/earbuds that don't connect to the audio jack, work perfectly, it is only the audio jack.<br />
<br />
The driver says the following: Driver Provider: Microsoft<br />
Driver date: 19/11/2010<br />
Driver Version: 6.1.7601.17514<br />
Digital Signer: Microsoft Windows.<br />
<br />
I already did the audio troubleshooter, all it says is "Your audio is quiet. problem = volume too low"<br />
<br />
I'll do as you said.<br />
<br />
I'll get back to this with the results.<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch.<br />

            Well... I did all of the above, and yet all it did was change my audio driver to realtek, decreased the audio quality slightly, and then once I tried uninstalling and rebooting, it changed the setting configuration and gave me just a few more settings..
 Audio is still acting weird....<br />
<br />
No idea what to do now.

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, the Shared experiences feature is turned on in Windows 10, and your device is set to share or receive from your own devices only, but you can disable it or change the settings. If you're not using the feature you can also disable or change the
 Shared experiences settings by going to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Systems
</strong>&gt; <strong>Shared experiences</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, to better assist in resolving your concern, kindly provide answers to the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any changes made or updates installed prior to the issue occurring?</li><li>What was the exact error message that you encountered?</li><li>Which version and build of Windows 10 is installed on your device?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>

<h2>            Blocked Website ONE SITE ONLY</h2>
                    How do you unblock one website with Windows 10?&nbsp; FYI WIndows 10 is the solution here NOT Internet Explorer!!!!&nbsp; A friend couldn't access AOL.&nbsp; I watched while a tech support person solved the problem, but too fast for me to take notes.&nbsp; The site will not
 open with Microsoft Edge!!!&nbsp; He went into some Hosts file.&nbsp; He flushed the DNS. He did check Internet Explorer first but stated that IE was NOT the problem.&nbsp; Windows 10 blocks sites in Windows\System32\drivers.&nbsp; He also went into the registry, which I am not
 sure I want to do that.

            If it's only an issue on an insider build and has been a problem for 4 separate builds, I think you'd get a much faster solution by reinstalling the build fresh.&nbsp; Takes 15 or 20 minutes tops, certainly not the hours/weeks/months you've suffered this long

<p><span>So I started to do the fresh install, but the message that came up was that I would revert to the previous version of windows (I assume the regular NOT the Insider Build) and that it would keep my settings.&nbsp; If it keeps my settings, how am
 I going to avoid the problem I have? I have been trying to solve this problem for 3 months.&nbsp; I refuse to give up. BUT is there anyone anywhere at Microsoft who cares? I have participated in beta versions as far back as Vista.&nbsp; I think I make a humble and minor
 contribution, but every little bit helps and I get great satisfaction in trying to help.&nbsp; It is just not fair that I cannot get help with a problem that a Windows 10 knowledgeable tech person could solve in just a few minutes.&nbsp; Meanwhile no one has responded
 to the last two posts.</span></p>

<p>If you are getting the option of whether to keep your settings, then you aren't actually doing a fresh install.</p>
<p>If it was a fresh install, nothing would be maintained and the computer would be just like it was when you took it out of the box the day you first got it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend installing using a DVD disc or USB "thumb drive" stick, using this tool: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then you can be sure you will have a pristine perfectly-functional machine with no beta/insider code on it, and without hassle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing will take you about 15 minutes, and it normally takes a typical user about another 20 minutes to download their favorite browser, Office package, and a few other programs they need "every day".&nbsp; The rare/occasionally-used things you can install
 when you happen to need them, or you can spend more time doing it all the same day.&nbsp; But no matter what, you're never more than a hour or two from a perfectly-fresh install.</p>

<p>If you are getting the option of whether to keep your settings, then you aren't actually doing a fresh install.</p>
<p>If it was a fresh install, nothing would be maintained and the computer would be just like it was when you took it out of the box the day you first got it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend installing using a DVD disc or USB "thumb drive" stick, using this tool: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then you can be sure you will have a pristine perfectly-functional machine with no beta/insider code on it, and without hassle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing will take you about 15 minutes, and it normally takes a typical user about another 20 minutes to download their favorite browser, Office package, and a few other programs they need "every day".&nbsp; The rare/occasionally-used things you can install
 when you happen to need them, or you can spend more time doing it all the same day.&nbsp; But no matter what, you're never more than a hour or two from a perfectly-fresh install.</p>

<p>First, I want to show you what options Windows 10 offers, which I was going to do in spite of the fact that I believe there is an easier solution, having solved the same problem with the help of Windows support on a friends computer that was the retail version
 of Windows 10.&nbsp; Second, your suggestion sounds good, but going to your URL tells me that first I need a license and I upgraded for free from Windows 8.1 when Microsoft presented the offer, THANK YOU for the easy way, but how do I find my license?</p>

            I found that I don't need a license as it is digitally assigned, (not exact terminology).&nbsp; Little wary, but I will try.&nbsp; If I lose computer, Microsoft won't help.&nbsp; FYI:&nbsp; Lots of old information at Microsoft site; wish they would fix.&nbsp; Maybe this old info
 is still needed for some computers, but still should be better organized.&nbsp; Constructive criticism or any negative comments don't seem to go over well.&nbsp; I've been loyal since MS dos, but that doesn't count for anything.

<p>How can I load other OS like Linux and Vista? Do I need ISO files or will the install disc do?</p>
<p>I don't see a Virtual Pc console to do this, like on the older versions of Virtual Pc.</p>

            <p><strong>I recommend you use another tool such as Oracle VirtualBox for Linux, since the integration components available in Windows Virtual PC&nbsp;are not compatible with Linux.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>Create a virtual machine and install a guest operating system<br />
A guest operating system runs in a virtual machine. If you do not want to use Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 3 (SP3) as the guest operating system, you can create a virtual machine. You will use a wizard to create the virtual machine and customize
 it by specifying details such as the name and the amount of memory to assign to it. Before you create the virtual machine, consider the following questions:
</p>
<p>How much memory will you allocate to the virtual machine? Be sure to allocate enough to run the guest operating system and all applications that you want to run on the virtual machine at the same time.</p>
<p>Where do you want to store the virtual machine and what do you want to name it? For example, you might want to use a name that identifies the guest operating system, or describes how you want to use it. You can use as many as 80 characters for the name.</p>
<p>What type of virtual hard disk do you want to use and where do you want to store it? For more information, see About virtual hard disks.</p>
<p>After you create the virtual machine, you can modify it as needed. For more information, see Configuring a virtual machine.</p>
<p>Note <br />
For information about an easy way to set up a virtual instance of Windows XP SP3, see Configuring and using Windows XP Mode. For information about the operating systems supported for use as guest operating systems, see the Windows Virtual PC system requirements
 (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=155832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=155832</a>).
</p>
<p>To create a virtual machine<br />
Open the Virtual Machines folder. From the Start menu, click Windows Virtual PC. If the menu item is not visible, click All Programs, click the Windows Virtual PC folder, and then click Windows Virtual PC.</p>
<p>The Virtual Machines folder opens in Windows Explorer. From the menu bar, click Create virtual machine.</p>
<p>Note <br />
The Virtual Machines folder provides details about all the virtual machines created by the current user, as well as access to the tools for creating and modifying virtual machines and virtual hard disks.</p>
<p>The Create a Virtual Machine Wizard opens. Proceed through the pages of the wizard, choosing the options that are appropriate for the guest operating system.</p>
<p>After the wizard finishes, the virtual machine appears in the file list in the Virtual Machine folder.
</p>
<p>After you create the virtual machine, you can install the guest operating system. The procedure varies slightly depending on the type of installation media you plan to use, such as physical CDs and DVDs, .iso files, and network-based installation servers.
 The following procedures describe how to use each type.</p>
<p>To use a CD, DVD, or .iso file to install a guest operating system<br />
To use a CD or DVD, insert it into the drive and then skip to the next step. To use an .iso file, do the following:</p>
<p>Right-click the virtual machine in the file list, and then click Settings. </p>
<p>In the left pane, click DVD Drive. In the right pane, choose Open an ISO image. Click OK.</p>
<p>Start the virtual machine. In the file list, select the virtual machine and click Open. Windows Virtual PC opens and displays the video output of the virtual machine.
</p>
<p>The virtual machine searches for bootable media. Setup begins after bootable media is found.</p>
<p>After the installation is complete, install the Integration Components package. From the Tools menu of the virtual machine window, click Install Integration Components.</p>
<p>To use a network-based installation server to install a guest operating system<br />
Start the virtual machine. In the file list, select the virtual machine and click Open. Windows Virtual PC opens and displays the video output of the virtual machine.</p>
<p>The virtual machine automatically starts the PXE boot agent and attempts to contact the remote installation server. Watch the screen for instructions. When prompted, press F12.
</p>
<p>Note <br />
If the remote installation server does not respond, you will receive the message “Reboot and Select proper Boot device.” Check the virtual machine settings to make sure the network adapter is connected to an external (physical) network. If it is, check with
 the administrator of your network for instructions about using a network-based installation server.</p>
<p>Select an operating system from the choices offered by the remote installation server.</p>
<p>Use the setup utility for the operating system to complete the installation. If you need to restart to complete the process, press CTRL+ALT+END, or click Ctrl+Alt+Del from the virtual machine window.</p>

<h2>            printing problem</h2>
                    <p>I'm using an HP Pavilion laptop, Windows 10 and an HP printer. Also using Google Chrome browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last 3 days, I am not able to print a document in color. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked everything I can think of: color ink cartridge OK; color option is selected when printing, and printer prints in color from husband's computer....so it's not a printer problem. &nbsp;It must be some type of override command on my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to print documents in color from a PDF file, from the web and from Outlook, and so far, they only print in black ink.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!</p>

<h2>            File History Drive Full - Turn Off Warnings</h2>
                    Is there anyway to turn off the daily (or more) warnings about the file history drive being full? I have already set it to "until space is needed" option, and it's a 128GB drive. The fact that it's full just means it should automatically start deleting
 stuff without my knowing or caring. How can I turn off these notifications?

If you're disabling HDR through the TV menu, this may be toggling your HDMI port&nbsp;from version&nbsp;2.0 to 1.4. 4K&nbsp;resolution is not supported on Xbox if it is plugged into an HDMI&nbsp;port running version 1.4 specs, and will drive 1080p/SDR at most.

<p>i have an older 4K tv with UHD, and when i set it to 10 bit with UHD on, i can clearly see the vibrancy and detail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>however, on the 4K test it shows the TV does not support movies and games at HDR 10, but supports 4K gaming @ 60Hz</p>
<p>
</p><p>theres other TVs which do show HDR 10 working with movies and games; however cheaper models will not give a full range and may just be a slight enhancement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i would wait till 4KTVs standardize 10 Bit HDR and Dolby atmos, as theres very few TVs on the market now which truly show the potential of HDR.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Sonic solutions Dla incompatibility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tommo3kids  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sonic solutions Dla incompatibility</h2>
                    Running Vista Home Premium whenever I boot up I get a window saying a driver has been disabled for Sonic Solutions Dla and that I should contact Sonic Solutions web site for support. I have not been successful with trying this but I have gathered that
 there is a patch available to cure this problem. The original disc was supplied with my Dell PC which I understand requires a special patch. Whether this fault is responsible or not I don't know but my Windows Updates are not downloading and the window just
 freezes. Virus scans have shown nothing amiss but I'm having no luck even in Safe Mode. My PC also freezes and will not shut down. I have to cut off the power and restart in safe mode.

<p>My husband's number has not changed, he has had the same number for 4 years, and I have never changed it.&nbsp; I did as you suggested, and went in and edited his number, but I was still not able to connect.</p>
<p>I have not been able to call him since my renewal. At this point, I would like to request a refund. I will pay for one month of service, but would like to be refunded for the remainder of my one year subscription.&nbsp; I have been lucky to have had your service,for
 the last 4 years, however, I have never had an issue with Skype.With this first incident, however, I am truly disappointed that there is not a live help desk to talk to, and if you had done any research on my account, you would have discovered that I did not
 change my husband's number. Please refund the remainder of my subscription, and I will use another service, that is more customer and user friendly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,&nbsp;</p>

<span>I have a SONY VAIO VPCCB15FG laptop and I was using Windows&nbsp;</span>8.1<span>&nbsp;
 the option to switch graphics vanished from my Catalyst menu, so only the Intel HD&nbsp;</span>3000<span>&nbsp;VGA was being used.
 I tried downloading the latest Windows 8.1 driver from my laptop's support page, but somehow it installs as a different model (amd</span>7600<span>m),
 so my system was crash&nbsp; when I try to run and showing on the display Video TDR failure .(when Two driver is showing on the divice manager&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>The only thing that you can do is to contact Sony directly since the driver is clearly not for the same graphics card and for them to be able to assist you properly together with the Catalyst issue which is a feature of Sony's devices.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You will need to reload those programs and drivers. If you have any on CD or DVD you</p>
<p>can load them from there. Or go directly to their makers' sites, such as Canon, Norton,<br />
ArcSoft. Any programs and drivers that came with your computer should be available<br />
at the System Maker's site.<br />
