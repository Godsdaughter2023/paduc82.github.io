            Sounds like you have logged into a temporary profile. Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account. 
<br />
<br />Or
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />
<br />Type: explorer.exe
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Another option is to to kill the File Explorer process completely.
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />
<br />Type: CMD
<br />Hold down the the shift key
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Type: 
<br />taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Exit Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />
<br />Type: explorer.exe
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Sorry, this is widely reported currently and there is no known fix except to do a clean install or a Reset or wait until MS comes up with a workaround.

            Hi CADJr2015,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />
<br />Once in Safe Mode: 
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer 
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon, check the box marked 'Hidden Items' 
<br />
<br />C:\users\Default\ 
<br />
<br />Right click and copy the Desktop folder contained in the Default Folder 
<br />
<br />Navigate to: C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile 
<br />
<br />Right click and Paste the Desktop folder into the systemprofile folder 
<br />
<br />Restart (not shut sown) your PC 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<h2>            Hardware &#47; Driver Related Issues</h2>

<p>Hello, recently i installed Windows 10 on an old EarthWalk Lap15EW2 that came with Windows 7 installed, and right after that, I started having problems where I would boot it up and it would instantly hard-lock and i would have to hold down the power button
 and restart it just to get into the OS, so I thought I would look at device manager, and see if there was anything wrong, and there was. Many devices weren't recognized or had major driver issues, so i tried to install drivers for the devices, but Windows
 said that the best drivers were installed or there were no drivers for that device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the devices with problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller has error</p>
<p>Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection Has a Driver Problem</p>
<p>Realtek GBE Family Controller has error</p>
<p>Mass Storage Controller has no driver</p>
<p>O2 Micro SmartCardBus Reader has no driver</p>
<p>SDA Standard Compliand Host Controller has a driver problem</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>

 or word documents, but on an actual web site, it won't work. When I hold Ctrl U to underline documents, it takes me to another tab and shows the source code. I have a password manager and was unable to underline the password in the edit box. I was at Best
 Buy the other day and talked with their computer expert. He said you can do it on a smart phone, but not on a laptop. Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the information. Please note that there’s no option to underline passwords that you input on your online accounts. Pressing
<strong>Ctrl</strong> +<strong> U</strong> key in a browser will just give you source code of the website that you are visiting. Currently, underlining passwords using browser on your PC is not available.</p>

    <title>Mouse Buttons not working with Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjkr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse Buttons not working with Windows 7</h2>
                    Just got back from vacation, everything worked prior to that but I try logging into windows and when prompted to select profile I am unable to, after a while I finally get it in but can't select anything on desktop either. After a while I start using my
 keyboard so I find out it isn't my PC that is freezing or anything as it works fine, I then switch out my mouse for another one and get the same thing. Basically the cursor works, but when I click open areas/icons or just click on buttons I get no response,
 same with right click, I have had some moments for a few minutes where it worked, but have really no idea why it works and why it doesnt.<br />
<br />
What works changes everytime I restart apparently.&nbsp; One time I restart and the left and right click mouse buttons were full functional on taskbar but nothing else, right now they don't work on taskbar/any open programs but can click on anything on desktop and
 open<br />
<br />
Both were wired mouses, I mainly use G5 wired mouse, updated set point drivers and still got same result<br />

Hi MJKR,</p>
<p>Try the following steps and check the result.<br />
<strong>Step 1: </strong>Check in safe mode<br />
a. <strong>See </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your computer in safe mode</a><br />
b. Login to the problem user account and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the issue doesn't persist in safe mode, then try clean boot<br />
a. Open the article: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
b. From the article, follow "Step 1: Perform a clean boot" Executing these steps will disable all the non Microsoft programs running on the computer.<br />
c. Check if the issue persists.<br />
d. If the issue does not persist in clean boot, it means that some non Microsoft program is causing the issue.<br />
e. To find out the program that's causing the issue, try "Step 2: Enable half of the services" to "Step 6: Resolve the problem"<br />
f. Once you find the culprit, check if there are any updates or patches for the program. If you find any, install them and check the difference or reinstall the latest program.<br />
g. From the article, follow "Step 7: Reset the computer to start as usual"</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong> If the issue still persists, restore the computer to an earlier time<br />
a. Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.<br />
b. In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.<br />
c. In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.<br />
d. Click Finish.<br />
e. Restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</p>

            Hola! podrías intentar haciendo un hard reset, apaga tu consola pero deja apretado el "botón" de encendido durante 10 segundos. Luego la fuente de electricidad de tu consola cambiará de color blanco a naranja. Después de esto, desconecta tu consola de
 la corriente por 5 minutos. Finalmente, conectala y trata de acceder. Saludos!<br />

            We are having the exact same issue.. when we click on Add New we get kicked out. We know our microsoft sign in's and xbox sign in's emails and passwords. Don't get why we can't add our gamer tag to the console.

            Creo que deberías llevarla a un lugar donde puedan mirar si algo del hardware esta mal, pero también puede ser que solo sea que el software se trabó, intenta hacerle el hardreset

<h2>            Windows 7&#58; Can&#39;t right click or select or interact at all with the desk top. </h2>
                    
<p>I'm running Windows 7, preinstalled on a new Lenovo y460 and I was trying a couple of different desktop shells (SharpEnvro, Emerge Desktop, and GreenGnome). When I was preparing to use GreenGnome I noticed that it was&nbsp;recommended for Windows XP only (Preparation
 was mostly moving a file to the start-up program, I undid everything that was called for for the installation). It was after that that I noticed I could no longer right click or interact with my desktop (my taskbar and windows works fine).&nbsp;</p>
<p>After looking around the internet, the few people who had a similar problem simply system restored. So I tried that when I got the error message, "System restore unable to access file, restore unsuccessful". The alert told me it could be due to an antivirus
 so I removed mine completely (Microsoft Security&nbsp;Essentials) and it still wouldn't restore. I then tried restoring in safe mode and that didn't work either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for as the issue with the desktop I feel like it could be an issue with the explorer shell but I don't know how I would go about fixing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I don't really understand what you mean by the top listed desktop link. There are three programs listed under "Programs" (Emerge Desktop Shell Changer, Add desktop, Configure Desktops), which is on the top. At the bottom there is also a section dubbed
 'Files' which has the folders 'Desktop' and 'Desktop1'. I opened Desktop which brings me to Windows Explorer. I am able to interact with them.&nbsp;

<p>I was trying to get to your desktop shortcuts with explorer, and see if when it shows them in explorer will they work on that page,</p>
<p>Also you check the properties of these shortcuts on that page and see if there's any security issues with them, or delete one of them and then go to that program and re-install it on your desktop to see if it will work there.</p>
<p>Hold the ctrl key while you click on any shortcut on your desktop.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade&#58;  Password not accepted</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. Upgrade was successful as I was able to login and play around however now after a few days of the laptop being shutdown I can't get back in.&nbsp; Password is not being accepted.&nbsp; I have already completed/checked
 the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tried every combination of passwords I have used previously.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reset password on Microsoft Live and logged into microsoft live with that password</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checked I didn't have Caps Lock on</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checked the keyboard language is correct.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checked I typed in the password correctly by looking via the eye.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tried to change password via Administrator but can't as its a Microsoft Account and I get a "The system is not authoritative for the specified account and therefore cannot complete the operation'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now at a total loss as to how to get back into my laptop.</p>

                    All the Chinese and Japanese characters display as squares SOMETIMES. It sometimes get fixed after I rebooted the system.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have already changed the the non-unicode language as Chinese (Simplified, China) in Region &gt; Administrative.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The display language for my OS is English.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I heard people say it will work if I change my Format and Location to Chinese/China. I don't want to do it because then my time format will also display as Chinese.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>These setting combinations were working in Win 7.</div>

            not sure about displaying both chinese and japanese, but for just japanese i found that switching language for non-unicode to japanese once then changing back to english(for occasional applications that dont display right language) works for displaying
 japanese characters correctly in windows explorer

<h2>            Windows 10 File Administrator Account Access Problems&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings! Ok, I'm getting desperate! Since installing Windows 10 I have suddenly been locked out of making changes to files, write permissions, and moving files into the Documents Directory, Pictures, Music, and all other directories. I am the device owner,
 I am listed as an administrator and yet, this system persists in informing me that I require and Administrators Permission to work on my own computer??? I have tried every fix that I can find! Is there any way to clear this up! Do I need to completely remove
 Onedrive? What the heck is up with all of this??</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!!!! </p>

            <p>Hi RookKC, </p>
<p>No I as yet haven't gone to safe mode to try and alleviate the problem. I did notice that Onedrive was locking my entire system down in a constant retrieval that I finally stopped by shutting off its services and unlinking its access. My name is listed as
 you stated as an administrator but I wasn't listed by name as an admin on any of the folders.... thus I was denied writing and moving and editing privileges. The folders still refuse to come out of "read only" mode no matter how often I uncheck that box. I
 did have to add myself as an administrator by my user name on each folder but there are still access problems. For some reason when I migrated from 8.1 to 10, it didn't migrate my "Owner" and "Administrator" full control access to my machine. It simply listed
 me as a "User" on the system and shunted me down the privileges list apparently.
</p>
<p>MS left a message on this thread claiming they are currently researching the trouble, which does little to help us all as we are now bogged down and can't access our computers!
</p>
<p>I like the features of 10 but this is a BIG LEAGUE Glitch screw up on the part of some coding person somewhere...</p>

            <p>Well, I do believe I've discovered a FIX, at least in all appearances thus far, as extensive as it is! Following much of the available advice I've picked through from forums all over the place, the following seems to have shut down most of the active symptoms.
 First, OneDrive was a HOG plain and simple. It also had addressed itself admin permissions all over the place which I never touched. What I DID find was that somehow it seemed to be conflicting with the folder and admin permissions so I went into the OneDrive
 settings from the active toolbar menu and shut down all processes, "unlinked" it and also turned off its auto-start function at the startup which you can do either in windows or with a utility as I did. Then I went into the Account Settings as was related
 by another user and found that indeed, I was NOT listed but my profile had just been included as a general Home User. I added my own Administrators/Owners account, placed the global permissions accordingly and then rebooted the system. After which I individually
 went back in and on each individual folder, Documents, Pictures, Music, Video, Download etc. I had to back in, re-add myself all over again using the "Find" feature that FINALLY was recognizing me as both a user and an administrator and then manually added
 myself to every folder.... PAIN IN THE BACKSIDE Microsoft!!!! NONE OF THIS SHOULD BE NECESSARY and yes I am awaiting your FIX that puts all of this properly in place in the system!
</p>
<p>Long and short of it all is that after booting all over again, suddenly I can now "Save Files, Move Files, Edit Files, and so on without a warning or being stopped telling me I was some sort of a nobody on my own computer!
</p>
<p>As I said, SO far at least by the time of this writing, it still seems to be working.... Only time will tell. Something in this Windows 10 system seems to adore re-writing and re-applying its own mind all over the place after you've made adjustments. I still
 suspect the OneDrive and other global "Cloud"-like file saving features, but to be honest, how can I be sure.
</p>
<p>If you will, let me know if this works for you! I will await Microsoft's fix.......</p>

            I had a similar issue with a Lenovo I upgraded here at work. Though it had appeared to have set the root permissions for the C: drive to the Lenovo recovery Q: drive. The owner of C root was unknown and no permissions were listed for anyone. Ended up pulling
 the drive and using another computer to reasign ntfs permissions. After which everything started working as expected.

            <p>Yup! This bloody "OneDrive" is an absolute global hacking pain in the neck for certain! Like I said I discovered, it had gone through and allocated permissions and access throughout my system all over the place and made sure that I had next to none! What
 I want to know it JUST "WHO" is it that is perusing all of our files through these permissions? It all seems like one hell of a vulnerability to me.
</p>
<p>It had locked me out of being able to even access my Outlook and all Outlook folders, which I forgot to mention by the way in my previous posting!
</p>
<p>All of this seems fixed now after I did what I did but it seems I'm not alone. Anyone dealing with this will be forced into having to reallocate accounts and permissions all over the place!

            <p>Really?</p>
<p>Are you sure that all the obvious, hard to find and equally hard to fix problems are the culprits here? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry - so - how about letting me try to restate the problem and blow away some of your concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is a Toshiba Qosmio with: i7 740QM; 8 Gig DDR3; 223GB&nbsp;Corsair SSD; &amp; a&nbsp;500GB&nbsp;Hitachi SATA II HD. Its set up to do a Fast Scan every night and a Full Deep Scan every week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading your instant in depth analysis, I ran another Full Deep Scan with WebRoot SecureAnywhere V9.0.1.35 - NO problems found. Then I killed my internet connection and ran&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Defender with
 the same results.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I was connected to my HotMail account when I noticed this and I have to admit that I resent that REQUIREMENT with a passion.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another item: the first thing I did after installing Win 10 was to check and change the default locations for the Documents, Music, Pictures and Video. My Drive C is the SSD and Drive D is the 500GB SATA. Naturally, I try to reserve the SSD for programs,
 while everything else goes onto Drive D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue here is that it "Looks Like" Win 10 somehow managed to make my Drive D act like it's "Read Only" even though the Attributes for Drive D are NOT "Read Only". I've used several programs including Word, Excel and SolidWorks to save to drive D and
 the system will hot allow that to happen. When I try it asks if I want to save to my Documents folder even when I try saving to my Documents folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it shouldn't matter but I did try coping a couple files from another source to my Document folder. When I tried to renamed them Win 10 told me I needed Admin Access. Do I have to tell you how quickly that message got "OLD"! Fortunately, in the File
 Explorer at least - there is a "Continue" button that will allow the changes to happen. Unfortunately - that button doesn't exist in my 2010 version of Word or anywhere else. Did I hear a collective OOPs there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the same tests with an External&nbsp;Hard Drives (USB) and it work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*******************&gt; EDIT &lt;*******************</p>
<p>I've been fighting with this thing all day and didn't see the lower posts.</p>
<p>This system was Upgraded from Windows 7 Pro and I too shut off One Drive shortly after I saw it in the program list.</p>

            <p>Hello.&nbsp; What I have found is that my User Profile has changed.&nbsp; Don't know how, but started a couple of weeks after installing Windows 10.&nbsp; I am the only user on this computer, but when I right-click on a file or folder and view properties, I see as many
 as six user accounts in my security tab.&nbsp; My account is listed four times; once as Administrator, with full control, then as home user with read/execute only permission.&nbsp; I did set up a One Drive account when I installed Windows 10, but I don't know that had
 anything to do the permissions changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did create another user profile with admin rights.&nbsp; I gained privileges to the same files and open each one fine (read, edit, and save capabilities).&nbsp; I also logged out of One Drive and change the settings so it does not run at startup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read in another post how a user made a new profile, copied all their "folders and files" there, and was able to regain full control.&nbsp; Anyone know how to do that?&nbsp; I wouldn't want to miss copying something important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop, local account, Windows 10 upgrade from 8.1.&nbsp; No hardware issues.&nbsp; Also happened on my wife's laptop, Dell, local account, Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7.&nbsp; Thanks.

            Hi Spencer.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />2) If no newer BIOS/UEFI firmware to install, then enter Setup to reset it to defaults, accessing Setup as shown here:  
<br /><a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) Compare the install you did with this gold standard  Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />The reason I ask you to do this is because no one of millions who have followed the install in that link have ever come back to report problems that I have seen.   It is also a great learning experience that will make you permanently the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and have applied it with your own hands. 
<br />
<br />The newest version 1903 will be released any day so I would wait to Clean install with it following the steps in the above guide, or run the media as an Upgrade first if you want to see if that helps, as it might.
<br />
<br />5) If hardware is still under warranty I would contact their Support to get help testing it for possible RMA.  For example you can test SSD with the manufacturer's or one of these tools:
<br /><a href="https://merabheja.com/ssd-health-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://merabheja.com/ssd-health-monitor/</a>
<br />
<br />6) Test the RAM overnight to stress it with the best bootable test memtest86, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>hello dommi here with degrees in mcet MCBA&nbsp; graduated back in 1998 hahaha long time in business</p>
<p>
</p><p>first thing is to have not called geek squad in the first place.; why I say this the first time one of there senior tech showed up at my place as my brand new system crashed after a 72 hour burn in time&nbsp; first they said it was my end as not knowing anything
 about computers in the first place &nbsp; well this set the tone for the net 15 minutes before I through this person out called there boss and was to the same thing from their boss.&nbsp; we this did not sit well with me</p>
<p>
</p><p>graduated with top of the class and letters of so from several different parties.&nbsp; one was from the head of the space industries the great older gent man from the tv commercials.&nbsp; he was my in structure a DeVry school in&nbsp; Toronto first day there he had me
 right a few more test just to see if I had the traing I said I had. &nbsp; came back to me a hour after the exam ask if I would like to instructed first and second year students in advanced theory plus other classes did so for about one year then left&nbsp; personal
 reason but not here </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>any way the first this one must do is did the person ask or check for any hardware changer to system/ why I ask is a lot of the newer computer systems out there are hardware specific required? if so they will have to replace said items with the manufactures
 exact item not generic as such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 was there any software added to your system before running a complete diagnostic check to see of any error codes to your computer system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 if your computer still running anything other then windows 10&nbsp; theirs an old trick to such a simple repair.&nbsp; have any one shown you dos command and how they work if so good.&nbsp; make a separate bootable cd disc use not pad and line 1 sys.ini file enter as
 the very first line fdisk/mbr and save it with the same title</p>
<p>
</p><p>one does the system will boot but uses the 2nd boot strap to load from as it will and can not ever change&nbsp; this will fix any and all boot problem as the master boot record has been altered in some way and just needed it to be reloaded from the second boot
 strap to your system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi Spencer
<br />
<br />When you say it takes that length f time to boot, what is on the screen at that time, is it the BIOS POST screen or are you left looking at spinning dots for that time?

<h2>            I factory reset my laptop and lost product key</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a lenovo yoga around 2 years ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a factory reset and it was my first to do on it.</p>
<p>After it was done the laptop was working fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried shutting it down but it won't do that</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I pushed the power button to shut down the laptop manually</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I power up the laptop again. It gives me this dashboard<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f123691d-2851-4d48-a714-a122b551566b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f123691d-2851-4d48-a714-a122b551566b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to Restore the system or Startup Repar or anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows the following:-</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/411a6bad-3b38-419f-9b0b-ec21b19046b8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/411a6bad-3b38-419f-9b0b-ec21b19046b8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What should i do?! And is there a way I can get my key back?!</p>

            Hi Anas, your best option is to clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a Product Key and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

<h2>            transferring files from vista to windows 8.1</h2>
                    I see that I can't use Windows Easy Transfer.&nbsp; I have backed up everything anyway on the external drive.&nbsp; Is there someway to just upload everything from the external drive (using "restore", for instance?)without overwriting everything in the same programs
 in windows 8.1?&nbsp; Or do I have to copy everything all over again, one by one?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to copy your data&nbsp;files only&nbsp;from Vista to 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Vista machine:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Vista's Windows Explorer (or Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) &gt; have an external Hard Drive or USB flash drive plugged in &gt; go to the files you wish to transfer &gt; right click on the files you wish to transfer &gt; hover Mouse Cursor over "Send to" &gt;&nbsp;select
 the external Drive .</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>8 machine:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Plug in USB drive&nbsp;&gt; open File Explorer &gt; copy files across&nbsp;into correct folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>_________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was a complete backup of Vista that you did, you can not&nbsp;pick particular&nbsp;files out of that complete backup.</p>
<p>It has to be mounted, which is complicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<p>I've adjusted the tv's av sync settings and put in automatic mode, but the delay in the voice continued. So I put in -5 which is the maximum that the TV allows and it's almost equal, but still has a delay. But I think it's about tb settings now. Thanks for
 the tip!</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi Trakko,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Is the camera getting detected in device manager?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You may click start then device and printers options. Check if the camera gets detected and listed in the option.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>You may also use the hardware and devices troubleshooter and check if it lists and helps resolve issues -</span><span><br />

<p><strong><span>You may try installing simple camera application in utilities and check if this helps -<a href="http://www.msi.com/index.php?func=downloaddetail&amp;type=firmware&amp;maincat_no=135&amp;prod_no=1847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.msi.com/index.php?func=downloaddetail&amp;type=firmware&amp;maincat_no=135&amp;prod_no=1847</span></a></span></strong></p>

<p>Hello Trakko,</p>
<p>In addition to what Meghmala stated, since this is a new computer I advise that you contact the manufacturer in regards to the WebCam.<br />
They should support the hardware that can pre-installed on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Can I use my computer while creating backup with Win 7 Backup and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I use my computer while creating backup with Win 7 Backup and Restore</h2>
                    I have spent at least an hour on a fruitless search for the answer to this question. It's not mentioned in the program itself, so maybe it's not an issue, but will Win7 successfully create a backup if I am also using the computer while it's doing so. This
 is my initial backup. Do I need to let the computer sit undisturbed while it creates this backup (it seems awfully slow), or is it ok for me to use the computer while the initial backup is being created?<br />

            <p>Hello Arlis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is always better to keep Windows backup undisturbed. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you want to use your computer while creating backup, you may use it for running those processes which may take lesser memory and take lesser processing time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those processes may include typing a document, playing music and so on.</p>
<p>
