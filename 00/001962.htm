            <p>If you are tapping it in history, it will&nbsp;start playing a cached copy. You don't need to delete anything. There is no "stop" and the transport controls on the lock screen&nbsp;don't really go away. If you play enough other media it will drop out of your history

<h2>            Students Can&#39;t Type on a Class Notebook</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm a relative newby to Class Notebooks. I have set up a notebook to be used by staff and students, for a Student Council group.</p>
<p>When creating, I added staff and it sent a link to them. All good. Then I added students. They followed their link onto the notebook, but are unable to type or work in the Sections that I have created for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be that it is set up as read-only. I need them to be able to work/edit in the space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to rectify this? Or what I need to do differently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA.</p>

<p>Hi Natasha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The option for the students to type or work in the sections that you created will depend on the permissions that you set when you share the notebook. For more information about the permissions in Class Notebook, please refer to the steps below:</p>

<h2>            &#34;Choose Home Page in Search Settings&#34; Message that freezes Internet Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Good morning Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are having an issue with Internet Explorer. When we open a new tab we get a message that says "Choose Home Page in Search Settings..." gives an option of a default and the one we currently have. However no matter what dot we choose, it will not let us
 click on "DONE" or close the pop up. I have to go into the Task Bar and End Task. This only started happening once we installed Office 365 and they said its not their issue. Anyone know what we may be able to do? Thank you so much for your help.</p>

            <p>Rakesh, this is not the solution. You need to change the home page setting to the msn.com as a home page.</p>
<p>Marcela, what you need to do is go to IE, right click and choose Properties (Do not open the browser). Go to previous versions, select the previous version and open the browser from here. Once the browser is open in previous versions you &nbsp;should be able
 to select Internet Options - (if the previous settings browser has an MS home page). On Internet settings choose the default browser of msn.com. Close the browser and then open IE as normal. You may get an MS message to update IE. I choose yes, the browser
 opens successfully without the home page settings message, and you can then browse from here on in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS - this is a hugely frustrating issue, please fix asap.</p>

    <title>VBA to determine which tabstop is effectively utilised by a tab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john-b-roberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA to determine which tabstop is effectively utilised by a tab character i.e. chr&#36;&#40;9&#41;</h2>
                    I have been supplied with a very long (several hundred pages) document that has been set up "visuallY' into tables, however this has been done using&nbsp;using tabstops rather than an actual table.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to re-format the document into a spreadsheet to perform some analysis on the data. To complicate matters, there is no consistency of the arrangement of the tabstops within each paragraph, and sometimes, for example, the text that starts ("belongs")
 in column 3 might over-flow through one or more subsequent columns, such that there is then only one tab character to place the next required text into column 7 (if the overflow extends to column 6, and there is no "actual" content for these over-flow columns
 in this row). Also, some columns are right aligned tab stops, and some are left aligned.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What is the best way, using VBA, to determine which column a range of text is "visually" in, so that I can export it to the correct target column in a spreadsheet? For confidentiality reasons I cannot supply the actual document, or even an extract, but
 I've constructed a generic illustrative example which I can supply, I'm just not familiar with specifically how to do that on this forum.</div>

            Without seeing the document, the following may work for you. Select the area of the document in question and run the macro. It removes multiple tabs to be replaced by single tabs then converts the result to a table.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dim oRng As Range<br />
Set oRng = Selection.Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With oRng.Find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Text = "^t{1,}"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Replacement.Text = "^t"<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oRng.ConvertToTable<br />

            <p>Thanks Graham, however that is <em>almost</em> the logical opposite of what I think I require.&nbsp; I would need to replace one tab with multiple tabs, however determining the value of the multiple, for any given occasion,&nbsp;is in essence what I'm not sure how
 to do. </p>

<p>This first&nbsp;image, below&nbsp;shows the example file; with the tab characters highlighted, and showing&nbsp;the ruler. Note some tabstops are right aligned.</p>

<p>The second image, below, shows the result of a "Convert Text to Table..."&nbsp;operation; the results are neither surprising nor desirable.</p>

<p>The third image, below, shows the result I would like to achieve. Note this is only an illustrative sample and not the actual file (&gt;350 pages of this kind of layout problem).</p>

            <p>The good news is that Skydrive worked. The not so good news is that I can't see a way forward here. The number of tabs added to space the paragraphs into the columnar format does not lend itself to any easy way I can see of comparing the position of the
 tabbed texts with the tab stop position. </p>

            <p>IMO it is a fairly difficult problem which may require several iterations and a lot of clarity as to what can, exactly happen in the document. I hope someone has existing code that deals with as many issues as possible, but failing that...<br />
<br />
...as an experiment, you could try running the following VBA on one or more "tables" or "partial tables" in your document. It's been thrown together so I would be surprised if it works at all, but if your document has consistent tab settings, it may do something
 useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea is that you select a "table" consisting of a "header row" and the following data rows. The macro tries to compare the left or right positions of each chunk of text in each row with the equivalent positions taken from the "header row". It then writes
 the text chunks to the appropriate cell in a table in a second document. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have VBA skills, it will be hard to make this work, and it would be hard for anyone to progres without a copy of your document.<br />
<br />
The VBA makes a lot of assumptions, by no means all documented, e.g. that the tab definitions are identical in every row. It has a stab at coping with the various things you have mentioned. So I certainly don't expect it to work. But the name of the game in
 this kind of scenario is primarily towork out whether it's actually going to be simpler to do the job manually, whether the code can successfully convert at least some of your data into tables, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main assumption is that your document has multiple tables and that this code would only convert one at a time. So in a production version, it would be worth working out how to detect where each table begins and ends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run it, you'll need to install the VBA. Graham has some instructions somewhere on his site. Back up your document and work with a copy. Then select a "table header"+"data rows", run the macro and see what happens. I wouldn't put much effort in if the
 macro fails or does nothing useful.</p>

<p>i was used SGH i-780 the original WM i used it 6.0... when i heard the new version 6.1.. i try to find out and get the update from my friend who now to upgrade it...but unfortunately it was third party and have some problem...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you upgraded to a new ROM that was from an "unofficial" source, you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; Unfortunately, "cooked" ROMS are not as reliable as an official version.</p>
<p>When Samsung created the upgrade ROM, it was based on upgrading from the previous official version.&nbsp; There is a possibility that the "cooked version" you used might have had some effect (although I tend to doubt it).&nbsp; It sounds as if you have a button that
 has gone bad and will need to be repaired.&nbsp; The camera issue I need more information but regardless, it sounds as if you may be in the market for a new device.</p>
<p>USE OFFICIAL ROMS .... it is always the safest course to take.&nbsp; Using a ROM that comes from a 3rd party always comes with a risk!</p>

    <title>Action links in message.html not working - redirects to blank page - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garrettboone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Action links in message.html not working - redirects to blank page</h2>
                    
<p>For about five days now recipients of encrypted emails I have sent have been experiencing the following:</p>
<p>-they can open and download the message.html attachment that comes with the initial notice email</p>
<p>-they click the one-time passcode option and no code is sent, the page redirects to a blank page</p>
<p>-In Chrome it is blank, in IE is says 404 not found, this is confirmed by tech support</p>

<p>I'm an office365 online user and have a local installation of Outlook 2016, but encryption happens at the exchange level, not locally, through a transport rule. Even when sending from the online portal, the same thing happens. Additionally, I am the sole
 user at my organization and no settings have been changed recently. I have noticed that the service health for Exchange has recent issues - doesn't seem to be related, though.</p>

<p>I have gone in through powershell and confirmed OME configuration is correct. Also disabled, then enabled the OTP setting.</p>
<p>When the page redirects after selecting one-time passcode, the address seems to indicate that it stalls out at the step of sending to the OTP server the specifics of the message. It never gets to the step of displaying the page where the user enters the
 code.</p>
<p>I have also noticed while inspecting the source that the message window itself and then the redirect window have some HTML error codes.</p>
<p>Anyone heard of this behavior before with the OTP? It almost feels like when text messages on my phone don't get delivered and everything backs up.</p>

<p>Hi Garrett,</p>
<p>This issue was posted to the Service Health Dashboard (SHD) as incident EX45445 starting at April 23, 2016, at 3:54 PM UTC. The user experience of this incident is: [Update User Impact from Iridias Report]. A suggested workaround is: affected users are receiving
 an error and are unable to open encrypted messages. Tenant administrators can view current information and updates on SHD at the link here
<a href="https://portal.office.com/admin/default.aspx#@/ServiceStatus/ServiceStatusHistory.aspx." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>We will update to the primary thread below once the issue is resolved or you can obtain the most recent information from SHD.</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/158/t/441143</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description, I understand that you have contacted the Microsoft Phone support. I tried to open your case using the case number provided in the link. Unfortunately all the case notes are drafted&nbsp;in a different language which I couldn't understand.
 So I suggest you to post this thread in the appropriate language forum or explain the issue you are facing with the computer&nbsp;in English.</p>

            <p>Yeah, the new OneDrive is pretty terrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It looks totally disconnected from the OS, we lost great features like placeholder for files not synced, we can't see if a folder is shared or not from the explorer anymore either.</p>
<p>And we got an ugly sync icon on each file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Basically, we lost everything that made modern&nbsp;OneDrive great and we are sent&nbsp;back to a point where even live mesh 4 years ago was better (it was pretty much the same thing as this "improved" OneDrive and it had p2p sync).</p>

            <p>I have to believe this is a temporary issue. I have the same issue. I have a SSD for my OS, so there is no way for me to access my&nbsp;photos without parsing them into much smaller folders and doing a selective sync. Why bother taking the time to apply metadata
 to them if I have to basically wrap the pictures in such a tight folder hierarchy, it negates tagging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a folder called education, with CBTs in there. So now, when I want to switch from one CBT to another, I have to swap out selective sync settings. Before, I would just right click on the CBT I did not need anymore, and mark it as online only,
 then jump over to the other CBT and mark for Offline use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to believe this was just a penalty&nbsp;for being on the "fast" build track, and that the "slow"&nbsp;build will have these placeholders.</p>

            LOneDrive placeholders/smart files are exactly the kind of innovative approach to living in a hybrid cloud/local world. At the least, I would like to see them brought back as a default, and at worst, I would like to see them brought back as an option.
 The reality I that I have 500GB of pictures and movies that cannot fit on my hard drive. Using selective sync was the only reason I bought a Surface in the first place. I was able to teach my non-technical wife exactly how to keep older photos in the cloud
 and current photos local. She is not confused. In fact, she quite easily understood the evolution. Bring this feature back. It is truly a bridge to trusting online services.

</p><p>If so, that kind of thing is liable to occur if the fields re-use some of the same bookmark names for their calculations. You'll see that issue discussed in the Note under the
<em>Date and Time Calculations In A Word Form</em> heading, along with advice on which parts of the field codes need to be modified. For example, instead of using the raw jd, mm, dd &amp; yy bookmarks, you might rename one set (and their references) jda, mma, dda
 &amp; yya and the other set (and their references) jdb, mmb, ddb &amp; yyb.</p>

<p>This is not fool proof but it should stop all but the Excel-well-informed from printing the sheet. Suppose it is Sheet2 that need to be blocked. Right clcik that sheet's tab and use "View Code", copy and paste this subrountine to the VBA window. Now when
 someone tries to print ti they will get only the cells A1 and A2</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_Activate()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheet2.PageSetup.PrintArea = "A1:A2"<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>You might also think of putting the 'secret' material in hidden cells</p>
<p>best wishes</p>

<p>Anything we give you is relatively easy to get around. Bernard's solution will work so long as the user enables macros. If not then nothing stops them from Printing the page. You can get a bit more sophistacated and only show the page if macros are enabled.
 Then with Bernard's code you will stop most people. Even at that there is nothing stopping the user from copying the sheet&nbsp;contents to another sheet and then printing that. IMO there is no foolproof way to stop the users from printing anything in XL relatively
 easily...</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents...</p>

                    <p><span>When I sign in to Outlook, I can't see the "Subject" of my emails. All I can see is the first letter, and then an ellipsis (ex. "S...")<br />

When I try and drag the Subject column so that it will expand (as you might do, say, with the sides of a column in a Microsoft Word table), nothing happens. Or, Outlook thinks I am trying to "drag and drop" the email somewhere else.</span></p>

So, how do I expand the size of the "Subject" column in Outlook's main page interface? I feel that there is a very simple solution to this problem that I am missing.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you optimize your browser. This will serve, as initial troubleshooting that shouldnâ€™t be overlooked. All bases should be covered, and browser efficiency
 should be ensured since Hotmail is a browser dependent service. Check this link out to know how to do this:</span></p>

            <p>Hi Alix,</p>
<p>Thank you for your advice, it was very helpful! However, I think I finally figured out what the problem was, and the solution is really quite simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that when I switched over to Outlook from Hotmail, the screen automatically
<strong><em>zoomed </em><em>in</em>.</strong> (No, I didn't do it myself by accident -- the switch from Hotmail to Outlook did it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to view more of the Subject Line, I had to <em><strong>zoom the view out on my computer</strong></em>.&nbsp; To do this, I simply held
<strong>CTRL + moved the scroll wheel on my mouse</strong> to adjust the zoom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the columns in Outlook cannot be adjusted manually, a zoomed out view provided more space for the Subject Line. (This does sacrifice the size of Outlook's typeface, it got smaller).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming that the shape of my monitor was an important factor in this problem: I have an old ViewSonic, 1280 x 768 -- more square shaped compared to the newer 1280x1024 monitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be nice if Outlook's columns could be adjusted manually, seeing as a large portion of space is still wasted in the "From" column (or, at least it is on my monitor). However, I'm just glad that I some sort of correction to the problem could be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your input and your time!</p>

<h2>            Outlook Calendar Sync and Multiple Accounts</h2>
                    <p>HI!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got my outlook.com account to sync my calendar between phone, tablet and PC. In my tablet (Surface) and desktop PC I have Outlook and in the phone I've got Android with active sync. Also I have 2 more email accounts (that uses IMAP) working on my outlook
 application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already defined in outlook that the default data file is the one with the outlook.com account so all my appointments are been send automatically to the calendar that's been synced to outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This setup works perfectly, and when I create an appointment in any of the devices it get since through each one of them very fast. If I receive an appointment that's been send to my outlook.com account, it gets synced immediately also through the devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gets weird once you receive an email with an appointment that is not directed to the outlook.com account but one of the other email accounts. In this case outlook properly generates the appointment in the correct calendar (The one syncing with outlook.com
 that is), but it doesn't sync the appointment to outloook.com and therefore the other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to look on the calendar log but there are no records of any error there. To make things even more strange, I've got an email alias in one of my email accounts, that's also setup as an email aliases in my Microsoft account, appointments sent to this
 email alias, that actually arrive to the IMAP server are synced, but if you send the appointment to the real account it doesn't, even if both appointments comes from the same server and email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I'm starting to think there are some restrictions on how outlook and outlook.com sync appointments to the calendar, or may be I need to configure something in the outlook.com calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that somebody can help with this problem, it's really annoying to have some appointments synced and some not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh! one more thing, I added to my Microsoft account my other email addresses as aliases (Hoping this will fix the problem), they didn't appear on the outlook calendar....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Auto Fill a Cell With Data From Another Workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aj_iv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto Fill a Cell With Data From Another Workbook</h2>
                    I have two Workbooks, one called Quote and the other called Products, and each contain identical columns, PartNo and Description.<br />
<br />
1.) Within the Quote worksheet I'd like to begin typing within a PartNo cell and have it start auto filling using the data in the PartNo column in the Products Workbook.<br />
<br />
2.) Once the PartNo has been entered into the Quote worksheet I'd like for the associated Description cell to be automatically populated with the related Description from the Products workbook.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            <p>1) That's not how autofill works. It only takes values from the cells&nbsp;directly&nbsp;above as possibilities, and only after you have typed a unique beginning segment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Use VLOOKUP based on the PartNo that you enter, with the Products table as the source.</p>

            <p>You could use data validation with a list, but you would not get autofill. You would get a list that you could choose from. You could also use VBA to sinulate it, but I have never found a really good replacement, since VBA is diabled when you are in edit
 mode and are entering data. You would need to use a userform and text entry box, and it gets complicated. What I have done is put the list above the entry area, and then hidden those rows - so if I have 100 different values that I want to autocomplete from,
 I just hide rowsx 1 to 100 and Excel's autocomplete does the rest, for cells in rows 101 and on, as long as there are no breaks in the table..</p>

<h2>            not receiving E-Mail from my friend who has charter.net</h2>
                    I am not receiving emails from my friend whom I have always emailed with at least 2 to 3 times a day for the last couple of years. She receives mine but I don't receive hers. She&nbsp; told me that her other friends with hotmail are having the same problem.&nbsp;
 I also had her send one to my husband who has hotmail and he did not get it either. she checked with Charter.net and they said it was not a problem on there end that it was a hotmail problem. I followed all the instructions that the page said to try like,
 filtering, checking email rules, ect... ect.. she is also on my safe list and contacts nothing has changed or been changed, been having this problem for over a week now only reason i found out was through a text mess. Any one else having these problems? And
 like I said I followed all the instructions on what to try and still no change. help please! Also wanted to say that i do have rules set up but nothing that would keep me from getting her emails and those rules have been in place for months no new rules were
 set up and btw I still get emails from junk or dirty stuff that I set up rules for and it didnt keep it out of my box. So curious how this stuff comes through but not a legitamite email wont. hmmm<br />

            For the last two weeks, I am having the same identical problem. I can send out an email thru Outlook using my charter.net email address. My friends with Hotmail are not receiving my emails and I am not getting a bounce back error message. I can receive
 emails from them. Yesterday they received my email so I thought perhaps the problem was solved. But today, they again are not receiving my emails. My friends who do not use Hotmail are not having this problem.<br />

            <p>Looks like the email is NOT working again!! AFter not getting emails from my&nbsp; friend who has Charter.net for over a week, she was recieving mine but I was not receiving hers, then 2 days ago it started working again, looks like others said the same thing,
 now today it is back to not receiving her Emails again from Charter.net but this time she says she is getting "Undeliverable" messages now when before she didnt get that message.</p>
<p>I opened up a Gmail account so we could email each other, I prefer my hotmail since that is where all my stuff is.</p>
<p>But this is getting really annoying to say the least. Charter.net is saying it is not on there end, I cant get an answer from Hotmail so who is at fault and better yet, with all the complaints I have seen on line about this why hasn't it been fixed?? Is
 there some sort of beef with each other or what?</p>
<p>It is not fair to not get to the bottom of this. AGain, it is nothing on my part so please don't ask to send any pictures or anything nothing I have done has changed in months,. This is clearly a problem between you two carriers.</p>
<p>Has hot mail tried to fix this or look into it? </p>

            <p>We have the same issue. My husband works off an hotmail account and cannot receive emails from our family's charter account. Thus is very annoying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that charter email servers get hacked at time but still there should be a possibilities to bypass filters for email accounts that are known to be ok.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>any advice from hotmail about this?</p>
<p />

            Mermenolma- Seems to be more a problem with hotmail than charter because my friend who has charter.net has many friends with hotmail and all her friends say they are not getting her email. She is able to receive email from me but I don't get hers. The thing is right before her emails stopped coming they started going into my "Junk" folder which is weird because she is on my contact list and safe senders list so don't know why all of a sudden they went there then stopped coming all together. The other hotmail friends said this also happened to them. 


I have no rules set up. nothing has changed with my acc. other than not getting her mails. another thing is when she sent me an email she didnt know I was not getting hers because she had no error message, but the last couple of days she now gets a "Underliverable"  message.  


I think hotmail has tried to improve there site that all they did was mess it up more.  


What makes me upset too is that I get all kinds of **** junk mail that I don't want

            <p>Yes, it's a Problem on hotmail's end and not on charter. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I wanted to say is that webmail providers get blacklisted sometimes (gmail, Hotmail, and sadly, charter, too) and then are blocked by spam filters. They get backlisted because they get hacked and send out millions of spam. I know this for sure because
 I had this problem a couple of years ago, where Charter got blacklisted into Europe. You can get your specific account taken off the black list, but I think that there should be a smarter way to block off spam emails&nbsp;and let in&nbsp;trusted account.
