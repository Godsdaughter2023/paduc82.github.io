<h2>            3D Builder - How to hide an item</h2>
                    <p>I have a project open with multiple items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous versions of 3D Builder allowed you to show or hide items, just like any other STL editing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the latest version of 3D Builder, I can't find how to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Evan,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've tried to check for this option on my 3D Builder app, but it seems that this feature is no longer available.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can check this support article for the available selection in 3D Builder for reference:<br />

For further assistance with this program, I suggest that you contact our developers by posting on
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=wpdevelop&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Cortana is bad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dalec00per  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana is bad</h2>
                    
<p>1) instead of simply saying "Xbox"to initiate command, you now have to say "hey, cortana". Not the biggest issue, but it is double the syllables and twice the time. annoying</p>
<p>2) you used to say something like "Xbox snap tv" and it should happen almost instantaneously. Now, you say "hey cortana, snap tv" and you see the words slowly appear on screen, cortana thinks about what you are trying to say, understands what you are trying
 to say, then does what you are trying to say. This kind of response time to voice commands would be amazing 10 years ago. They are now sub-par not compared to some time long, long ago but sub-par compared to THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE I DOWNLOADED THE UPDATE!</p>
<p>3) if cortana is still active, regardless of if you can see it or not, it continues to make a chiming noise like it's trying to understand you. Over, and over, and over again.</p>
<p>so, cool, I'm in the early preview group. the new dashboard previewed and I had to sit through a month or so of bugginess but it did get fixed. Xbox, will you fix this? What about an option to forego cortana and go back to what worked?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I DID LIKE when I asked cortana why Siri is so much better (it's not, but I felt the need to insult my Xbox. ****, I FELT THE NEED TO YELL AT AN A.I. THAT IS SO SAD and that's how bad cortana is) and cortana replied "that's like comparing apples to windows".
 Funny, but then again you anticipated how mad people would be at a poor product and wrote in a joke about it. Maybe THAT should have been a clue to scrap the idea till it worked.</p>
<p>please, I love my Xbox and its voice command. Why did you make it worse? It was so fun and pleasant.</p>

<br />Download the ISO file on another computer and perform an InPlace upgrade.

<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

            Hi Kelly.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You should upgrade to the latest version in the Media Creation Tool which you can download and install on another PC, open the app and choose Create Media, either create the bootable flash stick or download the ISO for transfer.  Uncheck Recommended Settings so you choose the licensed version for the other PC only.  
<br />
<br />Transfer the media back to the other PC, open the bootable flash or click to Mount the ISO file, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  
<br />
<br />If any problems with the Upgrade then follow these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If it fails then you can wait until later to see if the problems are ironed out later or in a future version.  Since your version is too old you can also try a previous version which are available here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.

            This was the only thing that worked for me! I just went to settings, then found the sticky note app and clicked reset. &nbsp;I disabled the enabled insights and now my sticky notes work perfectly!&nbsp;

    <title>Speakers and Windows 8 Problem&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Speakers and Windows 8 Problem&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hey guys,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Before installing W8 I had my computer running perfectly with Windows 7 and although the million of things I now HATE about Windows 8 I am trying to put up with it to see if I can at least like it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My main issue is that my speakers are not working or being detected, although they were fine when running W7. Firstly they are connected through the green audio jack and are switched on with volume up high. I have an ASUS P5QL-EPU motherboard which I think
 has the&nbsp;sound-card&nbsp;built in. When I look in the device manager all I can see is 'High&nbsp;Definition&nbsp;Audio Device' -&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;times. However when I load up the playback devices on the sound options all that is visible is S/PDIF which does nothing at all. To ensure
 it was not a driver issue with W8, I&nbsp;uninstalled&nbsp;all the drivers shown in the device manager and installed the latest Realtek Audio Drivers which are shown to be supported by Windows 8, and yet no result.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Finally I thought its very unlikely but the speakers&nbsp;coincidentally have stopped working and maybe defected, therefore I tried them on my Macbook and they were perfectly fine. Furthermore, if I replace the speakers for my Turtle Beach headphones they are&nbsp;recognized&nbsp;instantly?
 So what on earth is happening here, the speakers are plugged in correctly and have the latest drivers.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Below are some link to images encase you&nbsp;hate&nbsp;reading.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks a lot for the support,</div>
<div>Reece&nbsp;</div>

            Reece,
<div>Thank you for the extensive report. I wish everyone were like you.</div>
<div>Your motherboard does not use Realtek for audio, it uses VIA.</div>
<div><span>VIA VT1708S 8 -Channel High-Definition Audio CODEC</span></div>
<div>ASUS is only posting Windows 7 drivers for your motherboard:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Intel_Socket_775/P5QLEPU/#download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Intel_Socket_775/P5QLEPU/#download</a></div>
<div>which might work if you install them in compatibility mode.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You might get VIA Windows 8 drivers from here:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.via.com.tw/en/support/drivers.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.via.com.tw/en/support/drivers.jsp</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>As a side note, it is common to have twor "High definition audio devices"</div>
<div>One is the SPDIF output of the video card via HDMI and the other one is the SPDIF output (optical usually) of the motherboard chipset.</div>

    <title>question about wifi icon symbol - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dlee90  say:</h3>
<h2>            question about wifi icon symbol</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, we have a user that is unable to connect to their home wifi. Tried all the usual troubleshooting steps but nothing resolves. (driver reinstallation, reboot, router reboot, driver update, check ip/dns settings) Can connect to other hotspots except
 home router. Other computers and devices connect with no problem but this dell on windows 10 anniversary edition shows the network with an x and a circle. Have scoured the net to see what it means but haven't been successful yet. Does anyone have an idea what
 this symbol means? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f5fdff2-f3c8-44ef-8dad-a9a5628474e4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Yes, we did diagnose and disable and reenable. Also uninstalled driver, reinstalled driver , updated driver to latest version. No issues with any other wifi spots except this one. Very weird.

 more powerful, etc...I get it. But will my keyboard shortcuts still work? Can I still access the registry? Do I have command prompts?

<h2>            Project Spark Refund</h2>
                    
<p>Not sure if this is the proper forum for this question, but it's the closest I could find.</p>

<p>I purchased Project Spark and activated the code shortly before Oct 5th, when it then became free to play. Refunds in the form of Microsoft Account credits were supposed to be issued by Dec 10th, but I did not receive anything. Wondering what happened to
 my refund.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Problem using both SSD and HDD on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hsd91  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem using both SSD and HDD on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to upgrade to an SSD for Windows and programs, and use my old HDD for file storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install of Windows 10 onto the SSD. The HDD was removed from the computer while I installed Windows. I booted up, installed a bunch of programs on the SSD, then turned the PC off. Then I reinstalled the old HDD. Windows did not recognize it
 at first, so I ran the troubleshooting tool, installed updates, and then Windows recognized it. Then I did a full non-quick format of the HDD followed by another quick format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the HDD is showing 208 MB of used space after formatting. When I go to Disk Management, it shows System Reserved (D: ) is in the HDD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything else is on the SSD (Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, Primary Partition).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I do something wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Argel is correct in that the 'System Reserved' partition is probably left over from the previous installation of Windows on that drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into Disk Management (Windows + X keys and choose Computer Management - Disk Management)</p>
<p>Right click all partitions on the HDD (make sure you select the correct drive), and choose Delete</p>
<p>When all partitions are gone, right click the unallocated space and select Format - choose NTFS as the files system</p>

<p>Well, if you move the 360, the Disc holder is what cause the circle scratch because the Disc gets out of place. The slim also has the Disc Holder. So then yes there is a possibility for some people to get the circle scratch on the Slim.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>1. Did you make any software or hardware changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong> : Boot the computer in safe mode and check whether the issue persists or not. If the issue does not persist then perform clean boot.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b>: Boot the computer in safe mode</p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.
 The words Safe Mode appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</span></p>

 mode </span></span></span></a></p>
<p><b>Step 2</b>: Perform clean boot</p>
<p><b><span>Clean boot</span></b><span>: To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues,
 you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot". A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;After you have finished troubleshooting, follow the step 7 in the below link to reset the computer to start as usual:

            Can the two XP conputers 'see' each other and the printers?<br />
<br />
Two suggestions:<br />
<br />
Make sure the network workgroup name is the same for all computers/workstations. Turn _off_ network passwords at least while you get it all set up and working. Then set up passwords&nbsp;or set up an account with the same user/pass on all networked computers/workstations.<br />

<h2>            its of the OS are still in Spanish, Volume comes up and altavoces, the start screen tiles, when sorted by category are sorted by and headed with Spanish words.</h2>
                    <p><span>&lt;Original title: </span>Language&gt;</p>
<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have a crisis of confidence, confidence that Microsoft can do right by me when delivering the Windows 10 upgrade.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reason:&nbsp; My wife and I have each bought new laptops recently. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I bought mine here in Spain (with 8.1) and was assured that the installation of the English OS was no problem.&nbsp; That proved to be almost true.&nbsp; In a multilingual world, why did I have to navigate my way round the problem in Spanish. Doable, achieved,
 but the task ignited that indefinable nugget of disquiet, the sort of feeling you aren't even sure is there but you leaves with a sneaking suspicion things aren't quite as they ought to be.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then started to install software, which decided it wanted to address me in Spanish. An investigation, a click on the Unicode settings, a period of uninstalling and reinstalling the programmes and all was well, almost.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Bits of the OS are still in Spanish, Volume comes up and altavoces, the start screen tiles, when sorted by category are sorted by and headed with Spanish words. On boot up I am
</span>pagar&nbsp;<span>principal not the main user. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, here we have the world’s largest supplier of software run on, what is it, 80% of the world’s computers? who can’t even provide an English language user with a fully English language OS. That indefinable feeling began to take shape.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is too, the problem of the keyboard layout. This is something I knew about, something I used to encounter when that was my job. I foolishly thought it would be fairly simple to remap the keyboard. I can. Whole keys, but if I want to, for example,
 keep the 8 key typing 8, and have it producing the shift symbol printed on it &nbsp;&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp; well, I haven’t figured that one out.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This would not be a huge issue apart from the fact that suddenly, without any intervention&nbsp; from me the 8 and 9 keys were doing what they say they do, typing, when shifted&nbsp;&nbsp; (&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as suddenly they stopped doing this.&nbsp; The (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; printed
 on the&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; key is produced by typing shift 9, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )&nbsp;&nbsp; printed on the 9 key appears when shift 0 is tapped.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Have I missed something? It could be me, but I can’t find an easy way round this. However solving that issue isn’t the purpose of this missive. I just drop into the mêlée as it is a further example of the not quite rightness of the whole MS experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now we move on to my esteemed other half’s computer which arrived with windows 8 installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The first task was to download (approx) 1.5mb of updates before I could get 8.1 installed. This I did.&nbsp; Let me say that again. I successfully downloaded 1½ MB of software onto a PC, using the not very good internet here. It runs at around 0.5MBS. I
 suspect, based on the way the software subsequently behaved that there are people in Redmond who just don’t believe that such a thing actually exists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then had to deal with the 3.6MB 8.1 download. I realise now, with the benefit of hindsight that I was on a fool’s errand. It was never going to work. Had the user interface been better designed it would have saved me several days of pointless endeavour.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am spending the summer on a campsite on a mountainside in rural Spain. The site wi-fi, which we pay for in our rent, cuts out after one hour. Yes, oh Silicon Valley, optical fibre wired, trillion bytes a microsecond residents, here we have virtually
 steam driven web access. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Up to the point, when Microsoft went from annoying itch to noisy neighbour in need of a court order, the point when I tried to download those 3.6MB of absolutely mandatory software I had been able to wrangle the connection, make it bend to my wishes.
 It was slow, but here I have time. Speed or lack of it isn’t an issue. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If, for example, I wanted a 200mb PDF of an eighteenth century dictionary, that was perfectly achievable. I used Free Download manager. The key attribute that this app. has over Windows is that it always, and that word should be in one-hundred point
 type, bold, italics, fluorescent yellow, on black ground. ALWAYS starts off from where it lost the connection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I downloaded the 1.5MB updates I did so my selecting only three or four of the 145 required programmes at a time. I lost track of what actually happened. The system decided to download its own selection, regardless of where I had put my ticks.
 Odd. Truly odd. But eventually, success. All were installed on the machine and the app store was now augmented with that precious icon for the 8.1 update... hooray.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The highest I ever got was 32%. Sometimes after the machine dropped out after the hour, it would resume from wherever it had got up to, other times, it went back to the beginning.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I discovered the trick of going to the command prompt and typing Net Stop and all that stuff and of emptying the SoftwareDistribution folder before trying again.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After several abortive attempts I had had enough. It was late, I was irked, I wanted to call American Strategic Air command and have them take out key MS installations, I wanted to throw the laptop against the hardest concrete wall I could find. I
 debated the merits of abandoning the 21<sup>st</sup> century and spending the rest of my life off grid with only a quill pen and a scroll of parchment for company.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the end I did something far stupider and far more radical than any of the above. I decided to do a system restore, the one which says it won’t affect any of the existing programmes or stored data.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It wiped all the updates.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, it seems to me MS are halfway between two camps. Either its software is user friendly, cuddly and works in a way which doesn’t involve customers, (yes I know that may be a radical word for you, customer, as in one whose wallet contains money they
 have worked hard to get, to pay for a product which when bought needs fixing) needing to spend hours trawling the net and trying to unravel sometimes contradictory information to get their computer to where it really should have been when shipped.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The design of 8.1, big icons and tiles, and calculator buttons the size of a helicopter landing pad, (why can’t you shrink the 8.1 calculator so you can work with it and another app at the same time?) suggest that the software is meant for consumption
 by those uninterested in what’s under the bonnet.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The MS reality though is you do need to get involved, do need to get your head around sometimes quite complex issues to make the damn thing do what you want it to do.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The reason I persevered with the 8.1 update download was that up to that point I had managed to download everything I had wanted. The update did occasionally restart from part way through. Surely I reasoned, MS wouldn’t put out a 3.6MB download that
 required a completely stable internet, surely they would be sensible and competent and worldly enough to build in a stop and restart&nbsp; technology into their download.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>About this time too, I wondered why windows 8 had been foisted on the planet in the first place. I didn’t hang around long enough to give it a good test drive, but it seemed to be rubbish. This opinion was doubtless boosted by the long diatribes I
 endured from the many people who, when they learnt of my problems launched into an anti 8 rant. Even if the software had some merits, received wisdoms meant I would never be able to objectively search them out.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the end the problem was solved by doing the bleedin’ obvious. I took the laptop down to a local bar. The internet connection there, a speed test revealed, ran at 9MBPS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One of the reasons I hadn’t done this earlier is that I didn’t fancy sitting there for too long, and overdosing on coffee. The other, just to make the point again was that I could see no logical reason why it wouldn’t work on the campsite and spent
 days trying to unearth the solution. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the end the download took 1 hour 45 minutes. I sat there for another half hour waiting for the installation to finish. Finally, as I was on battery, I took the machine backup the mountain, (transporting it open), plugged it into the mains and waited.
 And waited. And waited.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the end the PC took two full hours to complete the install. That included forty-five minutes sitting at 63% and at least 5 minutes with a black screen.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I was given no control over the process. I wasn’t politely asked, “The download is complete. Would you like it to install now or wait for a more convenient time?”&nbsp; Simple basic courtesy you may have thought.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So a full two hours later the machine decides it wants to log back on to the internet. Now to be fair, it did offer a “skip this step” option. However, by this time my faith in the whole process was at rock bottom.&nbsp; I had no way of knowing, and no
 information was provided by the software as to what might happen if I clicked that button. In the circumstances, desperate to get the job done, to finish with the whole damn process and get my life back, I made the decision that clicking “skip” was a no, no.
 I tried to get the machine to log onto the local, and available, and one that machine had previously used network. But as it was part way through the update it provided no method of selecting a different network. It was also impossible to persuade it to display
 the status of the battery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What **** planet are the bozo’s who wrote this ***** programme would be a fair synopsis of my feeling at that moment.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I waited another hour or so for the LED on the laptop’s front to change colour, and drove it back down the mountain, back to the bar. It took just five minutes to complete the process. Bingo, a computer with 8.1 installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then went through the process of installing software and transferring data files. All would have been well but for another moment of brain fade. Those tasks completed I started to make a back up. My external hard drive was already plugged in, but
 I decided to use a USB stick. I plugged that in, the files on it were I knew, unwanted. A screen showed just one drive plugged in. A message came up “this will wipe all your files.” I clicked yes, and realised immediately that my hard drive with all my back
 up files was being wiped. I ripped out the USB. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, to be fair, I was warned. But here we have the kid’s playground design of the start screen and the happy camper this is all child’s play feel to 8.1. In those few seconds, all my back up files disappeared from the hard drive and it turned from
 a 750MB unit to a 32 MB one.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Not a disaster. All the files I needed had been transferred back onto the new laptop. It was only necessary to figure out how to get back the missing 718MB and redo the backups.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But why oh, why dear writers of software was it so simple to potentially lose a lifetime of data? **** is a word I think that applies here.</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, to-reiterate, I know it was my fault, but essentially reformatting a 750MB disk with one click, a moments loss of concentration, the supposition that the disk displayed was the USB stick, because although there were two things plugged in, only
 one was displayed. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Who are you writing this software for, kids, as the display design suggests, or PC savvy geeks? Methinks you need to make up your mind.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I really don’t want to spend my time being a PC tech. I am fed up to the back teeth with searching the web to fix what it seems to me is a incomplete and unfinished product... oh and on both PC’s the app store won’t work..... if what I have read on
 the net is even half true, this it seems is because it is...... poorly written software... but then I wouldn’t know, don’t want to know, I just want it to work, and it don’t.... twice.... &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I have no faith or confidence in MS, the 10 upgrade seems like a disaster waiting to happen...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;My main concern is...... &nbsp;and this question is the reason for this whole rant.....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>My machine, is as far as I am concerned an English language one. But there are remnants of the Spanish OS on the system. What will the upgrade decide to do..... English or Spanish??? An important question to which no one appears able to give a
 proper, sensible and realistic answer.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My wife’s computer with 8.1 installed does not have the 10 upgrade icon. As far as I can make out computers with 8.1 are all eligible for the 10 upgrade. Or is this another nearly truth? I did expect the 10 icon to appear once the 8.1 upgrade was completed.
 It hasn’t. I guess we will have to wait and see... just another not ideal situation
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Would we be better leaving for Mars on 29<sup>th</sup> July?</span></p>

            <p><strong>Can I choose a different language during the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>Cross language upgrades are not supported, the free upgrade will be installed in your local language. In fact, you should uninstall any language packs before upgrading.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if the default language your copy of Windows 7 Ultimate&nbsp;was installed in French and added English; you will need install a language pack for English after setup is complete if you are upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp;If its Windows 10 Home you will
 need to install the Windows 10 Pro Pack ($99) using Add Features&nbsp;(Windows key + X &gt; Control Panel)&nbsp;then download the English Language Pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can download the .ISO for the desired language, create a bootable copy and perform a custom install. (Please note, this means programs will need to be reinstalled and your personal files will need to be backed up.</p>

            <p><span>My dearest Microsoft,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp; Thank you for the original reply to my question about the issue of language and the Windows 10 upgrade.
</span></p>
<p><span>I have received what is quite obviously a stock answer from you, and my follow up enquiry, to clarify, has not yet been responded to. (Sorry about ending that sentence with a preposition.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let me first nail my colours to the mast here. I am not a computer tech. I have no training in how the damn things work. Anything I know I have picked by as I went along; learning gained whilst fire-fighting. I do not arrive at the right
 answer first time, I do not go the most direct route and I make mistakes. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am also a customer. I have paid out my money to have this software.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When purchasing software I rely on the skill and expertise of the provider to make it work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I do not understand the process of writing the stuff. I don’t want to and you wouldn't expect me to.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now, to the crux of the matter.&nbsp; I do not understand. Your reply makes little sense.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You say it is not possible to do cross language upgrades. That mean does it not, that if I have a computer in Klingon and want it after the upgrade to be in Latin that is not possible?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However what I have is a computer in English (or as near as MS can get it). Therefore the upgrade should be in English. QED</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If what you are saying is that the MS language pack does not in fact turn a PC from one language to another, in this case Spanish to English. The obvious question this ignorant user would ask is, why not....
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It just doesn’t make sense. I can only assume you are sending out stock answers without bothering to understand the question.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Really, think about it. I am English. I have converted my PC to be in English. For some arbitrary, non-logical and absurd reason, MS will turn it back into Spanish. How is this; sensible, reasonable, customer centric, a good thing to do,
 okay behaviour? </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There are only two possible explanations. The information is wrong or MS can’t be bothered to put into place whatever is needed to make this work as it should.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You see, I have bought two new laptops. Due to poor internet here and what I perceive as the appalling design of the user interface it took me several days to update and upgrade the computers and transfer the software and files. The thought
 of having to do it a third time just because I bought a machine in Spain leaves me fuming.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Really please, please read this properly, understand it, and tell me as I have a computer in English Windows 10 will keep it that way. Anything else would just be absurd, farcical and jolly well not cricket.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I cannot conceive that a mind exists that would anything else. To do so would be way beyond illogical .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yours in real, genuine anger&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>OK back to the language question....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer bought in Spain has English language pack installed.. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>logic dictates that a computer running in English would be used by an English language user....</p>
<p>
</p><p>however the original answer to the question .... what will happen when I do the 10 upgrade was..... it will revert back to Spanish... either I will have to pay $99 for the privilege of having my computer put back the way it was before the upgrade... language
 wise &nbsp;or do an ISO install which will be a pain in the butt.... I just don't want to go through that ..... again.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It also seems ludicrous that the upgrade will effectively change the operating system &nbsp;language of a computer.. really, not cricket.. not the done thing... bit of a **** up it looks like...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now &nbsp;I have had a look at the &nbsp; "this PC is compatible" &nbsp; report and it says &nbsp; see pics below&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"you'll need to reinstall language packs one the upgrade is complete"</p>
<p>
</p><p>which seems to contradict previous information.... is this a breakthrough... or is this new intelligence wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>because if I get to install 10, and end up with a Spanish computer demanding $99 to go back into English I can see no reason not to send around the boys in blue and have MS arrested for exhortation&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, underneath the rhetoric is a genuine question..... and a very real issue.... &nbsp;please, I need to know what will happen and would like &nbsp;an absolute and definitive answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>will I be able to install 10 and change it to English... for free as all the advertising says the upgrade is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or I am stuffed and have to an ISO.... &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as &nbsp;I am concerned this is not a cross language upgrade.. I am English, the computer is now an English one... seems only reasonable &nbsp;to me.... please an answer&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t download or save documents in Windows 10</h2>
                    Just installed Windows 10, and bugs abound. I can't save Word documents, for one. When I click on "Browse" to choose a folder to save to, nothing happens.

            <p>This problem, not being able to save files, affects more than Word. So far, I have found it in WordPerfect and Quicken, as well, and in Photoshop. It is the result of Windows 10 changing the security status&nbsp; to lock &nbsp;me out. Fixing the security status doesn't
 help, because the next time&nbsp; the program is opened, the security status has been changed back.</p>

            I had this problem with my wife's laptop but not mine. I tracked it down to a security group called HomeUsers, which apparently is added with oneDrive. For some reason, this authority appears to overrule even the administrator authority on my wife's laptop
 (it doesn't on my laptop). This group only has read and execute authority. I gave it full authority on the PC, but upon reboot, it reverted (overwrote) to read and execute. I finally changed it on oneDrive, and now everything works. Two days later, so far
 so good...

            If you right mouse click on oneDrive, and then click properties. Click the security tab. On both my laptops, there is a group that shows up as a bunch of numbers. Wait a minute or so, and it will resolve to HomeUsers (probably some sort of lookup table).
 On the change permissions line click Edit. Highlight HomeUsers. Both my wife's and my laptop showed only read and execute check. I checked Full control, for all subfolders. Since I did this everything has worked fine on the laptop.&nbsp;

<br />
It's so necessary for me now to change my "skype name".Not the regular first name and last name in profile setting. But it seems impossible.<br />
How can I do that?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)

                    I have an ASUS laptop running windows 8. I got an Oxc00000d error and then stuck in a loop of diagnosing my PC. Since I bought the computer with windows 8 installed, I have no boot CD and can not locate my serial number to do a wipe. &nbsp;I would try a registers
 scan, but I get the same error when trying to reboot in safe mode.
