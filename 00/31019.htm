<h2>            Microsoft Partner Gold ISV Pop Up</h2>
                    <p>I have this sketchy pop up that says I need to update my drivers and the only identification on it says Microsoft Partner Gold ISV which Im sure is BS. I cant seem to find its location to uninstall it. It appears to be multiplying my Chrome browser in task
 manager. How do I get rid of this junk? Thank for the help.</p>

            Hi Ryan, this is a scam!
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features, look for anything suspicious and uninstall it
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Alt + Del to open Task Manager. On the Startup tab, select anything suspicious and click Disable
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type msconfig and hit Enter. On the Processes Tab, check the box marked 'Hide All Misrosoft Services'. Then look through the remaining services for something Suspicious and uncheck it
<br />
<br />Restart your System
<br />
<br />If the problem persists, download the free version of MalwareBytes and run a scan with that:

    <title>Why is my Laptop Regular Freezing&#63; Event ID 10016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is my Laptop Regular Freezing&#63; Event ID 10016</h2>
                    Hello, I have been dealing with this freezing issue ever since I recieved my laptop, a thinkpad T490, a couple days ago. It randomly freezes. When it freezes, even the lights on the Razer Core X Chroma, which is usually hooked up to the laptop, freeze
 in place. After going to the event log every time this happens I think it's event 10016 that is causing this. An help on this issue would be greatly appreciated.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e22e158a-2ec1-4b7b-9f68-4eb5bc87f452?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e22e158a-2ec1-4b7b-9f68-4eb5bc87f452?upload=true" /></a>

            Hi limnakama,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Freezes are often due to bad hardware. As you said it is new, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer for the full functioning of the device. Would suggest you to ask Lenovo for warranty repairs.
<br />
<br />Also, Is there any other entry besides 10016 which you find related?

<h2>            Few SideWinder X4 Macro questions</h2>
                    Hello.
<div>I have few porblems with creating SideWinder Macros.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1.</div>
<div>In macro I need to do sth like that:</div>
<div>&nbsp;Hold "R Alt", Press "s", Release "R Alt".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know that holding key is when there is little square in place of time in IntelliType macro editor.</div>
<div>But How Can I enable that "square"? I can only type time into that box.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2.</div>
<div>I want do disable Macro for S6.</div>
<div>How to do it?</div>
<div>Now I'm&nbsp;assign&nbsp;macro with only 1ms wait time (No way to assign empty macro).</div>
<div>I would like to have status "Not assigned" next to S6 again.</div>
<div>I don't want to use "Disable"&nbsp;option&nbsp;as this will not&nbsp;re-enable&nbsp;key&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;after assigning new macro.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3.</div>
<div>Is there any easy way to make macro that will type text and press enter?</div>
<div>I know that I can just type that into macro box but that looks messy with all those delays.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance for answers.</div>

    <title>Joining a Windows 10 Pro machine to Azure AD without - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ethan.asi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Joining a Windows 10 Pro machine to Azure AD without linking&#47;registering an employees email address to that computer</h2>
                    <p>I have been researching for a few weeks now trying to figure out how to join Azure AD for new purchased machines when setting up the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two different scenarios that would be joining azure AD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Shipping a machine that has not been setup yet directly to an employee's location. I have to walk through step by step on how to configure settings, join the azure domain, and how to download a program or two. Is their a Microsoft process that I can put
 information into that knows that computer needs to join our azure domain? I do not wish to sign in with my credentials to join the azure domain each time we order a new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If my company has a windows 10 Home edition machine that we would want to add to our Azure AD, We purchase a windows 10 pro license and activate it under the settings. our next step is going into the settings to join an azure AD domain through a Microsoft
 account, however I do not wish to register my account on every computer in our environment. Is their a way to have this computer join azure AD with some sort of a token or activation process? The second issue to this scenario is after joining the azure AD
 with my credentials the local admin account is still active and I need to then go through the process of logging in and removing this account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would be the best process of joining my environments machines to our Azure AD network without having to register my account with each computer?</p>

            When joining a machine to Azure AD it requires an active Azure AD account to do this which be default is all.  So i would leave that setting and just have the users join their own machines to Azure.
<br />So you don't need to use your own account at all.
<br />
<br />"Users may join devices to Azure AD - This setting enables you to select the users who can join devices to Azure AD. The default is All."

<br />Does that answer your question?

<p>Currently Users do have the ability to join their devices to Azure, I am trying to get the experience in where they receive a laptop already joined to azure, and then the user only has to sign in to create their profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>letting users join azure still does not get rid of the problem of still having an administrative local account. Do you have any solutions that would also help with that issue?</p>

            OH i see.
<br />Yeah that right now is not possible.
<br />The thing with "joining" a machine to Azure AD is it's not the traditional sense of joining a machine to Active Directory on premise as you are aware.
<br />
<br />You could just use their credentials to join it before giving it to them, this will also make sure their profiles are setup for Window Mail etc. 
<br />Then have them reset their password after they get their machines.
<br />We would do that before offline domain join was a thing, too bad Azure doesn't have something like that.
<br />Sorry I could not be more help.
<br />
<br />Try positing this question in the Azure community.

<h2>            Qualcomm athros adapters Drivers are not compatible with Windows 10 version &#40;1903&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, After a big research i found out the the a lot of Qualcomm Athros Wireless Adpaters (Drivers) are not Compatible with Windows 10 (1903) and also (1809).</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the concerned adapters:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Qualcomm Atheros 802.11 a/b/g/n Dualband Wireless Network Module, Qualcomm Atheros AR1111, AR1111 WB-EG, AR2427, AR5002G, AR5002X, AR5004G, AR5004X, AR5005G, AR5005GS, AR5006, AR5006EG, AR5006EGS, AR5006EX, AR5006EXS, AR5006G, AR5006GS, AR5006X, AR5006XS, AR5007,
 AR5007EG, AR5007G, AR5008, AR5008WB-EG, AR5008X, AR5009, AR5B116, AR5B125, AR5B195, AR5B91, AR5B92, AR5B93, AR5B95, AR5B97, AR5BMD222, AR5BMD225, AR5BNFA222, AR5BWB222, AR5BWB225, AR9002WB, AR9002WB-1NG, AR9002WB-2NG, AR9227, AR922X, AR9280, AR9281, AR9283,
 AR9285, AR9287, AR928X, AR9380, AR9382, AR938x, AR9462, AR946x, AR9485, AR9485WB-EG, AR956x, AR9580, Osprey, Osprey Emulation, Osprey Simulation, QCA9565</li></ul>
<p>(They all fall into the same category and share the same driver) &amp; their driver's last version is realised oddly in 2017. Very old</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i searched the Web i Discovered that many people encountered issues with internet when updating to Win10 1809 or 1903, including me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus with Qualcomm Athros AR9002WB-1NG and as soon as installed the 1903 ver of Win10, i had an intermittent internet droupts, Wifi is connected normal and i the internet works fine for 20-50 second then cutts off randomly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is only encountered in 1903 and 1809 versions of Windows 10. IN 10240 the internet works just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can report this to windows, so they can release new drivers for Athros wifi adapters ??</p>
<p />

            It's the first I've seen of it that I recall.  But there are increasing reports of network disconnects after 1903 so I will inquire more about the adapter.

<p>I have a similar issue. I reached 65% and now I cannot load the savegame anymore. The game gets stuck with black screen and some background noise. Note the Xbox is not stuck, I can go back to home screen, however the game is stuck.</p>
<p>The issue is also discussed here:</p>

<p>But no one has a solution.</p>
<p>I have also contacted Square Enix technical support but no answer so far.</p>
<p>Cold reboot of Xbox does not help. I have not tried to re-install the game, but several people in other forums say it does not help.</p>
<p>Starting again the game from the beginning is not an acceptable solution, especially given that it might happen again.</p>

                    So I put my laptop in test mode to use an unsigned driver, to play an old video game. Problem is, it refuses to leave. The program I used is dseo13b.exe. It signs drivers in test mode. But when I select for it to leave, and restart, the computer stays
 in test mode. And I cannot load command prompt as the start menu won't work. The run box works, but I cannot run cmd as administrator. I'm pretty good with computers and I've tried everything. Nothing works. and test mode is slow as **** and I am sick of it.
 PLEASE HELP! My laptop is a budget PC with 4Gb RAM, 500Gb hard drive, Intel Celeron@2.41 Ghtz, and (newly installed) Windows 10 Home.

            No, it is Test Mode. Test Mode is a little known windows feature that allows you to use unsigned driver files. I put it in to play old DRM protected games that use SAFEDISK AND SECUROM. And it worked too, all I needed was the driver secdrv.sys to make
 them work, and a program to self sign the driver. problem is, the laptop refuses to leave "Test mode". luckily, I disabled many features of test mode through command prompt, and my laptop is working fine. and the old games still play. The Test Mode watermark
 is still there, but I can live with it. So I've successfully bypassed your not supporting old DRMs. And 'm pretty happy. Turns out, the slowness is just windows 10 being slow. (As usual). The only concern I have is that it might be more vulnerable to hackers.
 So problem solved, I'm fine leaving it in test mode. Its actually running pretty fast now.

<h2>            MICROSOFT VISUAL FOX PRO 9.0 VERY SLOW AND SLUGGISH ON WINDOWS 10 - &#34;ALWAYS BRINGING UP NOT RESPONDING ERROR&#34;</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 90px">
</p><p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a query in relation to Microsoft Visual foxpro 9.0 and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in the accounts department of a manufacturing company that is very conventional and orthodox.&nbsp; For the accounting system, they use Microsoft Visual foxpro 9.0 whereby invoices are raised, credit notes done, cheque payments posted in the system, payroll
 done, etc... and other accounting functions like journal entries and allocation adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This system was implemented in the company during Windows XP time and ever since then the company has been using it. I have been using the system for the last 3 years or so and it worked well on Windows 7. However, just recently, the company got me a new
 PC with Windows 10 professional and that is where my problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The accounting system (Microsoft visual fox pro) is very sluggish and slow with windows 10 bringing up the&nbsp;<strong>"not responding"
</strong>message each and every time I try to access any of the system features. For example, the box for cheque receipts takes an incredibly long time to come, box for viewing invoices takes a long time to come, file checker doesn't finish in the system and
 makes the system freeze, cancelling cheques freezes the system and all these items keeps coming with a message
<strong>"Microsoft visual fox pro - user ID: not responding" </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Now the problem with this sluggish Microsoft&nbsp;visual fox pro on Windows 10 is it wastes a lot of time and transactions don't get updated in all the tables due to the slowness&nbsp;of the PC running windows 10, meaning double entry transactions get saved
 in some tables and not others. But this system would otherwise work very well with Windows XP.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The RAM for my machine is 8GB and ROM is 1TB so it's not even small RAM that is the issue. The system works well on computers with even just 1GB of RAM</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can someone please suggest a solution to solve this slowness and "not responding" problems&nbsp; of Microsoft visual foxpro on Windows 10?</strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>I tried running the Windows file checker using the windows powershell but that didn't make any difference and the slowness of the programme&nbsp;is still apparent while running on WIndows 10 and the system is specifically slow on Windows 10 professional
 only and works well with earlier version. I tried compability troubleshooting but that didn't help. Someone please&nbsp;help me get a solution as this issue makes an adverse work performance on my side and negatively affects my career.</strong><br />
</p>

            Don't your BSODs say this in the bottom (this is what they look like here):<br />
<br />
*** STOP: 0x1000007e (0xc0000005, 0x804e83e8, 0xf78d6a6c, 0xf78d6768)<br />
<br />
*** SDActMon.sys - Address 0xf74394d4 base at 0xf7423000 DateStamp 0x50bde490<br />
<br />
Looking at all three with BlueScreenView and the Windows debugger, they all implicate SDActMon.sys, but I can't find out who/what that file belongs to - maybe somebody else will know.&nbsp; Maybe your Acronis - they have a TMActmon.sys...<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Anything changed there lately?<br />
<br />
If you search your system for SDActMon.sys and find it, you might be able to tell who/what it belongs to by right clicking it and checking through the Properties or by looking at the folder where it is (or those above it) and other files that might be around
 it.<br />
<br />
It could be some malware, so you when you find it, you can scan for that (don't know what you've used - and you should tell us what you've used)&nbsp; if you can upload it to a couple sites where they will scan it with 40+ reputable scanners (click to rescan the
 file if asked):<br />

            <p>The first reply from Sirinivas has alredy been followed step by step (in the last few days)...</p>
<p>ElderL...pointing to SDActMon.sys is helpful...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It belongs to MAX Spyware Detector... I searched the Registry and it appears three places...</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\SDActMon</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet003\Services\SDActMon</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SDActMon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used Malwarebytes... and followed instrucions in:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.selectrealsecurity.com/malware-removal-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.selectrealsecurity.com/malware-removal-guide</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MY BSOD lists the *** STOP (above) but NOT the cause *** SDActMon.sys ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've used this SD for years ... and wouldn't think SDActMon.sys is a problem...!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this the issue that is reflected in the MiniDumps...?</p>
<p>If so I can remove the program and see what happens...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just don't know how to read the minidumps...!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the mean time I will check out SUPERAntiSpyware...</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Support</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I use a really old IBM Intellistation Z Pro Type 9228 and I currently run Windows 7. Each time I try to install Windows 10, or Windows 7, it stops at the spinning circle. The only thing i modified from the original system is adding in a GTX 970. I have tried
 every online solution and I have also verified that the dual Xeon 5150s that I have can run Windows 10. I have also verified that Windows 10 can run on DDR2 systems and I have 8 GBs of DDR2.&nbsp; I have also set the BIOS back to its defaults to see if anything
 would happen. I have done everything I can and Windows 10 will still not run. Is there any possible way of me running Windows 10?</p>

            What's the capacity of the SSD?&nbsp; There are files/folders that Windows won't let you move away from the system drive, and you can't move program files because they're registered where they are, and the system wouldn't know where to find them if they were
 moved.&nbsp; You could, however, uninstall program files and reinstall them on the other drive.&nbsp;

<h3> balagopalkumar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not able to share my internet connection in Windows 10&#33;</h2>
                    <p>For the past few weeks I have been trying to share my internet connection via Ethernet from a dongle [net stick]. Windows 7 was a breeze. Just had to go to properties and share it. I am doing the same thing on windows 10 and it won't share. No error and
 no other problem. Just the internet is not being shared. Tried it on a friends laptop running windows 10 and the same happens with him too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have connected our two laptops using a Ethernet cable. </p>
<p>I have connected to the internet [the one I am using to post this question] using a dongle [a usb modem].</p>
<p>I went to network and sharing centre, clicked on the modem, went to properties, sharing tab and shared the internet to my Ethernet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And windows 10 is being utterly stubborn. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh ya.. my friend had WiDi on his laptop which surprisingly doesn't work with windows 10 and the intel website&nbsp;has cited it&nbsp;pretty clearly it won't.</p>

<p>Hey buddy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been fighting this issue for a while now.&nbsp; I have a windows 10 laptop with a realtek rtl8723be wifi lan card.&nbsp; I also used to use the sharing feature on windows 7 with no issues.&nbsp; Unfortunately my new laptop came preinstalled with win 10 and I
 can do no rollbacks of drivers for this card.&nbsp; The hostednetwork virtual adapter is not present even with "show hidden devices".&nbsp; This card can support hostednetwork because it did it on windows 7, but Microsoft has jacked something up.&nbsp; Right now I am sharing
 my FOXFI/PDANET via usb and I have internet file sharing enabled to my eithernet port sharing to my Linksys ea8300 router.&nbsp; The eithernet adapter shows that I have no internet connection, as well as the router showing no internet.&nbsp; There is internet but it
 is very intermittent, so something is trying to work.&nbsp; Any solutions on your end?</p>

<div>Issue is a bought Forza Motorsport 4, brand new and sealed, back in Spain. However, the Installation disc is unreadable and I cannot have half of the cars because of this. Now, I live in Kenya and I am not coming back
 for the whole year to replace the game. Is there any way that I can get the installation disc content in my computer and install it manually in the Xbox360 using a USB stick?</div>

    <title>windows 8.1 update error 80092004 code about kb4054566 &#40;NetFW - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pierrebezin  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 8.1 update error 80092004 code about kb4054566 &#40;NetFW 4.72&#41; - the solution &#58;</h2>
                    <p>it is linked to&nbsp;a previous KB4340558 update which contains 3 kbs : 4338415 4338419 and 433424.</p>
<p>The 4338419 often (no always)&nbsp;fails using WinUpdate when looking at my error log.</p>
<p>THE solution is to uninstall the KB4340558, then install the KB4054566 before reinstalling the KB4340558 using DiSM instead of WinUpdate.</p>
<p>Here is the KB4340558 : <a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4340558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4340558</a></p>
<p>and the KB4055466 : <a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4054566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4054566</a> </p>
<p>Create a folder (using windows explorer) C:\updatefix and&nbsp;the 4 subfolders C:\updatefix\expanded4xxxxxx&nbsp;(see the numbers below)</p>
<p>Download the whole&nbsp;KBs to C:\updatefix according your OS / 32-64 bit and rename them as below (mine is x64 so take care about the command lines to remove then add)</p>
<p>Extract each *.msu to the expanded file using the command prompt in Admin mode :</p>
<p>expand -f:* "C:\updatefix\kb4054566.msu" C:\updatefix\expanded4054566\<br />
expand -f:* "C:\updatefix\kb4338415.msu" C:\updatefix\expanded4338415\<br />
expand -f:* "C:\updatefix\kb4338419.msu" C:\updatefix\expanded4338419\<br />
expand -f:* "C:\updatefix\kb4338424.msu" C:\updatefix\expanded4338424\</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Remove the KB434558</strong> (using command prompt)&nbsp;in this order :</p>
<p>dism /online /remove-package /packagepath:C:\updatefix\expanded4338424\Windows8.1-KB4338424-x64.cab<br />
dism /online /remove-package /packagepath:C:\updatefix\expanded4338419\Windows8.1-KB4338419-x64.cab<br />
dism /online /remove-package /packagepath:C:\updatefix\expanded4338415\Windows8.1-KB4338415-x64.cab</p>
<p><strong>then the KB4054566 </strong>using :</p>
<p>dism /online /remove-package /packagepath:C:\updatefix\expanded4054566\Windows8.1-KB4054566-x64.cab</p>
<p><strong>Now you will be able to install it without problem using</strong> :</p>
<p>dism /online /add-package /packagepath:C:\updatefix\expanded4054566\Windows8.1-KB4054566-x64.cab</p>
<p><strong>Same way for the 3KBs of the KB4340558 </strong>:</p>
<p>dism /online /add-package /packagepath:C:\updatefix\expanded4338415\Windows8.1-KB4338415-x64.cab</p>
<p>dism /online /add-package /packagepath:C:\updatefix\expanded4338419\Windows8.1-KB4338419-x64.cab</p>
<p>dism /online /add-package /packagepath:C:\updatefix\expanded4338424\Windows8.1-KB4338424-x64.cab</p>
<p>You may be asked to reboot but i did all in one pass (say no at the end of each when asked), then I rebooted going back with WinUpdate to download the langage pack.</p>
<p>You won't&nbsp;see the results using the WinUpdate story but you will see them in installed updates.</p>
<p>If some have a better idea, share.</p>
<p>DiSM is better and allow to verify your system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">October 15th Update :</span></p>
KB4340558 (july) has been Updated by the KB4345592 (august) then by the KB4457920 (in september), so look at these first in your&nbsp;WinUpdate history, then in your error Log, in order&nbsp;to know exactly what to do next, meaning the right way.
<p>Unless you manually uninstall the buggy one you won't be able to install the KB4054566.</p>
<p>Above procedure&nbsp;is for&nbsp;the KB4340558 but&nbsp;you can do&nbsp;it the same way for the Updated ones if you are concerned&nbsp;because it prevent NetFrameWork 4.72 installation (probably a wrong file version and/or bad digital signature in the package).</p>
<p>After NetFW install you can reinstall your KB Update using DiSM then go back to WinUpdate.</p>
<p>Don't forget to Uninstall before to completely wipe the&nbsp;rights files using DiSM to have the&nbsp;corrects ones (version/level).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think/hope that&nbsp;MS staff is looking for a final answer in the next Rollup.</p>
<p>

            Thank you, these instructions worked for me. They definitely didn't work when I had downloaded the x86 package by mistake, but they did once I downloaded the correct x64 package for my system. Somehow I focused on the wrong detail when originally choosing
 which packages to download. Specifically, I mistakenly thought the x64 package was just for Windows Server not also for individual 8.1. Friendly heads up to anyone who sees this in the future. This has been plaguing me for half a year now, glad to have it
 resolved!

    <title>New Tech Problem Skype Support Respond Quickly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vanitaslover  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Tech Problem Skype Support Respond Quickly</h2>
                    <p>This is a brand new problem I found the night of dec 23 2017 between midnight, and five am mountain time. I woke, and checked my Skype for Web like I&nbsp; usually do as the first thing getting on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I got to Skype for web on internet explorer I found this on the page. The site was saying 'Skype is calling you' I saw a close button, and tried to click it wanting to get to&nbsp; skype for web officially before seeing what was up, and why I was getting
 a call from any member of Skype Team. I clicked the button, and guess what the page didn't respond at all. Both my internet, and computer are working very well. ..Yes I tried to reboot the computer as my first option to fix this. The problem is still there,
 and has continued to stay there this whole time even as I'm writing this it's still in effect. My account was signed in through my Hotmail email. Hotmail, and Outlook are the same place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had thought of emailing skype support team, and tried to get to where I could do it. That appartally isn't optional though, I still tried to find a way to get a hold of someone without using a phone. I had used google to get more direct links for skype
 support, and found "What is Live Chat' It was a&nbsp; article that led to info speaking of contact request text chat. I tried to follow the article, and all I found was 'Ask the community' I'd frowned at this.&nbsp; So here I am creating this 'ask a question' topic
 to get a hold of Skype Support as a back up way of emailing my new teck problem without being a bother.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help quickly 'cause of the fact Skype was calling me for unknown reasons. I found that skype calling me was unusual since I have done nothing among rule breaking, and&nbsp;my account is fine. I havn't changed anything in my settings either. The site was
 working just fine before I had fallen asleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know what today is, but please try to help me. I guess you can call this 'Bad Luck for the Holidays' or 'Holiday Surprise' sense of humor while being serious. For me it's currently Christmas eve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My skype account email address is the same&nbsp; as the email I'm using&nbsp; for this Microsoft account to create this 'ask a question' topic. I can't access skype at all on my end even if it's saying I'm online probally 'cause I clicked the check box for 'keep me
 signed in'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the newbies need practice, but I prefer one of the experts on the Skype Team to help me. In a medical situation I rather have the experts then the newbies too.</p>

    <title>Start menu icons pixelated and text blackened - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Start menu icons pixelated and text blackened</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my new pc running Windows 10 Home edition 64bits. The start menu displays over-pixelated icons and the fonts used in the app list is black on a dark grey background, making it impossible to read the names of the programs. The thing
 gets even worse when I scroll down in the app list.</p>
<p>It is the same about every native thing in Windows, including Edge and windows explorer. Even when I right-click on anything in a folder or on the taskbar. It is getting really frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything to fix this, from changing the accent color to updating my display drivers, but nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot of what I have :</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/896f37f5-bf3a-4a45-8108-6506ba51747c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/896f37f5-bf3a-4a45-8108-6506ba51747c" height="476" width="656" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what this can be and how to fix it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot ;-)</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Teo,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p><span><span>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I will certainly help you </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Have you installed any third party antivirus software?</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>This issue could have occurred due to conflict between third party applications.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us try the following steps, and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: If you have installed any third party security software, I suggest you to temporarily disable them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2</strong>: Let us run <strong>SFC scan </strong>and see if it&nbsp;brings any difference.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>sfc /scannow (System File Checker) </strong>command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press ‘Windows + X’ keys. </span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>‘Command Prompt (Admin)’</strong> to bring up an elevated command prompt.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note</strong><span>: Click <strong>‘Yes’</strong> if it prompts for permission.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. In the <strong>command prompt</strong> type in the following command and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know the status, we are glad to assist you further.</span></span></p>

    <title>Bitlocker has locked my computer and I can&#39;t even reset to factory - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bitlocker has locked my computer and I can&#39;t even reset to factory defaults</h2>
                    <p>My upgraded to Windows 10&nbsp;PC was working&nbsp;fine for months.&nbsp; Yesterday I&nbsp;started it up and as usual had plugged in USB for Bitlocker and suddenly&nbsp;It tells me to put in "correct" USB.&nbsp;It is the correct one, I only have one. Then it gives me option to type in
 key, which I had printed, yet identifier isn't even the same, so the Key is also incorrect.&nbsp; I'm ready to just set to factory defaults but can't even do that as it tells me "the drive where windows is installed is&nbsp;locked".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I'm at the point I just want to unlock, lose personal data and start over but I can't.</p>
<p>Basically I now have a boat anchor.&nbsp; HELP!</p>

    <title>Problem with Windows Media player 12. Playlists - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pfgray2008  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Windows Media player 12. Playlists </h2>
                    <span><span>
                    <span><span>
<p>I have a problem with windows media player 12 can anyone figure this riddle out? Here is the problem. When I try to edit or create a playlist the MP3 list disappears in the right column. More to the point very time I play a song it goes to unsaved playlist
 on the right hand side and the playlist I was working from is gone. I have to hit the arrow button back to find it. Then I can drag the song. So basically if you want to play the song prior to adding it to an open playlist you will lose your current list and
 have to&nbsp;use the arrow keys to return to the&nbsp;list you were intending the file to go to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its as if the unsaved playlist file is the default for everything. I can’t figure out why windows media player is doing this. I never had this problem with XP media 11.
 I think Microsoft screwed up again! Not venting its software however I'm new to windows 12 but no one at Dell or my office could figure this out so much for tech support.</p>

            <span>After a while, I finally got all my playlists to show...I feared that you guys might be right but lucky I found the cure.<br />
This seemed to lead to the solution:<br />
<br />
As a work around let’s try to run windows media player troubleshooter and check what is causing the problem. To do so, please follow the steps below:</span>
<p><span><span>Open the
</span></span><span><span>Windows</span>
</span><span><span>Media Player Settings troubleshooter by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong>
</span></span><span><span>button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type
</span></span><span><span><strong>troubleshooter</strong>
</span></span><span><span>, and then click
</span></span><span><span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>
</span></span><span><span>. Click
</span></span><span><span><strong>View all</strong>
</span></span><span><span>, and then click
</span></span><strong><span><span>Windows</span>
</span><span><span>Media Player Settings</span>
</span></strong><span><span>.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>This might not work for you. How all my items were accomplished was due to the fact that I had all the playlists
 previously created on another system (ie another WMP 11, etc...). So I imported these into my music (under my documents) and put them all in a folder labeled "playlists". I revised each of them to work with the directory of where I actually put each file by
 basically just creating the playlist over like you already know how. Once all the playlists are finalized into the appropriate folder and I troubleshooted, I think I like tried to play one of the playlists or simply a song&nbsp; (at that time I think my WMP was
 not currently in use) and&nbsp; a little black box popped up like when you try and play a mp3 file and it needs to open the application to play it Once you begin the song, you fill it out to go back to the library from the "now playing" session and I found all
 my playlists there. Sorry I can' remember better in detail as it was kind of a shock for real!....but at least you have a few controls to work with. Hopefully you can get it to work by trial and error and putting your playlists in the my music directory or
 other specified directory. <br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck guys!<br />
