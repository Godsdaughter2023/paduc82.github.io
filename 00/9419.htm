            Click the Skype menu &gt; Preferences &gt; Notifications, then check or uncheck all the listed notification types. 
<br />
<br />There could be a few reasons why you might not be receiving notifications. Try these things:
<br />
<br />    Notifications will stop when you sign out. Make sure you’re connected to the internet and signed in.
<br />
<br />    Verify that notifications are still turned on.
<br />
<br />    Make sure you’re using the latest version of Skype.
<br />If you’re still not receiving notifications from specific contacts after verifying they’re turned on and making sure you’re using the latest version of Skype it means that the sender is using an outdated version. Ask them to update to the latest version of Skype.

<h2>            International countries being able to call me</h2>
                    <p>I can see how to purchase Skype numbers etc but for my business I wan to have a number for each country (US, UK &amp; Australia) to call me on my mobile number, but they are charged local rates and I am paying the subscription to have those country numbers.
 When I go in looking I would have to buy by State etc, is there no generic US, UK etc number I could subscribe to that they can call me on to respond to my online adverts. I am In New Zealand, and use Skype to call their numbers, but if they want to call me
 back at this stage I can only give my NZ mobile number? Anyone have any suggestions/ideas that may assist me without costing a small fortune!?</p>
<p>Many thanks in anticipation</p>

    <title>Start Menu, Start Menu, Where are the Folders for the Start Menu&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oreveredrist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Menu, Start Menu, Where are the Folders for the Start Menu&#63;</h2>
                    From what I can see, it looks like there are three Start Menu folder locations in Windows 10:<br />
<br />
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu<br />
C:\Users\Default\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu<br />
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the one under Users\Default is what's given to a user automatically when the account is created. &nbsp;Ditto for the one under Users\[username] -- that would be for each user's personalized Start Menu. &nbsp;But, what's the one under ProgramData? &nbsp;Is it
 for items that should be on all user's Start Menu?<br />
<br />
Regardless, there should be some easy way to manage these Start Menus. &nbsp;Right now, I've got all three folders open in File Explorer and am trying to streamline the default spaghetti factory. &nbsp;But, theres a problem with doing that. &nbsp;According to those Start
 Menu folders, I should have a total of nine application shortcuts on my actual Start Menu under All Apps. &nbsp;Yet, I've got 36. &nbsp;Where are those sitting? &nbsp;Even if I add in the things I've pinned to the first page of the Start Menu, the numbers don't add up. &nbsp;Which,
 of course, brings up another problem: &nbsp;where is the "Start Menu" that holds those things sitting on the first page of the Start Menu?

</blockquote>
<p>Good luck with that!&nbsp; I have spent some time, so far unsuccessfully, trying to find where the extra manu items are coming from.&nbsp; I think they are all 'modern' apps, and so far the only suggestions I have seen involve uninstalling the app to remove it from
 the list - absurd!&nbsp; I have had a look in the registry, and may look again.&nbsp; Of course, MS knows how it all works, but doesn't seem to want us to have any control.</p>
<p>They may have brought back the start menu, but its crippled and unintuitive.&nbsp; As someone else asked, what will it (the menu) look like when a few program installers have added their junk all over the place?&nbsp; If the list just gets longer and longer (a problem
 i first noticed in Win-95), then perhaps enough people will complain and something will be done.&nbsp; The sad thing is that, since Win-95, through to Win 7, it has been possible to tame the mess that installers create - but now MS seem to want to stop us from
 doing so.</p>
<p>That's OK, as long as they make a good fist of organising it themselves - but so far I am not convinced.<br />

            I think one of the problems traditionally has been that people edit and prune the folder hierarchy that represents their start menu. I used to do it myself, heavily. However it leads to a problem, which is that program uninstallers do not then know where
 to find the .LNK files that they need to delete, so they all get left behind. Perhaps Microsoft has been trying to get away from this. But I wish they would tell us!!!

            <blockquote>I think one of the problems traditionally has been that people edit and prune the folder hierarchy that represents their start menu. I used to do it myself, heavily. However it leads to a problem, which is that program uninstallers
 do not then know where to find the .LNK files that they need to delete, so they all get left behind. Perhaps Microsoft has been trying to get away from this. But I wish they would tell us!!!
</blockquote>
<p>I have always accepted that aspect (start menu items get stranded when progs uninstalled) as a small price to pay for being able to organise things the way I like.&nbsp; Since i am in charge of the start menu, I can tidy up myself.&nbsp; I don't want a start menu
 that is 3 screens high!&nbsp; I'm afraid I don't get the impression that MS is listening.<br />

If what you actually are asking is to have the old contacts window back, the answer is .... no.</p>
<p>Microsoft has designed a new contacts interface called People.</p>
<p>Both Outlook.com and Hotmail.com users are to use the same People interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you mean you want to switch back to hotmail, it is possible, PROVIDED if you have been using your existing hotmail address and password to sign into outlook.com.</p>
<p>If yes, very simple steps....</p>
<p>Open outlook.com &gt; top right, next to your name, click the Gear icon&nbsp; click Switch back to Hotmail &gt; click Skip &gt; you are back to Hotmail.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the method above will not work if you were switched to outlook.com automatcically, or if you setup a new outlook account, or rename an account.</p>

            You may be seeing Outlook.com because your account was automatically upgraded from Hotmail. Hotmail customers who were upgraded automatically to Outlook.com were notified in advance via email.<br />
<br />
Why was my account chosen to be upgraded automatically?<br />
<br />
When we launched Outlook.com preview, we shared plans to eventually upgrade all Hotmail customers to Outlook.com. To help ensure a smooth transition, the upgrade will be gradual. Your upgrade is part of the process.<br />
<br />
<b>Can I switch back to Hotmail?</b><br />
<br />
If you were automatically upgraded to Outlook.com, the option to switch back to Hotmail isn't available.<br />
<br />
To see if you have the option to switch back, check for the Switch back to Hotmail link in Outlook.com. Go here for steps on how to check for the link.<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/switch-back-hotmail<br />
<br />
For more information about the automatic upgrade and Outlook.com please click here.<br />

<br />
<br />
Some accounts that are "co-branded" are not currently eligible to be upgraded to Outlook.com. This includes accounts that were offered through companies like Bell Canada and Telstra, as well as some MSN accounts.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This will be addressed soon, so please be patient. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;If you want to try it out, then I suggest creating a new email address and temporarily forwarding your old mail to the new inbox. But, keep in mind that you won't be able to "merge" these accounts later. &nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Renata,</p>
<p><span>Apparently, users who were upgraded automatically to Outlook.com were sent notification messages concerning the upcoming upgrade. Accounts that were automatically upgraded do not have the option
 to switch back to Hotmail.</span></p>
<p>You can check the option to switch back by following the steps below:</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span> </span>
</span></span>Sign in to Outlook</p>
<p>2. Click the Options icon, then click ‘<b><i>Switch back to Hotmail’</i></b>
</p>
<p>If you didn’t see this option
<b><i>‘Switch back to Hotmail</i></b>’, switching back to Hotmail isn’t available for your account.</p>
<p><span>All Hotmail users will be upgraded to Outlook.com and plans were shared when Outlook.com preview was launched.<span>
</span>To ensure a smooth transition for all Hotmail customers, the upgrade will be gradual. This is the start of that upgrade process.</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards.</span></p>

<p>Hi Jean,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As the same issue may have different root causes, we can focus on this thread to troubleshoot it separately.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To better understand the situation, I’d like to confirm the following things:<br />
1. Is this an intermittent issue for all the users in the plans? That’s to say sometimes the function works well but sometimes users will get the error message.<br />
2. Is the issue only related to all existing plans or a specific plan? If you create a test plan, can’t you post comment after a while?<br />
3. Do other features/functions work well in the plan? <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Moreover, we need to collect some trace logs and tenant information for further investigation. I have sent you a private message to collect the information. You can find the message via the URL
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why you are still seeing the word "demo" in your Office applications is because it was not uninstalled correctly or properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove all traces of the Office application and make sure your new Office 2016 is installed properly, you can refer to

    <title>Where is this command in PP 2016&#63;&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ichamandy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is this command in PP 2016&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I only recently upgraded to Office 365, 2016 version because I knew MS would take out a whole bunch of useful commands and add in a whole bunch of useless one. &nbsp;MS did not disappoint, as it hasn't for the 30 years I have been using its monopoly products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to add the increase space and decrease space icons (paragraph space?) to my ruler through the customize command. &nbsp;I used them ALL THE TIME to increase/decrease the space between blocks of text. &nbsp;It seems MS, in its infinite wisdom, has decided to
 remove these commands after them being a staple of the program for a couple of decades. &nbsp;If they are there, I can't find them (they used to be easy to find). &nbsp;My only alternative, if they are removed, is to go to the end of each block of text and manually,
 tediously go the paragraph formatting command and increase the spacing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a line spacing command in the Home tab (line spacing 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, etc.). This is not the same as the increase and decrease the space between points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if these commands exist in Word 2016 and ,if they do, where they are???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

<p>I completely understand what you're looking for... They're the buttons that Increase/Decrease Space Between Paragraphs [not Line Spacing]. In 2011 &amp; prior they were an integral part of the Formatting Toolbar &amp; could be added to other toolbars as well:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1fd6c46-381d-48b9-8829-d983fe4f2a3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1fd6c46-381d-48b9-8829-d983fe4f2a3d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>They were associated with the Spacing Before/After values in the <strong>Format&gt; Paragraph</strong> dialog. However, there are no equivalents provided in PowerPoint 2016. The down side of using those buttons, though, is that they were preset to 6 point increments,
 whereas using the dialog window allows for specifying the exact amount of space as any value as precise as hundredths of a point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless there is sufficient demand I doubt that they will be returned to PowerPoint 2016 due to that lack of flexibility. The only suggestion I can offer is to use the keyboard shortcut [<strong>Option+Command+M</strong>] to more quickly access the Format
 Paragraph dialog box. I understand what Jim is referring you to, but don't see how it can address your need due to the variability you seem to want.</p>

<p>Yeah, I was involved in the initial introduction of the Mac in this region :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not arguing with you, nor am I trying to change your mind or defend what Microsoft does or does not do :-), but I do know that Microsoft does employ extensive metrics &amp; analytics in this regard. The simple fact, though, is that one man's trash is another
 man's treasure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not surprised if this particular feature ranks very low on the usage scale... Less experienced users don't understand spacing fundamentals &amp; rely solely on banging the return key to create "space between paragraphs", while more experienced users typically
 are not content to accept the preset 6 point increments. As a result, it's quite likely that the data shows very little usage for those specific buttons. Oddly enough, they are still available in Word, though.</p>

    <title>Formatting trouble in plain text content control &#47; How to have - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthew_pichu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formatting trouble in plain text content control &#47; How to have synced rich text controls</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been working on a questionnaire where we want the user to be able to enter data into content controls and have the formatting be uniform throughout the form. We also needed the restrict the editing allowed to just these specific fields. I've placed
 rich text content controls in the document and have restricted editing to be Read only with the content controls as exceptions to the restriction.&nbsp;<br />
We also only want a few styles to be used in these fields so I've restricted the formatting styles to only a few options and have set the properties of the content control to format to one of the approved styles. After setting the copy/paste settings to have
 data pasted from other programs as Plain text only the form works great. The old source formatting is stripped and the desired formatting is applied to whatever is pasted into the content controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's just one problem: We have a section for a reference number which needs to show up at the top of each page. I'd like it to behave like the other content controls but to have whatever is entered into the first field to show up in the same fields at
 the top of each page. I've gone to Quick Parts --&gt; doc properties and inserted a Category control which I then placed into the header section. I applied the default formatting and it works great. Whenever anything is typed into this field it shows up, properly
 formatted, on all the other pages. The one problem is that our users would like to be able to copy/paste into this section to avoid making errors when entering the reference number. Despite my default copy/paste settings (which i've instructed the users to
 replicate) whenever I paste into the Category field it pastes as source formatting (HTML). Trying to merge formatting after pasting doesn't work either ONLY if restricted editing is turned on. If restricted editing isn't enabled the user can copy/paste and
 then merge formatting and it works well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is due to the fact that the category control I inserted is a plain text control as I haven't had this problem when I paste into rich text controls. Something about restricting editing prevents any formatting changes in a plain text field.
 I was wondering how to resolve this issue (other than just manually typing the values into the field).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, is there a way to either insert a quick part category that has rich text properties? Or is there a way to sync individual rich text content controls so that they match when changes are made to one? We're using Microsoft Word 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much!</p>

            <p>It's possible that this behavior -- especially the part about ignoring the paste option setting -- is "unintended" (a.k.a. "a bug"). I haven't tried to reproduce it in Word 2013 or 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Office 2010 reached the end of mainstream support last year (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle?p1=13615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle?p1=13615</a>) and is now in extended support,
 the only updates Microsoft will make to that version are for security issues. Unless you can find a usable workaround, you're stuck with what you have now until your group receives a later version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want me to investigate whether the later versions have fixed the problem, you can send a copy of the questionnaire and a sample document from which to copy the formatted reference number, along with a screen shot or description of the exact settings
 in your Options &gt; Advanced dialog. (The documents don't have to have any confidential or identifiable information, as long as they still demonstrate the problem on your PC.) You can find my email address at

<p>Hi, I would greatly appreciate some help. I have successfully made a full install of Windows 7 62bit Home Premium on my desktop which previously ran Vista.&nbsp; I am now 1 by 1 trying to get my software to work. I uninstalled the previous version of Device Center
 but there must still be some traces of it on my PC.&nbsp; Shortly after drvupdate-amd64 starts to run I get an error message in a dialogue box headed "Windows Mobile Device Center Driver Update" as follows:</p>

<p>Greetings&nbsp;Zing8, welcome to the Windows Phone forums!</p>
<p>Please note that there are some incompatibilities between&nbsp;Outlook 2010 64bit and WMDC 64bit programs that will prevent you from using both on a 64bit installation of Windows 7 (see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980513/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB980513</a>
 for more info).&nbsp;&nbsp;After you already have Office 2010 64bit installed, it is easiest to simply install the 32bit version of WMDC (instead of the 64bit version) to resolve the incompatability.</p>
<p>If that fails to work as well, and you have tried Laura's step-by-step above, but still get the same error message, then clearly some&nbsp;aspect of the Vista installation of WMDC is still around, and is interferring with your intention of installing the latest
 version of WMDC. This infers that you did a standard "upgrade" from Vista, instead of a clean installation of Windows 7 (or what Microsoft calls a Custom/Advanced Installation).&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is correct, you may need to re-install the OS using a
<strong>Clean (Custom) Installation</strong>.&nbsp; This will absolutely get rid of all lingering traces of your old setup<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">by formatting the drive you want to upgrade</span> as part of the installation process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, this will also delete all of your personal data and programs, so make sure you backup all of your personal data first, and make sure you have all the installation disks or installation files handy to install your favorite programs, then go here
 to see how to do a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/help/upgrading-from-windows-xp-to-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Clean (Custom) Installation</strong></a>&nbsp;(using tab #3)<strong> </strong>
where the <strong>Clean (Custom) Install</strong> process begins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps 1 &amp; 2 deal with confirming your PC is&nbsp;capable of running&nbsp;Windows 7, and<strong>backing your data up prior to installation</strong> (using tab #2).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully Laura's process to uninstall the device driver&nbsp;will work.&nbsp; If not, and the downgrade to 32bit WMDC&nbsp;doesn't suffice to solve your problems either,&nbsp;it may mean that you have no choice but to re-install using the Clean&nbsp;Install process.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Google Chrome Not supported With Bing Ads&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been on the phone to a BingAds representative, querying some figures within my BingAds account.&nbsp; When I select "last month" option (1st July - 31st July)&nbsp;from the drop-down menu it shows me one set of data, however when I select&nbsp;the&nbsp;"custom range"
 option from the drop-down menu, select the exact same date range 1st July - 31st July, it shows me another set of data, very confusing and wholly inaccurate, which one do I trust??&nbsp; The Rep in question proceeded to say that Google Chrome is not supported,
 and that you should "only use Internet Explorer" when using BingAds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At no point have I been told not to use Google chrome as this reports inaccurate data. I have potentially made hundreds of changes within the account based on "Google Chrome&nbsp;Figures" which are essentially flawed/fictional, and only to be told that the browser
 is not supported, how does this help?? More importantly why is there not a notification at the top of the browser window telling me this when I log in??</p>

    <title>SOLVED&#58; Outlook 2007 with Windows 10&#58; Testing Connections - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonm1983  say:</h3>
<h2>            SOLVED&#58; Outlook 2007 with Windows 10&#58; Testing Connections Works BUT Emails Don&#39;t Send</h2>
                    <p>Weird problem, here are the details:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Software:</strong></p>
<p>- Windows 10, up to date.</p>
<p>- Office 2007 Enterprise Edition with SP3 installed.</p>
<p>- Avast Antivirus Free 2015</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Scenario &amp; Problem:</strong></p>
<p>- Outlook has three accounts added to it using gmail servers for two of them and the third has an independent server.</p>
<p>- Pop receiving works perfectly.</p>
<p>- SMTP sending does not work.</p>
<p>- The above is in spite of the fact that when testing the connections, test messages send and receive without issue.</p>
<p>- Changing ports gives various different Outlook error messages, but the main one when the settings are correct (and work in a different email client on the same computer) is,
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-style: italic">"(0x800CCC13): ‘Cannot connect to the network. Verify your network connection or modem’"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Summary of fault finding:</strong></p>
<p>- Add different email addresses with different servers and the same problem repeats itself so it is not unique to the gmail servers.</p>
<p>- Tried different ports as suggested by Google; 465 SSL, 587 SSL, 25 SSL to no avail.</p>
<p>- Disable all antivirus (Avast 2015 Free edition) and Firewall. Add exceptions for Outlook in Firewall too and for all above mentioned ports.</p>
<p>- Tried three different internet connections at three different houses to rule this out as the cause; problem persists no matter which connection is used.</p>
<p>- Installed SP3 for Office, problem persists afterwards.</p>
<p>- Installed a different email client, Mozilla Thunderbird and entered same email settings to test and it worked perfectly, so the email/gmail settings are definitely correct.</p>
<p>- Windows 10, Office 2007 and Avast are all fresh installs and Outlook is using a fresh PST file (on Monday 3rd August) and a message was successfully sent.</p>
<p>- The problem only started after the internet router was reset on Thursday, although this now appears not to be the problem after trying various different internet connections elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Summary of conclusions/assumptions:</strong></p>
<p>- It is NOT the internet connection.</p>
<p>- It is NOT the email/gmail settings.</p>
<p>- It is NOT the firewall.</p>
<p>- It is NOT Avast.</p>
<p>- It must be related to Outlook itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have ascertained for certain that the error either lies with Outlook itself, or with Outlook's connections.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is worth mentioning that the setup DID successfully send an email when it was first installed but now no longer does.</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(PS. Oddly, the selection criteria beneath this message did not allow me to select, "Windows 10", hence this is marked as Other / unknown system.</p>

            <p>Many thanks Hal,</p>
<p>Subsequent to my original posting, I was able to fix the issue. Just logged in here to post that I have managed to fix it - and the fix I used is as described on the link you posted too.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>1. Ensure Office 2007 has Service Pack 3 applied/installed/updated.</p>
<p>2. Run an elevated command prompt (i.e. with administrator privileges).</p>
<p>3. type:</p>
<p>and press enter.</p>
<p>4. allow the scan to complete, it will likely find an error and repair it.</p>
<p>5. Restart the computer.</p>
<p>6. Check Outlook 2007, it should now send emails properly.</p>

            Is it possible the window is "off screen"?&nbsp; When Word is open but out of site, right click on the task bar and select "cascade windows".

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<b>Starting point when Word does something unexpected</b>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word, any version, go to Tools and then Options and study all the settings on all the tabs. You may even find some settings that
 you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you're wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables is suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each
 time the answer was, "I'd use a Word table." By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>

<p>Recently a couple readers wrote to me with very similar problems. One was having trouble getting Internet Explorer to run; the other, Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>In other words, a couple of Windows' own built-in tools were broken. (Note to Microsoft: That should
<em><span>not </span></em>happen. Come on!)</p>
<p>Usually, for situations like these, I recommend an end-run around the problem. Internet Explorer won't work? Install Firefox or Chrome and use that instead. Can't load Windows Explorer? Switch to any number of even better
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/212334/windows_explorer_explained_choosing_a_replacement.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Explorer replacements</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn't really solve the problem. If you're hoping to fix your broken tool, you'll need to do a little trouble shooting. To start, I recommend switching to (or creating) another user account, then seeing if Explorer runs
 properly. If it does, you've narrowed down the problem significantly (and should consider "moving" to a new user account permanently). If not, well, back to square one.</p>
<p>Either way, it's a simple method of figuring out how deeply rooted into Windows the problem is. And that will help considerably as you Google-search for an actual fix (assuming there is one--sometimes these things can be resolved only

<p>Also uninstall Office Trial editions and any other Office-related programs such as "Office Activation Assistant" and any Office Viewer programs from the Programs applet in Control Panel. But you don't have to
 uninstall Office Starter if you have it. Then make sure to reboot TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo” at play here. We do it because it works!) after completing repair or uninstall.</p>

<h2>            Hiding contacts</h2>
                    Hi, I used to be able to hide who could see the number of my contacts. Skype kept asking me to "upgrade" so I did and hated the new look but Skype.exe was still on my system I run Windows 7 and it was the old version. However now I only have the choice
 of everyone or contacts seeing my contacts. They have forced us to be more open but is there any way I can as before hide the number of contacts and my contacts. My Skype version is 7.39.0.102

    <title>All my contacts where showing up as offline and thus I couldn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashradford  say:</h3>
<h2>            All my contacts where showing up as offline and thus I couldn&#39;t call nor answer a contact who was waiting-&#40;see below for more details&#41;</h2>
                    <p>All my contacts where showing up as offline and thus I couldn't call nor answer a contact who was waiting.</p>
<p>Then when I went into email, (I had in the interim updated my version of Skype) that contact came up as calling, but there was a message about a google chrome extension and then an App I had to ad. Anyway without noting too much of the detail around that,
 as I didn't want to keep the person waiting any longer, I added all of that and I could accept the call, but afterward in my skype account (accessible through icon on desktop) there is no record of the call. But there is a vertical rectangluar window for skype
 on the right side of my hotmail inbox page. This features none of my old skype contacts but some new ones. In summary, how do I now access a functioning version of Skype? It now appears to be more directly linked to hotmail/outlook and the old icon and contacts
 no longer seem accessible or functional.<br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Ashley</p>

<p><span><span>Good Day!
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further troubleshooting, kindly follow the steps below:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Make sure that Skype is no longer running. Quit Skype.</span></span></li><li><span><span>On your keyboard, press the Windows key + R key. Then, the run windows will appear.</span></span></li><li><span><span>On the run window, type in
<strong>%appdata%\Skype</strong> and hit enter. Look for a file named <strong>shared or shared.xml</strong> and delete it.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Open the folder that has your Skype name.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Locate and delete the
<strong>config or config.xml</strong> </span></span></li><li><span><span>Open Control Panel and look for Internet Options.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Go to the advanced tab and select Reset.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Put a check mark under "Delete Personal Settings", then hit okay and enter.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Close it when prompted.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Restart Skype.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, kindly reply to this thread.
</span></span></p>

<h2>            wifi can&#39;t connect over static IP&#8207;</h2>
                    
<p><span>recently bought a Lumia 535 (dual sim) as soon as it was launched,</span></p>
<div>in my office all the devices are required to use static IP, hence even I tried to do so but the phone would not connect to the router with a static IP, tried all sorts of troubleshooting, even the network admin of my office came to my rescue but the problem
 still remains, we checked if the phone connects with a dynamic one....yes it does..</div>
<div>So we concluded that it was something wrong with the cell phone, so I went to the Priority dealer from where I got it, of course he was a nice guy after hearing my problem doing some sort of setting and troubleshooting from his end he immediately replaced
 it with a new one. Now to my horror,<span>&nbsp;</span><span>even</span><span>&nbsp;this one has the same problem, now to conclude this might be a bug in the latest DENIM OS as my Lumia 925 running CYAN works flawlessly with the specified static IP settings on the same
 network in my office.</span></div>
<div><span>please help me sort out this problem or if its a bug then can any&nbsp;</span>Microsoft<span>&nbsp;engineer detect this one and fix it.</span></div>

<p>Cyan is currently the latest official release, if you have Denim then you have a developer preview which is made available for deverlopers to make necessary adaptations to their software in time for the release; it also serves as a public "Beta Test".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your first phone was also running Denim then there was nothing wrong with it and the "Priority Dealer" was wrong to issue a replacement under warranty, the simple fact is that until the official public release of Denim is made then you install that software
 at your own risk, as you must have accepted during the set-up process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it works under Cyan, run your phone under Cyan and then you have the right to complain to Microsoft about errors. As things stand, you are running a software version not approved for normal public use and so any bugs you pick up need to be reported through
 the Developer Preview programmes.</p>

<p>The 730, 735 and 535 all run Denim from out of the box, so developer preview has got absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe it is a matter of country/region specific firmware versions, see for example

<p>appreciate your efforts, but that thread which you suggested have different issue, actually in that thread there the guy having problem doesn't have the option for the static IP but in LUMIA 535 in my case it has the options to activate static IP but as
 soon as you turn on the settings for static IP it displays an error message "unable to connect to the network".</p>

            I have had the same problem since March 2, 2018. 2 Lumia 820s and a Lumia 925 all give the 80070020 error code when I try to download any app. All running 8.1. Date and time are all good on each phone. Also tried soft reset, hard reset (factory), and windows
 recovery tool. Problem persists. Made sure Microsoft account was synced up as well. Is the store officially unsupported now? Or maybe undergoing service maintenance? All answers on here seem redundant, anybody got some real insight??

            Try temporarily setting your date to 3 Dec 2017, do Store updates, then set date back to correct date. Microsoft seem to have changed something on their end which is stopping things from working correctly when phone date is set correctly. Perhaps someone
 from Microsoft could explain why this has been done!

<p>Hi Gerald Mal, The store returns error 80070020 when the date and time is correct for the last day or more, so needs a fix from microsoft. There is a workaround which is to set the WRONG date - yesterday I got the store to download some apps I wanted, only
 by setting the date back 3 months to 3rd December 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft are looking to resolve the underlying issue as the store for Windows Phone 8.1 should be supported (according to the FAQ about the end of support for Windows Phone 8.1) until July this year.</p>
        </p>

            A fix is certainly in order, as I still cannot download certain paid apps with either the rollback date or current date. Help!

    <title>How can I delete my Hotmail account without being charged the &#36;100 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikaelalevasseur  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I delete my Hotmail account without being charged the &#36;100 service fee&#63;</h2>
                    I have had a Hotmail account for almost 10 years, and during that time I experienced no problems. Ever since Hotmail switched over to Outlook, my account has been hacked twice. The second hacking happened today, and as a result I want to deactivate my
 Hotmail account completely. I was unable to do so online, so I tried calling the Help center. The manager at the help center that I spoke to was not helpful at all, and informed me that I would be charged a $99.99 service fee in order to deactivate my free
 Hotmail account.&nbsp;I am a student paying my way through university, and I find it completely appalling that a company as large and successful as Microsoft could expect such a ridiculous fee for a simple service.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hacker spammed my entire contact list, including
 important work related contacts who will be extremely inconvenienced by the spam. It's extremely embarrassing and inconvenience and I just want the account deleted. I would appreciate any feedback or help.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
Mikaela&nbsp;
