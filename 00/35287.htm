                    <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have just encountered this error recently, after a reload of windows (keeping all files) i find that i cant log into any windows/xbox service from my computer. Eg store or games downloaded from the store that require a microsoft login. if i try i am
 met with&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know the accounts are working fine cause i can still log into them from the microsoft website and xbox website (probly the same site really)</p>
<p>
</p><p>has any one seen this issue before. I have tryed many different options here from deleting accounts and email accounts from the computer and removing the PC from said accounts from the web site with no luck. I have also tryed to reset the PC again keeping
 folders and files with no change either. little stuck on what to do next and not the keenest on removing everything from the drive and reinstalling.</p>
<p>

<p>I have this issue too, my 'delay update till' date came up yesterday, after the update I couldn't get past the windows start up screen with the white dots so I was forced to do a reset.</p>
<p>After the reset I thought everything was fine, until I tried to add more than one email to the mail app resulting in the same message. I found out that the dolby access app was broken asking me to reset it every time I opened it (I did, it made no difference).
 I tried </p>
<p>resetting the store cache, resetting the store app, troubleshooting, sfc/scannow, uninstalling and reinstalling apps through the powershell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has been no progress so far but I thought posting what I've already tried (which was pretty much all the results of searching for this error via google) might save a few posts repeating these solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder, did you update or reset recently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope we can fix this soon!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80c9827c-a163-4650-b1a9-a0185c962c8b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80c9827c-a163-4650-b1a9-a0185c962c8b?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>I have the same problem here. I suspect that it has something to do with the ''log to this app only'' or something like that when you add an email account. I always answer no. A Yes would mean that I would be logged on the web with my MS account which I
 don't need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to add a Google and Videotron account no problems. I tried to ''manage'' the corrupted MS email account I tried to create but it brings me to the Microsoft web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am forced to read my emails using MS web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will reload my image and let you know.</p>

<p>Did more tests after reloading my image of a fresh rebuild.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to create my Outlook email account by logging on to MS profile (instead of ''just sign in to this app'' which I normally select) I get the same error in both ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest files from Windows Update.</p>
<p>I have Cortana and XBox desabled. All other settings are by default.<br />
</p>
<p>The other thing I could think of is that I had to replace my hard drive and there is no more Reserved partition like there was on my hard drive that contained the Free Upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp;I re-entered my product key number (Settings/Update &amp; Security/Activation/Change
 product key) but same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope MS techs will find a simple solution...like changing a value in the registry ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maby is't a function removed in the last update ?</p>

<p>I also searched the other day and foud a few discussions with this email app problem. Still not working for me so I use my phone instead or logon to outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can say that before I replaced my HDD, the email was working fine. Like if the license was looking for a partition on my old HDD. Checked yesterday and could not validate my license. Checked again today and my license is valid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But still getting the error when creating a outlook email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem could be since the last windows10 update we got recently. I did my image right after so I can't say for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>gmail is also an option for me.</p>

    <title>no audio from headphone jack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> north pole woodcrafts wild bird alaska  say:</h3>
<h2>            no audio from headphone jack</h2>
                    All settings in windows are set correct for the headphone jack. &nbsp;I can hear the "test" tone clearly through the headphones. But when I play a CD or video there is no audio through the headphones. &nbsp;The headphones did work up until a recent windows update.
 &nbsp;After the update the headphones stopped working. &nbsp;The audio is also&nbsp;intermittent. The audio will drop out for 5 to 10 seconds and this started after the Windows update.
<div>When I plug the headphone jack in it no longer mutes the onboard speakers but it does reduce the&nbsp;volume&nbsp;of the computer speakers.</div>

            I've tried all these options you mentioned. &nbsp;It still does not work. &nbsp;Like I said, it was working fine until I did a Windows update a couple of weeks ago. &nbsp;
<div>As I said, if I TEST the headphones I can clearly hear the test tone in both right and left channels.&nbsp;</div>
<div>But a music CD or DVD or You Tube video has no audio through the headphones.</div>
<div>According to Windows 8 my jack is "working".</div>
<div><br />
<div>I now can hear computer generated sounds through the headphone....but still no audio when I play a CD, Video Movie or a video from YouTube.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My computer is a Dell Inspiron 3520 runiing Win8 64bit</div>

    <title>Thieves Guild Quest glitch, help&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fortified brad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Thieves Guild Quest glitch, help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>It's already known and noted. Im just curious if anyone knows anyway around it so I can get the last couple of achievements...<br />
Its the quest Scoundrel's Folly. -SPOILER ALERT- When I went to shadow that guy, he teleported, and I went to the area I was suppose to go to but he wasnt there and the map marker is currently glitching out.
<br />
&lt;BR&gt;<br />
&lt;BR&gt;<br />
This is what UESP noted it as: "<span>Sometimes after leaving the Winking Skeever Gulum-Ei will disappear. The quest objective marker shows his location as through the wall of the city, although leaving the city puts the marker on a small door between the trading
 company and the lighthouse that leads back into Solitude."<br />
&lt;BR&gt;<br />
&lt;BR&gt;<br />
They dont have any mention of how to avoid or get around it on the site. Help! Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>You can try the export to PC if you have the PC version of the game, then use the console to advance the quest to the correct stage or summon Gallum to the right area. &nbsp;You can google search how to do it, there were some people in the Bethesda forums who
 were doing this for people who had gamebreaker errors like this. &nbsp;Other than that I am afraid this is a gamebreaker.</p>

<p>Here's a you tube clip that i used to get past the glitch. Works like a charm and very easy to do. Hope it helps. &nbsp;make sure you are at the confront gulum-ei part and not the shadow part. if you can't shadow him,﻿ get into the east empire warehouse and go
 to the secret room Brinewater grotto and it should update the quest from shadow to confront. once you get it to confront, try what this video suggests. &nbsp;[View:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKXiE4DGMZk]</p>

<h3> sebiswag  say:</h3>
<h2>            Energy Plan keeps resetting</h2>
                    <p>I'm using an ASUS UX 303 LN with Windows 10 64bit (newest update) an an i7 Intel, my problem is folowing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made an energy saving plan for battery saving. In this plan, I've set all the CPU, GPU, etc. settings to minimum.
</p>
<p>My problem: the settings keep resetting every couple hours to "maximum perfomance". This is awful! I changed all the settings of this "maximum performance" plan to battery saving, but even they keep resetting!!! Settings contain minimum CPU energy (keeps
 resetting to 100%), GPU (keeps resetting to maximum performance) or fan (keeps resetting to active instead of a quiet passive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It'**** **** enoying... pls help </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you are encountering <strong>issues with your Power settings in Windows 10</strong>. We suggest running the
<strong>Power troubleshooter</strong> to find and fix problems with your Power saving plan. To do this simply follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>On the <strong>Cortana search box</strong>, type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>
and click the <strong>first option</strong>.</li><li>Then click on <strong>System and Security</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Power</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the steps above, restart your computer and set your preferred power plan settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further questions, please let us know.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started the troubleshooter, which found and solved several problems. The "balanced" energy plan was selected and kept after an restart.</p>
<p>But again, after an hour of working, the plan sets itself to "maximum performance".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem still isn't solved...</p>

<h2>            How do i reset&#47;strip a folder of all permissions settings&#63;</h2>
                    I have an external hard drive that has lots of media. video and music. &nbsp;In an attempt to secure my adult stuff from my 12 year old and while trying to watch a movie from different machines, i changed the permissions. &nbsp;Now, they are all mixed up and i am
 unable to access some files on this machine, and other files on that machine. &nbsp;When i change a folders permissions, it doesnt work for everything in the folder. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would just like to return all of the permissions to whatever the default settings were.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I do this..? &nbsp;</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the steps to modify ownership and permissions of folders and files:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the file or folder, click
<strong><span>Properties</span></strong>, and then click the
<strong><span>Security</span></strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong><span>Advanced</span></strong>, and then click the
<strong><span>Owner</span></strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong><span>Edit</span></strong>, and then do one of the following:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change the owner to a user or group that is not listed, click
<strong><span>Other users and groups </span>
</strong>and, in <strong><span>Enter the object name to select (examples)</span></strong>, type the name of the user or group, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change the owner to a user or group that is listed, in the
<strong><span>Change owner to</span></strong> box, click the new owner.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to take ownership of the contents of the folder, select the
<strong><span>Replace owner on sub containers and objects</span></strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Yes</span></strong> when you receive the following message:
</span></p>
<p><em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You do not have permission to read the contents of directory folder name. Do you want to replace the directory permissions with permissions granting you
 Full Control?</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All permissions will be replaced if you click
<b>Yes</b>.</span></em><i><span><br />
</span></i><span><br />
<strong><span>Note: </span></strong><em><span>folder name</span></em> is the name of the folder that you want to take ownership of.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then reapply the permissions and security settings that you want for the folder and its contents.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp; Additional considerations</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An administrator can take ownership of any file on the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assigning ownership of a file or a folder might require you to elevate your permissions using User Access Control.

            <p>Hey all!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the redeeming issue! I moved your thread over to our Xbox 360 support forum for better visibility! :)</p>
<p>This issue may be a result of a licensing issue. Be sure that the region on your account matches the region you're physically located in, and verify the content you are trying to download is available digitally in the region you're located in.</p>
<p>If the issue continues,&nbsp;I recommend contacting our chat or phone support agents through our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;page so they can take a look into it for you! :)</p>

<p>Blackops 2 and gears of war are region locked FYI</p>
<p>So your account region has to match your actual region just like the support person said</p>

<p>If it is not a windows sound and a PC sound, then is a sign that your computer hardware or motherboard has a serious issue. Does it do this right on boot up or just before a shut down?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disable windows sounds using your sound icon on taskbar&gt;&gt;Playback&gt;&gt;sounds&gt;&gt;Disable them.</p>
<p>If you still get a sound, I highly suspect a hardware or board issue and you need to contact your OEM or a&nbsp;Tech somewhere to check it out.</p>

            Hi JasonKTX,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you and thank you for your valuable question please, Can you pleases tell the make and model of your laptop?
<br />
<br />Meanwhile check your drivers, They should be updated because sometime the firmware caused this type of issues. (Personal Opinion)
<br />
<br />
<br />Please let me know and feel free to ask back any question.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards:
<br /> Yasir

            No, it means you are misunderstanding whatever error message you are seeing.&nbsp;
<b>There is no service pack 4 for Windows XP.</b>&nbsp; Any reputable antivirus software meant for Windows XP will install on Windows XP service pack 3.&nbsp; If you are having problems installing antivirus software, your computer may already be infected.<br />
<br />
You should install only one resident antivirus program.&nbsp; Do not install both Avast and AVG; pick one.&nbsp; You can have other

If you need more help, please do the following:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Post the complete text, without paraphrasing, of any error message you get when attempting to install your choice of antivirus software.<br />

<p>Mass Effect 3 doesn't bring the end for the franchise when it's released in March next year, as Bioware plans to continue the series, but it isn't sure how yet.
<br />
<br />
<span>“Certainly the setting has really resonated with people, the type of aliens in the world, the type of people that inhabit space,”</span> said BioWare founder Greg Zeschuk</p>

<p>I'm impressed on how popular Mass Effect has become. &nbsp;I really enjoy the franchise &amp; hope to see it continue on. &nbsp;As of right now i'm just waiting on word for a Co-operative mode being added to Mass Effect 3. &nbsp;Maybe that is the reason it has been delayed
 &amp; not because they are afraid to compete with Skyrim, MW3 or Uncharted 3 sales.</p>

<p>I would've been pissed if it didn't continue after Mass Effect 3. It's a very rich universe with some fantastic stories. I'd hate it if I couldn't learn more about it.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that ME3 is going to be about the defense against the first wave of Reapers and the start of the counter-attack. ME4 would probably be about invading Reaper territory and actually learning about the Reaper race and their agenda.</p>

<p>Well OG I kind of agree. The ending for the first Mass Effect was perfect and could have easily have ended there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However Mass Effect 2 is obviously designed to be the middle part of a trilogy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think of them like A New Hope and the Empire Strike Back. Most people consider Empire to be the better of the two, yet as a movie on its own merit it doesn't stand up too well because much of it relies on you having seen New Hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is where Mass Effect 2 falls down for me. A great game but an empty experience if you've not played the first.</p>

<p>Actually, I just didn't like the gameplay of ME2. I wasn't overly impressed with the first ME (I liked but didn't love it), but ME2 removed/simplified/dumbed-down too many elements that made it an RPG. If I wanted a semi-mindless&nbsp;shooter, I could have just
 walked into any game store, went to the 360 section, closed my eyes and randomly grabbed a game off the shelf. The&nbsp;percentage of mindless 360 shooters&nbsp;is already overwhelming. I shouldn't run the risk of coming away with one&nbsp;when purchasing what is supposed
 to be an RPG.</p>

<h2>            Change headphone settings for Skype only in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've recently started using Skype and have a headset with 3.5mm jacks for headphones and microphone.&nbsp; I'd like to leave the headset plugged into my laptop permanently, but I've found that all computer sound goes through the headset.&nbsp; Is there any way that
 I can separate computer sound and Skype sound, and just direct Skype through the headset?&nbsp; I have a Dell Lattitude E6410 and am running Windows 7 and Skype 4.2.0.169.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to listen only to the Skype communication device via the headphones and computer sound via the speakers, I am afraid that wouldn’t be possible.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, you can still manage to get the sound via both the speakers and headphones.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The following settings would allow the sound to be played both via speakers and the headphones.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Right-click on the speaker icon in the notification area and select&nbsp;<strong>Volume control options</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Select and check&nbsp;<strong>All devices currently playing sound</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Uncheck&nbsp;<strong>The default communication device</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Select and place a check mark on both speakers and headphones under “Sound Devices”.</span></p>

<h3> scouse atom  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Xbox Live Account wont sign in Online.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,&nbsp;I dont really know what to say on this or if this is going to do anything. Anyway I have had Xbox Live for I think around about 4 years. I got it at Christmas when MW2 was the latest Call of Duty. I play on my Xbox 360 near enough everyday. When Black
 Ops 1 was latest CoD I think that was when my Account wouldn't sign me into Messenger and I thought maybe my Conection may have been laggy but it kept doing it, so I checked on Computer and it was the same problem. I left it because I wasnt too bothered about
 not beng able to go on Messenger as I only spoke to 3 mates on it and I could still play on my Xbox Live Gamertag: T0MINAT0R333.</p>
<p>I have never been back on my Email ever since. Since Microsoft Security changed with Microsoft Account, I get a message pop up on my Xbox asking for me to Verify myself for Security Checks, I cant verify myself as I cant sign into my Email. It is or seems
 obvious that I got hacked but I have no idea how as I have never shared any Details of my Email or anything like that. For some reason though, if I try to Verify myself by putting in what my Password was that I made it comes up with something like: Sorry your
 Password may be incorect. It would say something like that and let me try again, but if I put anything else in it comes up with a different Error message that is similar but doesnt let me try again. It's as if I get the Password right but it says it's wrong,
 its really stupid and I dont deserve this. I have well over 100 Xbox 360 Games which most are bought brand new rather than Pre-Owned, I have around 52000Gamerscore and I have bought DLC for online games including CoD DLC, BF3 DLC and other games. I have cost
 loads of money on Xbox and not just the games, I have bought an Xbox 360 Arcade, Xbox 360 Elite and Xbox 360 Slim 250GB and I still have them all because the XArcade was for Family and then Elite was for my Xmas present and Slim was Xmas after because I needed
 250GB since Elite only had 120GB, also I love the look of the Slim, my Sister currently uses my Xbox 360 Elite but not much as she is usually on PC.</p>
<p>My mum has tried calling up Xbox for help whilst I was there but they done nothin, the guy said that we cant tell him my Gamertag or Email or anything and there is nothing he can do. He said my only hope was to verify on PC by doing Questionaire but the
 thing is my Sister made my Email Info for me and that was years ago and she cant remember none of it. This is also how I know I havent shared any of my Info online or anywere. The only thing I think she made was that my First Name was Tom and my Last Name
 was Tom, I know what Secret Question was as it would have been the name of our dog. Also I knew my last Pre-Paid Card / Codes, they were for Xbox Live Gold 12M and MSPoints, cant remember how much but after finishing the Questionaire it said not enough details.
 Anyway ive bassically paid for Gold and I cant use it and its just being wasted away every day.</p>
<p>This is so annoying and I dont know what to do. And sorry about all the paragraphs, when I type I cant really stop, ive been up all night looking on IE app on Xbox Live how to get my Account back, I got Diamond Camo on BoII and bought the Skins and also
 now this means I wont get the last Map Pack for BoII for Zombies. I made another account so I can message or Private Chat friends but im definately not starting from scratch, id rather get a PS3 and then probably PS4 as this is ridiculous. Im currently using
 my Best Mates Gamertag because he let me so I can play online when he is not on it. I really need help and my Gamertag sorted. Can anyone please help, I dont think anyone will be able to help and Xbox just dont care at all what so ever, im also not bothered
 about giving people my Email and Password as it doesnt work now anyway so if someone is willing to help and need to know details then fine, I have nothin to lose as I have already lost account or whatever which is really just stupid. Also whoever messed up
 my Account or whatever, no one has actually ever been on my Gamertag so it makes no sense why. Thanks alot.</p>

<p>Hello T0RMINAT0R333,</p>
<p>Lets see if we can't get you sorted out.</p>
<p>Some apps (like the mail apps on some smartphones) or devices <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>(like the Xbox 360, for example)</strong></span> can't prompt you to enter a security code when you try to sign in. If you get an incorrect password error with an app or device, you'll need to create a unique app password to sign in. Once you've signed
 in with your app password, you're all set to use that app or device. You will use this new app password to sign in to your device going forward instead of your Microsoft account password.</p>
<p>You'll need to create and sign in with an app password once for each app or device that can't prompt you for a security code.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign in</a> to your Microsoft account. </li><li>Under <b>Password and security info</b>, tap or click <b>Edit security info</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
If you're prompted for a security code here, enter it and tap or click <b>Submit</b>.
</li><li>Under <b>App passwords</b>, tap or click <b>Create a new app password</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
A new app password is generated and appears on your screen. (write this down) </li><li>On your Xbox, enter the app password displayed on the screen when asked for your Microsoft account password.
</li></ol>
<p>Let us Know if this gets you gaming.</p>

<h2>            Skype 8 for Android</h2>
                    <p>Skype was the best I had for a long time biz and personal I always have skype credit cos I travel much, now every time I need to make a call I have to copy the number from my address book and paste in skype dial pad to call, on old skype there was this little
 button on the top of the pad that gets you to your phone contacts to chose who you need to call, what ever happened to simplicity, why you have to complicate life to people who respected this software for a long time, I still have skype but now I use bad quality
 Viber at least I can call faster and not press too many buttons to get what I need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are so many complaints on your site, what, don't your&nbsp;so called dedicated support read or may be you don't&nbsp;even have support... please look into it. thank you for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Internet Email&#34; pop up keeps popping up. Just started to happen arbitrarily recently. I do not use Internet Email. I use Outlook.</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody please tell me why this pop up box with the server name and my user name and password (all three pre-populated) continuously pops up requesting that I click "OK"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another weird thing is that after I have done this the last time (selected the "Save this password in your password list" box and clicked "OK"), The pop up will reappear and&nbsp; the "Save this password to your password list" checkbox is no longer selected even
 though it was selected the last time this nightmarish inconvenience occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use either Firefox or Chrome and not IE Explorer {because of the constant pop ups telling me a site is not secure (I don't care, because it doesn't matter or already know because the address is "http" and not "https")}.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem only recently started happening, it's a personal computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very arbitrarily happening event. There is no set time interval. For example, I can forward an email already sitting in my bellsouth inbox to another email account without the pop up appearing and I can send an email from another account to my bellsouth
 account without the pop up appearing, but for no apparent reason, the pop up will just appear, usually when I'm in mid-sentence in a document or completing a password field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately for me, the "bellsouth" address I have is more than fourteen years old, has been used for so many logins and user IDs for too many online reasons that I cannot even remember and I would hate to just chuck it out. It's so old, there are no numbers
 in the email address. </p>
<p>
</p><p>More information that I am not sure matters:</p>
<ul>
<li>I installed Chrome on this computer about one or 1 and 1/2 weeks ago. I only started seeing the pop up issue since about Monday morning, though.
</li><li>My phone always receives an incoming email message (it alerts me) at least two minutes before Outlook does.</li></ul>
<p>Can somebody please help me?&nbsp; Really, please! Help!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very, very, very much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

If you are sure it's right, I would go to the website that runs your email and change your password, as it may have been compromised.

            <p>This happens to me.&nbsp; I click OK, then it checks for my email successfully.&nbsp; It is not a problem with the password.&nbsp; It happens when the password has not changed.&nbsp; How do I know?&nbsp; The next time Outlook checks for email, it works just fine.&nbsp; It simply has
 to do with the fact that Outlook has checked for email and for some reason has timed out (presumably the server at the other end did not respond fast enough), so the pop-up occurs.&nbsp; In my case (and I suspect in many others) it has nothing to do with a password
 change.&nbsp; I have tried upping the time that it checks for email to 6 minutes, and it still happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes one wonder why Outlook does not have an option for "Auto retry after X minutes, for a total number of Y retries" before this EXTREMELY ANNOYING popup occurs.&nbsp; One wonders why Microsoft blows this off.&nbsp; I suppose the simple answer is that it does
 not take place in the usage of any Outlook developers.&nbsp; One wonders if perhaps Outlook developers don't even use Outlook because it is so ANNOYING.

            Two different servers: Cox (pop.west.cox.net) and Godaddy (pop.secureserver.net).&nbsp; I assume others are experiencing exactly what I am experiencing due to posts I read when I google around for a solution.&nbsp; Obviously most do not see this problem, but it
 appears that there are many of us that do, and I can tell you it is very annoying.<br />

            As to why the server rejects it the first time (even with a 6 minute timeout), only the server gods know.&nbsp; BTW, I just got the pop up as I was typing this, clicked OK and Outlook went on its merry way.<br />

            <p>Thank you very much,MardAZ!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was some months ago that this happened at home and even more months previously that it happened at work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am glad to know that it is a server time out issue and not a password or Outlook setup issue. It did stop on its own awhile back, but Oh Lord! How irritating! -Right in the middle of a Word document and not looking at the screen, just typing on my merry
 way and the pop up took precedence over the Word document and I found out that I was not only NOT saving my thoughts in the Word document, but I was also using that train of thoughts as my "password" that was previously, automatically input when Outlook decided
 to check for new email.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

To prevent the password prompt from popping up you must update your email account settings to tell Outlook to remember your password.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>
1. Click "File" on the main menu in Outlook, click "Info," select the "Account Settings" pop-up menu and then click "Account Settings."</p>
<div>
<p>
2. Click the "Email" tab if it is not already selected.</p>
<div>
<p>
3. Click the email account that keeps prompting you to enter your password. Accounts are listed under the Names heading.</p>
<div>
<p>
4. Click the "Change" link located just above the list of accounts.</p>
<div>
<p>
5. Enter your password in the Password field located under Logon Information.</p>
<div>
<p>
6. Place a check mark in the Remember Password check box to have Outlook remember your password.</p>
<div>
<p>
7. Click "Next" and then click "OK" to save your settings.</p>

<h2>            Age of Empires 3 Online &#40;ESO&#41; Account Recovery</h2>
                    
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I lost access to my Age of Empires 3 Online account due to having changed email addresses and not being able to receive a password recovery link as a result. I was wondering if you might be able to change the e-mail address linked to the account for me so
 that I can recover it. I have all details such as the username, game CD key and product ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help,</p>

<h2>            hacked</h2>
                    My email has been hacked and someone deleted my setting for netflix, amazon, and microsoft+xbox. When the hacker did this they gave themselves a new email and my original email is not found in the system. So far microsoft is the only one who cannot give
 me back access even though i have secondary email on account and all the details they could ever ask for.

<p>
</p><p>The first question is are you able to sign into your account click no&nbsp;</p>

If you're unable to recover your account yourself, immediately reset your email password to prevent further misuse of your account, and then contact Xbox Support. We'll need you to provide some specific information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
The hardware identification numbers from the Xbox console you use most often.
<ul>
<li>
For the Xbox 360, we’ll need the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/repair/serial-number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Console ID and the Console Serial Number</a>. </li><li>
For the Xbox One, we’ll need the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/warranties-and-repair/find-xbox-one-kinect-serial-number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device ID and the Console Serial Number</a>. </li></ul>
</li><li>
The Microsoft account email address that you're trying to recover. </li><li>
An alternate phone number where we can reach you if necessary. </li><li>
A <strong>new Microsoft account</strong> without any gamertag associations. This new account will be used for secure communication purposes during the process of recovering your compromised account.
<p>
To create a new Microsoft account, go to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account.microsoft.com</a> and select <strong>Create one!</strong> (you will need to sign out of any existing account to see the
<strong>Create </strong>option).</p>
<ul>
<li>
When setting up this new account, please only use your <strong>phone number</strong> as a recovery option.
<strong>Do not</strong> use an <strong>alternative email address</strong> as your other email accounts may also be compromised.
</li><li>
<strong>Do not</strong> use this new Microsoft account on your Xbox console or on Xbox.com until you receive further notification from Xbox Support.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Basically what is going to happen is that they will fill out a form for their escalations team with all this information that they are asking for and send that form up to the escalations team who will then look over all that information and determine if
 your account was truly compromised if it was then they will move all of your information (purchases, games, game saves, subscriptions) over to the new account they had you create in the steps above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps to the letter like when it says to create a MS account but DO NOT use this new MS account on your xbox console or xbox.com because it will then put a xbox profile onto that account and the escalations team WILL NOT be able to move your old
 information to the new account if it already has a xbox profile attached to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically you will need to contact xbox support by going to support.xbox.com/contact-us and they will walk you through all of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nobody in these Public forums has access to your account information to be able to do this for you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Problem: We have discovered that some computers on our network have folders of user data that have become encrypted. I am unable to decrypt these folders to gain access to the data. I believe that some (but definitely not all) of these encryptions are the
 result of moving a MACOSX compressed folder to windows.</p>

<p>1: See encrypted folder (Green).</p>
<p>2: Right click into properties. Select advanced.</p>
<p>3: 'Encrypt contents to secure data' is checkmarked, if I look at the 'Details' page, no users are under the 'Users who can access this file' group.</p>
<p>4: I uncheck the box and hit 'Ok', then 'Apply', then 'Apply changes to folder and subfolders'.</p>
<p>5: Error: An error occurred applying attributes to the file: "FILEPATH" This machine is disabled for file encryption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps that I have tried:</p>
<p>-Removing the drive and attempting to decrypt from another computer.</p>
<p>-Attempting to access through a linux boot</p>
<p>-I had the user that 'owned' the file try to access it (I'm a network admin). She was unsuccessful. She downloaded the data a few months ago and her OS has NOT been modified since then.</p>
<p>-Bitlocker is not enables</p>
<p>-The disable EFI registry entry is appropriately set</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm out of ideas, there's no way we can archive the data as no one has the ability to view or copy the data short of duplicating drives. The only thing we can do is see filenames and delete the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>
