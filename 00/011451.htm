<h2>            N70 Battery life</h2>
                    Hi<br />
is it just me or does the battery life of the Nokia N70 - not come anywhere close to the 11 days standby and 3.5 hours talk time.<br />
<br />
I'm lucky if I get 2 days... <br />
listen to about 20 minutes of radio a day make 1 or 2 calls... and then charge...<br />
<br />
my old 6230 - i did that + listened to MP3's ...played games and was still getting about 4 days...<br />
<br />
??

            Hi <br />
<br />
Just a thought I have a N70 and had the same problem when i asked my provider 3 i was told that becasue it is conected all the time to the 3 site it will drain the battery quicker. Answer, disconnect from their site and the battery will last longer.

            Hi Guys!<br />
<br />
Yes, the battery life will be affected when you use the phone to connect to the Internet. This drains as power in the same way making a call drains the battery. If you are connected to GPRS or 3G all the time this can have an impact on standby time.<br />
<br />
The same also applies to listening to the radio/music and using bluetooth or infrared.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            I purchased the bl6c battery which is the one the ngage qd uses and i dont have any problems with the battery life. It was a little bit of a tight squeeze in the 6680 and a perfect fit in the n70 as it has more space behind the battery cover (as does the
 6630). I dont no how to measure its capacity but when i was using the old battery in my 6680 i got less than 24 hrs and i wasnt even on the internet very much. But i also believe it depends on your network reception which was very bad. But it is an improvement
 and no longer runs out on me at odd times and i use the internet for long periods during the day now.

            Hi Guys!<br />
<br />
I have to mention that the BLC-C battery is not designed to be used with the N70.<br />
<br />
Whilst it may give you a longer standby time you could end up damaging the phone itself, the screen etc.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I have nothing more to add on the standby time question other than the advice alread posted, switch off bluetooth, try to limit the camera and mulitmedia usage etc :(.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            I'm intrigued to find out how a higher capacity battery can damage the phone?<br />
<br />
I've been using the BL-6C with my N70 since early December and it's been fine, and actually makes it a useable phone. Likewise there are many people over on the Howard forums who are doing the same, none of whom have reported any problems.

            i think karim refers to the power output of the battery.<br />
<br />
if it is higher or fluctuate etc then the screen could damage. its like psp owners who have bought a higher capacity battery, the screen gets brighter this can result in screen burn. if the same happens with the n70 and this battery it could damage sceen in
 the same way.

            The only difference with most "current" Nokia batteries is their capacity, i.e. how much energy storage there is. There is NO significant difference in delivery of this capacity or the voltage or their charging cycle except a larger capacity battery will
 take longer to charge. The only issue you will have is that some larger capacity batteries are physically bigger than the correct battery for that phone. This could cause mechanical stress to the main board and battery connector so is obviuosly to be avoided
 where possible. If the battery fits nicely in the case then there should be no problem. The best solution is to have a chrged spare available for a quick swap.<br />
Remember, for lithium ion/polymerbatteries, it is also perfectly safe to charge the battery as often as you like, even if not flat. It is also safe to leave on charge for hours at a time even if it has said "battery full".

<h2>            nokia c6-00 cannot install apps</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I cannot install apps on my Nokia C6. I have tried with 15-20 apps and managed to install only two: AccuWeather and Facebook Chat. In other cases I get "Cannot install app" error (this is my translation from polish, so it may vary from, let's say, official
 english text). I cannot even update Ovi Store, so it is unusable for me. I have to use internet browser to download files from Ovi Store and then try to install. Some of apps I have tried to install are: Sports Tracker, Skype, Opera Mobile, Happy WakeUp...</p>
<p>That's new phone, I haven't installed any cracked soft on it etc.</p>
<p>Version of software installed on my phone is: 20.0.042/20.0.042.229.01 and it says there is no updates.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the net I found that I have to perform hard reset and it may help... is that correct?</p>
<p>I will be grateful for all help!</p>

    <title>No more Bluetooth Sync possible after Notebook Standby - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> negg  say:</h3>
<h2>            No more Bluetooth Sync possible after Notebook Standby</h2>
                    I'm havin unregular problems with syncing via bluetooth with a Samsung SGH-i620 (WM6) and AS 4.5. Every now and then (I would say mostly after I put the notebook into standby) I start ActiveSync via bluetooth on the phone and there is no connection possible.<br />
<br />
The error I get is: "No network connection possible" (sorry, translated this from german version, maybe the english text is different). Error code is: 80072EFD<br />
<br />
The only thing I found about this error code is&nbsp;this&nbsp;link:<br />
<br />
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=258816<br />
<br />
I used the&nbsp;registry&nbsp;entry&nbsp;mentioned&nbsp;there, but it did not help. The only thing that helps is restarting the notebook. The phone does not need to be restarted, that's why I suppose the problem is related to ActiveSync on the PC.<br />
<br />
I'd like to add that I had no bluetooth problems ever before with other (non WM-)phones or other bluetooth devices. PC is a Sony VGN-TX3XP running Windows XP SP2 with all updates.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what I might try to solve this problem? Thanks for you help!<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As described by others, whenever I put the laptop in standby mode (doesn't matter if the PDA is or isn't connected at the time), when I wake up the laptop, ActiveSync no longer works via bluetooth, because the bluetooth COM port that was linked
 to ActiveSync has mysteriously "disappeared" from the "connection settings" window of ActiveSync, even though the COM port still shows up in Windows Device Manager.&nbsp; Just as with others in this thread, after I reboot, the problem goes away.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not clear
 to me if&nbsp;it's an ActiveSync problem, or&nbsp;bluetooth driver issue or a Windows power management issue.&nbsp; Based on my experience (below), I can only guess that ActiveSync regenerates a list of COM ports at reboot, but maybe doesn't do so when ActiveSync is restarted
 (without rebooting).&nbsp; Perhaps when waking from standby ActiveSync searches for active bluetooth COM ports too soon, finds none, and rebooting is the only available way to refresh the list of COM ports.&nbsp; Or maybe after resuming from standby, the bluetooth radio
 is still in some kind of low power mode that prevents its detection by ActiveSync?&nbsp; (sorry, just brainstorming)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was glad to find that a somewhat recent (relatively speaking) thread actually exists on this issue, but I'm sorry to report that I don't have a real solution, and disappointed to see that none has yet been found.&nbsp; I'm fearful that MS has abandoned
 ActiveSync, now that Vista uses the "Windows Mobile Device Center" in place of ActiveSync.&nbsp; If it's a problem that requires a new build of ActiveSync, we may never see a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I thought I should post, since it seems maybe I have some information that hasn't been mentioned yet:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I use the Device Manager to "uninstall" the device before I put the laptop in standby, after I wake up the laptop, Windows can "scan for new plug and play devices", and automatically reinstall the device.&nbsp; This is *almost* a decent work-around,
 except for the following problem:&nbsp; When the device is "uninstalled", the COM port is treated as a disconnected/hidden device, and when it's reinstalled, it's assigned a new (next available)&nbsp;COM port number, instead of reusing the old one.&nbsp; Therefore:</p>
<p>1. ActiveSync connection settings needs to be set to use the new COM port.</p>
<p>2. After a few times, you'll run out of COM ports that Activesync can use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get around the second issue, you could:</p>
<p>Option A:</p>
<p>You could try the following approach, (after you uninstall the bluetooth COM port device manager entry, but before you put the laptop in standby would be&nbsp;best I think); haven't tried this yet&nbsp;:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option B:</p>
<p>&nbsp;set up Device Manager&nbsp;"View" menu for&nbsp;"show hidden devices", and periodically remove the unused Bluetooth COM ports manually, or you can do the same thing faster by deleting their entries from the registry (though the latter could cause you
 more problems if you accidentally delete a COM port that's used for something else).&nbsp; Bluetooh Serial ports are found under:
</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\BTHENUM</p>

<h2>            Error code 0xc06d007e</h2>
                    I have used Windows 10 and Office 365 together for some time without issues. Today, while away from home and all of my supporting documentation and notes, I am getting a message that Office needs to be activated. When I follow the steps to activate, I
 get the following error code: System Error: 0xc06d007e . Clicking on the repair button only regenerates the error code. Clicking on the repair button for the second message closes the window completely.

            First, it is NOT recommended that on use lookup fields on the table level (http://access.mvps.org/access/lookupfields.htm). &nbsp;Users should never interact directly with tables, so lookups should be done with list controls on the form level. Second, I wouldn't&nbsp;structure&nbsp;my
<div><br />
<div>You have a many to many relationship here so I would use a junction table to model it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>tblStudentSubject</div>
<div>StudentSubjectID (PK Autonumber</div>
<div>StudentID</div>
<div>SubjectID</div>
<div>DateTaken</div>
<div>DateCompleted</div>
<div><br />
<div>So you would use a Subform on your student mainform to enter the Subjects chosen. When the student is assigned to a course you can enter the date taken</div>
<div><br />
<div>To then display the number of courses selected, you could have a textbox with the ControlSource:</div>
<div><br />
<div>=DCount("*","tblStudentSubject","[StudentID] = " &amp; Me.StudentID)</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is no need to store this value as its a calculated value, the Dcount will display the count accurately.</div>

            <p>First, let me say I agree with Scott.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, you can get the count of selected values in a multi-valued field by using a query like</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select StudentID, Count([FieldName].Value])</p>
<p>From TableNameHere</p>
<p>Group By StudentID</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The .Value part on the field will&nbsp;display the values selected as if they were separate records.</p>

<h2>            How to delete an IMAP account and go back to a POP3 Account</h2>
                    I created an IMAP account for a blind client, but she doesn't like the way the folders work now.&nbsp; I have attempted to create a POP3 account in addition to the IMAP account, so that I could eventually delete the IMAP account, but Outlook 2016 will not allow
 this, stating that this account already exists.&nbsp; I even uninstalled Office all together and when it fully re-installed, everything was exactly the same.&nbsp; The IMAP account was fully intact.&nbsp; I don't know how to get back to a clean slate and start again with
 a POP3 account. &nbsp;

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that Outlook 2016 recognizes the email you’re trying to add <span>
is</span> the default account that’s why you’re getting the message that the account already exists. Start with removing the current Outlook profile by following these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>User Accounts</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Mail (32-bit)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Show Profiles</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the profile that you’re not using.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Remove</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Yes</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Hit <strong>OK</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After removing the old profile, </span>you can now set up your email as POP. Here’s an
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2758902/how-to-set-up-an-internet-email-account-in-outlook-2013-or-2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> that would walk you through the steps on how to add an email to Outlook.</p>

<h2>            Account does not exist</h2>
                    I've been using the same email address since about 2006, recently I have had to change my password a couple of times as I can't access my account. It now says email account does not exist. This account is active daily and I use it on a regular basis. I
 need to access it. Help! This is a hotmail.co.uk which I have been using on an iPhone 5s for over a year.&nbsp;

    <title>slide show on second monitor stops on mouse click on windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            slide show on second monitor stops on mouse click on windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a user with a plasma connected as a second monitor, which she uses to display ppt slide shows on the wall outside her office. With XP she would run it while working on her main monitor. Now we installed Windows 7 and the slide show runs but it stops
 as soon as she clicks on something in her main room. Is this a PPT setting that I missed or a problem with Windows 7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            <p>well, I haven't seen it with my own eyes but the first thing my user told me when I installed Win7 was "my slideshows don't work anymore"...</p>
<p>it was actually another machine with a different video card,&nbsp;which had an s-video connector for the &nbsp;secondary monitor. maybe that's why it worked?</p>

            <p>Hi macklaw,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize that it took us more time than usual to reply to your question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I understand none of your old emails were saved by Outlook and you want to recover them.&nbsp;You have also mentioned that Outlook will not send your emails and they are directed to your Outbox. Just to verify, are you pertaining to the Outlook mail
 client or to the Outlook.com web-based email?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are referring to Outlook.com web-based email,&nbsp;p<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">lease be informed that by upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should still stay
 in your Inbox. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Here are the possible reasons on why your emails/folders are missing in your account:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. <strong><span>Due to inactivity in account:</span></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>If your emails were over 365 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity in your account even before you renamed the account. If you had Self-recovery of emails turned on in your account before renamed, you can try to recover some of the deleted
 messages yourself (Link to recover deleted messages is under DELETED folder). You can refer to this article for more information:
</li><li><span>If you were accessing your emails on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but didn’t log into your web account for over 365 days, you may lose emails due to inactivity in web account.
</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. <strong><span>You got another option to save your Hotmail emails differently when renaming your account to @Outlook.com account:</span></strong> If you chose to rename your account to @Outlook.com, a prompt would have asked
 you – ‘Where do you want to save your emails?’ You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account. If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will be the name
 of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under ‘Folders’. And all your old emails will be stored in this folder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. <strong><span>Your account was hacked even before you renamed your account:</span></strong> A hacker had already deleted emails in their account before you renamed the account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You can provide us more information by answering the questions below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When was the account switched to Outlook.com?</span> </li><li><span>Did the data loss occur right after Outlook.com upgrade or was the data still there for a brief time?</span>
</li><li><span>Did you have issues logging in before noticing data loss – did you have to reset your password?</span>
</li><li><span>Did you click on any link before the issue occurred?</span> </li><li><span>Did you try to deactivate or downgrade to Hotmail.com before the issue occurred?</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Make sure that you are signed in to the forum to view the link.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p>However&nbsp;if you are referring to the Outlook mail client, I would advise you to post your query in the Office Outlook&nbsp;forum thru this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/outlook?tm=1367826773772">

            <p><strong>Hi Karla,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here is my situation. I have used Hotmail forever and was using Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I dropped my computer, broke it, so I had to buy a new one. Got a Lenovo but I was</strong></p>
<p><strong>required to buy it with Windows 8 ( which I didn't want ).</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Lenovo was preloaded with many apps, including email , which was an Outlook Express. It was awful and hard to use. It got to where it would not send out my email. It just sat in the "out" box. Then accidentally I found out about outlook.com and
 went there. Everything is fine nowwith one exception.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In Hotmail, I had a number of folder I created which appears on the left side below "inbox, junk, drafts, sent , and deleted". The were historical folders like "50th class reunion" where I stored</strong></p>
<p><strong>old important emails I needed to keep. Some of the emails were 7-8 years old but important.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When I now go to these important historical folders, all the old emails are gone. Outlook.com</strong></p>
<p><strong>did not save my historical folders.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is there any way to retrieve these historical files ?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thanks,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mack</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will be glad to assist you with your concern about how to retrieve your files. You can try to recover deleted emails using self-recovery feature. Please go to the deleted email folder and run the auto restore option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>You may also visit the links </font></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>How do I recover deleted email messages?</font></span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>

 for further details regarding deleted emails.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't find the auto restore option please follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to your <span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Hotmail Inbox</font></span> page.</p>
<p>2. Click on <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Options</span> (located on the upper right corner of your screen, next to a question mark icon) then “<span style="font-weight: bold">More Options”</span></font>.</p>
<p>3. From the Hotmail Options screen under the category <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Customizing Hotmail</span>, click “<span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced privacy settings”</span></font>.</p>
<p>4. Under Deleted message category, tick on "Let me recover deleted Messages".</p>
<p>5. Click <span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Save</font></span>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once done, please check your deleted mail folder and see if the auto-restore option is available. If so, please try to recover the deleted emails.</p>

    <title>Flag mail merge so only Excel cells with data are imported - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Flag mail merge so only Excel cells with data are imported</h2>
                    <p>We have annual giving pledge campaigns. When someone pledges, we send a thank you letter to them confirming the amount and frequency of their gift. We track the pledges in an Excel spreadsheet which is used as the data file for the Word mail merge thank
 you letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to set a flag so that if a cell has data in it then only merge that record's data into the Word mail merge document?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fields in the spreadsheet that are merged are:</p>
<p>Name; Street; City; Name2; 2018-Freq; 2018-Amt</p>
<p>(One row per record)</p>
<p>
</p><p>A tracking field that shows the date the pledge was posted to our CMS is "Posted".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What little I remember from my programming days beaucoup years ago says I could use an "IF - THEN" statement, such as IF "Posted" &gt;{Today's Date} THEN Merge fields "Name"; "Street"; "City"; "Name2"; "2018-Freq"; "2018-Amt" to Mail Merge document. At least
 that's the code my organic computer would use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking at upwards of 150 letters in each batch, if not (we hope) more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Put the following nested fields at the beginning of your mail merge main document and see if that is enough for your requirement.<br />
<br />
{ SKIPIF { MERGEFIELD Posted \@YYYYMMDD } &lt;= { DATE \@YYYYMMDD } }</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the { } need to be the special field brace pair characters that you can insert in Windows versions of Word using ctrl-F9. You can't just type them on the keyboard. You can use Alt-F9 to toggle between "field code" view and "field results view" so you
 can see what you are doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible to filter the records using the facilities in "Select Recipients", but as far as I know in there you can only compare a date field against a specific date, not a function whose value changes from day to day such as "today" or some such). So
 you would have to change the criteria manually each day. <br />
<br />
However, you can also set up the criteria using VBA, e.g. if your data is coming from Sheet1, you can connect to the sheet, then set the query in VBE's immediate pane using&nbsp;</p>
<p>
activedocument.MailMerge.DataSource.QueryString="SELECT * FROM [Sheet1$] WHERE d &gt; date()"<br />
<br />
</p><p>Once you have executed that command, the query should "stick, and the two main problems then are (a) if the user is supposed to be able to apply more filters to the data, it may not work, and (b) if the end user needs to reconnect to the data the filter
 will not be re-applied.<br />

<h2>            In Outlook 2007, email messages, can I hide day of week in received column&#63;</h2>
                    Looking at messages in my Inbox, the Received column shows the date as: day of week, date and time.&nbsp; All I want to see is date and time.&nbsp; I have checked regional settings on my computer and it does not include day of week. So how do I get it to display
 eg. 09/07/2011 20:45 instead of Sat 09/07/2011 20:45 ?
