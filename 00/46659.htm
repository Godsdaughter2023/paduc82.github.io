<h2>            Windows Media Center - HDCP Support Required - New Monitors</h2>
                    I recently purchased two new LG monitors (29EA93-P and 27EA83-D). Their specs say they are HDCP capable. The Nvidia control panel application says they are and that HDCP is working with the connection between the video card and monitor. However, Windows
 Media Center (Windows 8) refuses to allow me to watch encrypted content (HBO, Showtime). Occasionally it shows the HDCP error when watching other channels but maximizing the window resolves the issue (as has been reported elsewhere), but doing the maximize
 thing doesn't work for these ones.<br />
<br />
I also ran this step: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-pictures/how-do-i-diagnose-why-hdcp-stopped-working/f8894406-fb52-47b7-8eb8-5ab81fd41d58<br />
This hasn't resolved the issue. I didn't expect it would because I don't use Hyper-V or virtual machines.<br />
<br />
Does something need to be done when switching monitors to refresh WMC's HDCP settings? I literally unplugged the old monitors and plugged in the new ones without changing anything else. Is there some sort of validation in WMC where my monitors, since they are
 new, might not be in a list of recognized monitors? I reran the monitor setup within WMC hoping that would fix things, but it didn't. The only other thing I can think of is that these monitors are higher resolution (2560x1080 and 2560x1440, respectively) so
 I don't know if that could cause an issue somewhere.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping to avoid streaming shows through Showtime/HBO/Comcast's sites because their quality isn't that great and/or plugging in an old monitor every time I want to watch what I've DVR'd or live TV, so any help would be appreciated. Thanks!<br />

            I re-ran the TV Signal Setup and that didn't resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
I have a Ceton InfiniTV PCIe tuner. I made sure it had the latest version of Diagnostic Tools and that everything was up to date. I ran the setup again and am still having same issue.<br />

<h2>            atapi.sys - Address F879C7C0 base at F87860000, Datestamp 4802539d__STOP error on boot</h2>
                    Hello all I have a DELL Inspiron E1405 laptop with Windows XP Media Center Edition (circa 2006). I've had no problems with it until today. I had used it earlier today, no problem (on standby mode but on) then I closed it again, a few hours later I open
 it and the text on the screen is fuzzy (this has happened once before, apparently the resolution automatically changed, I was able to fix it) but this time around I could NOT fix it, there was "nothing" to fix, everything was normal. I tried to click on "help
 and support" in the properties box (for the screen resolution) but it said a "system service" was not running so I hit the power button and shut off my computer then THIS popped up (in all its blue screen glory):<br />
<span><span><span><br />
<span><span><span><br />
A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer ... etc
<br />
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Technical information: STOP: 0x0000007E (0xC0000005, OxF879C7C0, OxF8C6252C, OxF8C62228)<br />
atapi.sys - Address F879C7C0 base at F87860000, Datestamp 4802539d<br />
<br />
I tried to reboot in safemode but I keep getting back to this exact screen. I even let the battery just run out and tried to restart nothing happened.
<br />
<br />
I no longer have a windows CD to boot from so I'm guessing my only options would be to boot from something like linux or ubuntu and replace the corrupted atapi.sys file? I don't know of anything else to do! Please help!<br />
<br />
Also, I've never booted from CD before nor have I replaced a system file. Help!</span>

            There was a rash of problems similar to this caused by infection by a rootkit. The best solution is to back up your data and do a clean install of Windows. Since by your own assessment you aren't computer savvy, take the computer to a competent local professional.
 Don't use a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place. The pro will be able to back up your data and will have the Dell reinstallation media. If you don't want to do this, then yes you need to boot with a Linux Live CD like Knoppix, copy your data to an external
 hard drive, and get replacement reinstallation media from Dell so you can do the clean install/restore. If the installation media is not a recovery image you will need to install all the Dell drivers and laptop utilities after the operating system installation
 is complete.

            Thanks for the help but that hasn't helped me one bit :\ I havent the slightest idea of what to do besides maybe booting from the non-windows live CD and I don't have the money for another HD much less anything else you said. My warranty expired in 07
 and I have no money to pay for ANYTHING besides a CD to boot the new OS from. I need something I can do that's free or as close to free as you can get and also step-by-step how to do it.
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            You don't need a new hard drive. You need to reinstall Windows. The external hard drive is just a suggestion in case you haven't backed up your data. You could also boot to a Linux Live CD or, if you only have one optical drive in that machine, boot to
 a Linux Live USB flash drive and burn your data to CD/DVD-R. Obviously you can't burn the data to CD/DVD if you've booted Linux from a CD and you only have one CD drive.<br />
<br />
I'm happy to give you links about how to do this. Just let me know.

            Thanks. So I would boot from the USB flash drive with Linux then from there I could burn my files to a CD (I have almost 50gigs worth of stuff, I guess I'd need to use many MANY CDs to get it all).
<br />
<br />
How would I do this? Step by step please.<br />

            You would want to use DVD-Rs, not CDs! Better still, if your drive supports it use dual-layer DVDs. It will still take you awhile. Here's a link to booting Linux from a USB flash drive:<br />

            1. Connect the bootable USB flash drive with Linux on it to the computer.<br />
2. Turn the computer on and press F12 to get a temporary boot order menu. Select removable USB devices. If you don't have this option then your computer can't boot from USB. But let's assume it can.<br />
<br />
Linux will boot. You didn't say what distro you've got on that key and whether the window manager is KDE or Gnome so you'll need to look in its Programs menu to find a CD/DVD burning program. KDE uses K3b. I don't have a distro running Gnome on a machine right
 now so you'll have to look to see what's available there. Whatever, just burn your data to DVDs. I have no idea what your laptop is capable of. Look at your purchase paperwork or find its specs on Dell's website. You want to use DVD+/-R blanks, not RW ones.
 If your laptop has a dual-layer drive you can get dual-layer DVDs which hold twice as much. Again, you will need to find out what your laptop can do by looking at its specifications.<br />
<br />
As I believe I already said, I don't know whether you have a true operating system CD from Dell or a recovery disc. If you have a recovery disc all the drivers will be in the image already. If you have a full OS disc then yes, you'll need to get all the drivers
 and laptop utilities from Dell's website to install after XP is on.<br />
<br />
If you don't know how to do something you can ask OR you can plug your question into Google and find out. For instance, if you have a KDE distro and aren't sure how to use K3b, you can use a search term like "how to burn using k3b". You don't need to wait for
 an answer to a forum post.<br />

            Thank you so much! What is a 'window manager'? I know for a fact my computer can rip discs (I've done it via windows media player) and thus can burn them too but I've never burned a disc before on my computer. Since I'm going to be booting from Linux will
 I have access to the internet etc to download the drivers from dell? I was able to download a version of linux on to the USB device which has nothing whatsoever to do with dell, I dont have any sort of discs relating to dell or microsoft anymore (I've moved
 a lot). In otherwords, I can download the drivers (which ones?) I will need from dell's website once I've booted from the linux USB device, correct? Since I don't have a copy of XP, I'm assuming I'm going to have completely uninstall the corrupted XP OS and
 replace it with the linux one, correct? <br />
<br />
Thank you very much!!!

            I'm sorry but that's pretty mixed up. I'll try and answer the questions in order.<br />
<br />
1. Yes, you will be able to access the Internet from Linux but that's not why you're booting from the USB key. The distro on the USB key is just to allow you to get your data off since you can't get into Windows.<br />
<br />
2. If you want to install Windows you will need to get replacement OS discs from Dell. Or once again, see if there is a recovery image on your hard drive. Contact Dell tech support to find out. You'll be talking to them anyway to get the replacement XP installation
 media.<br />
<br />
3. You only want to install Linux if you want to run Linux.<br />
<br />
4. If you want to run Linux then Windows drivers aren't going to help you one bit. You would need Linux drivers for your hardware. But I don't think you want to run Linux. Linux is a completely different operating system and has nothing to do with Windows XP.
 You'd better do some research about Linux if you think you want to switch from Windows.<br />
<br />
Are you really sure you want to be doing this? I don't mean to hurt your feelings but it doesn't sound like you understand what you're doing and probably taking the machine to a pro is a better course of action. Just saying.

1. Yes, you will be able to access the Internet from Linux but that's not why you're booting from the USB key. The distro on the USB key is just to allow you to get your data off since you can't get into Windows.&lt;-- I know that. I was just wondering if I'd
 be able to access the internet, I presumed I would be able to I just wanted to check.<br />
<br />
2. If you want to install Windows you will need to get replacement OS discs from Dell. Or once again, see if there is a recovery image on your hard drive. Contact Dell tech support to find out. You'll be talking to them anyway to get the replacement XP installation

<br />
3. You only want to install Linux if you want to run Linux. &lt;-- It looks like I have no choice if I want a working computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. If you want to run Linux then Windows drivers aren't going to help you one bit. You would need Linux drivers for your hardware. But I don't think you want to run Linux. Linux is a completely different operating system and has nothing to do with Windows XP.
 You'd better do some research about Linux if you think you want to switch from Windows. &lt;-- I know linux is completely different than XP I just see no other choice but to use it because I can't afford a replacement XP. Unless dell/microsoft is willing to send
 me it for free, that is. EDIT: I just checked since my warranty has long since expired that's not going to happen but I can download the drivers for it it seems....<br />
<br />
I don't have the money to get someone else to do this. Anything is better than what I have now which is a big, flat paperweight.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

    <title>No sound after updating drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> osinard  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound after updating drivers</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently tried to update sound drivers and I've lost all sound output after that. The sound test shows working but there's no sound.&nbsp; Nothing I've tried helped. Rolled back the drivers, running diagnostics..I even reinstalled the windows still have
 the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not mentioning that I had my amd graphic cards disabled in my laptop a while ago. I believe this might have to do something with it because audio inputs shows "speakers 2-high definition audio device". I suspect the update that originally killed the sound
 changed something because even after reinstalling windows twice still no sound coming through even though it looks working on screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not the most tech savy person here so maybe there might be a simpler solution than taking the laptop to a technician.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Osinard
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />1. Run Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Playing Audio &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Audio Driver 
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Sound, Video &amp; game controllers &gt; Right Click on the entry below (if more than one, then you will have to repeat the steps for all) &gt; Properties &gt; Driver Tab &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Roll Back -  If Roll back driver is enabled, roll it back
<br />
<br />B. Update - Update driver
<br />
<br />C. Download and reinstall the driver from computer manufacturer's website - If you face issue, let me know your computer make and model?
<br />
<br />3. Check Speaker / headphone is not disabled and is set as default
<br />
<br />Type Sound in Windows Start Seach box &gt; Click Sound &gt; Under Playback tab, right click on an empty space and select, Show disconnected devices and Show disabled devices &gt; Select Speaker and click on Properties and make sure that it is is enabled &gt; You may also check if the Speaker that you are using is set as default.
<br />
<br />4. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />5. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>
</p><p>I assume the problem isnt hardware related because the sound was working just fine a few days ago before I installed audio drivers from easydriver. the update must have changed something. But even after restoring to previous point or reinstalling windows
 didnt help.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Wonder if there's simpler solution than sending it back to technician and wait yet another 2-3 weeks.&nbsp;</p>

            I dont see IDT in device manager, only high definftion audio. I will look into this though thanks. I believe the problem is a discord the new driver update created with integrated graphics card disabled.&nbsp;

<li>The free upgrade does not have the option to&nbsp;switch architectures, so the architecture will remain the same. If you want to switch architectures, you will have to download the Window 10&nbsp;.ISO file in the appropriate architecture (32 or 64 bit)&nbsp;and do a custom
 install.

    <title>Unable to interact with the content on the secondary monitor - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to interact with the content on the secondary monitor</h2>
                    <p>I have three monitors plugged into a evga GTX 1060 ACX 2.0, the system is running latest Windows 10 pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every night I put the computer to sleep. Occasionally, and more frequently the past week, I wake the computer in the morning to find very strange behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whatever monitor is my main display works perfectly</li><li>Secondary monitors turn on and show the last content they had (any open browsers, programs, etc)</li><li>I can move my mouse into the secondary screens and see it moving around just fine</li><li>When I click or do any kind of interaction on those screen, the visuals do not update (again, mouse around moving is fine)
<ul>
<li>Click a window, the window focus never shows; scroll or press a button on a website, doesn't show any changes; click the Windows button, menu doesn't open</li></ul>
</li><li>However, I can still interact with the screens despite not being able to see what I'm changing
<ul>
<li>Drag a window off the screen and it magically appears on the main display; press the 1-Click buy on an Amazon item, receive it 2-5 business days later</li></ul>
</li><li>Changing the main display changes the screen I can interact with</li><li>Mucking with the resolution of the secondary monitors does not fix the issue but it does update their visuals</li><li>Display driver details:
<ul>
<li>Date: 2018-11-12</li><li>Version: 25.21.14.1694</li></ul>
</li><li>I am in the process of downloading NVidia 2019 drivers to see if that helps</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The only fix I've found so far (with my limited experience debugging display issues) is restarting the computer. Help!</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please reply to the following questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you facing this issue only after sleep mode?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you aware of any changes on the computer prior to this issue?
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p><span>It could be that when you are putting the computer into sleep, after a time interval the computer might be
 going to Hibernate mode and that is why you are facing this issue. We can try disabling Hibernate and check if the issue persists. Please follow the steps mentioned below to check if that helps:

<p>Thank you for the prompt reply and suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated the NVidia driver as mentioned above and haven't yet seen the issue recur, though it's only been 2 days. Hopefully this will solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also run the powercfg command as recommended, but doing a before and after&nbsp;comparison of /q output from the tool doesn't show a difference in the settings - HYBRIDSLEEP it is still set at&nbsp;0x00000001 (though I'm not sure if that's what the intended change
 was).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't yet tried the new power plan but if I encounter the problem again that will be my next step.</p>

<p>I have had this exact problem the last few weeks as well on a GTX 1070TI and three monitors.</p>
<p>The main monitor works, but the other two are frozen. If I change which is the main monitor in settings that monitor comes alive but the previous main monitor freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an insidious problem because Windows is actually working fine underneath so you can potentially click some buttons that you should not click (like the mentioned Amazon 1-buy) and do something unaware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me the problem also occurs occasionally after using Sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was really hard to find this page when using Google/Bing so there might be a lot of others with this problem unreported. I did find this old thread from 2015 with what seems to be the same trouble: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/dual-screen-setup-second-screen-freezing-up/4a74ae2d-8c2e-400e-bdee-0a5b208b03df</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except the workaround there does not work as per above (the currently main screen works but stops working when not the main screen anymore).</p>

<p>I am facing the same issue. Put the computer to sleep at night, come back to start working in the morning, and the second monitor is not refreshing the content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a wild theory: perhaps this is a memory problem. It seems like the pixels are being dumped back into the GPU display buffer and not being refreshed. I don't know enough about graphics cards to say anything more than that. One strike against this
 theory would be that somehow the mouse still shows up just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What programs are y'all running when sleeping? I've got Chrome, Excel, Signal Desktop, Word, MATLAB running.</p>

            I will try to see on Acer's site.&nbsp; they do have an eRecovery function but I have to admit that this is a second hand computer and I have not done a recovery disk.&nbsp; I have however done one via windows with the programme as is but have not tried to boot
 from it yet.&nbsp; If it does not boot automatically do I have to do F8 or something like that to boot from the disk?<br />
<br />
I have cleaned and scrubbed.&nbsp; I have run maintenance and scannow I have deleted all of the temp files I can.&nbsp; Except the corrupt temp file which I cannot access.&nbsp; Could that file be deleted and just rebuilt in some way?<br />
<br />
When I run chkdsk (which is trying to run when I reboot) it stalls and says that it cannot do it.&nbsp; Something about Autocheck but it goes so fast I don't have the time to note it down.&nbsp; The key problem remains this corrupt file I think which is preventing me
 from doing all sorts of things as per normal.&nbsp; Also, I get a message re Accrobat 32 being corrupt as well although pdf files do seem to render<br />

If its a second hand PC, and you have'nt restored to factory condition, so as to start with a clean PC/installation, its allmost impossible to asertain what the problems are, and any cure. 


For one thing you have no idea what the previous user was doiing with the PC, in the worst case Kiddie ****

    <title>How to disable windows update in windows 10 home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> windows_ninetyfive  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to disable windows update in windows 10 home</h2>
                    I really dont want it updating automatically. I find it annoying. I dont care if theres any risks, I want to disable it. I have windows 10 home, and tried disabling the service, but some more stuff got put on my computer WITH NO WARNING NOR PERMISSION.
 I own this computer, it is my right to choose what updates to put on it. I feel violated as a customer, because microsoft still thinks they have permission to put stuff on my computer without asking me first. I already paid for the product. I'd rather have
 it nag me like windows 8 did to update to 10 than automatically update.

</p><p>Is it the&nbsp;interruption to your work&nbsp;when updates&nbsp;are installed that bothers you or is it the drain on a limited internet data allowance that results from downloading updates?&nbsp; If it is concern about your internet data allowance then I recommend both these

<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; You can prevent <strong>Windows updates </strong>from even downloading by setting your internet connection as "metered" and it has no side-effects.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is only officially&nbsp;available for WiFi connections but can be set up for others.&nbsp; If you want to do
 it then let me know what type of internet connection your computer has [WiFi, Ethernet, USB-tethered phone, ...] and I can give you the relevant procedure.&nbsp; If you are on a network that provides your internet connection then it is the connection between your
 computer and the network that is the relevant factor [<em>my computer is connected by an Ethernet cable to a "WISP" router that is connected by WiFi to my phone's WiFi Hotspot and the phone is connected to the internet through its 3G mobile data connection
 - in my case the relevant connection is that Ethernet connection, the other bits and pieces are irrelevant</em>].</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; <strong>App updates </strong>operate independently of Windows update.&nbsp; To prevent them happening automatically, log in to the Windows Store then click on your account picture to access account settings.&nbsp; Turn off
<em>Update apps automatically</em>.&nbsp; This precaution is necessary for the built-in apps not just ones that you have deliberately bought from the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you set up either of these solutions, you will need to check for Windows updates manually every so often [Settings, Update, Check for updates] and will need to visit the Store every once in a while to get updates for your apps.&nbsp; I go to my local library
 every few weeks to use their WiFi for updates.</p>

            <p>You start by unzipping the .zip file content to a folder (usually the folder is created automatically but not always, so when you see the"Extract To" directory prompt choose or create a folder for the destination/location where the unzipped file will reside).</p>
<p>Once the folder is created, use Windows Explorer to browse the contents of the driver folder that was created. You should see a file named "Setup.exe", double click on this file to start the driver install.</p>
<p>Generally the first driver you should install is the Motherboard/chipset driver, followed by the SATA, USB, LAN and other drivers (each of which should be unzipped to there own unique folder)</p>

                    <p>Help!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing this on one of my Dc's with Windows 2003 Service Pack 2, Dot Net 3.51 and the necessary KB's. I am in desperate need of the hotfix rollup package mentioned in this article (https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/969166), so I can
 complete the install. I am in desperate need of this and have emailed Microsoft, but don't think I will hear back in the timescale needed. I could cure it by installing dot net 4, but the company won't authorise the change this year. I have written powershell
 scripts to automate the migration and don't have the time or the skills to do it again in VB by Monday, all help gratefully received</p>

Screen Message:  For Realtek RTL8139(X)/8130/810X PCI Fast Ethernet Controller v2.13 (020326) PXE-E61 Media Test Failure, check cable PXE-M0F: Exiting PXE ROM  This message keeps scrolling continually until unit is manually powered down.  The HP laptop computer (Pavilion dv8220ca) was opened for an inspection regarding cleaning of cooling fan and area, but since unit has never been put on carpet, bed or other dust prone areas, it was remarkably clean for a system of approx 5 years of age. Hp's are noted (according to the well experienced person who dismantled it) for being a 'pain in the ****' because there is no direct path to what you want to get at. It's all in 'layers' compared to Dell, Acer and other manufacturers.  Everything work great until this time. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

            <p>&nbsp;I'd check Device Manager to see if the device in question has either ! or ? beside it.&nbsp; If so, something's worng somewhere. What device is it complaining about?&nbsp; Please post the exact message you're getting.</p>

<h2>            Transferring data from 360 slim to another 360 slim</h2>
                    
<p>So, the transfer cable is good and all, but, you can't transfer data from a slim xbox to another slim xbox. What's that about? With the gears 3 xbox coming out now, I'm sure a lot of people who rushed out to get the regular slim when it first came out are
 pretty upset that they can't get the data from their old slim to the new one...</p>

<p>I was also in the same boat and was forced to use a 16GB USB drive to transfer my stuff. &nbsp;I mean it's all very well saying that we can use a USB or re-grab stuff from your history but if like me you've had an Xbox 360 from day 1 there are plenty of DLC files
 that simply aren't there anymore!</p>
<p>Oh and it took me 5 hours to transfer everything! Five freaking hours!</p>
<p>I'm annoyed because I was lead to believe by AceyBongos (via Twitter) that there was a Slim to Slim cable due yet Xbox Support on Twitter kept saying that they couldn't comment on this.</p>
<p>AceyBongos today actually replied to us on Twitter saying "I dunno - did the shop not have them?" as if he expected there to be one!</p>

Are you using a third party Anti-virus software? If yes, try disabling and check if it helps.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.

<h3> navy1212  say:</h3>
<h2>            audio drivers wont install&#47; Audio output device not detected</h2>
                    My computer isnt recognizing an audio output device at all.. When i go into control panel, and try to select an audio playback device there is nothing under the playback audio tab even if i
 select to display hidden and disabled devices. All the drivers that are attempted to be installed are all corrupt and will not work. I even tried to buy an external sound card (creative recon 3d sound blaster) and still have the same issue with no device detected
 and corrupt driver installation.&nbsp;
<div>Nobody knows what the problem is, could it be that I have a bad mainboard? My mainboard model is an MSI N550GTX-Ti MDIGD5. Perhaps im missing something simple. Additional note: this is a custom
 built computer and have not had sound since it was built, is there a step that was missed? Please help and thanks.</div>

            That's the model number for your graphics card -<br />
If you want sound from your graphics card you need to use the HDMI output and have speakers<br />
in your monitor or TV.<br />
<br />
The Sound Blaster is the external USB&nbsp; one right ? Since USB can have it's own problems let's
<br />
start by disconnecting the Sound Blaster at least until you are able to install the integrated Audio<br />
drivers.<br />
<br />
Verify that Realtek HD Audio is not disabled in BIOS.<br />
<br />
Where did you get the drivers for the Realtek HD audio (assuming the motherboard uses<br />
Realtek - most do).&nbsp; The best place to get them is from the mfg's weg site. If the driver you<br />
have is corrupt download it again.<br />
- If there is a Realtek High Definition Audio driver installed and listed in <span style="font-style: italic">
Programs and Features</span> uninstall that driver and, after rebooting,&nbsp; install the new downloaded driver.<br />
If you continue having a problem try installing from <span style="font-style: italic">
Safe Mode</span> or <span style="font-style: italic">Clean Boot</span> -<br />

            Upon start up I hit F2 to enter the BIOS menu. I have verified that the HD audio control option is enabled. The drivers that are installed are coming from the windows update its self. I attempted
 to uninstall ever driver that says HD audio or REALTEK HD audio and restart the computer but it keeps installing corrupt drivers. I will attempt to go to the mfg website and try those drivers there. I think the main issue im having is that my system is not
 recognizing a playback device in the system. Is this simply because of the corrupt drivers?

            Setup Windows updates so it only informs you of the updates and does not install them<br />
automatically.<br />
I'm not sure what audio drivers Windows updates is installing. If it's not the Realtek drivers it may
<br />
only be a generic Windows audio driver, which is OK to have.<br />
<br />
Are you getting an error message that specifies a problem with&nbsp; corrupt drivers, or just assuming<br />
this to be the case ?<br />
If you have not been able to install the downloaded drivers and there are no Realtek drivers<br />
listed in Programs and Features, or you have uninstalled them, then there are no corrupt drivers<br />
installed. <br />
<br />
Windows will not recognise the Realtek, or Creative audio if no drivers are installed.<br />
I'm not sure, but think Windows generic drivers should still be able to produce sound without<br />
Realtek active.<br />

            Correction on that model number i gave you that was for my graphics card i was reading the wrong box.&nbsp;
<div>Second, yes the drivers that are attempted to be installed to have an error message which is as follows:&nbsp;Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted
 or missing. (Code 39).</div>
<div>Under the device manager selection, under sound i have 5 icons that all say "High Definition Audio Device" with a speaker icon to the left with a yellow exclamation point symbol indicating an issue with the item. After i right click and go to properties
 the above error message is what is displayed in the message box. When i select the option to Update Driver Software it notifies me that the most up to date driver and been installed in my system. So what should my next step be after know this information?
 Thank you for taking your time to try and help me by the way i have spent hours trying to figure this out.</div>

            As you have not been able to install either the Creative or Realtek drivers, and all the Audio<br />
options are flagged in Device Manager I would try uninstalling all the options in the list.<br />
If the Creative or Realtek drivers did install, but are not functioning then I would uninstall them<br />
via Programs and Features and uninstall the others via Device Manager.<br />
- There is are also two High Defenition Audio Controller&nbsp; listed in System Devices that uses the<br />
same driver. I would think they will also uninstall when you uninstall the Microsoft HD audio from<br />
Sound.... If not and they are also flagged I would uninstall them too.<br />
- Leave your Creative Audio card unattached to the PC<br />
- Before rebooting via the Start button (or Windows prompt that may come after uninstalling)<br />
disconnect from the internet.<br />
- After re-booting Windows should re-install it's generic HD Audio driver.<br />
- Verify your speakers - stereo or front are plugged into the green output<br />
- At this point there should only be only one audio device.&nbsp; Microsoft HD Audio ( in Properties<br />
mfg = Microsoft).<br />
- If Device Manager says the device is working properly then you should be good to go<br />
with installing&nbsp; the Realtek HD Audio drivers you downloaded from the motherboard mfg's site.<br />
<br />
If device manager still flags your audio, well, I don't know... I would be inclined to read more<br />
forums, wait for more ideas here,&nbsp; or boot with my Windows disk run a 'repair' reinstall.<br />
<br />
btw - My current Microsoft HD audio driver is version 6.1.7601.17514.<br />

            Well i have followed every step and piece of advice that you have given me with no luck. I'm clueless as to what the issue could be and think i am going to have to give in and take my computer
 to a repair shop and see if they can fix it. I will however post the results and the solution to the problem, if i ever happen to come across one.. My uneducated synopsis? Something must have gone wrong during the build of this computer to where the audio
 is available all together. What reason could there be for my system not even&nbsp;acknowledging that i have an audio out put device where the mainboard clearly comes with a default audio out option AND i purchased an additional external sound card. NONE of the
 drivers will install correctly, even from the MSI website directly. Not only that no matter what i do the system, once again will not recognize an auto output device. Some step was missed, or something is not connected correctly. Ill let you know what my outcome
 is so that in the off chance that s

            OK - I'll be interested in hearing what the problem was , as will others, no doubt.<br />
<br />
One more thing.&nbsp; If you are connecting the Creative card via the front panel USB have you verified<br />
that USB is working by connecting another device to it, or by connecting the Creative card to a<br />
back panel USB&nbsp; ?<br />
<br />
I would think it is something to do with Windows though if the Creative drivers won't install,<br />
and with that in mind you may save some money doing a 'repair' reinstall of Windows. It's a
<br />
fairly painless procedure.<br />

            Alright, so i just got my computer back and, you were right. Windows was completely jacked. I guess me not knowing came with inexperience and trusting someone to put together a computer for me. The guy told me over 50% of windows was corrupted and he reformatted
 my hard drive, reinstalled windows and bam we have sound baby. 120$ + 150$ sound card i didnt need + 20$ in gas money = alot of money that i didnt need to spend if i would have just had a genuine copy of windows to begin with.&nbsp;
<div>However i would like to thank all the inputs that you guys gave me and i will use it for further knowledge if something like this does happen again and hopefully this helps people in the future. Thanks again!</div>

The secrets out eh!&nbsp; You didn't get a genuine&nbsp; OEM disk when you bought the parts for the machine.<br />
" <span style="font-style: italic">Bad boy, bad boy, what ya gonna do, what you gonna do when they come for you</span>"&nbsp; :D<br />
I hope the repair man gave you the disk and key, so you can do repairs yourself in future.<br />
<br />
Anyway - lesson learned and your off and running. Have fun, mate....<br />
<br />
btw -<br />
I have a similar story. I was going to build a new machine but came across a machine from a<br />
young punk ;)&nbsp; who had installed dodgy Win7 Ultimate. <br />
I asked him why he had Ultimate when he didn't need it and his response was he just liked to<br />
have the best of everything.<br />
Then he started&nbsp; humming and hawing when I asked where the disk was as we packed <br />
up the machine, so I knew it was bogus.<br />
Not to worry though as I wasn't going to use Ultimate anyway because I wanted to image my old<br />
Win7 Home Premium to the new machine to make life easy ( didn't want to reinstall over 100 games<br />
and other software), so I bought an genuine OEM disk on the way home just for the new key.<br />
Still saved around&nbsp; $300- on a three month old machine, + an MS X6 keyboard and flash<br />
mouse pad as extras, so I'm not complaining (loudly)&nbsp;&nbsp; :D .<br />

<h2>            Getting stuck loading device driver. Computer will not boot up.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Recovery</p>
<p>I have recently purchased a usedsony laptop off Ebay with Windows Vista. I started&nbsp; it up with no problems. Then went online and proceeded to update the system. When done, I rebooted the laptop, now it comes on, but it gets stuck at loading a device driver(ckcdsk).
 Unfortunately it did not come with a recovery disk or original Windows disk. Can I get some help on this.</p>

            <p>hi</p>
<p><b><u>These are the various ways to reinstall Vista</u></b></p>
<p><span>contact the computer/laptop manufacturer and ask them to send you vista recovery disks to reinstall the operating system back the way it was when
 you bought it</span></p>
<p><span>they do that for a nominal $ cost</span></p>
<p><span>____________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>also ask them if you have a recovery partition on your hard drive to put it back to how you bought it</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>you would normally press F8, F9, F10 or F11 or Alt + F10 or 0 at boot to start the recovery process depending on the manufacturer</span></p>
<p><span>ask them for the exact key sequence</span></p>
<p><span>__________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>or borrow a microsoft vista dvd;
<u>not an HP, Acer etc recovery disk</u></span></p>
<p><span>make sure you borrow the correct 32bit or 64bit&nbsp;microsoft dvd&nbsp;for your computer</span></p>
<p><span>they contain all versions of vista</span></p>
<p><span>it is the product key&nbsp;that determines which vista version is installed</span></p>
