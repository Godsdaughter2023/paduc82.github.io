<h2>            Problems with .net framework 1.1 security updates and other elements - again&#33;</h2>

                    <span>On at least 2 previous occasions I have had problems with the security updates for .net framework 1.1 SP1 and each time I have followed the instructions to uninstall the whole .net framework and
 reinstall it. This worked each time until a further security update, which again failed.<br />
<br />
Having tried to find alternatives to this lengthy solution (my internet access is not brilliant) I finally decided to go through the whole show again, and downloaded all the required files from the Microsoft
</span><span>Article ID: 976982
</span><span>on this issue.<br />
<br />
First I ran the fix it 50123 program. I got the following message: The installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this package. This may indicate a problem with this package. The error code is 2738. I was given an option to
<span style="font-style: italic">get help </span>but unfortunately this did not link to anything helpful that I could see.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should have stopped at this point, but I continued to follow the rest of the instructions as they suggested it could be
<span style="font-style: italic">either</span> registry issues or the .net framework at fault.<br />
<br />
I used the .net cleanup tool to uninstall the whole framework as directed by the article, then reinstalled 1.1, 1.1SP1 and 3.5.<br />
<br />
I rebooted and checked for updates, which I installed. This solved the original problem in that the security update
</span><span>KB2416473 </span>
<span>for .net framework 1.1 finally installed successfully, but 2 other updates failed, one of which was related to the .net framework.<br />
<span>for .net framework 1.1 finally installed successfully, but 2 other updates failed, one of which was related to the .net framework.<br />
<br />
I now have an error message against .net framework 1.1 SP1 when I view update history. The error code is 643 and the
<span style="font-style: italic">more information</span> link says kbid = 867460. When I click on this all I get is a long list of numbers, all of which appear to be bug fixes or similar. Unlike most other entries, this does not state that it is an UPDATE. Is
 it possible that this could be the actual SP1? When I did the install, framework 1.1 SP1 appeared to install correctly (there were no error messages), but my program files list does not indicate SP1 against framework 1.1.
<br />
<br />
I tried to reinstall this service pack but got a message saying: The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable. Click OK to try again, or enter an alternative path to a folder containing the installation package 'netfx.msi'
 in the box below.<br />
<br />
Do I need to uninstall .net framework 3.5 again, then try to reinstall the service pack for 1.1 again?<br />
<br />
Also I am pretty sure that I did have .net framework 4 installed before I did this latest uninstall and reinstall. I am also pretty sure that after the last time I uninstalled and reinstalled 1.1 and 3.5, framework 4 was offered when I searched for updates.
 This has not happened on the latest occasion so I do not have .net framework 4. Do I need to download an install this separately? I must have had it installed at some point as I can see that
<br />
<br />
Can someone please help me to sort this out. I have suffered from this particular update failure each time a security update for framework 3.5 is issued, and this has been happening for more than 2 years now. I am totally confused by the whole issue now so
 would appreciate a reply that explains what I need to do as simply as possible!<br />
<br />
Thank you.</span>

<p>Please cite the KB number(s) of any .NET Framework update(s) failing to install (e.g., KB2539633; KB2468871; KB2449742; KB951847).</p>
<p>==========================================</p>
<p>NB: If you remove .NET Framework 3.5 (SP1) using the .NET Framework Cleanup Tool, reinstalling .NET Framework 3.5 will also install .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 and 3.0 SP2; then Windows Update will offer .NET Framework 3.5 SP1.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT! =&gt; If you remove .NET Framework 4.0 or 3.5 (SP1), reinstall your .NET Framework versions in the following order:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. .Net Framework 4.0, then...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. .Net Framework 3.5, then...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. .Net Framework 1.1, then...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. .Net Framework 1.1 SP1</p>

            If you have access to the Windows7 PC that has right driver that you need, you should be able to copy the driver to a USB drive and then load it to your PC as long as both are the same bit Operating System. Both systems need to match, either 32 or 64 bit.

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>If you're on a business network, you may want to bring this issue to the attention of the network/server administrator.</p>
<p>I suggest visiting your PC manufacturers website for driver updates, specifically the chipset drivers.</p>
<p>I see that some other hardware is not being installed correctly and this may be affecting the installation of the Nikon:</p>

<h2>            Fresh Paint Tutorials--Missing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I saw a demo of Fresh Paint for the Blue version of Windows (9) and I was intrigued. I found and installed (after considerable difficulty) the Windows 8 version and now I want to use it. Folks, the lack of a tutorial is unacceptable and speaks to the lack
 of understanding of this market and the&nbsp;intended audience. Pointing questioners at the FAQ is not nearly enough. You need a step-by-step walk through with videos and illustrations. While this program might seem intuitive for your developers, it's not for end-users
 (even computer literate end-users). Don't make me write a book about it.</p>

            <p>Julie is whistling past the graveyard...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was looking for tutorials on how to use this program. &nbsp;It would at least get me started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 in general is just bad when it comes to being intuitive. &nbsp; And the attitude that it is getting better because more people are using it is laughable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>More people are using it because they are forced to. &nbsp;I prefer that I didnt have to dance with this nightmare.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just purchased new windows 8 tablet bc my old one&nbsp; has a broken screen, which prevents the touch screen from working, and So I could no longer use Fresh Paint</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm assuming this is an updated version, but it looks more like a downgrade. It is way&nbsp; more difficult to use and it appears to have lost some features. Also, before there was type of tutorial for oil paints and regular paints, along with A "How-to" area
 that showed in pictures what each tool was and how to use it. I shouldn't need instructions but I'm not sure what to do and I'd really like to find the oil paints.</p>

            I couldn't agree more! I finally Googled it in frustration, and found You Tube posts which helped. Once I figured out how to right-click to bring down the palette and tools (I have a desktop...even worse!), it got easier. Still a lot I don't know, but
 I'll keep searching for clues lol. Seems a little silly to need to, but it's a great app and really feel/looks like old-fashioned painting...definitely worth the effort to learn. Wonder when the Powers That Be will recognize and fix the situation?

<p><span><span><strong><span>Hi Kenny_91,</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span><br />
1. What changes have you made prior to the issue?</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span>2. Were you using McAfee trail version?</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span>I would suggest you to check if the below steps assist you resolve the issue –</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span><br />
<span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>To check for the IP address you may use the command -<br />
<span>a. Click Start. Type &nbsp;<strong>cmd</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>b. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
ipconfig /all (there is a space between ipconfig and /) <br />
the ipconfig /all command displays Windows TCP/IP settings for all your network adapters.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>If your IP address for your Local Area Connection is either 0.0.0.0 or 169.x.x.x (where x is any number), then
 your computer is not getting an IP address from the router.&nbsp;<br />
If that is the case, try this:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>ipconfig
 /release in the command prompt and press ENTER</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>ipconfig
 /renew in the command prompt and press ENTER</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>c. Test it again by typing ipconfig /all to see what the address is?&nbsp; (If you are on a home router, it should start
 with either 192.168.1.x or 192.168.0.x or 10.x.x.x)</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>You may also refer to the below link and check according to the steps if all settings are proper -<br />
</span></span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-TCP-IP-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-TCP-IP-settings</span></span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:<br />
</span></strong></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>You may check if you face the same issue in safe mode with
 networking.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>You will have to select advanced options after booting using F8 and then select safe mode with networking.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
<br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In Safe mode with networking; you</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>have
 access to only basic files and drivers and includes the network drivers and service needed to access the internet or other computers on your network.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><strong><span>For
 booting in safe mode with networking refer to the below links -</span></strong></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />

<p><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span>Method 3:<br />
</span></strong></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>If you do not face issues in safe mode with networking then you may check in a clean boot state.<strong>To perform the clean
 boot follow the step 1 mentioned in the below article and then try checking in this clean boot state -</strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If the issue gets resolved check which non-Microsoft service is causing the problem; referring to the article and
 following other steps.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></span></span><span><span><span><strong><span>After
 you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>If the issue persists you may check if resetting the TCP/IP helps-<br />
To reset the TCP/IP stack go to this article and follow the instructions to manually reset the TCP/IP components (you may use the manual method for Windows 7):<br />

    <title>Chinese language support on Windows 7 Home Edition - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Chinese language support on Windows 7 Home Edition</h2>
                    <p>Hi, <br />
I have just purchased Windows 7 Home Edition (English version) and installed on my PC.
<br />
<br />
When I want to install the Chinese Language pack so that I can at least input and install Chinese programs as my old XP/Vista machines; I notice that "Install/Uninstall Language" option is not available.
<br />
<br />
Is it true that I need to have Windows 7 Ultimate in order to have this option? <br />
<br />
This is unbelieveable if this is the case. <br />
<br />
I am a Chinese America. I am used to the English UI on my PC but I need to input Chinese and use some Chinese banking software on my PC.
<br />
<br />
How can I fix this? <br />
<br />
Pls advise. Thanks!!!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Windows 7 language pack feature is supported only in Ultimate Edition. Not in Home Premium.<br />
<br />

<h2>            &#34;No firewire device found&#34; when tried to capture video using Canopus ADVC 110 on Windows 7</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>Original title: <span>Windows 7 and Canopus ADVC 110 compatibility</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Dear Sir,</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>My existing Setup is as follows -&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Operating System - Windows 7</strong> </span>
</p>
<p><span><strong>Pyramix audio workstation Software version 7&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>CPU - Quadcore Processor&nbsp;</strong> </span>
</p>
<p><span><strong>4 GB Ram.&nbsp;</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Motherboard DP55SG</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Canopus ADVC 110</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>I have a Canopus ADVC 110 which worked very good with &nbsp;Windows XP. I use an Audio Software Pyramix &nbsp;where ADVC 110 is used to capture the video . Now I changed my operating system to Windows 7 32 bit. My OS recognizes
 the IEEE firewire port &amp; the device, But still the Audio software shows as no firewire device found, hence not able to capture the video.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>In Windows XP the firewire port takes &nbsp;OHCI COMPLIANT &nbsp;IEEE 1394 HOST CONTROLLER &amp; the device is AVC COMPLIANT DV TAPE RECORDER/PLAYER.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>In Windows 7 the firewire port takes LSI OHCI COMPLIANT &nbsp;IEEE 1394 HOST CONTROLLER &amp; the device is AV/C COMPLIANT TAPE RECORDER/PLAYER.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>I changed my IEEE driver to OHCI COMPLIANT &nbsp;IEEE 1394 HOST CONTROLLER &nbsp;&amp; many other option's &amp; same with the device options still no luck. Windows 7 shows driver installed properly. I checked with my Audio Software &amp; there
 is no problem. Shifted back to windows XP &amp; everything works properly.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Hence reaching onto the conclusion that there is a driver compatibility problem in Windows 7.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Upgrading to Windows 7 is a must for me as my software gets updated.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Sir I have been using Canopus ADVC 110 for years without any problem.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Kindly let me know for any device or driver updates or alternate option's to solve this issue.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Eagerly waiting for your reply.</strong> </span>
</p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Regards,</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><strong><br />

<p><span>Hi Alok,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Re-install Pyramix and the Canopus ADVC 110 driver software using the Program compatibility assistant</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Even though the software is compatible with Windows 7, let us try to install the software in compatibility mode by choosing the compatibility
 level as Windows XP. <span>&nbsp;</span> Visit the link below to know how to install software designed for Windows Xp in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Install the legacy driver for IEEE firewire port</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Since you’ve already tried this step, I would still suggest you to choose the OHCI Compliant Host Controller driver while re-installing IEEE
 Firewire port driver</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the Start Button, type devmgmt.msc in the Start Search box and press Enter.<br />
Expand the "IEEE 1394 Bus Host Controllers" node in the device tree on the right hand pane</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right click the host controller node select "Update driver software ..."</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select "Browse my computer for driver software"</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select "let me pick from a list of device driver on my computer ..." and Check the box before “Show compatible hardware”.</span></p>
<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose the second option---1394 OHCI Compliant Host Controller (Legacy), and click next to update the driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance</span></p>

    <title>When trying to open the File Explorer in the taskbar, receiving error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mister jbcm  say:</h3>
<h2>            When trying to open the File Explorer in the taskbar, receiving error message&#58; &#34;The parameter is incorrect&#34; and homegroup in the navigation pane went missing while using the File explorer.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: [ERROR] FIle Explorer </p>
<p>1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I open the File Explorer in the taskbar, this pop-up appears. This leads for file explorer to closing. A workaround for me to use file explorer is to right-click the tray icon and navigate to the desired folders manually. I need a way for file explorer
 to work as it did before.</p>

<p>
</p><p>2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If ever related to the above problem, the homegroup in the navigation pane went missing while using the file explorer. As I read a few articles online concerning this, it somehow is related to registry. As someone incompetent in this kind of stuff, I would
 never touch these files. I did try a system restore but no luck. One thing I noticed was I download an image online and choose the destination folder, the homegroup is present in the navigation pane. Again, it might just be related to problem#1. If it still
 persists, what do I do to access the homegroup since this is the only way I know to do such?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you remember making any software or hardware changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could be related to any recent changes on the computer that might have corrupted any system files or User profile itself.</span></p>
<p>Let’s try the following steps and check.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>You may try performing a SFC scan on the computer which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If the issue persists after <span>performing the SFC scan, then you may try to check for the issue in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
new a User account</a></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create New a User Account:</strong></p>
<p>a. Search <strong>Command Prompt</strong> by typing <strong>cmd</strong> in the
<strong>charm screen</strong>.</p>
<p>b. Right click on <strong>cmd.exe</strong> and click on <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</p>
<p>c. Type “<strong>net user username password /add</strong>” without quotes.</p>
<p>d. Replace ‘<strong>username’ </strong>and ‘<strong>password’ </strong>with you chosen username and password.</p>
<p>e. If new user account works, refer steps on <strong>how to copy files to the new user profile</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Copy old files to new profile:</strong></p>
<p>a. Navigate to <strong>C:\Users\Corrupted_Profile_Name\. </strong>The profile name will be the
<strong>corrupted profile name</strong>.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Copy</strong> all the files. </p>
<p>c. Open <strong>Control panel</strong> and <strong>Folder View</strong> options uncheck
<strong>Hide protected operating system files</strong>.</p>
<p>d. Navigate to <strong>C:\Users\Corrupted_Profile_Name </strong>and copy <strong>
Appdata folder</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Do not copy these three files. NtUser.dat, NtUser.ini, NtUser.log.</p>
<p>e. Navigate to <strong>C:\Users\New_Profile_Name\.</strong></p>
<p>f. <strong>Paste </strong>all those files here.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro upgrades twice on my laptop. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthonybotano  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro upgrades twice on my laptop.</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 8.1 Pro, and upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; This was a pretty seamless upgrade, and I was able to use all of my apps from Windows 8.1.&nbsp; The operative word being WAS.&nbsp; My laptop at one point saw the Windows 10 Pro upgrade as a download, and I
 was able to avoid it because I already have Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; About 2 hours ago, my laptop was downloading and installing updates without my knowing.&nbsp; When coming back to my laptop, I discovered that my laptop was upgrading to Windows 10 Pro.....&nbsp; Again!&nbsp; I
 let it go knowing that interrupting this process can be the start of a very bad day.&nbsp; After finishing and logging in, I noticed my desktop had changed even with logging in with my Microsoft account, and I was getting popups that certain apps were no longer
 working.&nbsp; My wireless was also dead in the water, even after repairs and fixing DNS issues.&nbsp; The upgrade rendered Microsoft Office 2013, The Sims 4,&nbsp; my wireless card, a slew of apps including software used for work, completely useless and most wouldn't start
 up.&nbsp; The rest would crash after startup.&nbsp; I was able to revert through recovery to my previous version of Windows 10 Pro without a problem.&nbsp; So it seemed......&nbsp; The revert gave me back internet and a few other things, but I was still missing registry keys
 for multiple apps and so on.&nbsp; It seems that the upgrade and/or revert deleted registry keys, along with other software components.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is....&nbsp; Why would Windows 10 do this, and why would Windows 10 Pro upgrade itself?&nbsp; If software can detect and in the version of Windows 10 to match your version of 7 or 8.1, why can't it detect that you've already been through an upgrade?&nbsp;
 Is there an update causing a glitch? Is Windows 10 not recognizing what version of Pro that I have installed, and installing Pro anyway.&nbsp; This has not happened on any of my 3 desktops, just the laptop.&nbsp; I'm also looking at my girlfriends laptop, and Windows
 10 home is in her update list, but it is already been through the upgrade.&nbsp; I haven't heard of this happening, which leads me to believe it's linked to one or more updates that could be causing a new problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say that besides this issue, I've pretty much no other issues with Windows 10.&nbsp; I'm very happy with Windows 10, but would like to see an update to uninstall or turn off Cortana completely.&nbsp;

            <p>The computers are installing the "Cumulative Update" which results in the _report_ of a whole operating system being installed because after installation the "Build" is changed to a different version.&nbsp; In a sense, it is a "new" installation by way of the
 fact that the "build" number is changed.&nbsp; However, in reality, all that is happening is that a "patch" is being applied to cause the OS to "upgrade" to the new "Build Version."</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to problems with the current "cumulative update"... A _lot_ of people are reporting severe driver issues, app failures, hanging Windows OS and total system failures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be worse.&nbsp; My nearly brand spanking new Pipo W2F tablet, which was running fine with the original build of Windows 10 (installed via Windows Update reservation), was _utterly_ and _completely_ "bricked" by this "cumulative update."&nbsp; The "death"
 occurred during auto-restart. It is now as _dead_ as a door-nail (no response to the power button), and I have no recourse whatsoever.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After having had nothing but trouble with _THREE_ different computer upgrades to Windows 10... and (ironically) successful with only ONE _older_ computer...&nbsp; I cannot tell you how happy I am that I kept my main computer for last.&nbsp; There are certain registry
 alterations one can perform in the Windows Registry that will forever prevent Windows 7 (or 8) from being updated to Windows 10; (it cannot even be forcibly updated by Microsoft), and I have written all of those edits into my Windows Registry to prevent my
 main computer (wickedly powerful &amp; loaded with tons of 3rd party software), from being trashed via Windows 10 like my other computers were trashed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will run Windows 7 for as long as it is supported, and then I will turn to Linux.&nbsp; One of my 3 computers that was trashed by Windows 10 could not be successfully "rolled back" because the validation Key was corrupted during the roll-back.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
 my key sticker had lost (rubbed away) several letters/digits, and for that reason I could not even go back to Windows 7.&nbsp; So, I installed the latest version of Linux _with_ non-open source software.&nbsp; I am amazed at how far Linux has come, and I could _definitely_
 live with it.&nbsp; It came with free (or, to restate it: "included with no payment required") versions of just about every program I use (many of which involve video editing and conversion), and I have found there is absolutely _nothing_ which I could previously
 do via Windows that I cannot also do via Linux... and, as a matter of fact, the computer in question runs _significantly_ faster with Linux.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a strong feeling Microsoft is in the process of committing suicide; especially if they do in fact begin a "subscription" fee for updates after the "free year" expires.&nbsp; The subscription scheme is rumored to be called "Windows 365." You don't pay
 for the OS, only the future updates. (There _is_ surely a reason why Windows Update cannot be turned off).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps... I was an original Apple _fanatic_ right up until OSX ruined everything.&nbsp; I once built an Apple OS7.6-8 operating system _literally_ individual file by file. (You could actually "drag and drop" your way to the creation of an entire custom Apple operating
 system installation disc if you knew what you were doing.&nbsp; Ah, the good ole days).&nbsp; After OSX, I said "Bye Bye Apple" (forever), and I suspect I will be doing the same with Microsoft after they end support for Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Didn't look at all like a cumulative update - it was the full Windows 10 Upgrade process, including multiple restarts, the 0%-100% counter, the stages (Installing Files, Configuring, etc.) and even culminated in the "Hi" "We have....." screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that, there is no apparent negative impact and I have to say all (5) of the computers (3 desktop, 2 laptop) I have upgraded to 10 so far have gone extremely smoothly, and in only one instance did I have a problem; the Windows wireless network
 driver on my Dell laptop was horrible and I had to revert to an old Windows 7 version driver. Now working great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to say about paid updates in future (that would be very bad and might drive me to Linux) but I have to say Windows 10 is running very well for me today.</p>

            <p>Updated reply...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an 12 year old Gateway All-In-One that is the _only_ computer (out of 4) that successfully installed Windows 10 Upgrade, and ran without any issues.&nbsp; All three other computers were utter and complete upgrade nightmares, of which two were fubar; (with
 one of them "bricked").&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, with regard to the successful upgrade on the 12 year old Gateway... after the initial upgrade I used it for a couple of weeks, and then turned it off and set it aside all this time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your question/complaint gave me the idea of plugging it in, allowing it to update, and see what happens; (due to the fact that it has never had a single update via Windows Update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, it downloaded and installed the updates that I initially told you about (i.e. "Cumulative Update, etc...").&nbsp; Then, after all of that was installed, the computer initiated another download (which it is currently now downloading).&nbsp; It is called "Upgrade
 To Windows 10 Pro, version 1511, 10586."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the "newer build" I told you about.&nbsp; It is not a "re-download" and "re-installation" of the original Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; It is a _new_ installation to the latest "build" of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where you are absolutely correct is that it _IS_ apparently _another_ complete "upgrade"; (it sure is taking forever to download).&nbsp; In fact, the very fact that this download is _called_ "Upgrade To" proves your point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still must point out that this is not a "re-install" of the _same_ "Upgrade" you've already done.&nbsp; This is a _new_ install of a _new build_ of Windows 10 pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I watch the download progress, I am eager to find out if it will turn out to be my FOURTH Windows 10 trashed computer...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post an update after the process is complete, and after I have had the chance to actually test a few things; (or not).</p>

            <p>Hi JonKArnold, AnthonyBotano,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your 1st upgrade was from Windows 7 or 8 to 10, Build 10240 released July 29th&nbsp;this gives you the 0-100% counter the 1st time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second time probably was the upgrade to the 2nd big release of Windows 10, Build 10586 this one was released November 12th this one also gives you the 0-100% counter experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check your current build when you click start, type winver and run the winver program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 1st release&nbsp;(Threshold 1) has 10240 as build number, 2nd release (Threshold 2)&nbsp;has build number 10586, next is to be expected somewhere around end of March '16</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is by design in 10, every 4 month cycle there will be an upgrade to the new build improving your os and bringing you new features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In between you'll get cummultative updates &amp; security updates like you were used to before without the 'upgrade experience'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this clears it up for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>It clears up why Windows 10 is installing an upgrade, but the main problem hasn't been addressed.&nbsp; So.....&nbsp; Every time Windows 10 decides to upgrade itself, I'm going to lose data, and my software will once again be rendered useless.&nbsp; I have a feeling my
 post will become one of the main topics on this site, because others seem to have related issues even on other discussions/threads.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I became of another "glitch?" as well.&nbsp; Another laptop just yesterday received the update, quite a bit later than the pc that this topic was started over. The pc that just received the update/upgrade, is one of my desktops and I encountered the same issue
 with installed software as I did with the laptop.&nbsp; So even with a date set for an upgrade/update release, there's maybe no telling when your pc will actually upgrade.&nbsp; There is a setting to defer updates, but unlike previous versions of windows, I'm not seeing
 an option where you can choose what to download and install.&nbsp; Until I'm sure the problem I'm having won't happen again, I'll choose to defer upgrades.</p>

            <p>Update... "Re 12 year old Gateway &amp; completion of _all_ Windows 10 updates"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: This is "On Topic" because it involves the installation of the "Upgrade To Windows 10 Pro, version 1511, 10586."</p>
<p>
</p><p>WOO HOO!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The entire process went without a hitch.&nbsp; The Device Manager shows all devices installed and enabled. Desktop performance is significantly more "snappier" ("responsive") than before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few computer differences I can think of which _may_ explain why this computer has had _zero_ issues with the entire Windows 10 upgrade process (including zero issues with the Windows 10 _update_ process), as opposed to my other 3 (_much_ newer)
 computers which were utterly trashed by Windows 10 upgrade and/or Windows 10 _updates_.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) This Gateway AIO has a 32 bit system. (Question:&nbsp; Is it possible that the many issues people are having is related to being 64 bit systems?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I upgraded the computer to use SATA devices as opposed to the original ATA setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) The initial Windows 10 Upgrade was done with the "Media Creation Tool" rather than via Windows Update.&nbsp; All three of my Windows 10 "Failure" computers were upgraded via Windows Update "GWX Reservation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) This is the only computer that was upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; The others were "Home" upgrades.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I only mention this because the Windows 10 Pro "BUILD" Upgrade seems to only be auto-downloaded &amp; installed by Windows Update on computers with Windows
 10 *Pro* original "Builds."&nbsp; I have not heard of anyone else with "Home" versions complaining about an entire "Full System Upgrade Re-installation" on their Windows 10 *Home* systems.&nbsp; However, just because I haven't heard of it doesn't mean it's not happening).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I am one _very_ elated dude.&nbsp; I originally planned on selling this computer.&nbsp; However, since it is the _only_ computer I've been able to upgrade to Windows 10 without _any_ issues whatsoever... I think I'll hang onto it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps... I can imagine how it would be if this were my only computer.&nbsp; I would probably be all kinds of "Pro-Windows 10" and unable to understand how others can "trash talk" Windows 10 so much.&nbsp; However, given my _horrendous_ experience with Windows 10 upgrades
 on 3 other (nearly new) computers... I am in _no-way_ a Windows 10 advocate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway...&nbsp; (for now)</p>
<p>
WOO HOO!!!&nbsp; Happy Camper Alert!!!</p>

            <p>Here is what I'd suggest you can do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(See "One Final Note," below, before proceeding)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Disconnect _all_ external devices (except keyboard &amp; mouse).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Restart computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Run Windows 10 troubleshooting software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Restart computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Open Windows Update and start an update search; (if it is not already running by itself)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then allow the update/upgrade process to run again.&nbsp; It is possible that you may have external devices interfering with a _full_ upgrade.&nbsp; It is also possible you acquired a Windows Update "corruption," which is why I suggested running the troubleshooting
 software, which is designed to repair that issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>** One final note:&nbsp; There have been reports of people having issues with failure to complete updates which are caused by "Ghost Users." This can be resolved by looking at the list of "users".&nbsp; (Look for instructions on how to view the editable user profile
 list).&nbsp; If you have "Ghost Users" (i.e. "non-existent users") that somehow got added during update/upgrade processes and/or users who have been deleted but still exist in the profile list, you can delete them.&nbsp; Doing so has resolved issues for many people.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 So, you might want to check into that _first_ before doing as I listed above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to you, sir...</p>

            <p>Thanks Erik, that explains it. Odd way of updating though - scary. It would be better if they could give some visual indicator that it is just a big cumulative update, or install of a new build.</p>

</p><p>If what you are trying is to use an old version of Skype, unfortunately there is no longer an option to revert back to an old version of Skype for Android. We want to create the best possible app experience for our Skype users which means we have to make
 some changes along the way. These decisions are hard to make, but will enable us to focus our efforts on transitioning Skype from a peer-to-peer video and chat app to a modern, mobile friendly cloud architecture.</p>

</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. Thank you!

<h2>            Cannot access admin account on windows 8</h2>
                    I got a new windows 8 computer for christmas and my brother was the one to set it up before christmas (ik santa is fake) and he set it through email and made it *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (i understand you will remove this email for privacy)
 and he can't remember the password, we tried resetting the password so dont say i need to reset it. the reset was denied and i really need the password for the account to access my computer, i'm using his computer atm, i tried using system recovery BUT that
 requires the admin password which i don't know. I just really want you to PM me the password for that account.

I am having the same issue. I stopped using Hotmail as it was terrible and didn't work offline.&nbsp; I worked overseas where the Internet is expensive. Now I have a new computer and stupidly signed on with my old&nbsp;Hotmail address since Win 8 demanded a Hotmail address
 just to log on to my new computer.&nbsp; When tried to do something I had to remember the password. I filled in all the info correctly but&nbsp;I don't have the same phone number, and have a new credit card. I am not going to pass out other people's emails and subject
 lines as it is immoral but jeepers, this is a new computer so secure I can't use it?????&nbsp; My form said I&nbsp;didn't prove I was me.&nbsp; I also can't make a new email cuz&nbsp;when I do, I am not the administrator.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Please help. I am honestly on my last Win computer these have gotten so hard to use. Android took 10 minutes to learn. Windows 8, 20 years after using Windows, is still stressful.

<h2>            Videos not playing properly windows 10</h2>
                    I am running build 10240 and my graphics card is an amd radeon 7310. Every time that I try to watch a video, it plays the audio but not the video portion. I am given a black screen. Before you tell me to update my drivers I have already done that. SOmetimes
 I also get an error message that says error video could not be decoded. Very frustrating and I am very sorry that I upgraded to windows 10,

                    <p>I tried to update windows, but it says I have to restart the computer. I did this several times, but it just keeps telling me to restart my computer and does not work. According to my windowsupdate.log, I keep getting an error&nbsp;0x80070bc9. I have googled
 this and can't find anything that has worked so far. I already tried using fixit, but that did not work either. If anyone can figure this out, it would really help. Thanks!</p>

Level:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Information<br />
Description:<br />
Installation Ready: The following updates are downloaded and ready for installation. This computer is currently scheduled to install these updates on ‎Tuesday, ‎March ‎04, ‎2014 at 3:00 AM:
<br />
- Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2882822)<br />
- Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2872339)<br />
- Internet Explorer 10 for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems<br />
- Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I would expect the updates to fail to install. I suggest you select Start, All Programs, Windows Update, Change Settings. Under Important Updates is a box showing the current setting. Click on the Arrow down to the right and
 change the selection to “Check for Updates but let me choose whether to download and install them” and click on OK.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please then Start, All Programs, Windows Update, Check for Updates. Check the box before KB2882822 (make sure that the boxes before the other 3 updates listed above are not checked), click on Install and click again on Install
 in the next window and the process of installing starts. You should let the process proceed without interruption. Multi-tasking at the time updating is in progress is unwise. The progress window will tell you what is going on. You need to be patient. When
 it completes restart your computer. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I cannot be sure whether this attempt will succeed or fail. If it fails to install select Start, All Programs, Windows Update, View Update History, double click the failed update and post the Failure Code and Update reference
 number. Please tell me if it succeeds.</span></p>

            It didn't work. It still told me to restart my computer when I clicked "check for updates". There was nothing for me to check off or anything to choose what I wanted to install. It is just doing the same thing as usual, it did not fix it. I do not know
 if this will help, but it says I have never checked for windows update even though I have many times (even back when it was working). Here is an image if it helps at all.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd87d84d-b2ad-4ea7-839f-8f4a773598d4" />

    <title>Xbox Live Gold renewed a week early&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrsrabailey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Gold renewed a week early&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox Live Gold Account was set with the Auto Renew Option to off. (Which I purposely set). The expiration for this months subscription was&nbsp;11/27/2012.&nbsp;I added a new payment option to my account (paypal), and some how in the process renewed my monthly
 membership. I'm fine with the charge since I was setting this up to take place in a week anyhow. However, my subscription date and monthly renewal date has changed in the process as well. Now my&nbsp;renewal date is the 18th (today) and I've managed to&nbsp;virtually
 lose 9 days of paid xbox live. I don't want to refund the charge, however, I would like to get the full month that I paid for already. Can this be fixed or adjusted in anyway?&nbsp;</p>

<p>You shouldn't have lost those nine days...Because I know people who've bought 2-year membership cards and activated them both at once, and they weren't set to renew for two years.</p>

    <title>Is there a color filter that is automatically applied when starting a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> will_chris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a color filter that is automatically applied when starting a game on Xbox one x&#63; </h2>
                    <p>So I've noticed on my Xbox one x that when switching from the home screen or any app to a game there's a color filter automatically applied to the display settings. When I took a screen shot of a game then&nbsp;opened it and after going back into the GAME, I noticed that when viewing the shot on the Xbox that it looked more pure and colorful. So it looks like certain games I've experienced like pubg and witcher 3 have an almost slight yellow greyish tint to it in game and through out the quick menu, but it isn't there after you go to the home /dashboard. I'd like to know how to fix this or if it's something unaccessible. Also I feel like it's only on the Xbox one x when comparied to the normal Xbox one. This needs to be fixed asap. It takes away from gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
