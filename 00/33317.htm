<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>The Overlordian,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry you're having issues with your audio. Try changing your HDMI settings to "Auto Detect", and making sure you're not using uncompressed 5.1 audio (uncompressed CANNOT be passed through ARC ever). Instead try using one of the other audio settings
 like Dolby. Additionally visit&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/live-tv/connect-console-to-home-theater#1d758dcc92c94ea88363c212765adc3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">home theater set up</a>.&nbsp;<span><br />

<h2>            Lenovo G50 Slow After Factory Reset</h2>
                    <p>Okay so basically, my laptop crashed due to an EFI file gone missing(0xc0000034 i think) and so i put an ISO of a student windows 10 on a USB and booted up and repaired it through that (I did have the original but no disc came with the laptop)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After repairing it I decided to do a factory reset just incase it was a virus, however it ran into the night and the laptop was about to run out of battery and im cautious about leaving things on charge overnight, so i turned i let it run out through the
 night, when i turned it back on it said that it hadnt fully reset, so i said id reset it fully just to be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the second reset it has become unbearably slow, it takes several minutes for it to load up the interface for the file explorer then several more minutes for it to load up the folders in it, and when i change folder its just as slow. I've pictures where
 the thumbnail wont load at all and im not sure if this is because of the laptop but my USB has become corrupt aswell and i havent used it on any other device or moved anything onto it recently. It also refuses to play a dvd when i put one in or open the dvdplayer
 on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running SFC and DISM but both came back good so im not entirely sure which is causing this problem, I'm currently in college and the workload is too much to be dealing with this everyday or sending it away to be checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be grateful</p>
<p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How can sfc &#47;scannow be run on &#40;from outside&#41; a damaged Windows XP Installation&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>12Sep10 1220p edt</p>
<p>Re a Dell laptop that had WindowsXP Home on it; as of 9/5/10 it was pretty much up to date re Windows Updates (WinXP SP3? but still IE7 vs IE8).&nbsp; As it came from Dell in mid-2005, the HD has 3 partitions (one is C; believe one has files to restore Cdrive
 to DellFactory; believe one has Dell Diagnostics).</p>
<p>On 9/6, pc acting strange so clicked RESTART.&nbsp; Would not reboot to Windows in either normal or safe modes (hal.dll missing or corrupt).&nbsp; Attempts to boot using "Last known good configuration" failed.</p>
<p>May not be reasonably do-able, but I'm trying to patch up an apparently damaged install of Windows XP.&nbsp; After&nbsp; lots of diagnostic work, suspect hard-drive problems are the root cause so we've ordered a replacement HD.</p>
<p>Understand most would suggest a clean install of WinXP on the new HD BUT that would require reinstalling all programs etc from scratch (remembering what they were, coming up with sources to reinstall (some of which were OEM installs by Dell), etc), reinstalling
 all Windows Updates, etc.&nbsp; If possible, I'd like to recover this installation so I can have the option to copy it to a partition to the new HD and then delete what I don't want/need to keep.&nbsp; Another option might be to figure out how to use the Dell Restore
 To Factory partition on the old HD to recreate the original Cdrive on the new HD and then add apps not recd fr Dell and add all WinUpdates.</p>
<p>To make a long story short (can share more by email if it helps), have done a parallel install of XP to WINXP (vs WINDOWS) on the same Cdrive.&nbsp; I also did a Repair Install of XP over the existing WINDOWS dir.</p>
<p>Running WINXP, I have fortunately managed to copy (with great difficulty) most of "Documents and Settings" (including My Documents from&nbsp; WINDOWS) to our external HD.</p>
<p>Running WINXP, have manually patched up WINDOWS dir a bit by replacing some .sys and .dll files I've found were "missing".&nbsp; I&nbsp; managed to create bootlogs (ntbtlog.txt using both WINXP and WINDOWS) which shows a lot of drivers not being loaded (suspect these
 are due to some missing .sys or .dll).&nbsp; I started trying to investigate and resolve these one by one (putting copies of individual missing files from WINXP to WINDOWS) but its hugely time consuming and for some, it would seem I don't have the missing file
 anymore (not in WINDOWS or WINXP) so I'd have to go searching for it on the internet.</p>
<p>This has allowed me to now get WINDOWS to launch but its clearly damaged (no task mgr, no start menu, notepad.exe won't run, No CDRW showing, WinExp runs but features missing, etc).&nbsp; I managed to get a DOS window open and ran sfc /scannow from there but
 it didn't seem to do anything.</p>
<p>At this point, I suspect the registry files in WINDOWS\System32\Config are "OK" (vs what they were on 9/5) but its pretty clear there are still a bunch of files (and perhaps directoryies) "missing".</p>
<p>Given this, my goal at present is to get WINDOWS patched up enough so at least the basic Windows features are present and function (Start Menu, Task Manager, WinExp, Device Manager, Notepad.exe, CDRW showing, etc).&nbsp; From that point, figuring I would be able
 to reinstall Networking capability, address any higher level errors (eg, clean up .NET stuf, WinUpdates, programs, etc).</p>
<p>To accomplish this, seems I need to replace a bunch of still missing .sys and .dll files.&nbsp; Understand that's what SFC would do that (using the XPCD as source).&nbsp; Unfortunately seems SFC can't be run from the XPCD Recovery Console at all.</p>
<p>Since I can't get it to run within WINDOWS, if I launch my WINXP installation, how can I "run sfc on my WINDOWS installation" to replace basic missing .sys and .dll files re Windows XP (I've read about and tried sfc /scannow /offwindir=c:\WINDOWS&nbsp;/verifyonly&nbsp;but
 msg said the command wasn't recognized?)</p>
<p>If that's not possible, I'd appreciate any specific suggestions how to best get WINDOWS cleaned up to basic capabilities.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks<br />

<p>Too bad you did not seek assistance after the missing hal.dll message. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That is a common problem and can usually be resolved in just a few seconds (minutes if you count reboot time) and I have never reinstalled XP to fix it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The message indicating it is missing or corrupt is usually misleading, so the inclination is to try and replace it, but that is not simply copying in some file from some place. &nbsp;No... there is more to replacing it than that and it is never the real problem
 anyway. &nbsp;It is much simpler.</p>
<p>The missing or corrupt hal.dll message usually comes from an afflicted c:\boot.ini file which if you just have one&nbsp;installation&nbsp;on a single partition, you can use the XP Recovery Console to simply rename or&nbsp;delete&nbsp;the suspicious c:\boot.ini so there isn't
 one, then reboot. &nbsp;Since that kind of installation doesn't need a c:\boot.ini file in the first place, XP will&nbsp;complain about the missing file for a second or two, but still boot normally. &nbsp;Then you just fix the afflicted file.</p>
<p>I would use the XP Recovery Console to run a chkdsk /r on the system first though to make sure the file system was intact. &nbsp;It makes absolutely zero sense to start trying to copy files around here and there using trial and error methods on a file system
 that has lost it's integrity, so you may actually be making things worse (trying things). &nbsp;I think it would actually make negative sense if there was such a thing.</p>
<p>It sounds like it may be pretty messed up now, and sfc /scannow only cares about the 3498 files that Microsoft thinks are important and I have never fixed a problem using it either. &nbsp;It is a good time waster though and a popular thing to "try", but I have
 never seen it solve any problem.</p>
<p>What happens when you try to boot your original XP installation?</p>

<p>Resp to Wunders</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply but unfortunately&nbsp;all attempts to get benefit from System Restore features have not solved my present problems.</p>
<p>Right after first failed reboot to WINDOWS,&nbsp;we tried manually&nbsp;using Restore Points from Recovery Console -R using command prompt instructions from Dell Tech Phone Support (to find and manually copy 5 key registry filesets from a 9/2/10 Restore Point Folder
 (RP288 that we&nbsp;had ID'd&nbsp;using dir command) into WINDOWS\System32\Config folder but that failed (not authorized msg).&nbsp;</p>
<p>After launching the new WINXP and browsing using WinExp, I browsed to the C:\System Volume Information folder and found there were actually TWO subfolders each with multiple Restore Point (RPXXX) subfolders in them.&nbsp; One had 4 Restore Point subfolders&nbsp;with
 contents showing file dates &lt;9/6/10 (suggests&nbsp;they are good Restore Point filesets created by WINDOWS before the trouble on 9/6).&nbsp;&nbsp; The other has&nbsp;3 Restore Point subfolders with file dates indicating they have been created since and by the&nbsp;new install of WINXP.&nbsp;
 I took a snapshot copy of the whole System Volume Information folder for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Since then, I&nbsp;have also&nbsp;manually&nbsp;put renamed copies of&nbsp;the 5 key registry files (from the snapshot subfolder &nbsp;under several of the WINDOWS Restore Point subfolders)&nbsp;into the&nbsp;WINDOWS\System32\Config folder but it didn't&nbsp;seem to help or make much difference.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the WINDOWS\System32\Restore folder (in both WINDOWS and WINXP) only has&nbsp;one file&nbsp;(fileliist.xml) in it....the&nbsp;restrui.exe&nbsp;(executable I understand is reqd to run&nbsp;the "automated System Restore app using command prompt or Windows GUI) is not
 there.&nbsp; I haven't&nbsp;bothered pursuing the restrui.exe missing issue as it seems&nbsp;the tests I have done&nbsp;manually replacing the 5 key registry filesets in the&nbsp;WINDOWS\System32\Config folder have pretty much utilized any benefit System Restore had&nbsp;to offer.</p>
<p>I've browed all over the inet and read lots of docs and forum posts (including the 3 MSKB docs you mentioned) and tried most everything that seems relevant that&nbsp;I can do&nbsp;at this point but&nbsp;I'm still as described prior:&nbsp;</p>
<p>WINDOWS will&nbsp;now launch but its clearly damaged (no task mgr, no start menu, notepad.exe won't run, No CDRW showing, WinExp runs but features missing, etc).</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Resp to JoseIbarra</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply but FYI:</p>
<p>To make a long story shorter in my original post I didn't mention it but I DID seek assistance right after I got the reboot failure and the msg re "hal.dll is missing or corrupt" by getting a Dell Tech Phone Support Tech on the phone.&nbsp; They had me try a
 number of things using Recovery Console -r (logged to WINDOWS using command prompt) before they had me do the parallel XP installation to WINXP.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, its tough to keep accurate records of the exact steps and commands executed in a situation like that.&nbsp; I did take a few notes and pictures of many screens as we went but likely missed some stuf and some of the pix are marginally legible. After
 reviewing all the pix and reconstructing as best I can what was done during that call, the steps included:</p>
<p>a) tried to copy hal.dll from the XPCD into WINDOWS per&nbsp;C:\&gt;expand D:\i386\hal.dl_ C:\WINDOWS\System32\hal.dll<br />
b) executing a C:\&gt;bootcfg /rebuild command.....<br />
c) manually copied 5 key registry filesets from a 9/2/10 Restore Point Folder (RP288 that we had ID'd using dir command) into WINDOWS\System32\Config folder.</p>
<p>Both tasks&nbsp; a) and b) failed however after further review of my records task c) was SUCCESSFULLY accomplished.</p>
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; IN MY INITIAL "Resp to Wunders" I HAD INDICATED (from my memory) TASK c) HAD FAILED.&nbsp; THAT WAS INCORRECT, SORRY.</p>
<p>In hindsight, not 100% sure we did all we could/should have during that call to get tasks a) and b) successfully accomplished before doing the parallel installation to WINXP but I elected to follow the instructions from the Dell Tech.&nbsp; So after trying to
 reboot and getting another error msg re missing or corrupt hal.dll, they felt&nbsp;it was time to do the parallel installation.&nbsp; After they assured me that would not delete or modify anything outside WINXP), I went along with it given it could give me access to
 the HD (so I could get a copy of Documents and Settings.</p>
<p>With further benefit of hindsight, it seems the Dell Tech would have been well served to have had me use the Recovery Console to 1) verify C:\WINDOWS\System32\hal.dll was missing and 2) run CHKDSK /r from the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Since that 9/6 telecon with Dell,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I successfully resolved the missing hal.dll problem in WINDOWS (not a big deal, just took a copy from WINXP)<br />
&nbsp;have run CHKDSK /r from the Recovery Console at least three times.<br />
&nbsp;have run the Dell Diagnostics on the HD.<br />
&nbsp;have examined the boot.ini file and (based on lots of research and testing) concluded it is fine.<br />
The results from both CHKDSK /r and the Dell Diagnostics and the browsing I was able to do from the new WINXP installation all together convinced me (and DELL per a subsequent call to review my findings) that HD problems are the likely root cause for the problems
 encountered on 9/6.</p>
<p>as described prior:</p>
<p>WINDOWS will now launch but its clearly damaged (no task mgr, no start menu, notepad.exe won't run, No CDRW showing, WinExp runs but features missing, etc).</p>
<p><br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>I would not consider those very good instructions from Dell.</p>
<p>First, there a several different compressed hal.dlls on the XP CD and the XP installation picks the right one to match your hardware and motherboard at installation time.&nbsp; Take a look at all the compressed HALXXXX.DL_ files on your installation CD (7?).&nbsp;
 One of them will be picked to be your hal.dll at XP installation time (they are not interchangeable), but which one is the right one?&nbsp; You better know how to figure it out if you think yours needs replacing.</p>
<p>If you merely expanded HAL.DL_ to replace yours you would certainly get an new expanded hal.dll file, but you would have a one in 7 chance of it getting the right one.&nbsp; It would certainly be the wrong one for my system or any system I have ever fixed.&nbsp; If
 I wanted to replace mine, I would have to expand HALAACPI.DL_ instead. Maybe it is different from your machine, but somehow I think not unless you beat the 1 in 7 odds with the very boring generic HAL.DL_ file.</p>
<p>You can read this article and see why expanding HAL.DL_ will certainly get you a new hal.dll, but it is probably not a good idea unless you want the Standard PC (boring) hal.dll:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309283</a></p>
<p>If I chose to expand HAL.DL_, I would certainly get a new hal.dll and my system will sort of work (I have experimented with them all), but it would be the wrong one for my hardware.&nbsp; Since I understand it now, I am comfortable with experimenting because
 if something breaks, I know how to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are also concluding things are fine and suspecting things are okay with your other files, but your system is still afflicted and want to run sfc /scannow when I have never seen it fix a single problem in my life.&nbsp; Do you know how it works?&nbsp; Do you know
 what it does and doesn't do or does it just sound like something else to try.&nbsp; Trying things doesn't seem to be working out too well (and rarely does).&nbsp; With all your copying around of files and things, maybe you should see what happens when you run it. &nbsp;Maybe
 it will work.</p>
<p>And, since this hal.dll error message comes up somewhere just about every single day and I have learned how to successfully create the error message anytime I want, I also know exactly how to fix it without trying things - even if you give me a machine where
 the hal.dll was deleted on purpose, I can still fix it.&nbsp; I do things to fix it - not try things that might work maybe because I know what the message means.&nbsp; A long time ago, I would have thought to replace the hal.dll first too, but that is never the problem
 to date.&nbsp; Never. It is the first thing people want to do though and then there is a bunch of frustrating trying of things with the reinstall following shortly.</p>
<p>For your message, the hal.dll was probably never missing or corrupt and if the Dell people (or anyone suggests replacing it), that tells me that they have never actually seen the error sitting in front of them on a broken system and then fixed it with 100%
 certainly 100% of the time (actually figure it out).&nbsp;&nbsp; They are guessing or reading about what they think might work maybe or what should work.&nbsp; They have probably not ever really fixed it before except perhaps by chance - or as Dell would have suggested sooner
 or later, reinstall your XP (that is what they do when they can't figure things out).&nbsp; And I have never reinstalled XP to fix any problem and certainly not this problem, but I have fixed it many, many times (or now just give instructions so people can fix
 it themselves - they don't need me to help) by first getting them off the "I must replace my hal.dll" track they are most likely on from well meaning but wrong advice.</p>
<p>I don't see how a bad hard drive will cause your system to have any of the issues you describe (no task mgr, no start menu, etc.) that has nothing to do with your HDD.</p>
<p>Maybe between you and Wunders you will get it squared away, so good luck!</p>

<p>13Sep10 1030a edt</p>
<p>Resp To Resp to JoseIbarra - I would not consider those very good instructins from Dell.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your post and comments....</p>
<p>I understand I don't know a lot about these issues....and it seems you know a lot more than I do....esp re hal.dll.&nbsp; Good for you.</p>
<p>Some like me have had/chosen to learn by searching and reading a lot and by choosing to deal with their problems vs not.</p>
<p>In the case of hal.dll, I had never heard of it prior to 9/6 but did google and read a lot before deciding to call and get Dell Tech Support on the phone.&nbsp; When someone like me concludes they should get tech help/advice before doing anything, how would you
 decide exactly what to do?????&nbsp; My experience calling Dell or MS or multiple others for Tech Support is mixed.....depends on who you happen to get and you don't get to interview them very much before you have to decide if you are going to follow their suggestions.&nbsp;
 I for one do ask them a lot of questions if I sense what they are proposing I do to the machine might change anything or esp make things worse without ability to undo it.</p>
<p>Even deciding to go to a local shop can be an unknown....how does one know if the person that will deal with your machine really knows their stuf yet your option is to leave it or not without knowing what they know or what they will do with it (once they
 do something, it may be irreversable).</p>
<p>FYI, in my googling I never ran across any article or post with any indication of the critical need to pick the correct hal.dll IF one does have to replace a missing one on their machine.&nbsp; I look forward to reading the KB309283 at<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309283</a>
 and learning more about complexities re hal.dll.&nbsp; Thanks for sharing it.</p>
<p>Its nice for one to say they never try anything without knowing the exact result beforehand...but that's not possible for most of us as that means you must know everything.&nbsp; Most of what I have done on my own was diagnostic in nature.&nbsp; I have done some "testing"
 but in that case I think about what I plan to and if I think it might change something, I try to take measures so I will be able to undo it if I don't like the result.&nbsp; In some cases with these issues and the tools that are normally available, there are somethings
 one knows ahead of time will NOT be undo-able (eg, chkdsk /r, defrag, running sfc, installing XP over WINDOWS, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re your assertion "the hal.dll was probably never missing or corrupt" I have a different position.&nbsp; I believe it WAS missing as when I explored (and took as-found snapshot copies of) the whole WINDOWS directory from the new WINXP platform, the hal.dll file
 was NOT showing in the C:\WINDOWS\System32 folder (where it SHOULD be).&nbsp; Further, when I started comparing folder contents in WINDOWS to the same ones in the new WINXP there were a lot less files in System32 and System32\drivers (there should NOT have been
 less) so that vstongly suggested some of those files had "disappeared".&nbsp; That together with the CHKDSK /r results (finds and fixes errors on 3 successive runs), the Dell Diagnostic results ("Uncorrectable data error...") on the HD, and exam of the ntbtlog.txt
 (boot log) has pretty much convinced me our WINDOWS not booting issue was because it was looking for driver files that "had been there in good shape but now APPEARED to be missing"...that due to the "Uncorrectable data errors from the HD".</p>
<p>FYI one of the FIRST questions I asked the Dell Support Tech on 9/6 after sharing my info re symptoms etc was "what did they suspect as the root cause for driver files suddenly appearing to be missing"?&nbsp; They never mentioned possible HD read errors...even
 though I have now found a lot of posts where quite a few people have found this to be the true root cause for the symptom of "files disappearing".&nbsp; The only explanations the Dell Tech mentioned were some kind of virus or recent downloads that could have created
 "conflicts" (didn't seem likely to me but what do I know).</p>
<p>Believe I addressed your last question ("I don't see how a bad hard drive will cause your system to have any of the issues you describe (no tak mgr, no start menu, etc.) that has nothing to do with your HDD.") in my original post.&nbsp; Bottom line is "driver
 files that the registry is demanding but appear to be missing".</p>
<p>Live, listen, learn, and share<br />
Thanks again<br />

<p>Well if you are running the generic hal.dll right now, chances are good that XP has the wrong impression of your hardware.</p>
<p>When looking around the Internet for other posts with similar problems, try to find those that have happy endings and do not use words like try, might, maybe, could be etc.</p>
<p>The ntbtlog.txt will show show lots of "Did not load driver..." messages because that is the default logging configuration.&nbsp; It certainly does not mean that there is a problem and things are failing to load. &nbsp; It does not mean driver files are missing at
 all.&nbsp; It means XP looked at a list of potential drivers to load and decided that based on your configuration the driver was not necessary and therefore did not load it and logged it.&nbsp; It does not necessarily mean the file is missing. You could have Services
 disabled or turned off, features not installed, disabled...&nbsp; You certainly don't want XP to load up every single driver on your system - you only want it to load up what it needs to load.</p>
<p>Just because you see a "Did not load driver" message and if you actually look for the file and don't find it, that doesn't mean the file was ever there before or ever even needed.&nbsp; If you don't want to see those kinds of informational (not error) messages,
 just tell XP not to display them.</p>
<p>What do you mean "driver files the registry is demanding"?&nbsp; What driver files is the registry demanding, how do you determine it is demanding them - hopefully not from the messages in the ntbtlog.txt file - that is no indicator.&nbsp; If you are running the generic
 hal.dll file now, XP is thinking you have some other kind of hardware than what you really have and now XP is all mixed up (unless you got lucky and chose the right hal.dll), but XP is trying to do the best it can with the information you gave it.</p>
<p>You need to understand what the messages in the boot log mean and then determine if they are part of the problem or not.&nbsp; A "Did not load driver" message does not mean there is a problem.&nbsp; Now with your generic hal.dll file, XP might think it needs to load
 a lot less stuff than is required for your system to run properly.&nbsp; There is a difference between an informational message and an error message.</p>
<p>Dell is good about using phrases like some kind of conflict, some kind of corruption, some kind of virus, some kind of something when they don't know how to instantly fix things that is not in their book of solutions.&nbsp; That is usually followed by the reinstall
 your operating system phrase.&nbsp; End of call.&nbsp; They just want to mark their support calls "Case Closed", "Case Resolved", "Customer will reinstall - case closed"&nbsp; on support calls.&nbsp; That is how they get paid in support and they need to close their cases in minutes.&nbsp;
 The shorter the duration and the more you close in a day, the more recognition and promotions you will get.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just found this (my) old post so figured I'd post a SHORT "what happened" (in case it helps someone)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line, my gut was correct and the RootCause was the HD was "failing" (read and write errors).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it was tedious and labor intensive, got a new HD, paid someone to "mirror the old HD to the new HD", and then manually rebuilt the WinXP installation piece by piece (even file by file) and I LEARNED A LOT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The machine was pretty much "on its feet" by early Oct2010 (btw, the HAL.dll file I used was fine as it was taken from a "parallel install of XP I created on the same C volume" (even though MS cautions against doing that).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today its humming, I've since invested in two RAID1 1TB WD Ext HDs and have backed up all User Content (plus other D&amp;Ss) on this (plus 3 other machines on our home network).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My next challenge is to put IMAGEs of all the HDs on the Ext HDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LESSONS I LEARNED RE THIS EXPERIENCE</p>
<p>1) THINK very carefully before making moves that could be IRREVERSABLE</p>
<p>2) DON'T just accept whatever anyone says UNLESS you can sell yourself on it</p>
<p>3) IT IS HIGH RISK to procrastinate (as I did) getting good BACKUPs (clones, copies, VOLUME IMAGES, etc) in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to all that REPLIED for your efforts to help</p>
<p>Be Well,</p>

<h3> zacharydalonges  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple BSOD errors, computer won&#8217;t start</h2>
                    <p>So far i’ve experience these 3 errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-critical process died</p>
<p>-0xc000021a</p>
<p>-PROCESS1 INITIALIZATON FAILED</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to use my computer somewhat as it would startup but it was acting very strange. For instance chrome was crashing and there were green lines on my screen (weird). Occasional critical process died and computer would shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it moved onto automatic repair mode and I was able to go there once but as I was attempting a fix it crashed again. Now I am not able to even get into automatic repair mode as it crashes before then. Please help!</p>

            Hi Zachary.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC following the steps in the middle of the downloads page here:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   You can also try System Restore to a point before the problem began.  
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Zachary,
<br />Please check system journal (Event Viewer) for Kernel-Power errors. Reinstall video driver.
<br />Run chkdsk c: /f /r command, answer Yes and reboot computer.
<br />Run built-in Windows memory diagnostic and switch it in wide mode.
<br />Unfortunately it may be caused by video card faults too.

            Hi Zachary
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />
<br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. and select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />
<br />(Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.)
<br />
<br />If the troubleshooter hasn't helped, you can get in touch of an agent using the link below who can help you to get your copy activated:

<h2>            Gears of War 4 with an xbox 360 controller.</h2>
                    
<p>When Gears of War 4 releases I know it is very unlikely that I could ever officially&nbsp;play it with an Xbox 360 controller, but if I cant I will not be able to play Gears of War 4 with an xbox one controller because I am not coordinated enough. I will not
 use cronusmax because its too complicated for most people to figure out and the lack of coordination is from having a disability so other people have to help me with setting it up. If I could just do it myself I would use cronusmax. I was wondering if anyone
 could tell me if streaming&nbsp;from xbox one&nbsp;to pc while using an xbox 360 controller will ever happen. None of this will matter if Gears of War 4 is released for Windows 10, but thats a big if.</p>

<h2>            Installing windows 10 pro 64 bit on new PC</h2>
                    I want to Install windows 10 pro 64 bit on new PC , On my old PC I have windows 10 pro 32 bit , 9 years ago I bought old PC with OEM Vista OS , about 2-3 years ago I purchased windows 8 pro 32 bit for $40 by a download from microsoft and clean installed
 this on old PC on a new hard drive, since then I upgraded to windows 8.1 pro 32 bit &nbsp;and then upgraded to windows 10 pro 32 bit. Can I directly install the&nbsp;windows 10 pro 64 bit on new PC by USB drive created by mediacreationtool program or do I have to install
 windows 8 pro 32 bit via my windows 8 recovery CD then upgrade to win 8.1 pro 32 bit , then install windows 10 pro 64 bit on new PC by USB drive created by mediacreationtool program? Also will there be any activation issues?

</p><p>The correct way to uninstall the Windows 10 it was qualifying for previously is to delete it from the disk, using the installation disk.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the new PC after installing version 1511 from link I gave you above, making sure to delete all partitions during install to get it cleanest as illustrated in Wiki, follow the FAQ section here for Version 1511

<h2>            Windows 10 suddenly not connecting to internet.</h2>
                    Hi, my notebook suddenly can't connect to the internet after running a Windows 10 update. My router is working fine and there are no issues there. I can connect to the router with my notebook no problem there either. However my internet connection is not
 available. I've run trouble shooting several times and keep getting the same answer, Your connection to access point, router or cable modem is broken. Turn off your router (not the exact wording). I've done this several times. No luck. I've also done a restore
 to a couple days ago, no luck there either. The thing is, my router is fine, working through it now, my notebook connects to it fine, I can ping it, but when I try to go online it can't see the connection. Please help, getting desperate.&nbsp;

<h2>            SoundMAX Integrated Digital HD audio issues.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a HP laptop 6730s with vista business and SoundMAX Integrated Digital HD audio. When i pop up the soundMax audio settings,the "recording devices" section said "all audio devices are disabled". I have sound (music,skype etc...) but no microphone....
 and in my sound settings in "recording" tab is "No audio devices are installed". I thought I didn't have a microphone on my computer but went buying one and still doesn't work. Can I get help?</p>
<p>Here's my problem. I went checking on internet about it and it tells me I have to download new soundmax drivers and download a driver update program and the driver update tells me I have to download a bunch of other updater thingies that has nothing to do
 with sound.</p>

    <title>Family Safety URL filtering issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Family Safety URL filtering issue</h2>
                    I was playing around with the filtering for family safety and found this issue:<br />
<br />
First, for background, Youtube.com is blocked on my kids account based on age restrictions, I don't have a specific rule to block.<br />
I allowed one url(one video) from YouTube to be seen under the kids account. Logging in and going to YouTube.com is blocked, going directly by bing or other method to any other youtube video is blocked.<br />
Going directly or by search to that one allowed video is fine, however, once on YouTube the kids account can navigate to any other video they please as if youtube were not blocked at all. How can the universal block be put in place but leave the option to view
 a couple of subpages?<br />

<h2>            NAT is open but Service info is unavailable</h2>
                    
<p><span>I'm posting this again because the topic I posted in said "answered" even though it wasn't.</span></p>
<p><span>So, did anyone ever get this fixed? The reason I ask is because I've had this issue since March/April. Xbox support walked me through the usual details, none of which worked. Finally got them to take my system in for repair. Got a new system back with
 the same issues. I am occasionally able to join a mp game, but chat doesn't work half the time. My friends list will show up sporadically, but not often. Can barely access the store, and when I do, I get errors if I try to download something. My ps4, ps3 and
 360 don't have issues, along with all of my pc's. So it's not an internet issue, it's solely with the xb1. Please help!!!</span></p>

<p>If your console is already replaced it is more likely a problem with your router/modem or your provider. So please check out the settings of your networking gear and maybe ask your provider if they are aware of any issues of what you are experiencing.
</p>
<p>To be able to provide you with some more detailed help, please post some more information on your network environment as requested in one of the sticky posts of this forum.

<p>As I already stated, everything else connected to my network is working flawlessly. I've spoken with my ISP and they have not heard of any issues. Xb1 is the only thing not functioning properly on the network. &nbsp;I've jumped through so many hoops it's ridiculous.
 I have 0 packet loss, 30mbps down, 5mbps up, xbox says everything is fine with network. I've replaced Ethernet cables and that didn't work either. My xb1 is wired and I've tried connecting wirelessly as well. &nbsp;It seems that there are a lot of people with similar
 problems and no answers. Occasionally I have a good day with the xb1, but not that often.</p>

<p>As you said above your also own a 360. It's there anything on your router configured for use with the 360? Because the 360 and One use the same ports. So if f. e. having portforwarding configured for the 360 on your router that causes trouble with the One.
 Same thing if just using UPnp for the ports as sometimes ports are not closed correctly when not used anymore.</p>
<p>That's why I said it may be a router problem at your side. And this must not affect the rest of your network environment as your PC is not affected by this except you run a server on it.</p>
<p>So maybe provide us with some more details on how your router is set up so we may look a bit deeper in the problem you are experiencing and then find a solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I realize that the One and 360 use the same ports. I never set up port forwarding on the 360 because I never had reason to. It always worked fine without it. I have tried port forwarding on the One however and didn't have any luck. &nbsp;I have also tried turning
 UPnp off and that didn't help. What other information would you like? Is this what you were wanting to know? Also, I've tried clearing cache and removing alternate MAC address.</p>

<p>I don't know man. I don't think its your network. Xbox one has a garbage application that they need to fix. I've been having the same issue over the last month or so. I've had my xbox one since day one. I was good for a long time and now I always have issues.
 Nothing has changed on my network or in my environment. The last month it takes me multiple tries to view friends. My party chat doesn't always work. All of this worked fine before.</p>

            The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

<p>In the new Skype, your status should retain Online if you're not changing it. For best results, we strongly suggest you sign in only to one device at a time. Once you do that and the issue persists, proceed in uninstalling and reinstalling Skype. Make sure
 to restart your device before reinstalling.</p>

<p>Hi Julie_S1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestions ..</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>For best results, we strongly suggest you sign in only to one device at a time.<br />
==&gt;&gt; That's what I always do!</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Proceed in uninstalling and reinstalling Skype. Make sure to restart your device before reinstalling.<br />
==&gt;&gt; Done!<br />
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>In the new Skype, your status should retain Online if you're not changing it.<br />
==&gt;&gt; It does not stay active, when the 'Skype'-Window is not in focus! I made a call and changed the focus to another window. After about 1 or 2 minutes my partner said that my status is shown 'absent' (orange) on his windows client. Then I changed the focus
 back to the 'Skype'-Window and the status changed immediately to 'active' (green) on his windows client.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>My expectations are ..</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>When</span><span> </span>I <span>set</span><span> the</span><span> status</span><span>
</span><span>manually to</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>active</span><span>'</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>then it</span><span>should</span><span> stay</span><span>permanently</span><span>
</span><span>active</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>green</span><span>)</span><span>until</span><span>
</span><span>I</span><span> </span><span>do a "sign</span><span> </span><span>off"</span><span> even when the focus is not on the 'Skype'-Window!</span></li><li>It needs an option where I can set the behaviour of this to 'manual' or 'automatic'!</li></ul>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the activation and expiration status in the "System-&gt;Settings-&gt;Account-&gt;Subscriptions" section. If everything works, try to clear the cache by holding down the power button for 10 secs and try again. If it still doesn't work, delete your profile from
 the console and re-download it again.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi there Sooty,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue. Sorry to hear that you're having difficulty with an Xbox Live Gold 14 day trial subscription. As pointed out by our Ambassador, the redeemed codes will not be attached to the
 console directly, but to your account that it was redeemed to. You may check your Microsoft account by logging in with the same profile credentials on a different device (like a PC, smartphone, etc) and
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/check-xbox-live-bill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
check your purchase history</a> to ensure the redeemed code is on the correct account. If you've previously had a Xbox Live Gold subscription or a previous trial associated with your account, this may be why it isn't working.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you've successfully redeemed to the code to your account (that hasn't had a subscription prior) and the Xbox Live Gold subscription is not working, then it would be best to contact Xbox Support directly so that they may troubleshoot
 the issue for you. &nbsp;</p>
