<h2>            Take a full control of folders, subfolders and files</h2>
                    <p>I have a External HDD with folders and files created back when I used Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I change to Windows 10 and when I want to delete anything in that HDD I have to click continue</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried "Take ownership", "Take full control" in websites but I couldn't manage to apply my permission to subfolers and files</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to apply the full control to all subfolders and files?</p>

            Hey there JRox, if you want to take complete ownership of all files, I'd want you to go to the hard-drive image file in your file explorer and right click it. go to properties, then securities, click edit, and then finally allow all users to access the files (make sure you select apply to all subfolders and files aswell). This should solve your issue!

<p>Thanks for your reply but still doesn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the case my example folder "Portrait" I have full control of this folder check all dialog box from instructions, still, I have to manually edit permission in each folders in it</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f9b6930-0b65-4945-84ac-3b652fd385dc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f9b6930-0b65-4945-84ac-3b652fd385dc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to add my user now (DXXXXXX) to be the owner of folders and subfolders and files but all subfolders still don't have my user in that box, I have to manually do this to each folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image of user is different (one man and other users are two men), is that an issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is other folders' status in that External HDD, there is CREATOR OWNER that has none permission, I doubt this was a problem</p>

<h2>            Audio Sync issues when streaming Films&#47;TV</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am having Audi sync issues when streaming films and tv shows from my Windows 10 PC to my Xbox One S using the Films &amp; TV app.<br />
<br />
The Audio is always about 1.5 seconds behind the Video.<br />
<br />
My PC is connected to my network via a Cat 6 ethernet cable and my Xbox One S is also connected to my network via a Cat 6 ethernet cable.<br />
<br />
I have a broadband speed of 100mbps.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks

<span>Are you aware of any changes made to the PC prior to this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Are you facing this audio sync issue with any particular file?</span></p>

</p><p>If you still remember your <strong>old Skype Name</strong> and <strong>password</strong>, you can try using both to access it. You need to use the same credentials you've used when the Skype&nbsp;account was created.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have unfortunately forgotten the log in details, please proceed with the
<strong><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account recovery process</a></strong>. Fill out the form with the same information you have provided when you registered with Skype.

    <title>Installing Windows 8 Pro OEM on my laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing Windows 8 Pro OEM on my laptop</h2>
                    Hello guys,<br />
<br />
I have an HP notebook preloaded with Windows 8 OEM Single Language. I purchased this computer for business use and I need to make my computer join on my business domain. Due to obvious reasons, I purchased an OEM version of Windows 8 Pro while buying the laptop.
 I installed Windows 8 Pro OEM and had problems while installion due to BIOS injected Windows 8 key. I skipped it and installed Windows 8. After the installation, I tried to use my own key by using slmgr.vbs -ipk &lt;key&gt; and then slmgr.vbs -ato commands. Obviously,
 failed. Also tried activation by slui.exe 3 command too. Still not working. Any advices on how to install it? Windows 8 Pro OEM is not an upgrade kit btw.
<br />
<br />
Please help.<br />

            I don't want to install by doing that. I'd like to install Windows 8 Pro by clean installation and wanna get rid of unnecessary built-in softwares.<br />
<br />
Also, the key I've purchased is not an upgrade key. Are you %100 sure that it'll work just like that? Because to me, it's just upgrading.<br />

            <p>I strongly recommend you don't do that. If you must though try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>Boot from the Windows&nbsp;8 DVD</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Accept License Agreement</p>
<p>When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>Click Drive Options</p>
<p>Select the drive/s click Delete</p>
<p>Click New</p>
<p>Click Apply</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation</p>

            <p>Past experience with HP computers suggests that the OEM Win8 cd&nbsp;could be keyed to both your physical hardware (motherboard/HP BIOS) and possibly also to the existing OEM operating system/software that was installed on it.&nbsp; That prevents anyone from using
 the OEM upgrade/downgrade/whatever disk on any system other than the specific HP model(s) it was authorised for.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance HP recovery disks and many drivers won't install on an HP computer that has had the operating system replaced with a non-HP provided OS unless the harddrive is wiped clean first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of that unnecessary software may&nbsp;contain part&nbsp;of the HP identification key which could be preventing your OEM install from completing if the key isn't detected.

            You sure this is gonna work? Because the product key is embedded on the motherboard, not the hdd.

<h2>            emachines Welcome window and menu window keeps showing</h2>
                    I continue to get a window on the lower right hand of my monitor that says thank you for exploring the emachines E19T6W widescreen LVD display. &nbsp;It invites me to take a product tour which I have done . There are buttons on the side of the monitor for 'next
 topic' and 'end tour'.&nbsp;I punch these buttons and the window goes away for a moment, but contiunes to flash back on andoff. Very annoying as it covers up part of the screen. This has been going on for the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; The monitor is not new-I have
 had it for about 2 years..&nbsp;

<h2>            Skype for Mac - Log on Matter</h2>
                    <p>I recently changed my password for my skype account, and tried to log on again on my Mac, but it didn't work.</p>
<p>Instead, it said the program was old so that I had been logged out, so I tried to download the new one on the website, but it didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I delete the old one and install the new one again? But in this case, I can't find the way to do so.</p>
<p>Please advise me on this matter.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The reason why you cannot use Skype is because you are using a really old version of Skype. The version you have on your device is released on March 23<sup><span>rd&nbsp;</span></sup>of 2016. When we retire older versions of Skype, if you are still using an older
 version, you will be signed out of Skype automatically and won’t be able to sign in again until you upgrade to the latest version.</p>

</p><p>With Skype, your contacts are stored centrally on our servers so there's no need to update them manually. This should be the case as long as you sign in with the same Skype account and password.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t run Microsoft Solitaire Collection on Windows 10</h2>
                    My Solitaire Collection on Windows 10 quit working on May 3, 2016.&nbsp; Other games that are accessible from the Xbox tile on the "start menu" all work fine.&nbsp; When I go to the Windows Store and look for the Solitaire Collection it says that the game is already
 installed.&nbsp; There seems to be no way to "uninstall" my current installation and start over.&nbsp; I've located the area where game information is stored in Windows 10 and there's stuff for Solitaire that is structured in a way that is similar to what's stored for
 other games, however there's no way for me to be sure that what is there is actually correct.&nbsp; There's another tile on the "start menu" for "Xbox Live - Microsoft Solitaire Collection" that I used to be able to click and get access to Solitaire and my other
 games.&nbsp; Now clicking this tile has no visible result.&nbsp; Going to the Microsoft Store and trying to "open" the game does nothing either. &nbsp;In the past I've had short "outages" but it has alw

            Thank you for your suggestions.&nbsp; Unfortunately none of them resolved the issue.&nbsp; I had previously run the Windows checks and looked at the Microsoft Solitaire Collection.&nbsp; I'm using Norton Internet Security and it doesn't seem to have any optiond to list
 specifics programs or apps for special privileges.&nbsp; I also power cycled my cable modem and router.&nbsp; Still can't run Microsoft Solitaire.&nbsp; And as before I can run several other Microsoft games.

            I've uninstalled and reinstalled Microsoft Solitaire Collection a couple times.&nbsp; Each time I get the same results.&nbsp; when I click "Play" nothing visible happens and the app doesn't show up when I look for it with Task Manager.&nbsp; I finally decided to call
 Microsoft Tech Support.&nbsp; After finally getting to someone who was able to start looking at the problem, she had me run a couple of diagnostic tools to check the integrity of my Windows installation.&nbsp; The first one took 20 minutes to complete and after starting
 the other check she said it would also take at least as long so she disconnected and said to call back if that didn't fix the problem.&nbsp; It didn't fix the problem and I haven't called back but I do have a case number.

            <p>I tried all the things that were suggested in the previous response.&nbsp; None of them made any difference.&nbsp; One thing that I do see is the Microsoft Sudoku is shown in Apps &amp; Features as having a size of 132 MB while the installation of Microsoft Solitaire
 Collection is shown with a size of 68.0 KB.&nbsp; My other games from the same family / suite also have&nbsp;sizes over 100 MB. &nbsp;I suppose that it is possible that these are correct, but it just seems really odd that one is very large and one pretty small, unless the
 architecture of the two apps is very different.&nbsp; I would think that the Xbox Live apps would be built around the same platform with game unique additions.&nbsp; Maybe that's not the case or maybe there's some reason that the app is not downloading completely even
 though the Microsoft Store says the app is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'll next need to give the 800 number a call and go through the challenge presented by interaction with the Microsoft Support team.</p>

            My Microsoft Solitaire Collection suddenly came back to life with the Windows 10 update that came out on May 10, 2016.&nbsp; At the time it started to work I was offered (or maybe forced) the opportunity to use the Premium version for 10 days.&nbsp; That's what
 I'm using now.&nbsp; It was able to recover my game history.&nbsp; We'll see what happens when the trial period is up.

<h2>            Problems when Installing Windows Imaging Component</h2>

<div><br />
<div><br />
2) According to the link you provided the supported Operating Systems are:
<div><br />
<div>
<p><i>Windows Server 2003 R2 Datacenter x64 Edition, Windows Server 2003 R2 Enterprise x64 Edition, Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition , Windows Server 2003 x64 editions, Windows XP 64-bit, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition&nbsp;<span>64-bit Windows XP
 SP2 or 64-bit Windows Server 2003</span></i></p>

<p><br />

<h2>            Asus tranformer needs more storage for the update on windows 10</h2>
                    have windows 10 on my tp200SA &nbsp;Asus, but I cannot get the windows 10 updates as I do not have&nbsp;enough storage space. I have removed every app that I was able to. I have nothing more to remove. I have done disc clean up&nbsp; still cannot get enough storage space.&nbsp;I
 am literally down to bare bones. I was told by Asus support to get a empty flash drive&nbsp;for temporary storage and that it would allow the update. But there is no option to use that drive for&nbsp;the update. Has anyone had this issue and if so can it be resolved?&nbsp;Thanks&nbsp;

<p>Which Windows 10 updates are you referring to?&nbsp; The regular security updates or the annual version updates (such as Creators)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a ASUS Transformerbook T100TAF.&nbsp; Although creators update went on ok, previous version updates (anniversary) would not install due to lack of HDD space.&nbsp; I ended up creating an installer from ISO on a bootable USB drive and ran the update from that.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• 2017-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB4019472). Updates are available, but we temporarily need 1.06 GB-1.06 GB of space to download. Remove
 some things you don't need right now and we'll try again. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So I have removed all I can. I am not a techie by any stretch, so I do not understand your work around. I was told by Asus to just put in the flash drive and update would go ahead.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;How important is it to get these updates? Do you know? </span></span></p>

    <title>Tips and Guide for Black Ops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maverick0217-ba7bf97b-976a-4ff0-998f-452e3e1d64b0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tips and Guide for Black Ops</h2>
                    
<p>Welcome to Sinister Syndicate’s Multiplayer Guide! This four-part guide will tell you everything you want to know from game types, to weapons, to challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops is the most recent entry into the long-running series of war games. While
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Call of Duty</span> started primarily with games centered around World War II, popular opinion has generally shifted away from that war and into more modern conflicts. This isn't a guide for Modern Warfare, though, so
 not that modern. Black Ops as a game is set primarily in the conflicts in Vietnam, and the events surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis. This only matters to us in the Multiplayer guide because it sets the tone of the game; what settings will be included in
 the maps, what outfits will look like, what factions are available for play, and most importantly, what weapons are available. Black Ops is Treyarch's fresh entry to the series, after their success with World At War. It's a departure from the recent and successful
 Modern Warfare games by Infinity Ward, but is also much better supported, especially now that IW barely exists.
</li><li><b>Basics of the Game</b> </li></ul>
<p>It wouldn't be a Call of Duty Black Ops Multiplayer guide if I didn't talk about the multiplayer though, now would it? So here we go. The basics of the multiplayer game modes are all the same; you're a man fighting other men with guns in various environments.
 There are two main resources to keep yourself aware of in the game. EXP and COD Bucks.</p>
<p><b>EXP </b>is just what it sounds like, to anyone who has ever played a video game. You gain EXP to level up, which grants you access to better guns. Unlike the Modern Warfare games, leveling up does not get you new perks or kill streaks. Levels only unlock
 new weapons, allow you to customize guns and face paints, and unlock certain other features such as layers for your emblem and prestige modes. EXP is earned by killing players, completing challenges, capturing and defending objectives, winning matches, and
 other similar actions in game.</p>
<p><b>COD Bucks</b> are an in-game currency that you earn in much the same way as EXP. The difference is in its use.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">COD Bucks</span> rack up while you play until you spend them or you prestige. What can you buy with COD Bucks? Everything! You have to buy weapons to use them, and buy attachments to equip them. You have to buy the ability
 to paint your gun and put your emblem on it, or to customize your sights. You have to buy perks and their upgrades. You have to buy grenades or equipment to use. You even have to buy each layer of your emblem and each individual symbol you want to use.</p>
<p>Contracts are time-limited challenges that you purchase for COD Bucks if you complete them, you get more money than you put into buying them. If you fail, you lose your investment.</p>
<p>Sound confusing? Read on, it will all be explained.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Kill streaks in Black Ops</b> </li></ul>
<p>Anyone familiar with the more recent Call of Duty games knows about Kill streaks. In Black Ops, unlike Modern Warfare 2, they go up to 11 kills. Kills made by your kill streaks do not count towards your next kill streak. Each kill streak can only be earned
 once per life, so if you earn all three you'll have to die before you start earning any more. The kill streaks are:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Spy Plane: 3 Kills.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; RC-XD: 3 Kills.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Counter Spy Plane: 4 Kills.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; SAM Turret: 4 Kills.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Care Package: 5 Kills</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Napalm Strike: 5 Kills.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/27/e/27e79278afd9b358d3c1eefcff4eefaafc2f3cf8_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Sentry Gun: 6 Kills</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Mortar Team: 6 Kills</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Attack Helicopter: 7 Kills.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Valkyrie Rockets: 7 Kills.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Blackbird: 8 Kills.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Rolling Thunder: 8 Kills.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Chopper Gunner: 9 Kills.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Attack Dogs: 11 Kills.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Gunship: 11 Kills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Black Ops Perks</b> </li></ul>
<p>As always, Perks are a large part of game play. They can protect you from air support, allow you to move and aim faster, hide you from enemies, and let you see equipment. There are three perk slots: Blue, Orange, and Green. You can have one of each type
 of perk, to mix and match. Blue perks choose your player model. Each perk also has a Pro version, unlocked by completing certain challenges for it. More on that later in the guide.</p>
<p><b>Blue Perks: </b></p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightweight</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Scavenger</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Ghost</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardline</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Flak Jacket</p>
<p><b>Orange Perks:</b></p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardened<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/a9/2/a923fbd848316c0d3a66b22c0b17a29c6c5e7236_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Scout</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Steady Aim</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleight of Hand</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Warlord</p>
<p><b>Green Perks: </b></p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Marathon</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Ninja</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Second Chance</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Hacker</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Tactical Mask</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Other Aspects</b> </li></ul>
<p>The customizability of your player in the game is nothing to be scoffed at. How can you
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">customize </span>yourself? This Call of Duty Black Ops multiplayer guide will tell you!</p>
<p>Perks are the first method of customization. Your first perk chooses the look of your character. Once you unlock the ability to, you can change the face paint of your character as well. You can choose your clan tag, and you can etch it into your gun. Speaking
 of your guns, you can paint them different cameos, change the color and dot of the sights, and paint your emblem on them.</p>
<p>Your emblem consists of a number of layers, each of which you can add one of a selection of symbols to, in various colors. Use your creativity to make whatever you want! Just don't make it offensive, or Treyarch will remove it.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Call of Duty Black Ops Multiplayer Gametypes</b> </li></ul>
<p>The core to multiplayer is the gametypes, and this wouldn't be a good guide if it didn't cover them for you. So here we are, the Call of Duty Black Ops
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">multiplayer </span>gametypes.</p>
<p>Gametypes fall into two categories; <i>Player Match</i> and <i>Wager Match</i>. Player Matches are the standard deathmatch and objective variants, while Wager Matches are a new addition to Black Ops. Wager matches allow you to play one of four specific game
 modes at one of three ante levels, with your COD Bucks on the line. Win and you can take home as much as three times your bid; lose and you can lose it all. There's also the thing type,
<i>Combat Training,</i> which is regular Player Matches using bots.</p>
<p><b>Player Matches </b>divide into four groups. <i>Core, Hardcore, Barebones, </i>
and <i>Prestige.</i> There's also a fifth group for new map packs when they come out, to play just those maps.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/98/0/980b724afb37603833a911bc0480a5e5ea63bc6b_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p><b>Core</b> includes:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Team Deathmatch: 6v6 kill everyone. Reach a score limit of 7500 with 100 points per kill.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercenary Team Deathmatch: Team Deathmatch that disallows parties of organized players.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Free For All: 8 player battle royale with 5 points per kill and a score limit of 150.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Domination: 6v6 teams capture and defend 3 map points to a score limit of 200.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Ground War: Domination and Team Deathmatch with higher score limits and 9v9 teams.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Demolition: Two bomb sites on a map. Every player has a bomb. 6v6, one team defends.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Sabotage: 6v6, each team has a bomb site, with a neutral bomb. Defend your bomb site and destroy the other one!</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Headquarters: A neutral objective appears randomly; 6v6 teams try to capture it and hold it to gain points until it moves.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Capture the Flag: Two flags, 6v6, classic game type.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Search and Destroy: One bomb site, one bomb, 6v6 teams on offense and defense; no respawns.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Team Tactical: 4v4 teams with Headquarters, Search and Destroy, Sabotage, Domination, and Team Deathmatch</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hardcore, Barebones, and Wager Matches</b> </li></ul>
<p><b>Hardcore</b> mode ups the danger! Players have much lower health, no HUD, no radar unless a Spy Plane is called in, and friendly fire is on. Hardcore gametypes include:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Team Deathmath</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Search and Destroy</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Free For All</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Headquarters<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/2f/6/2f61958e979e3040b8adb7e18ebd1bc973b161ef_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Capture the Flag</p>
<p><b>Barebones</b> game modes strip the game to it's basics. There are three types.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Pure: No Perks, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Kill streaks</span>, Attachments, Equipment, or Contracts. Team Deathmatch and Free For All</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Classic: No Attachments or Equipment and kill streaks are set to Spy Plane, Napalm Strike, Attack Chopper.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Team Tactical: 4v4 with no Perks, Killstreaks, Attachments, Equipment, or Contracts.</p>
<p><b>Wager Matches </b>have three ante levels: 10, 1,000, or 10,000 buy in with a double-down option. Only the 10-buck level allows parties. They come in four flavors:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; One In The Chamber: Players have 3 lives, a pistol with 1 bullet, and a knife. Bullets kill instantly and when you kill someone, you get another bullet.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharpshooter: Every player gets an identical weapon, which changes every 45 seconds. Kills net you perks that stick until you die.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Sticks and Stones: Players only get the Ballistic Knife, the Crossbow, and the Tomahawk. Kills with the first two net you points, the tomahawk makes the enemy lose all of theirs.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Gun Game: 20 tiers of weapons from a pistol all the way to missile launchers. Players start at tier 1 and each kill bumps them up a tier. Being knifed lowers you a tier. First to kill with the final tier wins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the second article in the Call of Duty Black Ops multiplayer guide. This article will cover weapons and equipment in the Black Ops multiplayer mode, from the SMGs and **** Rifles all the way to grenades and the crossbow. Read on to learn all
 there is to learn!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Call of Duty Black Ops Weapons Guide</b> </li></ul>
<p>In this second part of Sinister Syndicate Black Op<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/07/9/07995d72cb80d4a6f223346e198670d6ab432fac_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a>s guide, we cover weapons. Obviously essential to combat, your weapon does a lot to determine your playstyle. Whether you choose the faster-moving faster-firing SMGs, or the slow-moving high-power LMGs, or split the difference with the **** rifles, it
 all makes a difference. Even your secondary matters; do you go in for a launcher to help take out air support, or do you run with the ballistic knife for some in-your-face stabbing action?</p>
<p>Well, before you spend your hard-earned COD Bucks on something you're not even sure you'll like, be sure to research your choices in this
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Call of Duty Black Ops</span> Weapons Guide. Each section over the next few pages will cover the primary weapons, secondary weapons, grenades and equipment. But first, we'll take a look at attachments and customization.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weapon Attachments and Customization</b> </li></ul>
<p>Almost as important as your choice in gun is the choice of the attachments you put on it. Every attachment costs COD Bucks to buy, for each weapon; you want to buy a silencer for two guns, you have to buy it twice. Thankfully, once you buy it, it's yours
 until you decide to prestige. Never going to prestige? Go hog-wild with your purchases.</p>
<p>Each attachment cost<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/79/0/790b55a8fbcb3354ba62364220f7412e1f011069_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a>s a certain amount of COD Bucks, spread into six tiers.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; 250: Upgraded Iron Sights</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; 500: Snub Nose</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; 750: Speed Reloader</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,000: Extended Mags, Dual Mags, ACOG Sight, Red Dot Sight, Reflex Sight, Masterkey Shotgun, Flamethrower, Foregrip</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,000: Infrared Scope, Suppressor, Variable Zoom</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; 3,000: M203 Grenade Launcher</p>
<p>Some of these attachments are just for secondaries, like the Upgraded Irons and the Snub Nose. The rest are for various primary weapons, with the **** Rifles getting the most variety. For a more detailed look at each gun and attachment, check out
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">this guide</span>.</p>
<p><b>Customization</b> is only available for primary weapons. At level 16 you can paint your emblem on your gun, and at level 19 you can etch your clan tag into it as well. At level 22 you unlock gun cameos. At level 25 you can change the color a<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/43/f/43fb3b3c8b35d34bdda242d71515f14364e475ac_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a>nd shape of your lense dot. At level 28 you can change the lense color itself. The costs are:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Gun Camo Colors: 250 each. Gold camo unlocks at Prestige 14.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Dot Sight Shapes: 500 each.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Dot Sight Colors: 250 each.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Sight Lense Colors: 500 each.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Emblem and Clan Tag: 1,000 each.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Black Ops Weapons List: SMGs</b> </li></ul>
<p>In the first part of the actual Call of Duty Black Ops weapons list, we have the primary weapons the SMGs. SMGs are fast-moving guns that fire quickly and have a limited supply of bullets. They're mostly for players who love to be mobile, who can't stand
 to sit in one place to camp. Every SMG costs 2,000 COD Bucks to purchase except the MP5K which is automatically unlocked. You have to buy all of them to unlock the classified Kiparis.</p>
<p>The <b>MP5K</b> is unlocked at level 1 and is part of the default SMG class. It's effective at close range but has a high damage drop at medium range.</p>
<p>The <b>Skorpion </b>is unlocked at level 7. It has the highest damage of any SMG, but drops off significantly beyond very close range.</p>
<p>The <b>MAC11 </b>is unlocked at level 11. It has a high fire rate, but all around lower damage.</p>
<p>The <b>AK74u </b>comes at level 17. It has a decent damage level, similar to the MP5K, but with a decet clip size and high recoil. It's almost more of an **** rifle.</p>
<p>The <b>Uzi </b>is unlocked at level 23. Like the MAC11, it has high recoil, low damage, and a high rate of fire.</p>
<p>The <b>PM63 </b>unlocks at level 29. It has a high rate of fire, the same standard low damage of SMGs, and a reasonably low recoil.</p>
<p>The <b>MPL </b>comes next at level 35. Low damage, high recoil, high rate of fire, it's standard for SMGs.</p>
<p>The <b>Spectre </b>is the last non-classified SMG, unlocked at level 41. It's almost identical to the MPL only a lower recoil.</p>
<p>The <b>Kiparis </b>is the final SMG in Black Ops, and is Classified until you have purchased all of the others. Only then can you purchase it. It has the lowest recoil of any SMG.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Black Ops Weapons List: **** Rifles</b> </li></ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">**** rifles</span> are the standard gun. Not as mobile as SMGs, not as powerful as LMGs, not as long-ranged as Snipers, they're average in every regard. This does mean that you'll hardly ever go wrong with choosing
 an **** rifle. Obviously though, not all rifles are created equal. Most are automatic, while some are semi-auto or burst fire. Some have higher power or recoil than others. The M16 comes unlocked for you, while you have to buy every other gun to unlock
 the G11.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/ab/4/ab4eaacee1b63f35dac0081188ba4267cf0fec68_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>M16 </b>is the first **** rifle in the game, one you start with. It fires a three-round burst and has a decently high damage rating, which only drops off at long range.</p>
<p>The <b>Enfield </b>is unlocked at level 6. It has lower damage and more recoil than the M16, but is the first full-auto rifle you can buy.</p>
<p>The <b>M14 </b>is unlocked at level 9. It's semi-auto, one shot at a time, but it makes up for that by having easily controllable recoil and high damage, higher than the M16s.</p>
<p>The <b>Famas </b>Is unlocked at level 14. Essentially the Enfield but better, the Famas has lower recoil and about the same damage.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/af/6/af6b48d1f3a02b89bbfb7e3a806cbe52f30d9a5e_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>Galil </b>Is unlocked at level 20. It has the same damage as the Famas, but less recoil, and is a solid **** Rifle to use early in your career.</p>
<p>The <b>AUG </b>Is unlocked at level 26. It has less damage than the Galil, but more manageable recoil, as it tends to pull the same direction every shot.</p>
<p>The <b>FN FAL</b> Is unlocked at level 32. The second Semi-Auto gun, you fire one shot at a time. It has the same damage as the M14, but much less recoil, making it more deadly.</p>
<p>The <b>AK47 </b>Is unlocked at level 38. High damage, manageable recoil, the AK-47 is a Call of Duty standard for endgame.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/99/0/99099a0f3766e5646b9fd04fb612c3ea7fa34aa0_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>Commando </b>Is unlocked at level 44. The AK-47 is great, but the Commando is identical in every way except a faster reload and weapon swap time.</p>
<p>The <b>G11 </b>is Classified and is unlocked when you buy all the other **** Rifles. Fires in three-round bursts that kill most players, the G11 is an end-game death cannon. To make up for this, it only has two attachments: A Low Power Scope and the Variable
 Zoom scope.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Call of Duty Black Ops Weapons List: Shotguns</b> </li></ul>
<p>Making their return to Primary status after their stint as Secondaries in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
MW2</span>, Shotguns seem to have gotten a bit of a nerf. There aren't many of them, and while they're powerful, they're quite short-ranged. All shotguns are
<i>more accurate </i>when you aim down the sights; it reduces pellet spread and makes a kill more likely and mid range. The Olympia is unlocked by default and you need to buy the other two to unlock the HS-10.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/fc/3/fc37cd61e005a0b3d5eeb89c6199bef011bedb81_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>Olympia</b> is the default shotgun. It has two barrels that can be fired in quick succession before needing to reload.</p>
<p>The <b>Stakeout </b>is unlocked at level 8. It's much like the SPAS-12 from MW2, with four shots, a pump-action between them, and the best range of any shotgun.</p>
<p>The <b>SPAS-12</b> is unlocked at level 24. It has 7 shots and is semi-auto, with no pump between shots. It's purpose is for room-clearing, and spamming shells.</p>
<p>The <b>HS-10</b> is classified, unlocked when you purchase the other shotguns. It has four shots and is semi-auto with no action between them. It's benefit is it's attachment; it's the only shotgun that can be Dual-Wielded.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Call of Duty Black Ops Weapons List: LMGs</b> </li></ul>
<p>LMGs in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Black Ops</span> are the standard weapon for covering allies and spraying bullets. They tend to have high numbers of bullets, making reloading a thing of the past. They have high power, but the trade off is
 their low mobility. Try playing a SMG class fora while then switch to a LMG; it feels like moving in slow motion. You start with the HK21 unlocked, and must buy the others to unlock the Stoner63.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/78/c/78c9f219527472d099c0af8da1ed6d7f23636d7e_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>HK21 </b>is the first LMG and you start with it. High recoil, but no damage drop off at range, it will kill in the same number of bullets from across the map as it would right next to you.</p>
<p>The <b>RPK </b>is unlocked at level 6. Same damage and lack of drop-off as the HK-21, the RPK has less recoil, making it an upgrade.</p>
<p>The <b>M60 </b>is unlocked at level 21. It's the only real bullet-spam gun, with a huge box of ammo to burn through. It has a slight damage drop off at medium range.</p>
<p>The <b>Stoner63 </b>is the classified gun, unlocked when you buy the other LMGs. It's the same damage and drop off of the HK and the RPK, but has nearly twice the rate of fire.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Call of Duty Black Ops Weapons List: Sniper Rifles</b> </li></ul>
<p>There's not much to say about sniper rifles in Black Ops. One high-powered bullet to put somewhere really far away, attached to a high power scope. They aren't very good in this game; no rifle will get a one-shot kill anywhere other than a headshot, and
 any gun gets headshot kills easily. There are also only four of them; the Dragunov is unlocked when you start, and you need to buy the other two to unlock the PSG1.</p>
<p>The <b>Dragunov</b> is the starting sniper rifle. It will one-shot a player in the upper-torso or head region, but will always 2-shot with a silencer.</p>
<p>The <b>WA2000</b> is unlocked at level 10. It has a faster fire rate and more manageable recoil than the Dragunov, but has the same kill areas and 1-2 shots.</p>
<p>The <b>L96A1</b> is unlocked at level 27. It's a bolt-action rifle, so one shot at a time. In addition to one-shooting people in the head and upper torso, it will also one-shot a player in the lower torso. All areas are two-shot kills with a silencer.</p>
<p>The <b>PSG1</b> is the Classified sniper rifle. It's Semi-Auto again, and has the same kill areas as the first two guns, but higher recoil, making it less useful overall.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Secondary Weapons in Black Ops: Pistols</b> </li></ul>
<p>First of the array of secondary weapons, and by far the most populated, is the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Pistols</span> section. The other two, launchers and specials, have fewer between them. Pistols are a varied lot, but for the most part they're close to mid-range weapons with a small clip. Their strength is in the fact
 they shoot bullets; this lets you pull them out in Second Chance, or when you're out of bullets for your main weapon. You must buy all of the pistols to unlock the CZ75. The ASP, M1911, and Makarov are all essentially identical; the only difference is in their
 attachments.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/4e/c/4ec3c3c08180fffd253f352d572861f15ea86567_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>ASP</b> has Dual Wield.</p>
<p>The <b>M1911</b> has Upgraded Iron Sights, Extended Mags, Dual Wield, and a Silencer.</p>
<p>The <b>Makarov</b> has Upgraded Iron Sights, Extended Mags, Dual Wield, and a Silencer.</p>
<p>The <b>Python</b> is unlocked at level 18, and is a six-shot revolver. It has higher damage than the three starting pistols, but obviously less ammo and a higher recoil.</p>
<p>The <b>CZ75</b> is classified, and unlocks when you buy the other pistols. It has the same damage as the starting pistols, but much less recoil.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Secondary Weapons in Black Ops: Launchers</b> </li></ul>
<p>Launchers are simple; they shoot high explosives and target different things. None of them have attachments, none of them are classified, and each serves a different purpose. There aren't many in
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Black Ops</span>, but they serve all their roles.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/66/e/66e284b67b4c869789070fc56bbe2bcffd6f5d4d_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>M72 LAW</b> is the first Launcher in the game, and you start with it unlocked. It's the most versatile as well. You can free-fire it at players or turrets or walls, or you can lock on to aircraft. It has a slight curve, not as pronounced as the RPG,
 but still enough to make precision at long range slightly lacking. It's only down side is you only get one shot, making anything harder than a Spy Plane impossible to shoot down in one life.</p>
<p>The <b>RPG </b>is unlocked at level 12. It's free-fire only, no lock on, and has a more pronounced curve in it's flight; it's not accurate, it's made for clearing areas. On the plus side, you get two shots. This can often mean the difference between success
 or failure in hitting your target.</p>
<p>The <b>Strela-3</b> is unlocked at level 30, and is this game's version of the Stinger. Two shots, aircraft lock-on only, as simple as that.</p>
<p>The <b>China Lake</b> is unlocked at level 48. It's a grenade laucher with two shots, a nifty pump-action reload, and a quick drop time.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Secondary Weapons in Black Ops: Specials</b> </li></ul>
<p>There are only two special weapons in Black Ops, both of which have their roles. Both are unique to this Call of Duty game, and are both entertaining to use. One is for close range and the other is for long -- you'll be able to guess which is which just
 by looking at them.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/c2/8/c28c81221ad588b060d5e5f8cf30ebbc107ca13d_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>Ballistic Knife</b> - Unlocked at level 15. You get one shot and one reload unless you have Scavenger. The Ballistic knife is a spring-powered throwing knife, essentially, that flies in a straighter arc than the tomahawk does. Using it also increases
 the speed of your melee, almost to tactical knife levels.</p>
<p>The <b>Crossbow </b>- Unlocked at level 33. Much like the Ballistic Knife, you get one shot and one reload before you have to pull out Scavenger. Think of the crossbow as a mix between a grenade launcher and a semtex. The bolt sticks to walls, floors, and
 people, and explodes after a couple of seconds. You can stick a player and they only have seconds to live.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Black Ops Grenades and Equipment</b> </li></ul>
<p>In a departure from MW2, Black Ops gives your character three special slots. One for a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Lethal grenade</span>, one for a Tactical grenade, and one for a piece of Equipment. The former are thrown using the triggers or shoulder buttons, while the equipment is readied and placed using up on the D-pad.</p>
<p><b>Lethal Grenades include:</b><a href="http://img.bhs4.com/18/c/18cb4b72c59341c79c93d91c652f86555003c6ab_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>
</b></a></p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Frag Grenades: Explode in a radius, will bounce and roll, and have a set timer. You can cook them in your hands, but watch out; hold it too long and you'll explode.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Semtex: A sticky grenade with a larger blast than the frag, with a distinctive noise and light.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomahawk: Thrown in a straight arc, this small axe is a one-hit kill on any part of the body. Known to bounce off surfaces.</p>
<p><b>Tactical Grenades include:</b></p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Willy Pete: White Phosphorus, does a tiny amount of damage locally and fills the area with thick white smoke.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Nova Gas: A yellow cloud of smoke that damages, blurs vision, and slows any enemy or the user who is not wearing Tactical Mask</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Flashbang: A grenade that explodes in a blinding light, turning the screen white and muting sound for many seconds.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Concussion: Similar to the Flashbang, it doesn't blind totally but darkens the screen, dulls sound, and severely restricts movement.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Decoy Grenade: When thrown, for a minute, will rattle off noises that sound like gunfire and appear as enemy dots on enemy maps.</p>
<p><b>Equipment includes:</b></p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Camera Spike: a placeable camera that replaces your mini-map with a view from it's point of view.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; C4: A pack of explosives that can be thrown and remotely detonated at a later time.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Tactical Insertion: A machine that marks your next spawn point, unless it's destroyed before you die.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Jammer: A machine that turns enemy mini-maps to static when they're near it's radius; emits a machine-like noise to enemies so they can tell the difference between it and a counter-spy-plane.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Motion Sensor: Placable machine that emits waves in a circle and gives quick, local updates on enemy positions nearby.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Claymore: Placable directional explosive tripped when an enemy walks into it's path. Can be flashed or jammed with a jammer.</p>

<p>In this third part of the Call of Duty Black Ops Multiplayer Guide, we cover each of the maps. There are fourteen basic map in the game, and four more added with the recent First Strike DLC. Where to go, what to do, read on to find out!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Call of Duty Black Ops Maps</b> </li></ul>
<p>There are fourteen basic maps that come with the game when you buy Call of Duty Black Ops. Additionally, Treyarch has recently released the First Strike DLC pack for 1200 Microsoft Points, which gives you four more maps. The maps vary in location from the
 jungle, the arctic, a nuclear test site, and even the Berlin Wall. Each one has it's own unique placement of objective and strategies to learn. The maps are: Array, Cracked, Crisis, Firing Range, Grid, Hanoi, Havana, Jungle, Launch, Nuketown, Radiation, Summit,
 Villa, and WMD. The four First Strike maps are Berlin Wall, Discovery, Kowloon, and Stadium.</p>
<p>Where do objectives spawn? What strategies are most effective? Read on in this third part of the Call of Duty Black Ops
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Multiplayer</span> maps guide to find out!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Array</b> </li></ul>
<p>First up is perhaps the largest map, Array. It's a winter map,<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/50/0/5001df2f9139f67c14a95a99a48a164969b1242e_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a>meaning everything is bright white and movement is easier to spot. Key areas to control include the central circular building and it's surroundings, which many people find is the hub of confrontation. Snipers love climbing the broadcast tower off to the
 wilderness side of the map, so if you hear a sniper go off, check that tower. Often you can out-snipe snipers before they can spot you. As a map with a lot of open area, anti-aircraft weaponry is essential if the enemy goes on a long enough killstreak to call
 in helicopters. Be prepared to move a lot; often you will spawn half a minute of running away from the action, so a LMG would make the slog intolerable.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cracked</b> </li></ul>
<p>Cracked is a broad map with several different levels of height and angles of approach to watch out for. There are few places to snipe from, as most of the area is mid-close range. The center of the map is a strip of raised rubble and buildings which are
 where most of the action takes place. Domination B is squarely on top of that rubble, leaving players attempting to capture it very exposed. On one side is a three-story bombed out building with a commanding view of multiple avenues of approach, making it
 key territory for many campers. There is very little open airspace to drop a care package without being ambushed, so be cautious using such killstreaks. Players with fast reactions and SMGs will make short work of many of the tight corridors.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Crisis</b> </li></ul>
<p>Crisis is a cuban missile base, offering a scenic beachfront, fortified underground bunkers and control rooms, and a pair of buildings. The beach is
 rarely used as more than a spawn point; most of the action takes place either in the tunnels or the cliffs above them, or the two-floor house to one side where many players spawn. Key places include a small tunnel carved out of the rock, which is a good ambush
 spot for players running from the beach to the tunnels. The tunnels themselves have many small corners to hide in, so keep an eye out. The beach is wide open to call in killstreaks, or to use
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">packages</span> as bait. Just watch out for players on the cliffs, who can see most of the beach at any time.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Firing Range</b> </li></ul>
<p>Firing Range is a relatively small map, one of the smaller maps in the game. Nearly every surface is made out of wood or thin metal, making bullet penetration easy and Hardened especially deadly. There is a lowered area as one spawn point, with three pathways
 up to the higher main area. Players love going to the higher tower in the middle of the map, but are vulnerable to a grenade if you throw it into their cubby hole. The two buildings overlooking the central area are also frequent camping spots, where you'll
 often find two or three members of one team watching the same window; these are easy kills. There are very few places to call in care packages without being killed, so use them wisely.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Grid</b> </li></ul>
<p>Grid is another snowy map, this one on the small end of the spectrum. A soviet comm/power station, most of the action takes place in the center of the map, between the two buildings. You can climb onto the truck to kill from an unexpected location, but you're
 quite exposed from both buildings. There is a back corner of the map with some tunnel-like buildings people rarely go to, which you could use to snipe from if you so desired. On the opposite side of the map is a wide wilderness area with enough cover to call
 in killstreaks or place hard-to-reach turrets. Not much fighting takes place back there, so it would be a great location to bait a trap with a care package.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hanoi</b> </li></ul>
<p>Hanoi is yet another map in the Call of Duty Black Ops Multiplayer maps roster. It's perpetually night-time in Hanoi, with a roving spotlight in one courtyard, a gallows under which players can hide, and several buildings around the map with multiple access
 points and windows overlooking the courtyards. Always keep an eye out on the second level when you move! Every courtyard and road has a building that can watch it, and more often than not someone will be
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">camping</span> one of those windows. Even the outer edge of the map has a building you can crawl onto the roof of and camp from. While hiding under the gallows is a good place to ambush players, it's also a good place
 to be ambushed.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Havana</b> </li></ul>
<p>Havana is a map with a long road in the middle and clusters of buildings on either side. The majority of the action will take place in these buildings. The long road is almost always covered by some sniper from one of the ends, while the buildings offer
 a lot of cover, snort sight-lines, and perfect ranges for SMGs and **** rifles. Due to how long and narrow the map is, a rolling thunder can cover a majority of it and net you an entire team worth of kills. Be wary when running through the buildings, as
 chances are there are claymores around every corner.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Jungle</b> </li></ul>
<p>Jungle is a dense map full of greenery, twisted pathways, and cliffside huts. It's easy to lose track of the enemy in the foliage and even easier to get sniped before you spot them. There is a high ridge where snipers love to camp, be aware one will be there,
 and probably have a claymore or motion sensor behind them. Be careful approaching them and instead throw a cooked grenade on top of them. The dense tree cover can make it hard to spot air support before it's on top of you, making it hard to shoot down. Also,
 on one side of the map is an open area with no boundaries. You can run outside of the map but after a short time you will explode, unlike the usual Call of Duty radiation death. This makes for an amusing time if you throw a care package slightly out of range,
 as enemies and allies alike try to capture it and die trying.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Launch</b> </li></ul>
<p>Similar to Cracked or Havana, Lanch has two large sprawling sides clustered with small pathways, separated by a long open road with little cover and long sight lines. To one side is a lower area with high catwalks, from which snipers love to kill players
 incoming to the area underneath the rocket. After several mintues of game time, a siren will go off and the rocket will begin to launch, hence the map's name. When the rocket lifts off, it's exhaust will kill anyone nearby; this makes Domination especially
 interesting, as Dom B is directly underneath the rocket.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Nuketown</b> </li></ul>
<p>Based off a model town for the purpose of testing a nuclear weapon, Nuketown is a tiny map colored in bright primary colors and loaded with mannequins. Combat in the map is fast and frantic, making it hard to do anything more than spawn, run a few feet,
 and kill or be killed. The map features several easter eggs, including out-of-map RC-XD paths, a large double rainbow, and a musical surprise. If an organized team shoots the heads off of every mannequin in and outside of the map, in the first 15 seconds of
 gameplay, the loudspeakers will play Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones. Many players love the map for it's fast-paced action, but others hate it whenever it comes up, especially on objective-based game modes, where capture points are often constantly
 exploding.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Radiation</b> </li></ul>
<p>Radiation is a map with a factory on one side, catwalks on the other, and a large open area in between them. Both sides have buttons that open and close a set of blast doors in the middle of the map, which lead to a tunnel that runs lengthwise through the
 map. Be aware that the blast doors will crush players caught between them when they close, making it dangerous to try to dive through a closing door. The tunnel is where B is located in Domination, so it's advised to close the doors once your team controls
 it and open them if the enemy does. There are many camping places on the map to watch out for, including the catwalks behind the factory with the conveyor belt, underneath the catwalks on the other side, and behind boxes in the tunnels.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Summit</b> </li></ul>
<p>Summit is another snowy map, placed at the top of a mountain, with a large central building where the majority of the action takes place. Be careful running into this building. From the south side people love camping the stairs to the left and the small
 entry room on the right, making a box of death if you enter without looking. From the north, people love camping on the stairs just inside to the left making them hard to shoot, or prone on the floor to the right to kill you when you expect the other way.
 If you survive all of that, check the control room floor and the catwalk across the way, as players will often hide there to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ambush</span> unsuspecting people.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Villa</b> </li></ul>
<p>As the name suggests, the map Villa is a rustic mansion and it's grounds. Unfortunately it suffers from two large open areas that players nearly never use, given that they're out of the way and hold no tactical advantage. Instead most combat will take place
 in the main building, near the fountain, or on the narrow road. Be careful and always check second-floor windows, as many players will camp such overlooks. It's possible to flank around the main building from either side, if you're careful, and ambush the
 entire enemy team controlling the area. Just be watchful for claymores, as most entrances may be covered.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>WMD</b> </li></ul>
<p>Last of the standard maps, WMD is a boxy area with a train that runs through the border, making it noisy and hard to hear enemies. In the center is a building with commanding views of much of the rest of the map, making it an ideal place to control. Additionally,
 near the domination C point, a high scaffolding can be climbed up on for sniping, though like all high exposed sniping areas it's easy to be counter-sniped. The Domination B point is in the exposed central area, making it often quite hard to capture without
 large amounts of smoke and cover.</p>

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Level 23: Sergeant Major II. Unlocks the Uzi.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Level 24: Sergeant Major III. Unlocks the Spas-12</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Level 25: Lieutenant. Unlocks custom sights.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Rest of the Levels</b> </li></ul>
<p>The first 25 levels are easy peasy. Every level the amount of EXP it takes to increase goes up. The last 25 levels take much longer to gain. If you're finding leveling slow, play an obective game like Headquarters, or Demolition with a dedicated team of
 defenders. More kills = more exp, but capturing objectives and defending them is worth even more.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Level 26: Lieutenant II. Unlocks the AUG.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Level 27: Lieutenant III. Unlocks the L96A1.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Level 28: Captain. Unlocks custom lenses.</p>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Effects of Prestige</b> </li></ul>
<p>Prestige mode can be entered up to fifteen times, each time once you reach level 50. Prestige has many effects on the game, including resetting nearly everything to level 1. You keep your purchased emblems and background, as well as your clan tag. You also
 keep the ability to add emblems and clan tags to guns, but can't use it until you unlock it again. Each prestige grants you new bonuses.</p>

<li><b>Basic Challenges</b> </li></ul>
<p>Basic challenges are the easiest challenges in Black Ops multiplayer. Even so, some of them are things you wouldn't think of doing, or would only do occasionally. Here's the list.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Break On Through</b> - Dive-to-prone through windows.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Elite Challenges</b> </li></ul>
<p>Elite challenges are marks of a player a step above the basic, though they aren't the most advanced actions. Many of them involve intermediate tactics and uses of items in ways beyond fire-and-forget. Here's how you earn each of them, though the exact number
 can be checked in your challenge menu in your conbat record.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Return to Sender</b> - Kill enemies with thrown-back grenades.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Situational Awareness</b> - Kill enemies by causing cars to explode.</p>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Finishing Moves Challenges</b> </li></ul>
<p>Finishing Moves are final kills of the match, so naturally completing all of these challenges will take quite some time. You have to perform the specific action and get it on the final killcam. What actions? Here you go.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Final Kill</b> - Be the killer in the final killcam.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Final Stab</b> - Get the final kill with a backstab.</p>

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Final Choke</b> - Get the final kill with Nova Gas.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Killstreaks Challenges</b> </li></ul>
<p>Killstreaks challenges are all quite self-explanitory, but some of them are more than just "get kills with this killstreak." Some of them, in fact, are anti-killstreak challenges. While the numbers vary, they all have three challenges associated with them.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Get X number of kills with the killstreak (or in the case of spy planes and blackbirds, while the killstreak is active.)</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the killstreak X number of times.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Destroy the killstread X number of times (in the case of turrets, air support and the like. Obviously doesn't apply to the Blackbird or weapon killstreaks.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a "get X kills with the care package" killstreak. Given that it's almost impossible to kill a player by dropping a box on them, the primary way to get this killstreak us to use
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Hacker Pro</span> to sabotage an enemy crate. Then when it explodes, those kills count.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lifetime Challenges</b> </li></ul>
<p>Lifetime challenges are the only challenges that do not reset when you prestige. They keep counting from the moment you begin the game to the final time you die. Many of them are obvious, but the less obvious ones are detailed as well.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Career Kills</b> - Get kills.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Career Time Played</b> - Time spent in game. Time spent in lobbies might count, but time at the menus don't.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Career Wins</b> - Win matches.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/2f/6/2f61958e979e3040b8adb7e18ebd1bc973b161ef_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Career Complete Matches</b> - Complete full games. Joining late, leaving early, or host disconnected games don't count.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Career Killstreaks Earned</b> - Earn killstreaks.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Career Score</b> - Earn arbitrary high numbers of score.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Career Contracts Completed</b> - Complete contracts.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Medals Challenges</b> </li></ul>
<p>Medals are necessary for <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">challenges</span>, but for the most part they're self-explanitory. You earn medals for things you do in-game. Rescue a teammate in second chance? Medic medal. Avenge a teammate after they've
 been killed? Avenger medal. There are a number of medals that have challenges associated with them, and others that do not. The challenges all have only one level and offer 700 exp as a reward. They all require earning the medal 20 times. The exception is
 the first one, for tomahawks.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Watch That Killcam!</b> - Earn a bank shot medal.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Sharing is Caring</b> - Share 20 care packages.</p>

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Combat Medic</b> - Revive 20 allies on second chance (only works if they have Pro.)</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Assisted homicide</b> - Injure 20 players that someone else then kills (assists).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pro Perk Challenges - Perk 1</b> </li></ul>
<p>Pro perk challenges are probably the most important challenges in Call of Duty Black Ops. Some are simple, some are hard, but if you want to unlock the pro version of a perk, you have to complete them. So what are they? Here you go.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>Weapon Challenges</b></p>
<p>Weapon challenges are all the same and they're all boring. Unlike Modern Warfare 2, where completing the challenges net you special titles and emblems, the only thing you gain from these challenges is EXP. Every weapon has essentially the same challenges.
 Get kills, get headshots. The only difference between tiers is the number you need. As you could guess, with the launchers, the challenges become "kill air support" and occasionally kill players, when the option is available. Don't worry about these challenges;
 just let them happen while you use your weapons of choice.</p>

<p>Stay alive longer and increase your kill/death ratio with these highly-effective tips for Call of Duty: Black Ops multiplayer. Take your time, know the map, and avoid dangerous areas to increase your multiplayer effectiveness. Read on for more.</p>
<ul>
<li>The multiplayer in <a href="http://call-of-duty.alteredgamer.com/cod-black-ops/91772-perks-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> is perhaps the most addicting the series has ever had to offer. Even after putting in countless hours and achieving multiple levels of prestige, even the best players are constantly looking for an additional edge, a way to increase
 their kill/death ratio and constantly top the in-game leaderboard. After playing for several months now, our experts here at Sinister Syndicate have compiled some of their favorite tips and tricks for gaining that edge over your opponents. Some of these tips
 may seem obvious enough to seasoned players, but there’s bound to be something on the list that can improve your game, regardless of your rank or skill level.
</li><li><b>Use Your Mini Map</b> </li></ul>
<p>This may seem like a pretty obvious thing to say, but I know there are many people out there who don’t take advantage of everything their in-game mini map has to offer. When your team has a spy plane up, you can use the mini map to track the movement of
 any enemy player who isn’t using the Ghost perk. You can also use it to spot enemies who are firing unsuppressed nearby, with or without a spy plane in the air. It’s best to play with one eye on your screen and another on your mini map. Using it correctly
 and effectively means you have advance warning of most enemies as they advance on your position and you can quickly locate enemies that are firing on your teammates (or you) nearby. You can also press the start button while you’re in a match to bring up a
 full map of the battle area. Use this to track enemies that are far away and communicate to your teammates where they’re headed. You can’t fight with the map up, so I recommend hiding first, but with a spy plane in the air this map can be an invaluable source
 of recon.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Use the Edges of the Map</b> </li></ul>
<p>The center of the map, especially in objective-based modes like Domination and Headquarters, is a merciless meat grinder. Those who run through are basically asking to be shot at from all sides and killed before they can accomplish anything positive for
 their team. Covering the middle of the map, as a lot of top players know, is a great way to get a ton of kills, taking out those who fail to heed the advice in the first paragraph of this section. If you need to get from one side of the map to another, and
 you’d like to arrive alive, your best bet is to move around the edges of the map. Out here, chances are there’s only one way for an enemy to come at you, and you can pay attention to that approach as you move. In the center of the map, there are just too many
 potential hiding spots and approaches to cover. Move around the outside, stay alive, and take or defend that position you’re headed for, rather than dying before you’re halfway there.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Avoid Obvious Positions</b> </li></ul>
<p>This tip is mostly for objective-based gametypes. When you’re playing Headquarters or Domination, defending a position by standing on it is simply a bad idea. Most objectives have multiple approaches, and even with a well-placed claymore you’re only going
 to be able to cover two at maximum. Instead, take up a position overlooking the entrance to the building that contains the objective or the objective itself. Position C in the Berlin Wall map is a good example of this. Smart players cover it from the building
 across the street, rather than by standing directly on the objective. This way, even cautious players will conclude the area is clear and rush into the objective, allowing you to pick them off with relative ease. Yes, there are those who will frown on camping
 like this, but in objective-based modes it’s pretty much the name of the game. Find a place where players will run past you to get to the objective and you’ll rack up a massive amount of kills taking out players so focused on the objective that they fail to
 watch their surroundings.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don’t Rush</b> </li></ul>
<p>Which leads me to tip number four: don’t rush in without looking around first. Players who continually run headlong for objectives or to the place where a teammate has just died typically end up becoming a similar icon themselves. Keep your eyes open, move
 slowly, check out popular hiding spots before moving in to capture an objective. Aim down the sights and cover corners as you move through a building. Yes, it slows you down, but it’s still much faster than dying and having to run all the way back. Don’t forget
 to stop and take a deep breath if you find yourself getting frustrated. Getting angry and rushing back to the spot where you just died almost always ends with you watching a kill cam. Take your time, find a smart way to approach and you’ll end up getting the
 drop on your enemy, rather than ceaselessly rushing to be slaughtered repeatedly.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Know the Map</b> </li></ul>
<p>Again, this seems obvious, but I’m still discovering places where I can jump up and get behind unsuspecting enemies, even in the original maps. No position is unassailable. The upstairs cargo container on Firing Range, for example, has three possible approaches.
 The most obvious, the staircase, is the only one most players bother to cover. It’s incredibly easy to get the drop on someone camping up there by using the stack of tires or the nearby fence outside. Knowing the map allows you to get into oft-overlooked places
 like the tower and catwalk on Summit. People aren’t used to checking these areas as they move around the map, and you can get a lot of kills as they run right past you. Take the time to get to know the maps well. Start a local match and just explore, jumping
 onto anything and everything you see. Getting into an out of the way place can lead to massive amounts of kills, and knowing how to get to people hiding in one can greatly relieve the frustration for you and the rest of your team. Even the best Call of Duty:
 Black Ops multiplayer players know that they can always find a way to improve their game. These tips can help players of any level, from noob to guru, to improve their kill/death ratio and maximize their effectiveness. No matter what gametype you prefer, these
 five tips will keep you alive longer and ensure you’re taking out as many enemies as possible.</p>

<p>Umm. This may of been informative 18 months ago. I scrolled through it and the only thing I really read was that the kiparis has the lowest recoil of any SMG. That's total bs haha. That gun is awful because of the recoil it has. Honestly, besides the uzi,
 which you should only hipfire, it has the worse recoil of any submachine gun, well any other gun period, in the game.

<p>You do not say what is causing you to want to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>You get your drivers from Dell:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/au/en/audhs1/product-support/product/inspiron-570/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dell.com/support/home/au/en/audhs1/product-support/product/inspiron-570/drivers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You normally only replace/reinstall drivers if you are having a problem with the existing ones or you require newer features that a newly released driver for a particular device&nbsp;would give you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of released drivers have never been updated since the year that they were released, but the devices they are for still work correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems with System Restore:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If you are using Norton, you will&nbsp;have to disable Norton's Tamperproof Protection before using System Restore.</p>
<p><a href="http://service1.symantec.com/support/sharedtech.nsf/pfdocs/2005113009323013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://service1.symantec.com/support/sharedtech.nsf/pfdocs/2005113009323013</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>AVG will cause problems with SR too.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Disabling AVG temporarily"</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Try using System Restore in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>"<span>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)"</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode#1TC=windows-7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>"The Advanced Boot Options screen lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer and pressing the F8 key before Windows starts&nbsp;(Tap F8 at the rate of about once per second)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Malware will stop System Restore.</p>
<p>Download, install,&nbsp;update and scan your System with the free version of&nbsp;Malwarebytes AntiMalware:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</span></a></p>

<p>Hi Hendrik,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>For us to identify the cause of the issue, I suggest that you perform a clean boot to disable non-Microsoft services and check if the issue
 persists. For steps on how to perform a clean boot, click<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>here</span></span></a></strong><span><span>.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply, Radney.</p>
<p>I will try, but it is not easy, as this is not 100% reproducible.</p>
<p>May I ask: Once we have done this step there are two outcomes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) No change, still the same problem</p>
<p>b) No problem without Microsoft Drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>What have we won? We still do not know the faulty driver.</p>
<p>So what would be the next step then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Hendrik</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That error appears to have been generated by the Driver Verifier:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; 0x9F_<strong>VRF</strong>_3_POWER_DOWN_tcpip!FlpWaitForMiniportToReturnTransmittedPackets</em></p>
<p>

<p>Hello auggy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply. Yes, I have. This was for this particular issue. I read in one Article that this should help finding the reason for the issue.</p>
<p>I have deactivated the verifier now.</p>

<p>Can you provide all the minidump files that are available, including the ones prior to enabling the Drive Verifier, via a public folder on OneDrive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reference to the tcpip.sys suggests the driver that may&nbsp;be causing the crash, which may be a third party driver,&nbsp;may be network related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all errors were DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE errors try running a !devstack on the second parameter which may show the driver actually causing the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance&nbsp;for the error you posted do this at the kd&gt; :</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>!devstack ffff910c29691060</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>See if you get the same results with a dump file that was not Driver Verifier initiated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is more info on the !devstack command in the following link:</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry for the delay. I did not have another crash yet. And the minidump files that were there are not existing anymore (I suppose they got deleted when I switched to a full dump, but that's speculation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will monitor this now and get back if the problem re-appears.</p>

<p>OK, I'll watch for your next post.</p>
<p>

<h2>            windows 10 security pop up for wifi access</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop running windows 10, not upgraded, it has always run windows 10.&nbsp; Over night it has started requiring a user/password for a Windows Security pop up when accessing Wi-Fi.&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed the credentials were changed yesterday....by some unknown
 method to me. I clicked "edit" and placed a new password.&nbsp; Turned the computer off, then back on.&nbsp; When accessing Wi-Fi, window still pops up requiring a user and password.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing works.&nbsp; I removed the "other windows credentials" profile, turned off the
 computer, then back on.&nbsp; Same windows security requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I rid the pop up requirement?</p>

    <title>Unusable audio for Skype video calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kelvinparrish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unusable audio for Skype video calls</h2>
                    <p>Hello... </p>
<p>I've used Skype extensively from various PCs over the years, and deeply appreciate its operation and performance, especially when my wife is on travel overseas.</p>
<p>Recently I attempted to use Skype (version 8.37.0.98) on my phone (Galaxy S8--SM-G950U, on Android 8.0.0., Verizon Wireless) and encountered a problem that precludes using Skype for video calls-- the output audio is directed only to the speaker dedicated
 for use when the phone is held to the ear.&nbsp; There are *no* audio settings either within the Skype app or on the phone (when in the app) that allow me to manually redirect audio to the speakerphone speaker.&nbsp; I would expect speakerphone output would be a default
 in video mode anyway.</p>
<p>I have not tried using a Bluetooth speaker or headset, and while they would likely make video calls with the phone possible, it's not very convenient to always carry those around.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be welcome!</p>
<p>

<p>Andre, thank you for your swift response!</p>
<p>I read your WikiHow link, and I agree, all those suggestions would be good if the problem was with the MICrophone.&nbsp; But my issue has nothing to do with the mic--it's all about Skype's audio output coming from the ear speaker and not the speakerphone speaker
 while in a video call.</p>
<p>I failed to mention that all functions are apparently proper with the phone and other apps; only Skype is exhibiting issues.</p>
<p>Thanks...</p>

<p>Hello Andre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My brother and I discussed the lack of speaker control; neither of us could believe there wouldn't be *some* kind of control.&nbsp; And indeed,
<em><strong>he found it.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing in the Skype settings controls or incorporated into the Skype app permissions within Android, nor is anything displayed when the app is started, on any page.&nbsp; However, when a call is *initiated* there are five new soft buttons on the bottom
 panel, and the leftmost button toggles between ear speaker and speakerphone speaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ergo, unless you have already initiated either an audio call or video call, you won't see the control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'll still consider this an issue that may want to be examined by the coders.&nbsp; And it certainly would make sense to default to the speakerphone speaker when a video call is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your assistance, and have a good day.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello TulaGianni.</p>
<p>I'm cutting MS a little slack for a few days just now, in light of their internal 'storm' &lt; https://www.cbsnews.com/news/more-than-11000-at-microsoft-said-ensnared-in-reply-all-email-loop/ &gt;</p>
<p>Several points:</p>
<p>Basic Skype is free.&nbsp; As in, it's another advertising vehicle, and when something is offered for 'free,' you need to think about 'why.'&nbsp; And while we *hope* designers and developers take our 'end-users' desires and requests into account, those are usually
 'way down the list of priorities.</p>
<p>When a service or product is provided by a sole source, a failure of that source is keenly felt by the user.&nbsp; The more 'involved' the user is, the more painful the failure.&nbsp; My wife carries two phones on her overseas trips; we use Skype daily, and her phones
 are our 'Plan B' when Skype is down.&nbsp; Oh yes, we certainly *do* 'feel it' when connection is bad or non-existent.</p>
<p>There's a great deal riding on reliability and quality; a company's reputation is directly tied to those two factors, even one as diversified as MS with Skype as a tiny part.&nbsp; Don't forget there's a business component to Skype--businesses are paying for
 their service, and of course they'll be supported first.</p>
<p>While navigating troubleshooting processes can be an incredibly painful and drawn-out process, *persevere!*&nbsp; Complaining only helps work out a little aggravation for you... but it doesn't get you any closer to a solution, and believe me, the people providing
 support are much more likely to work harder for you if you are willing to work in a professional manner with them.&nbsp; I've been on both sides of this, and as long as the end-user was patient and willing to keep chipping away at the problem, I'd plug away on
 their issue until it was resolved.</p>
<p>Best of luck, and may you connect with knowledgeable support personnel!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Mr. Parish,</p>
<p>I do absolutely understand their 'business' component to this 'free service if you will' that said, so is 'Twitter" &amp; 'Facebook' all of which have become millionaires through their advertising &amp; other means. I do not begrudge them any fault in this as long
 as their promise to the public is consistent; free Skype for the users of the internet for which we pay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, while they cut my video my son and brother had theirs. It's either free for ALL or not. I do believe should they start asking for a fee 90 % of the users will cancel Skype &amp; someone else will POP up with a similar version, competition will become fierce
 and they know it.</p>
<p>It's vexing having to experience such invasion of our personal spaces at their will, it's just not right.</p>
<p>I hope common sense &amp; decency prevails.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How do I hide&#47;remove Libraries from Explorer panel&#63;</h2>
                    I'm tired of the Libraries shortcut and it's drop-down sections in Windows 7 Explorer cluttering the left sid, I never use them, they're cumbersome and I save shortcuts to the Favorites section anyways. Can I get rid of the Libraries section or hide it
 or something?

            This is for Windows 8 and does not remove the Libraries folder in Explorer on the left panel. I can only click to "Show all folders" and that merely collapses it under Desktop but pinning Explorer to the taskbar and opening it still defaults to the Libraries
 folder and I want it completely gone from Explorer.

<h2>            Can&#39;t print 10x15 size in Windows Live Photo Gallery</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
I have general questions about Windows Live Photo Gallery

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Photo Gallery are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2009 (14.0.8117.416)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I used to be able to print 10x15 photos very easily fromWLPG. Recently I have been unable to. If I set paper size to 10x15, from the drop down box the only option shown on the right hand side is Full Page.&nbsp; this prints A4.&nbsp; If I use 10x15 paper, it prints just
 quarter of the picture, 4 times larger. I have checked and rechecked all the settings and preferences, but nothing helps.&nbsp; I have been in touch with Epson and they confirm I have the right drivers They suggested I download Epson Easy print, and I can get 10x15
 from that, but I like to edit and print from WLPG.<br />
<strong>PS</strong> I have chosen Version 2009 (14.0.8117.416) as it came with my PC which I purchased &nbsp;in November 2010.&nbsp; I don't know how I can check which version, just assume that's the one!<br />
Thanks&nbsp;&nbsp; Globe34</p>

            Thank you for your clear instructions. I found the version of WLPGto be &nbsp;as follows :<br />
&nbsp;WLPG 2011 Build 15.4.3538.513<br />
&nbsp;I also followed instuctions to repair Windows Live essentials, and received the message that it had been repaired. Sadly, this has not rectified the problem.
<br />
I welcome any other suggestions. <br />

<p>The&nbsp;steps I use are as follows : Open <strong>Pictures library</strong>/Select and open picture/Click
<strong>Edit,organise or</strong> <strong>Share</strong>/ View file and make any changes I want to. e.g.auto adjust. From drop down menu&nbsp; top left I&nbsp;click
<strong>Print</strong>. The <strong>'How do you want to print your&nbsp;pictures?</strong> &nbsp;box opens<br />
Printer is Epson Stylus DX6000 series. (This is my default and only printer) I select
<strong>10x15</strong> size, and<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Paper Type</strong> from the drop down lists. The only option that appears in the right hand column is
<br />
<strong>'Full Page.'<br />
</strong>(This&nbsp; is also&nbsp;the only option given if I change paper size to 13x18, A6 or A5)<br />
I then click <strong>'Options'</strong> to bring up <strong>'Print settings'</strong> and tick the box for
<strong>'Sharpen for Printing'</strong> and <br />
<strong>'Only show options that are compatible with my printer.'<br />
</strong>In the same box I click <strong>'Printer Properties'</strong>and when that opens&nbsp;check that
<strong>'Paper Type'</strong> is&nbsp; Epson Premium Glossy, and size is 10x15. Other settings are&nbsp;
<strong>Best Photo/Photo Enhance/Print Preview/ Landscape orientation.<br />
</strong>Working throught this step by step, I have just noticed that in <strong>
Printer Properties</strong> box is a button to <strong>'Show Settings'</strong> On clicking this, a side box opens, showing the settings described above,&nbsp;and also shows 'Output Paper Size A4 210x297 Scale ratio 191%.<br />
Returning to <strong>' Print Pictures' </strong>box If I change paper size from 10x15 to A4 the options shown in right hand column are Full Page/13x18(2)&nbsp; 20x25(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10x15(2)
<em>these are centred with space around them<br />
</em>9x13( Wallet 9) Contact Sheet(35)<br />
I&nbsp;&nbsp; first encountered this problem last month, but had not been doing any photo printing&nbsp; for some time prior to that.&nbsp; I have recently installed 'Photoscape 3.6' photoediting program.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can print 10x15 from that, but it is very confusing and inconvenient.&nbsp;
 Aso, after I encountered the problem I contacted the |Epson help line, and &nbsp;downloaded Epson Easy Print.&nbsp; That too will print in 10x15
<br />
Thank you for your prompt reply.&nbsp; I hope this is the information you require</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I have looked at the info you&nbsp;suggest and at the moment I&nbsp; am reluctant to uninstall and reinstall my printer, as it is working well with everything else If I decide to do that at some future date, i will contact you again.
