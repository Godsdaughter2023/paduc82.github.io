<br />
Are you saving direct to a memory stick to transfer to the laptop?<br />
<br />
If so, do you eject it correctly?<br />

            Thanks for trying to help Steve. &nbsp;Yep created, saved and tried to open all on the same laptop. &nbsp;When saving I use the pptx extension - defaults to this anyway. &nbsp;And yes have tried starting ppt, going file &gt; open... still no joy.
<div><br />
<div>Also when saved to my desktop, there is no ppt icon next to the file name; just the icon which looks like an old tape - saying it opens with Microsoft Office 2010 component, but doesnt name the component. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Wonder if repairing ppt itself will work &nbsp;.. what do you think?</div>

            Confusingly Microsoft Office 2010 (in his context) is probably the Microsoft Picture Manager (OIS.exe)<br />
<br />
It sound like your file associations are not correct and a repair may help. You might also want to try Right Click &gt; Properties &gt; Open With &gt; Change and try to browse to the PowerPNT.exe file. Do you know if you have the horrible click to run version??<br />

<h3> brianhcohen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot log into Domains.Live.Com to manage custom domain w&#47;Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Hello. &nbsp;I recently received the email notifying users about the end of support for custom domains in Outlook.com. &nbsp;The email states:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><strong>As a current customer, we will continue to support the ability to log in to Outlook.com with your existing custom domain
 email address, but as of July 31st&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><strong>&nbsp;you will no longer be able to add or remove accounts in your domain.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />
</span>However, when I log into Domains.Live.Com, the page simply reloads and continues to present the large "SIGN IN" button. &nbsp;Clicking that button again reloads the page with the same result. &nbsp;This is especially odd because I can see that my account is signed
 in, my name and user icon appear in the upper-right corner of the screen and I can click on it to navigate to my Outlook.com profile, settings, etc. &nbsp;Is it still currently possible to manage custom domain settings? &nbsp;I'd like to adjust the custom email addresses
 being used with my personal domain before that feature is retired. &nbsp;I've contacted Accounts and Billing support, who directed me to Microsoft Accounts Support, who told me that this forum was the only place to get an answer, and I'm hoping they were correct.
 &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi BrianHCohen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you wanted to know if you can still manage the settings of your custom domain registered in Windows Live Admin Center. You also mentioned that you're having issue with the page after logging in to Domains.Live.com. For custom domain settings
 issue, please be advised that you will still be able to manage its settings. By July 31st of this year, you should still be able to manage its settings but will no longer be able to add or remove accounts as what the notifications also states.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, we recommend that administrators who wish to continue managing email addresses in their domain should consider Office 365 for business - Microsoft's premium online email service. By migrating to Office 365, you will be able to continue managing
 your custom domains, as well as benefit from modern enterprise-class mail, collaboration and communication tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about Office 365 for business, you may go to this <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/business/what-is-office-365-for-business-FX102997580.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to the page simply reloading when you logged in, we are looking into the possibility that this may be a browser issue.&nbsp;W<span>e recommend that you optimize your browser
 first. This is to determine whether the issue is cause by corruption in the temporary internet files or in other cached information that is used by your browser. To optimize your browser, refer to the link below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Optimize&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Browser</a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>We also advise that you try to use another browser and computer to check if you will encounter the same issue. This will help us isolate the problem
 and if this is a browser specific issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persists, please provide us the exact error message you're getting if there is any.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Let us know the results for further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards.</span></p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Ralph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me. &nbsp;I have now tested this on the following systems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo ThinkPad, 64-bit Windows 7 w/SP1, 32-bit IE 8 and Chrome&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(48, 57, 66, 1)">35.0.1916.114m</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(48, 57, 66, 1)">Dell E6510 32-bit Windows 7 w/SP1, 32-bit IE 8, Chrome&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(48, 57, 66, 1)">35.0.1916.114m, Firefox
 28.0</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(48, 57, 66, 1)">Dell Optiplex 960 32-bit Linux Mint 16 Petra, 32-bit Chrome 34.0.1847.137, Firefox 29.0</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(48, 57, 66, 1)"><span>I have completed the&nbsp;optimization&nbsp;steps for all of the listed browsers on all three systems before testing, and in&nbsp;<em>all seven instances the result is the same.</em> &nbsp;This indicates to me that the
 problem is not the result of local corrupt data or a browser-specific issue.</span></span>As described above, there is no error message at all during this process.
 &nbsp;However, the following screenshots may help illustrate what I am experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>STEP 1: &nbsp;Navigate to Domains.Live.Com and click "SIGN IN" button</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38f5329e-cd0a-4329-89c2-2a824c94224c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter login credentials (username obfuscated for privacy)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6cf44dc5-479d-4b30-988b-d75390203bd4" /></p>
<p>Account is signed in, as evidenced in the upper-right corner, but the SIGN IN button on the main screen remains and the domain configuration settings are not available. &nbsp;Clicking the SIGN IN button in the middle of the page simply brings me back to the same
 exact page. &nbsp;There is never any error message at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e88de20b-1c48-4f3f-b363-f024efd175a5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have confirmed that my account is truly logged in, as I'm able to follow these links to the picture/name/account settings pages and access the email associated with the account.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66eb72fa-1849-4139-97ea-d6b94c8c21bd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>To reiterate, this is the case in&nbsp;<em>all seven web browsers across three different computers running three different operating systems.</em>&nbsp;It's highly unlikely that the issue is being caused by corrupt local data in every single browser, especially considering
 that some have never previously loaded this page before and therefore wouldn't have any cached data for it. &nbsp;It also rules out specific browser compatibility issues since the result is the same on multiple versions of multiple browser applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help me regain access to the custom domain configuration settings?</p>

    <title>To the &#34;Higher-Ups&#34; who can influence Windows Phone 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yie sean teoh  say:</h3>
<h2>            To the &#34;Higher-Ups&#34; who can influence Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    <p>There is no denying that Windows Phone 8 has huge potential and the industry is crying out for a viable third party. A duopoly on the ecosystem of OS's is not only bad for consumers but bad for innovation. RIM has shown it hasn't changed
 and will probably die. All the other companies trying to come up with a viable mobile OS should just stop trying now. Even desktop Linux OS's such as Ubuntu and Red Hat should worry that Android will take over and become the only Linux client available. With
 billions of dollars of cash at their disposal, there is no doubt that if a third ecosystem is to emerge, it is going to be from Microsoft and despite what some of the idiotic tech bloggers are saying (in particular, MG Siegler the tool), I&nbsp;believe&nbsp;Windows
 Phone can emerge victorious, and for the sake of the consumer technology scene, I hope I am right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My personal take on the strategy of Windows Phone is that it has positioned itself&nbsp;in between&nbsp;Android and Apple. Where Apple has great optimisation due to having control over both Hardware and Software, its proprietary take on the phone
 ecosystem provides lack of choice in features and forces users to be locked in a walled garden environment, which I, for one, am glad to not be part of. Android on the other hand gives users an abundance of choice in handsets, from processor type to screen
 sizes and resolutions. But the lack of control over the hardware means fragmentation is a SERIOUS issue, with programming for the OS a horrible experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's where Windows Phone comes in, concentrating on the optimality of performance by providing restrictions on screen resolutions and processors but also giving OEMs a license of &nbsp;creativity to design the size of the handset to
 whatever specifications they want. However, if you were to imagine a scale in between Apple and Android, Microsoft would definitely lie closer to Apple's ecosystem than Android's and this, unfortunately, is Windows Phone's biggest issue. This post will therefore
 address what those issues are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) File Explorer</p>
<p>For a company that has built 2 decade's worth of software on the fundamental notion of the File Explorer, it is ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE this it is not included on Windows Phone (as of a matter of fact, nor in Windows 8's modern UI [formerly&nbsp;known
 as Metro]). Microsoft, if you do read this, please note that THERE IS NOTHING more&nbsp;UBIQUITOUS&nbsp;than the File Explorer and hence is one of the main reasons people switch from using iOS products to Android products. The File Explorer gives the smart phone, the&nbsp;heart&nbsp;of
 a PC, and its&nbsp;absence&nbsp;thereof is the&nbsp;reason WHY many have not bought an iPad. Having a digital device without a File Explorer, especially a Microsoft one, is&nbsp;unforgivable&nbsp;and should be corrected immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Network File Sharing</p>
<p>Homegroups and Workgroups are an integral part of any person's personal or professional network system. At the heart of the Windows experience since Vista, Microsoft have missed a trick by not&nbsp;incorporating&nbsp;this feature natively in Windows
 Phone 8. Android's Es File Explorer is one of the most downloaded apps and rightly so. For a device that is always on, I cannot see a better experience than lounging in your bed with your phone, and being able to play a video that is on the shared folder of
 you home PC without having to transfer it on via USB or installing any ridiculous software on either my PC or my phone. Such a tool would trump Android as I'm sure Microsoft can build a perfectly great file explorer that incorporates network file sharing.
 Get this done and it will also open up Windows Phone to be built on a phablet. But before that can even happen, WP8 must support higher resolution screens (1080p and above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Higher Resolution Screens (1080p and above).</p>
<p>WP8 has a tendency to JUST catch up with the hardware available on Android. Announcing that WP8 can only support 720p is ridiculous when HTC releases their Droid DNA that has a 1080p screen, and with numerous other OEMs releasing 1080p
 screens on their handsets at CES, WP8 is once again lagging behind. With a little intuition, if WP8 had announced support for 1080p resolution and ABOVE (1440p), it would mean when OEMs are able to step it up with their Hardware, software is already supported.
 Come on Microsoft, its not difficult, these trends are so plain for everyone to see. Step up your game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Processor Chip</p>
<p>Speaking of catching up with hardware, having the dual core S4 Chip instead of the quad core S4 at launch was ridiculous! To be the best, you have to have the best hardware and if OEMs aren't able to launch WP8 phones on the latest hardware
 but they are doing it with Android, again WP8 will always be catching up. Microsoft should SYNC the release of WP8 phones with the launch of Qualcomm's new chip. As soon as Qualcomm releases a chip, the first phone that has that chip SHOULD BE a Windows Phone,
 in fact WIndows RT should follow that same principal. Consumers follow that geeks buy, and despite whatever Apple wants people to believe, specs STILL matter. If at launch I could get a WP8 phone, which is the first phone EVER to have a 1440p screen with Quakcinn's
 S5 chip, regardless of my preference of Android or WP8, I'm getting that phone. There is no competition. Specs matter and for WP to survive, it has GOT TO BE the best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Advantages of being in the Windows Ecosystem</p>
<p>This is the main selling point Microsoft is trying to get to the consumer, that if you buy WP8, it'll work perfectly in your ecosystem of Windows and XBox. Well, I bought into the dream but I didn't get the results. If I'm browsing the
 web on my HTC 8x, I can, via smartglass, push that page onto my Xbox. Great. If I want to continue reading that page, I can push it onto my Surface RT or my Windows PC, again great. But what if I want to go to work now, why can't I push that same page onto
 my HTC 8x or my Surface RT from my PC in the same way? Why can't I do this for video, or games? Why? Why? Why? Where is this&nbsp;synchronicity&nbsp;I heard about if I joined the family suite of Microsoft products? Well, its not there. There is no different if I was
 using a Windows phone or an iphone or an Android phone. That's a problem, a massive problem! What about games? Why can't i start angry birds on my phone, continue it on my Xbox, then my PC and then my Surface RT just before I sleep? Its an Xbox live game,
 is it not? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a Microsoft fan and will be til the day I die (assuming the company doesn't go bankrupt), but I cannot be the only person to see that these glaring issues are holding back the love from the geeks, and hence holding back from the acceptance
 with consumers. As Microsoft thrives to be a viable alternative to OEMs, my advice is, be more like Android and less like Apple.</p>

            <p>Just a few comments on your thoughts here. Not all of them are bad ideas. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) File Explorer. Yeah this one is the tough one for us power users to accept. We like control and we hate it when an OS limits our access, because it means less control. However, your everyday user, they don't have as much issue with a lack of a file explorer.
 As an IT tech, the more I can limit my users to only the files they NEED, the easier my job can be. I think a good compromise is developing with WP. It could be expanded upon. Right now, you can access music, pictures and documents within their respective
 areas. The SkyDrive app gives a bit more control and access to the entire Skydrive account. I think maybe expanding the SkyDrive app into a limited file explorer for the phone. I think that could be a good compromise between users that need very basic limited
 access so they don't store things in very random places or delete necessary file, but give us power users a bit more control over our phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)Network File Sharing. Yes this...this is a great idea. I adore the cloud and use it all the time. However, sometimes I'd just like to access that photo that I haven't yet uploaded to the cloud. Also, with cloud storage still being at a bit of a premium
 cost, I haven't uploaded a lot of video there. Being able to access my video files from a PC or other network storage would be fantastic. I know there are some apps out there that do that, but I'd sometimes rather see something like this "baked" into the OS.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3)Higher Resolution Screens. This one is another one that would be nice, but not entirely necessary. To me, I'm not concerned. Most people honestly aren't going to be able to tell you the difference between 720 and 1080 on a phone. And even the ones that
 can don't always want to pay a higher cost to have the slightly better screen. Yes, us tech geeks can debate the merits all day long, but we really are a minority. Maybe a could of high end devices could have the higher resolution, but to really compete with
 Android and Apple, Microsoft has to hit a price point sweet spot. Not going to happen putting more expensive parts into the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4)Processer: Similar argument to the resolution thing. Gotta find the right balance of cost and speed. Your everyday consumer has NO clue what a faster processer does for their phone. Yes, they follow the geeks, but I'd say more lower processer Android phones
 are sold than the flagship ones...mainly because of cost. I think keeping the cost of the phone down and better marketing would have more impact. Yes, a couple of high end phones with the awesome processer, but most don't need it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Ecosystem. Yep...marketing really needs to get on this. Microsoft has all the bits and pieces and is starting to pull together some pretty awesome things. They need to tweak it all and get it working smoothly, than market the heck out it. I'm a prime
 example of this. I never cared an ounce to have an Xbox. We already have a PS3 and Wii. Now with my Windows Phone and Windows 8 devices in the house, I'm anxious to get an Xbox now. Still working on convincing hubby we need it, but I see how cool it can be.
 Corporations need to see how Windows Phone in their existing MS ecosystem is the best fit for Sharepoint, Exchange and Office. I see MS moving this direction, but I'd like to see more marketing of it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My personal opinion is Marketing is the biggest downfall of Windows Phone not taking off as quickly as it could. Most people still don't know about it. Most carriers are just now taking some pride it in. Manufacturers are finally putting out some unique
 and awesome devices. But we need to show people why they need it, why it is better than the other phone OSs, and how it will help them in regular life.</p>

            <p>1) File Explorer: Just not needed anymore.&nbsp; The OS is a closed system, it just is not like it was in the old Windows Mobile days. This closed system provides a great deal of security for users. And what would you use it for? That is a serious question!&nbsp;
 Pictures? Songs? Office Files?&nbsp; All that can easily be found using the particular application they are used in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)Network File Sharing: I did like your example but if I am going to lounge in my bed and stream a movie, I will use my Surface ...
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Higher Resolution Screens (1080p and above). With my Nokia 920 I get a screen height: 1280&nbsp;pixels and width: 768&nbsp;pixels.&nbsp; Not too bad! And&nbsp;it has a&nbsp;Pixel density 332 ppi,&nbsp;as well as an aspect ratio 15:9.&nbsp; From my perspective I get a great balance between
 what can be done on the screen and what can be seen.&nbsp; Would it be nice to have even more ... I'm not sure the average person could really tell the difference and for those that could, is the additional cost worth it.&nbsp; I tend to doubt it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Processor Chip: The S4 seems to work well with the hardware.&nbsp; I've not had a issue since I got the phone.&nbsp; I'm sure as time goes on there might be faster chips but price is huge and they need to match the device with capability and cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Advantages of being in the Windows Ecosystem:&nbsp; I absolutely agree that it is a huge advantage.&nbsp; If I am on my PC, my tablet, my Surface or my phone I get a smooth seamless integration.&nbsp; I expect it will continue to mature and we will be able to do more
 and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Regarding 3) following story was widely reported:<br />
<a href="http://www.gottabemobile.com/2012/12/18/htc-canceled-plans-for-windows-phone-8-phablet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gottabemobile.com/2012/12/18/htc-canceled-plans-for-windows-phone-8-phablet/</a><br />
</p>
<p>Regarding 1) "good compromise" <br />
Instead of a compromise I suggest both everyday users AND so called power users could be properly catered for with a creative solution. I hope things develop in this direction.<br />
I don't really&nbsp; consider myself a power user, but I would like to feel more in control of my phone and more informed about what I have on my phone. Just one example of many: I saved an interesting picture on my WP8 some time ago and now I want more information
 about the content of the picture. I can't even view the filename!! Filenames of pictures usually contain some useful information&nbsp; like who is depicted or what.<br />
Also other properties can be useful to both normal and power users like when did I save a file? how large is it? Not only power users understand the implications of the difference between a file of 10 KB or one of 1MB (worth deleting to regain storage space?;
 too large for quick transfer via Bluetooth?&nbsp; etc.etc)<br />
(A question for the technically informed: would it be technically possible for someone to write a decent file explorer app for WP8 or are there restrictions by Microsoft or the OS?)</p>

            <p>I am all with you on #5 (the others I'm not against, but I can live without). My favorite thing about the Windows 8/Windows Phone 8 is the ecosystem... But as you stated, it is incomplete... I hope they start pushing out updates to get this fixed.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I also want some of the specialty products that Apple and Android users get to enjoy. Say...like a Smart Watch? Also maybe something similar to Google's Project Glass. If Microsoft wants to be on par with both Google and Apple, it would be nice
 if it was able to supply these products and more.<br />
<br />
I want items that I can impress my friends with, something that will say, "Yeah. Apple is so yesterday. Check out these gadgets that will sync with my life."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I envision a future Microsoft&nbsp;ecosystem containing gadgets including the normal PC, Tablet, and Phone, along with the more unique items such as a Smart Watch, Smart House Appliances, a Smart Car and more. Stuff where if a rogue and malicious AI took over
 the ecosystem, my world would end. That sort of integration is what I crave.</p>

            <p>Thanks for everyone for viewing this post, have any Microsoft engineers read this?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess the point that I'm trying to make is that what really irks me is these features are implemented in Android. I don't think it's in Microsoft's interest to dictate what the consumer wants but rather it would be more beneficial if it provide consumers'
 with choice. That's what Android did, if people don't want to use the file manager in Android, they don't have to but its there for them to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is even more irritating is since its built on the Windows kernel, all these features I've spoke about are possible. More p[possible than any other OS, so I really do hope someone listens and implements.</p>

            1.&nbsp; I think File Manager is THE most urgent update required. I need the phone mostly for business, and the 'Office Hub' is only usable when you keep most of your files on Sky Drive. The reason? When you accumulate a few dozen Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and
 PDF documents, you want them grouped thematically, otherwise it becomes very difficult to find the one you need. On Sky Drive this is accomplished in a normal way we are all used to: folders. On the phone itself? Impossible. If you have stored your several
 dozen (or, as the case may be, several hundred) files locally, on the phone - good luck sorting through them...<br />
<br />
Moreover, the SD storage card, while nominally supported, is useless for anything but entertainment content (music and pictures): the 'Office Hub' does not see it, and, AFAIK, cannot be configured to store to and retrieve from it.<br />
<br />
This is, frankly, idiotic. I understand that MS does not want to give users access to the OS files. Fine, don't. Give the File Manager ONLY the ability to see files and folders in the dedicated 'user area'. Or, even simpler, just give the already existing Sky
 Drive Manager the ability to see this 'user area', both on the phone itself and on the SD card, and to treat it the same way it treats Sky Drive cloud storage space - create, move and delete folders, copy, move and delete user files in them, and load them
 into apps. And give user an option of synchronizing the local, on-the-phone, folder structure with the one on Sky Drive.<br />
<br />
Having normal file management on Sky Drive and NO file management on the phone itself is such an obvious ploy to make everybody use cloud storage (and soon pay for its extension AND for extended data plans), it's not even funny. Don't worry, people will pay
 for all of that even if you don't rob them of a basic usability on their own phone. Except for those who get upset with such blatant attempt to dig into their wallets and switch to a different OS...<br />
<br />
2. Network File Sharing. Yes, I'd love to see it on WP. Personally for me, it's not a deal breaker like the absence of File Manager, but it still is a very useful feature.<br />
<br />
3. Yes, there is no such thing as too high a resolution :-), but I'm pretty certain the increase in resolution is in the works. For now, the resolution of my Nokia Lumia 822 works just fine for me.<br />
<br />
4. Processor. Again, no such thing as too much processor power - but so far I can't even use the existing chip to its potential - because of issue No.1 !<br />
<br />
5. Agreed on the Windows ecosystem.<br />
<br />
6. Oh, and guys? Fix this PDF viewer app of yours, will you? Half of the files I try to open with it fail to open (while opening perfectly from Sky Drive in the PDF viewer plugin of my PC's web browser).<br />

<p>2)Network File Sharing: I did like your example but if I am going to lounge in my bed and stream a movie, I will use my Surface ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&nbsp;would like&nbsp;to be able to wirelessly stream 24-bit 192 kHz FLAC files to my Nokia Lumia 625, and I&nbsp;would like&nbsp;it (the Nokia) to play these streamed FLAC files on a portable DAC/headphone amp via USB OTG (On-The-Go). Why? It's because&nbsp;always drag n' dropping&nbsp;new&nbsp;FLAC
 files onto the phone's SD card via USB&nbsp;so that&nbsp;the 'FLAC Player SD' app can then access and play them is, quite unfortunately,&nbsp;not exactly the&nbsp;type of modern connectivity I had&nbsp;pictured.&nbsp;Also, a&nbsp;separate portable&nbsp;USB DAC that supports, via USB OTG, high resolution
 digital audio, can,&nbsp;if combined with an either&nbsp;built-in or separate portable headphone amp,&nbsp;offer a fairly significant improvement in sound quality over the headphone output of a smartphone.&nbsp;To clarify on this, I own a pair of Westone ES60 custom In-Ear Monitors,
 and,&nbsp;although I must admit the sound I get from them if plugged&nbsp;directly into my Nokia is actually not half bad, to be perfectly honest,&nbsp;I feel rather disappointed about the&nbsp;fact I am not&nbsp;able to&nbsp;use the Nokia's&nbsp;USB for&nbsp;playback&nbsp;of high resolution digital
 audio on something&nbsp;like, for example, the Chord Electronics Hugo portable DAC/headphone amp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. - I don't care that the screen resolution of my Nokia Lumia 625 is 'only' 480x800. I have both a giant flatscreen HDTV and a Windows 8.1 laptop standing in my bedroom. The laptop has both HDMI and Intel WiDi, and,&nbsp;using the Nokia as an excellent&nbsp;remote
 control with this setup, I can pretty much lounge in my bed and stream movies&nbsp;for&nbsp;nearly as long&nbsp;as the time it&nbsp;might take&nbsp;some people (no offense, but anyway...) to&nbsp;see&nbsp;why Windows Phone&nbsp;could&nbsp;seriously&nbsp;be improved&nbsp;for other people by adding support for&nbsp;USB
 OTG and for HomeGroup&nbsp;printer and file sharing.</p>

            <p>Totally disappointed by the lack of access to SMB shares.</p>
<p>My VERY OLD Tytan II with win mobile 6.5 had it and worked seamlessly.</p>
<p>I just bought a Lumia 1520, upgraded to WP8.1. I had no doubth to find the same, essential feature on the new device.</p>
<p>NO WAY. Also the share folder browser, a paid app clearly cheats on this feature and downloads each file on the local storage while you attempt to open it. You don't notice it with photos or a short PDF, but it's evident with a fullHD movie (mkv 1 to 14
 GB).</p>
<p>It's totally crazy! I'm sure that microsoft could implement it with almost no effort, and there's no concern about security or ease of use: actually&nbsp;the entire enterprise world is based upon SMB. And the last thingh I would as a system administrator (yes,
 it's my job...) is to have multiple copies of files relevant for a business on the portable device of the users... without version control, without knowing where the go and with the idea that they can easily tap and "share" the files on some cloud service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really, is it a joke? give me back the SMB protocol on windows phone, it's mandatory.</p>

<p>Really, is that the advice to windows phone users? Switch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accessing network shares (over a vpn) is not something that should be possible on a windows phone, really? So now we best carry a laptop in our pockets to get the functionality that other ecosystems do offer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is this really the advice from an MVP?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Such actions must only be for the die hard experienced users, right? But if that is the case, why is ES file explorer so immensely popular on Google Play (over 1M reviews, 50-100M installs)? Could you perhaps be wrong in your statement, and that network
 shares of all sorts (smb, ftp, sftp) perhaps are used by many more people then you realize?</p>

    <title>E71 with Three - emails disappear after switching the phone off - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            E71 with Three - emails disappear after switching the phone off</h2>
                    I have recently bought a Nokia E71, with a contract from the operator <a href="http://www.three.co.uk." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.three.co.uk.</a> I downloaded the operator's<br />
email software, which is actually a customized version of seven email<br />
(<a href="http://www.seven.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.seven.com</a>) for push email functionality.<br />
<br />
Well, it doesn't work properly!<br />
<br />
It downloads email messages from the server. If I send myself an email, it does arrive on the mobile, even though not instantly.<br />
However, if I switch the phone off and then back on, all previous emails don't show up any more, even though they are still on the server. It's as though you could only see emails received since you last switched the mobile on, which is crazy!<br />
<br />
I tried setting up my mailbox using both an IMAP and a POP server (my email provider supports both) but it's the same story.<br />
<br />
I called the 3 helpdesk: they have no clue and promised to call me back. Any ideas? If they don't fix this I'll have to return the handset and cancel the contract, because it's of no use to me this way!<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            I use 3's push email as well. It's been working flawlessly for about 3 months now. I did have issues with it at first but after I finally got it to work, it's been fine since.<br />
I think you can try the following:<br />
<br />
Do a hard reset so that all your mailbox settings got completely wiped out. Don't restore anything because the main objective is to get your push email going. Download the 3's email from 3's services page. Then setup your mail box. During testing, send a email
 from a different account rather than sending it to yourself, because different email providers have different behaviour with self sending.

            I removed the software ('email on 3') and reinstalled it a number of times. Did you mean this or a hard reset of the whole mobile?<br />
<br />
What Nokia do you have? Exactly what problems did you experience and how did you solve them?<br />
<br />
Things are getting better now: emails no longer disappear after I switch the phone off and back on, but delivery is not instant and takes about 5-8 minutes - even when I send mail from other addresses to myself. Do you receive emails instantly?<br />
<br />
Could my issues have something to do with the recent change to 3g only in the network, or with the fact that data transmission may not work 100% the first few days after the number is activated?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!

 log in one morning and it said "someone else is logged into my email." I tried then to reset my password, well my answer to my question "what is my oldest childhood friend?" did not work. I then went to the page to reset password but it wants info to identify
 myself, particularly what subject lines have I used in recent emails. I HAVE NOT WRITTEN ANY EMAILS RECENTLY! I do know who I get regular emails from, like my husband *****, Pottery Barn, Anderson Elementary, Santander. PLEASE HELP ME GET BACK INTO MY HOTMAIL
 ACCOUNT!!! I cannot access it from my phone, my PC, my husband's phone, etc. I may be the victim of a hacker the broke into my account, however, I am a housewife, there are no secrets in this email address and I would like it so that I contact my friends.
 The form that you fill out with all my personal data gets rejected because I don't have subject lines....PLEASE HELP or FORWARD TO SOMEONE THAT CAN.&nbsp;</span>

<p>
</p><p>I often have 10 or 20 windows open in Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone else suggested that this had to do with Apple's "sandboxing" but that can't be right: I have other apps (including text wrangler, etc.) that remember what docs were open.<br />

            <p>David:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a gentle hint: running Word with 10 or 20 documents permanently open is a short trip to crash city.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when those crashes occur, you will often find that the document has been corrupted, and can no longer be opened at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I know it works some of the time.&nbsp; But the times when it doesn't are pretty scary.&nbsp; Just because we can, does not mean we should :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the issue itself, I suspect this is involved with the "Can't see recent documents" bug that was recently opened, and on which they are now working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Hi John, I totally appreciate your point, but this falls into the category of "I've been doing it this way for a decade or two." I haven't had problems with Mac Word crashing or corrupting docs (I hope I'm not jinxing myself by saying so). ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But whether it's 10 docs open or just 1, Word should remember and re-open the file(s) after a quit (or crash).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the topic of "recent documents": I love the File &gt; Open Recent &gt; More… feature, but: a) the cmd-shift-O shortcut that appears in the menu doesn't appear to work for me; and b) I wish I could select more than one document at a time in the dialog box that
 appears!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Agree with David. The issue is not how many documents we have open, but the behavior of the program that we can't control.&nbsp;The cloud makes corruption irrelevant now; I just restore a previous version or a backup copy that was synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a huge problem for me anytime Microsoft updates Word because it means that I lose track of all the documents I'm currently working on. Some of them I use as reminders for what I need to do. Some of them I always need open to look something up. For
 Macs, the resume session feature is built into the OS and should allow us to decide when we want it or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked great for me in previous versions. Why wouldn't they carry it over and at least give the option to turn it on or off? Or maybe there is something we missed?</p>

<h2>            Selection shadow dissappears in outlook 2013</h2>
                    When in Outlook 2013, I will have a message selected in my inbox or other folder. If I click out of outlook, the shadow/highlight indicating the message I was on disappears. I have check other computers in the office that have the same setup, and this
 does not happen. How do I get outlook to remember/show/highlight &nbsp;that last message I was working on?

    <title>Causing&#47;forcing IE to open my document via DDE or Shell instead of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joseph willcoxson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Causing&#47;forcing IE to open my document via DDE or Shell instead of via COM&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I work on a regular Windows application (MFC based) and a version that is hosted on the web. When we download documents from the web via a link and select "Open", two different methods seem to be used to open the file. If the IE process
 is 32-bit and ours is 64-bit (or vice versa) then IE uses DDE to open the document. OTOH, if both the IE process and ours is 64-bit (or 32-bit), then the document is opened via COM (CoCreateInstance/IPersistFile or IPersistStorage, etc). What also happens
 is that a blank page is displayed in IE and the URL of the document is displayed in the address bar of IE.</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>OTOH, if an Excel (or Word) document is Opened from a link, it does not use COM to open the document if the bitness of the processes match, but it always appears to use DDE. In addition, IE doesn't navigate to a blank page with the URL of the Excel document
 in the address bar, but the page that the link was on stays loaded.</p>
<p>I would like to be able to force IE to always use DDE to open the document. When IE uses COM, weird things happen. For example, if the user has the blank page with the URL of the document in the browser, then if they go BACK in IE, the document disappears
 in the standalone application.</p>
<p>So is there some registry setting or COM interface I have to implement to force IE to not use COM but use DDE or the shell to open my documents in the standalone app?</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>One of the weird things I've noticed is that if it uses DDE (32/64 or 64/32 unmatch between IE and application) then when prompted to save/open, it prompts from the status bar area of IE. If it uses COM (32/32 or 64/64 match between IE and application) then
 it prompts from a dialog in the center of IE. Not that I care about it, but it just seems as if there are two different code paths it goes down depending on whether the process widths match or don't match.</p>
<p>I've used the procmon utility to spy on registry usage by IE and to look at the command line when Excel is launched by IE. I can see it launching Excel with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\EXCEL.EXE" /h /dde "path/to/url"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It launches my application in a similar manner when the bitness of IE and my app don't match (32/64 or 64/32), but with slightly different arguments that it reads from my applications HKCR\%MyDocsProgID%\shell\open\command and ddeexec keys.</p>

    <title>Extra window when opening files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ec_exeter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extra window when opening files</h2>
                    <p>Most of the time when I launch an Office application it is by opening an existing file. But when I do so, another window is also opened - either the Workbook Gallery (in Excel; it's called something else in Word / Powerpoint) or a blank document, depending
 on whether I have the preference set to show the Gallery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that applications are meant to show at least one window when they are launched (which could be the file I wanted to open!), but is it possible to suppress this extra window when I open a file from the Finder?</p>

<h2>            How do I change the spacing, or height, of To, Cc and Bcc lines&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>New laptop, using the pre-installed Office and Outlook's is driving me crazy.</p>
<p>Seems like every time I re-open Outlook, the view settings or layout changes. For example: Every time I open an email in a new window after I open Outlook, the window is not maximized. It will remain maximized when I open other emails if I expand the first
 email that I open for as long as Outlook is running, but once I close Outlook and reopen it, emails that are opened in a new window will not be maximized. How do I change this once and for all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue - I just run a CCleaner, not sure if it is related, but after a reboot the To/Cc/Bcc lines of new/reply/forward emails have huge spacing between them (see attached). This wasn't the case before the reboot. Is there a way to fix that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my test in Outlook monthly channel the latest version 1905 (11629.20214), it should be a expected behavior, in my mind, Outlook may has changed to its new view. If you are in 1905 version, I suggest you can submit a feedback at
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook UserVoice</a>, we would greatly appreciate you sharing suggestions and ideas with our related team. Thanks for your time and efforts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you may select View tab in Outlook-&gt;select “Use Tighter Spacing” button:</p>

<h3> jbuss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does AutoSave work when using Excel 2010 in compatibility mode&#63;</h2>
                    Our office recently switched to Office 2010 and some users are still on Office 2003 for a few more weeks.<br />
<br />
A colleague spent about 6 hours editing a spreadsheet in Excel 2010 in compatibility mode. She is pretty certain that she clicked the Save button periodically. Suddenly Excel crashed and when she went back, it appears that the document wasn't saved and there
 was nothing to recover from auto save.<br />
<br />
Is this a fluke, or is it a compatibility mode issue?<br />

<h2>            Booking - a few general questions</h2>
                    <p>I'm setting up Booking in the Office365 Office Center for the first time, and can't find any answers to some general questions. Our calendars are in Outlook on the desktop, so we can click to see someone else's calendar, but they are not together as one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is there any way to block out time on a calendar for no appointments without having to put it on the calendar AS an appointment? For example, no appointments Mondays until 10 am - is there a way to do that without actually putting an appointment on the
 calendar that is No Appointments? There may be other appointments for that time period or there may not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Along the same lines, is there a way to have a time free? For example, if I have something I'm doing also as an appointment on someone else's calendar just so they know I'm booked, this does not need to show as a blocked time for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To accomplish these 2 things, would we have to use the calendar online instead? We are hoping not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) How do we embed the calendar into our website as a whole calendar. I figured out how to have a link to the calendar page, and how to have the calendar embedded so it scrolls. Neither of these is acceptable to the boss - he'd like to see the calendar as
 part of the page without scrolling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how much sense I'm making here - please ask any questions so I can make it clearer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Will every Monday be free until 10?  Under business information, you can set working hours. 
<br />
<br />There is an option in booking to block out free time - it creates an appointment on the calendar. You will need to create an appointment to mark off free time - if you show time as free, it wont block off the time on the booking calendar. 
<br />
<br />The only option is to embed the calendar - that is on the booking page. (I'm assuming you already found the page.

<br />
&lt;div style="height:1000px"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll probably need to go a lot higher than 1000 though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This worked, at least the height did. I added a width, and the width of the calendar within the content area did not change. That is probably not as big a deal as the height was.

On the free times, if it's going to vary, adding appointments to block off time will be the easiest option to manage.

</p><p>Thanks. I'm still working on the site - still have some tweaks to do, and need some proofing done before I can go live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The width of the content area is 700 pixels. I set the width to be 650 pixels. Yet the calendar itself is only 420 pixels. All the classes under mainContent are showing 420px. I'm going to try to change this in custom css and hope I don't mess up responsiveness
 of the site (I can always change it back).</p>

            Yes, you can - in Services, when you create or edit a service, click the Custom fields Modify button.

<p>It took me a little doing (forgot to save the whole thing), but I finally got them changed. However, this does not change the initial screen before the customer chooses a service. Is there a way to change that screen as well? I could not find anything on
 the Booking page. I know if I saw optional on a field, and then it became required, I would not be happy.</p>

            I finally got rid of the (optional) tag - I changed all of the service choices to have the phone # required then unpublished the calendar and republished it. It looks like the default is phone (optional) - so until a service is selected, it will say optional .
<br />
<br />If optional won't go away, double check the services to make sure its required - I set two to required but the setting wasn't saved for some reason.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9fe9b64-8f2e-4ce4-9f01-6217f12891df?upload=true" />

    <title>Linking an Excel document to PowerPoint - Making sure the link works, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aurelio74  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linking an Excel document to PowerPoint - Making sure the link works, also if the 2 files are sent to another user, that saves the 2 files in a different location than the original files.</h2>
                    MS Office PowerPoint 2007:<br />
Objective: I want to link a table from an Excel document to a PowerPoint document, in a way that the table in PowerPoint is automatically updated if changes are made in the Excel file.<br />
Identified solution: I "copy" the table in Excel, and make a "Paste special" / "Paste link" / "As: Office Excel file". The 2 documents (PowerPoint and Excel files) are in the same folder.<br />
Issue: The link works. However if I want to send the 2 documents to another person, and the 2 files are again saved in a same folder, PowerPoint tries to updated the table from the "old location" of the Excel file. The location is not automatically updated,
 as I believe it was the case in the previous version of Office.<br />
How can this be solved? How can the link be defined, not related to the exact location of the original file, but only related to the name of the Excel document - to be saved in a same folder as the PowerPoint file?<br />
Thanks in advance for your help!

<p>This used to work exactly as you want it to;&nbsp; PowerPoint would look for the linked XLS file in the folder you originally linked from.&nbsp; If it couldn't find it there, it'd look in the folder the PPT file's in.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't do that any longer.&nbsp; MS broke it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recipient will need to</p>
<p>Manually relink the file or</p>
<p>Run a bit of VBA code that lets them search for the original path and replace it with the new path (available on PPT FAQ; let me know if you'd like the link, or</p>
<p>Use a utility program or add-in that will fix the links automatically (I sell one called PPTools FixLinks; there's a free demo at<a href="http://www.pptools.com/fixlinks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pptools.com/fixlinks/</a>&nbsp;that lets you repair up to five links in a presentation;
 the full version has no such limitation)</p>
<p>The BIG problem here:&nbsp; this puts the burden of fixing the damage on the recipient; I don't think there's anything you can do at your end to fix it for them.&nbsp; You can "pre-repair" some other kinds of links by removing the path from the file link; then *usually*
 PPT will look for the file in the current folder.&nbsp; Unfortunately, with OLE links (e.g. your links to Excel content, other stuff pasted from one app to another), Windows requires a full path; it won't accept relative paths, so we're stuck.</p>
<p>Ah. Wait.&nbsp; Another thought:&nbsp; if you and the recipient agree on a drive and folder name, say C:\LinkedExcelFiles\, you might have a way around the problem.&nbsp; You create that folder on your system and put the XLS files there.&nbsp; They create it at their end and
 put the XLS files you send them there (shouldn't matter where the PPTs go, but may as well put them in the same place).&nbsp; The links should work then.</p>
<p>I'd avoid using network drives for this.&nbsp; Some releases of PPT 2007 have bugs following links to network drives, and if the drive letter is mapped to a UNC path ( ie,\\servername\sharename\) you're liable to get
 that in the link rather than the plain drive letter.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I started my laptop today and Skype asked me to log in for the first time in years, as it usually automatically logs in when my computer starts. I logged in, changed my password, and then saw that all my contacts were gone, as well as my Skype credit and
 the history of my conversations with these contacts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like another writer, I signed into my account for the first time although I use skype all the time. I never normally sign out. This time it took me to a very old account with the same email but I lost my credits and my extensive contact list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I recover that other account? Both the emails and skype names are the same but only one has all my contacts.</p>
<p>Thank you so much</p>

            This happened to one of our staff too, we followed the steps to reset her password and recover the account, note there was only one for her, but she is still missing all of her contacts, conversations and skype credit. When I checked her member details
 in Skype manager she still has credit assigned to her and has logged into the correct accounts. Can you please look into this for us and get back to me.
