            <p>Hello Rickrosado,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring Get Windows 10 Icon in the system tray?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, then I suspect that the problem might be temporary. Try to shut down your laptop completely, reboot it back after a while, and then try to initiate the upgrade to see if it works fine.</p>

<h2>            Wireless Network will not work. &#40;And neither Ethernet&#41;</h2>
                    Since a week ago or so, my computer's Wireless Connections stopped working. There are several Wi-Fi Networks around here, but none shows up. I have turned the machine back to its default state, but not even this will work. The computer is fine besides
 this, and I really wish to fix this. What could've happened? (Excuse my English!)

<span>Hi Michelle,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Resetting your <strong>Wi-Fi router</strong> is one of the maintenance procedures that help refresh your network connectivity. In this way, it could eliminate latency and will return your network status like when you started using
 the Internet. To resolve your concern, we suggest that you reset your <strong>TCP/IP</strong> or
<strong>Internet Protocol</strong> to its default settings. To do this, follow the instructions below:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #1:</span><span> Run the

<p>Hello and thank you for the feedback,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing wrong With the router. All my other Devices can Connect to the wifi without any trouble. Including my Laptop, it's only the desktop that has lost its Wireless-network Connections.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I have also tried typing the commands, but neither this worked. None of the others either.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I will include some printscreens, perhaps they will help to show what I mean. (Still hope my English is understandable, I apologize if I perhaps confuse you at times)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am only Connected because of my phone right now through an USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you see - the Wireless Connection is gone. I am not the most technical out there, so I am struggling a little.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I too have had my wireless connectivity disappear. I have tried all options in the troubleshooter but it says it "can't fix" he wireless connectivity. I am having to connect via an ethernet so I know the router is working. I see that others are having the

<p>KenCopo, try deleting the following:</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;your user name&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\ehome\ehthumbs_vista.db<br />
C:\Users\&lt;your user name&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\ehome\thumbs.db<br />

<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome\mcepg2-0.db</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This solved my problem where MC wouldn't navigate through my folders without locking up. It may solve your file naming issues?, at least it's worth a try.</p>

            <p>Excellent.&nbsp; So in Windows 7, Parental Controls are part of an optional download, part of the Windows Live Essentials package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove it, head to Control Panel and the Programs section.&nbsp; Choose "Uninstall a program" and find Windows Live Essentials in the list.</p>

            DayZ has only just released as Game Preview. When your buying it it clearly states that it is a work in progress and not to buy it if you want a fully working game. Overtime it will get better.

            With it being in game preview it is unfinished. It is a testing method basically. So not all features that might be in finished game are always in game preview. But it is a good way to help the developers finish the game and for them to see what the community
 thinks of the game.

            It's a preview game.&nbsp; You are able to give direct feedback for the game.&nbsp; They can make improvements based on you playing.&nbsp; I think that's pretty cool. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two possible causes of this issue are 1. Incorrect POP settings and 2. Firewall blocking ports. We suggest that you reconfigure your account with Windows Live Mail. To do this, please refer to the article provided below:</p>

<p>For Firewall issue, we recommend that you try to disable the security software. Please click

<h3> pabloperla  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I disable handwriting &#40;ink&#41; in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been playing around with Windows 10 and there is one specific thing that is driving me crazy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the touch keyboard with my Surface Pro pen (the first one with the wacom pen) it defaults to the handwriting pad instead of the keyboard and I have not been able to modify this behaviour in any of the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that handwriting is a nice feature but it just doesn't work for me and never will because of the way I write, it is horribly frustrating to try to teach any system to recognize my style. I prefer to use my pen on the keys, for those moments in which
 I am working with the pen and have to type a couple words fast, and it is annoying to have to change the keyboard every single time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make matters worse, after it has been opened with the pen and switched to handwriting, the default action when you use your finger is not always the keyboard and pops the handwriting pad which is completely useless with the finger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it also gets it wrong and shows the handwriting pad when using my fingers because I am holding the pen in my hand and the magnet in the tip is nearby (or at least that is my theory because if I am not holding the pen is not happening that often).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this would just be a minor annoyance if I could just configure the behaviour or disable the handwriting altogether, but I have not been able to find a setting or a feature to disable that does the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be achieved?</p>

<p>Thank you but I would prefer you to post the steps to follow here so we share them with the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, I have started a feature suggestion in the microsoft user voice webpage to petition for a handwriting toggle:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Doing that gets rid of the entire touch keyboard and not just the handwriting pad, the purpose is to get rid of the handwriting part of it and have only the touch keyboard working.<br />

            <p>PERFECT -- quick and easy -- now using my wacom tablet as a mouse doesn't pop up the handwriting pane EVERY TIME!!! It moves everything on the screen when it pops up, so this is a lifesaver.<br />
<br />
BAM -- 3 easy steps:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">
Turns out, it’s powered by a windows service called&nbsp;<strong>Touch keyboard and handwriting &nbsp;pane</strong>. Stopping this service will be
 in result of disabling the on-screen keyboard.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">
1. Press Win+R, type “<strong>services.msc</strong>“, and press Enter to bring up Services window.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">
2. Scroll down &nbsp;a bit until locate the service called&nbsp;<strong>Touch keyboard …</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">
3. Double click it, first to stop it if it’s running, and then change the Startup type to either Manual or Disable to prevent it from auto-starting next time when computer starts.</p>

            <p>This doesn't solve the issue. The original poster still wants the touch keyboard, without the handwriting feature.</p>
<p>This is quite annoying for me as well.</p>
<p>Ideally, instead of disabling handwriting completely, an option to choose what&nbsp; the default keyboard is would be better.</p>

<h2>            Symbol handheld scanner lmx5452 &#40;RJ45 to USB&#41; not working properly when connecting to a 64-bit Windows 7 System.</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am connecting a Symbol scanner LMX5452 (RJ45 to USB) to a 64 bit Windows 7 system. &nbsp;It recognizes the scanner and I am able to install the drivers. &nbsp;(Symbol COM Port Emulation device driver). &nbsp;When i press the trigger, the scanner shows the beam and
 does make the proper sounds but when software is run, it does not recognize that a scanner has been attached. &nbsp;The software we use is older and only works in a 32-bit system environemnt. &nbsp;I have tried using XP Box and a VM as a 32-bit system but the scanner
 is not even recognized to where I can install the drivers for it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;Thank You.</div>
                </div>

            <p>What software are you using with the scanner? Is it software that came with the device itself, or is the program from someplace else?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds to me like the device is working fine, but the program you are using to record the data might be the problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try opening Microsoft Excel and select an empty cell. Then scan a barcode and see if any information populates in the Excel spreadsheet.

<h2>            Acer aspire R 13 PTP Precision touch pad not fully functional.</h2>
                    <p>Hello I made a post on ACER about this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I see the OS windows 8.1 is updated and I installed ALL the drivers from ACER and from other places due to acer not having drivers for an ethernet even though this laptop don't got one that is another headache to deal with.
</p>
<p>ALL the gestures are working but ONE important one for me is the ability to tap and DRAG. TO tap and hold on the mouse pad and to drag an icon or a window or a scroll bar but I CAN not o that according to PTP it said ti tap and tap again quickly that not
 working i even set the delay for typing to max or off and it will not work. I can click and drag by holding the mouse button using two fingers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the hardwares it using microsoft drivers from 2006 I do believe I need to update it to get it working properly</p>

</p><p>My bios is set for advance touch pad I cant seems to find drivers tat will work let alone that is more updated then 2006</p>
<p>What I did as a work around is change it back to basic and the TAP function works fine i just cant scroll
</p>
<p>So I force installed synaptics drivers and got it to work with all the gestures.</p>
<p>I do notice it not that smooth it a bit slow and not always accurate and I notice on occasion playing games the mouse pad will stop functionally until I restart the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite amazed how hard it is to get the most basic thing on a laptop touch pad to work correctly please any ideas to get it to work since i paid for a PTP I want it working properly not a half butt job.
</p>
<p>I can go into the reg to make changes and dont mind using modded drivers if microsoft do not have a proper updated version then what I currently have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time please let me know what you think and If you need more info.</p>

            <p>Hello thank you for the reply and I am sorry been working 60hrs a week and didn't feel like fighting this right away .</p>
<p>The two method didn't work. As for the first one when I uninstall it took awhile due to having to uninstall a lot of hardware till the mouse pad stop working then I restarted using the touch screen. I did not have an option to delete the driver so I think
 after reboot it just reinstalled the same old microsoft drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the chipset driver I have the latest from acer all the drivers for this laptop sold of been from that website there was 1 or two that they did not have on their page and had to hunt for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going to intel to use their updated drivers but intel basically wont give me the time of the day I can not seems to properly find the correct name for my chipset I try using the auto detect function from intel and that failed so using the info from
 the auto detect I try to manually find the drivers and that was harder then finding a needle in the haystack which i found two needles so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps I also switch my PTP back on to advance.</p>
<p>I am going to hunt around microsoft for their drivers or find a laptop with similar hardware and see if the drivers work.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>from what I can find is that you need to use the SDK version that is suited for the first Kinect sensor (the 360 one)</p>
<p>and I think this is the latest: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40278</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The SDK 2.0 version is meant for the new Kinect sensor that for example came with the Xbox One console, so different hardware and it requires that newer sensor (so not the 360 one)</p>

<p><span>I understand that you are not able to uninstall software, cannot turn Windows features ON or off and view updates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Before we proceed with the troubleshooting steps, please answer the question given below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Perform Clean Boot.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</b></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important: Reset the computer to start as usual.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type
<b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click the
<b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click <b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists in safe mode and clean boot, perform SFC Scan and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Run a system file checker scan</span></b><span> and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the following steps to run SFC scan:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.<br />
b) Click on ‘Command Prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt. Note: Click ‘Yes’ if it prompts for permission.<br />
c) In the command prompt type in the following command: ‘<b>sfc /scannow’</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>

On my laptop, this is not a problem....go figure!!</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
The issue could be due to some Software/update causing the issue. I would suggest you to press the
<strong><span>Shift key and hold the power button</span></strong> so that it will go to the
<strong><span>recovery options</span></strong>, Select safe mode and boot to the desktop.</span><span> If you are able to boot to the desktop,
 then I would suggest you to upgrade the drivers for display card. As Windows 10 is the new operating the drivers for Windows 10 might not be available. I would suggest you to install in compatibility mode.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>I have already updated the graphics driver to windows 10. the results was it made no difference. &nbsp;that is the problem continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>option 2, i do not have ANY problems with programs I have installed and therefore see no value in running them through the compatibility checker. &nbsp; ALL of them run in windows 10.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I did install the graphics drivers from the manufacturer, however it had NO effect on the initial problem, changing the display text size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had updated from windows 7 pro to windows 10 pro, 64 bit. &nbsp;After that, I did a CLEAN install of windows 10 pro on the updated windows 7 pro hard drive. After which I did system updates and then installed all programs including office 2007. &nbsp;I then did
 an image copy of the C Drive using Macrium Reflect version 6. (this C drive was on another hard drive). I then had Reflect "recover" the image and installed on another hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I could determine, the Office 2007 drivers, that were updated by windows 10, were missing/different when comparing one hard drive to another and was the cause of the text size issue I was having. &nbsp;Since you do not have office 2007 installed, I
 have no idea how to help. &nbsp;I have windows 10 on my laptop as well, which does not have office installed and have NO issue with the display text size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only suggestion is to start over from whichever windows system you had, windows 7 or windows 8 and do the update to windows 10 as per normal. &nbsp;Then do a CLEAN install of windows 10, have it do all the critical and other updates except for the graphics
 drivers. &nbsp;Use the graphic card manufacturer's drivers for windows 10. &nbsp;Then test to see if you can change the text size procedure... Do NOT install any programs at this point.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">reboot your system and see if the changes you made have changed or if it has reverted back to default.</span></p>

<p>It sounded clear to me.</p>
<p>The yellow (more like gold) star (more like asterisk) appears on the wireless icon in the Notification Area (nee System Tray).

</p><p>There are no 'connection' problems, <em>per se</em>.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your&nbsp;query&nbsp;on Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using Windows Wireless Management or another Manager?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue generally occurs when you use any other third party Wireless Manager on your system. If there is any second wireless management program, then I would suggest you to disable it. However, if you&nbsp;do not know of any&nbsp;other wireless&nbsp;manager, I would
 suggest you to clean boot the system in order to start the system in a selective startup to avoid any software conflicts.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, please run the Network Troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Hi Darr,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model no. of your system?</li><li>Did you install the network drivers recently?</li></ol>
<p>The issue, generally, occurs when a utility provided by the manufacturer to manage the Wi-Fi settings is installed in the system. If you have any such utility preinstalled in the system, then you may try turning it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possible cause, could be an issue with the network adapters. I would suggest you to update the latest network drivers from the manufacturer's website and check for the issue. You may also refer to the following steps to update the drivers.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open Device Manager by clicking the

<strong><span>System</span></strong>, clicking
<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the list of hardware categories, find and expand the

<h2>            Xbox One OS Version is not the latest according to the Support Page</h2>
                    
<p>When I check my Xbox One OS version, it says it is 6.2.12998.0 (xb_rel_1506.150601-2200) fre. &nbsp;It also says the last automatic update check was 7/28/2015 9:22 PM. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, on the&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/system-update-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One operating system versions and system updates</a> page, it says that the latest update is&nbsp;6.2.13194.0 (xb_rel_1507.150702-2154) fre and that it
 was released on 7/7/2015. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is correct, then why am I not getting the latest update?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>ChrisSwainman,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry you're having issues updating your console. First try to do a hard reset. With your console on hold the power button down for 5-10 seconds until the Xbox quickly shuts off. Then turn your console on. When your console is on, from the Home screen
 press menu, and go to settings. Within the settings menu go to power Power and Startup. Ensure that "Instant-on" is selected. Turn your Xbox off, then wait about 15 minutes, your console should grab the latest update. Turn your console on to see if the update
 starts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            &#34;My Documents&#34; and &#34;Documents&#34; not quite the same</h2>
                    
<p><span>A month ago, when I got my new laptop with Windows 7, I noticed that the Documents folder (in the library) didn't work the same way it had in the past (I've been using Vista for
 the past&nbsp;4 years).&nbsp; The main problem was that I like to keep the documents in sort order with the most recent document at the top, but now, all of the folders are at the top.&nbsp; They were always at the bottom, after all of the documents.</span></p>
<p><span>Then I saw a "My Documents" folder, under my User (along with&nbsp;all of the of other "My" folders that came back with Windows 7).&nbsp; "My Documents" does the sort order properly, and
 they both show the same files, so I didn't have to use "Documents" any more.</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is that not all of my documents show up in "My Documents."&nbsp; But they all show up in "Documents."&nbsp; I've been pulling my hair out for the past month, trying to find documents
 that I swore I created, saved, printed to file, etc).&nbsp; Yesterday, I looked in "Documents," and they are all there!&nbsp; The thing that gets me is almost all of my files are in both - it's only a handful of files that are only in "Documents," but it doesn't make
 any sense.&nbsp; These are Word, Excel,&nbsp;notepad and pdf&nbsp;documents for the most part.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I've tried to search for an asnwer, but the only thing I've been able to find is people complaining that their documents are disappearing, and the answer to them is always that
 someone came along and deleted them, or something.&nbsp; I'll bet if these people checked their "documents" file in the library, they'd find them all.</span></p>
<p><span>If anyone out there knows why this is happening, I would really appreciate a solution.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</span></p>

<div>Libraries are special folders and thus work differently than regular </div>
<div>folders.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The "Documents" in the Libraries can be showing more than one folder... what</div>
<div>does it say under the title, "Documents library"?</div>
<div>"Includes: xx locations"</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can add more folders to the library, just click on the "xx locations"</div>

            It's just like Google. &nbsp;If you are looking for a file called <b>The Man in the Moon</b>, your search will find any of those words, not&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;in that order.
<div><br />
<div>If you actually want the specific phrase, in order, just use quotes, like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>"The Man in the Moon"</div>
<div><br />
<div>The quotes tell the computer that you don't want to single out just the word 'the' for example.</div>

            <p>"Libraries" are just a view of groups of folders not locations in there own right.&nbsp; Anything in a Library view exists somewhere else.&nbsp; If you add "Folder path" to your Library view&nbsp;you'll see where the files really are [right click in the header line - over
 name/ date modified etc], select More..., type an "f" to get to the right part of the long list &amp; select Folder path].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>You can also right-click on an individual file, Properties, General tab - look at Location.</p>
<p>Like you, I don't really understand the point of Libraries &amp; I use Windows Explorer through the Users folder all the time.</p>

    <title>Surface Book and Bluetooth &#47; New Connectivity Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelpatricehuber2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book and Bluetooth &#47; New Connectivity Issues</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with Bluetooth and Surface Book (i5, dGPU).&nbsp; It started maybe a month ago, a few weeks after the installation of the Creators Update (so it was not triggered by the Creators Update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a Surface Book with a Surface Dock connected to two external displays.&nbsp; A Surface Keyboard (ergonomic version) and a Surface Mouse are connected via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every other day or so when I get to the office, neither my keyboard nor mouse are working (show up as "Paired", not as "Connected" in Settings).&nbsp; A shutdown, restart, hard shutdown (pressing power button down for 10 seconds) don't make a difference.&nbsp; The
 only thing that works is to "remove" the two devices in Settings and re-pair them.&nbsp; Then it works for another day or two.&nbsp; At that point I have to go through the pairing process again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I had this setup for since December of last year without a single issue until a month or so ago.&nbsp; My guess is this relates to the most recent firmware update (or maybe an update to Windows 10).&nbsp; Maybe related to power management.</p>

<p>Did you also try running the Bluetooth Troubleshooter? We know that remove/repair works, but you need a permanent solution. There were fixes in a recent update for Bluetooth, and some people report that running the trouble shooter fixes and others report

<h2>            Fable &#40;Arcade&#47;Indie Downloaded&#41; Freezes at Start</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Game</strong>: <em>Fable</em> (Under Arcade Downloads and &nbsp;in Indie Games)</p>
<p><strong>Issue</strong>: The game freezes upon start up. When the game freezes a green border with a black square center along with green writing that says, "There's a problem with the disc you are using. It may be dirty or damaged." Also when I go to my
 games I notice that Fable does not have a photo cover like all my other games under "My Games" on the Xbox. Also, I notice that Fable does not have Awards or Gamer Score under the game name like the others games under "My Games" that I had downloaded from
 Arcade too.<br />
<br />
<strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<em><strong>The Walking Dead<br />
</strong></em>40/40 (Trophy Symbol) 500/500 (G symbol for Gamer Score)<em><strong><br />
</strong></em><br />
<strong>Concern</strong>: Why would it say the disc is dirty if I downloaded it from the arcade? I am just hoping that I did not waste
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">800 Microsoft Points</span> for a game that doesn't even work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Steps Already Taken</strong>: The Cache in storage has been cleared, game has been deleted and re-installed, Gamer Profile deleted and Re-Downloaded, Update deleted and Re-updated.<br />
<br />
<strong>Results</strong>: &nbsp;Same issue occurs. I have photos and a video clip if further visual is needed.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
H2Kzer0&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just curious, why is Fable under indie games? It's not an indie game and should be under games on demand (all 3 of them).</p>
<p>I hope this wasn't someone making a scam indie title but I really just want to see what the problem actually is here.</p>

<p><strong>H2Kzer0</strong>: It seems this is an on going issue with others as well. With people with many different versions of Xbox consoles. This seems to be more of an Xbox Live Arcade issue than the users. Here are forums of the same issue to further my
 investigation of the matter.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: All of the following links are users with the same issue and the issue has never been resolved. Question, why have they not taken the Fable game down if it is not even working?</p>

<p>Hi H2Kzer0, welcome to the Forums! &nbsp;Here's something for us to try. &nbsp;I want you to note the size of the Fables download, then entirely delete it from your system and perform the clear cache/console restart again. &nbsp;Then, please head to the marketplace and
 download a game of about the same size- no need to pay for anything, a demo of a Game On Demand will work fine. &nbsp; Once that is done, try downloading Fables again, it should resolve this error you're seeing.</p>

<p>I have already tried this with the Xbox Technical team who assisted me. It did not work. I deleted the game and re-installed. I have tried other arcade games of equal size of 3.8 gigs. Nothing has worked. All of the people I have listed in each of the forums
 I listed in my comments have tried this too. Is it not possible that this is a server problem and not an user problem?</p>

<p>Where are my manners. Thank you for the suggestion. I would have added it into the original post about me trying that and helped by Tech team but it does not allow me to edit my post at all. Anyhow, thank you for trying to assist me Miss Ermine.

<p>Fable is an Original XBox game.... and as such it may have compatibility issues... even though it's been tested. I too have this game, and have had to delete it 2x in a row and re-download/re-install to get it to work correctly again.... this started after
 the Fall update for me. The game worked just fine for years before that. </p>

            <p>&nbsp;Are you sure you have a Windows 7 compatible driver?&nbsp; I'd go to Creative's web site and make sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<h2>            PC stuck in Automatic repair loop after forced Windows 10 upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: I got stuck the Automatic Repairs loop after being FORCED to upgrade into windows 10 from windows 8!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guys, I desperately need help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after turning on my windows 8 computer, I got prompted with a scheduled windows 10 upgrade in 15 mins. I didn't think it was anything special as this was probably the millionth time I got a pop up telling me to upgrade to Windows 10. So as usual, knowing
 that I didn't want the upgrade, I obviously pressed the cross at the top right as there was no other option to decline! Little did I know that a time ticking bomb was about to occur.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, out of nowhere the PC restarted and it had appeared that my computer was unfortunately being upgraded to windows 10. I just personally think that this is an ALL LOW for Microsoft&nbsp;to force an upgrade where I no where agreed to do so.
</p>
<p>But what makes me even mad is my files is now at risk of being deleted because I am stuck in the Automatic Repairs loop. This definitely didn't have to happen if Microsoft had not forced the upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is <strong>What can I do in order to get out of this Automatic Repair Loop without my files being deleted?</strong> I have tried restarting and the different advanced options tools but nothing seem to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am truly disappointed with the course of action Microsoft took in order to make customers get Windows 10. Microsoft didn't even create an option for declining this offer. I understand that Windows 10 may be better than windows 8 in all aspects, but it
 was my decision not to upgrade OS in which Microsoft failed to allow me to choose, instead I always have to keep pressing the cross at top right-hand corner.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey your best bet revert back to your original os. Go to Microsoft support and chat with a professional. Give them your product key and they will give you the download link for whichever os you had. Before you do that though. Make a copy of the MEDIA CREATION
 TOOL. Use a different computer if you have to. Then chat with a tech pro and ask for the link to windows 7 or 8. Once you install it start checking all of &nbsp;the drivers and do your windows updates. Get your system back on some track and then install the media
 creation tool either from a flash drive or disk. And that will reinstall windows 10 without any errors or freaking repair loops. At least it worked for me that way. Best of luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and when you install the Media Creation tool just follow the prompts and leave it alone to do its thing.&nbsp;</p>
