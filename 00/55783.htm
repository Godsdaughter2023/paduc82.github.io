<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i want the second clock to be a 24 hour clock but not first or main clock</p>
<p>To my knowledge ..... NO.<br />
Clock settings apply to all the clocks.<br />
<br />
In case you don't know how to set a 24 hour clock .....<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Control panel &gt; classic view &gt; Reginoal and Language Options &gt; Format tab &gt; Customize this format... &gt; Time tab &gt; ......<br />
Use ....... <strong>HH:mm:ss&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note : HH are in capital letters, uppercase.<br />
</strong>Click OK when done.</p>

<h2>            d3dCompiler_43dll</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install Office Home &amp; Business 2013 with my product activation key.&nbsp; It downloads about 90 percent and then I get an error code D3DComplier_43dll.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I try to research there are many sites that want you to download their solution but many
 want some sort of payment. If this is common why hasn't Microsoft fixed this. I just finished my new PC build and installed Windows 7 Ultimate, i4770k CPU with the intel internal graphics and I do not have a GPU card installed.&nbsp;Office installed once before
 but due to PC complications I had to wipe my HDD clean and start again Windows 7 Ultimate and all the updates installed fine. Where can I download a legitimate Microsoft solution w/o going to all these various sites?</p>

<p>Hey Kaiza, how many songs have you downloaded after applying the license transfer? I know there is a limit on how much you can download from another account for a certain period of time. I recommend you wait a couple of days then try downloading them from
 the other account again. Also, try clearing your system cache!</p>

<h2>            Comic Sans font appears jagged and ugly</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>A while back, the Comic Sans font began to appear jagged and ugly in Chrome and text editors such as Notepad. No other fonts appear to have any smoothing issues; only Comic Sans appeared to have visibly changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the font looks ugly when used in Chrome and text editors, when I tried typing with Comic Sans in paint.net, it appeared perfectly fine—no jagged edges. It looked just like it did elsewhere before.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/oZsQ1vO.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I screenshotted a comparison between Comic Sans in paint.net (how it should look) and Notepad (all ugly and jagged).</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd heard Windows 10 had font issues, but I haven't found anything specifically on Comic Sans looking like this. Any idea how to make the font display properly?</p>

                    <p>Hello-</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Questions related to terminating Cortana have been asked many times on this blog. One response mentioned the risks associated with Cortana's deactivation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This question is about obtaining more details and understanding concerning these risks -- the unforeseen consequences of taking this step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- What is the impact on the overall performance of your machine?<br />
</p>
<p>- Are the risks of terminating Cortana limited only to users of Bing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- What else do we need to know about taking this step?</p>
<p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />IMO, there are no crucial risks for termination of Cortana.
<br />
<br />You can adopt this reversible process for this:

    <title>Windows 10 Update Removed Minecraft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ilpedrino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update Removed Minecraft</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so my wife upgraded to Windows 10 after my experience with the Windows 10 Insider Preview was good.&nbsp; Several times here computer updates in the middle of the day when she is on it without her ability to postpone because of being Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; That
 in itself is really lousy -- should allow to set a time so it can do it late, but....</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIG ISSUE:&nbsp; This last update a day or two ago and Windows 10 removed her Minecraft game.&nbsp; Instead it installed a Minecraft PC Gamer Demo POS which is REALLY STUPID since we have owned Minecraft for several years now.&nbsp; I found the launcher in her system and
 re-ran it only to find that Minecraft was completely set back to Deraults.&nbsp; Thankfully she mostly plays on our server so she didn't lose everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gives here?&nbsp; Since Microsoft bought Minecraft I am assuming they are pushing it real hard, but to the point of removing the existing game?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this?&nbsp; What about other games?&nbsp; Will it happen every time Windows 10 updates now?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guarantee if it happens again I will be removing Windows 10 from her computer and putting Windows 7 back on.&nbsp; And if Microsoft decides to eliminate complete support for Windows 7 and does not reestablish user control over updates I will then move to Linux
 -- already have several systems running Ubuntu, Lubuntu, and Zorin and love them all.</p>

    <title>I have discovered that I have several fonts missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kez105  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have discovered that I have several fonts missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi. Can someone help me, please? I have Windows 7 and Office 2007. I have discovered that I have several missing fonts - they disappeared without warning. In particular, I am missing Gil Sans that I use often, and Helvetica. I have reinstalled W7 and Office
 but the issue remains. This is extremely frustrating. Microsoft, can you please help and provide some sort of file that I can download and reinstall my missing fonts? Anyone else with any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

<p>It has nothing to do with Windows 7 not including the font. Windows doesn't remove fonts that already exist (unless you let the installer format the drive, but then you're going to reinstall all your applications anyway), nor does it prevent later installation
 of any fonts from any other source.</p>
<p>I don't know why you haven't been able to get Gill Sans from Office 2007. There are several different editions of Office 2007, and the web page I cited says that font comes with Office 2007 Premium and just plain "Office 2007" which I assume means Office
 2007 Standard. Possibly if you have one of the other editions, such as Home &amp; Student, the font isn't included there, but I don't have those editions to check them. Copying the font files from the old computer will still work, though.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand the frustration you have been through, I will be glad to help you in this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Technically graphics should work with the same devices and programs that work with Windows&nbsp;8.1, but you might need to update or reinstall some of them. Drivers for basic functions like storage, networking, input, and display come with Windows.
 These drivers allow you to complete the Windows installation and connect to the Internet. You might be able to get more drivers from Windows Update.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Please run the windows updates, from Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a:&nbsp;Go to <strong>search</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b:&nbsp;<strong>Setting </strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c&nbsp;<strong>Updated</strong> and <strong>Security</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d&nbsp;<strong>check for updates </strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You can install Windows 8/8.1 drivers in compatibility mode if there are no Windows 10 compatible drivers.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps to install in Compatibility mode.<br />
1. Download the <strong>updated driver </strong>from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
2. Right click the driver installation file and select Properties then tap or click the
<strong>Compatibility</strong> tab. <br />
3.Place a check in the Run this program in <strong>compatibility mode </strong>for: box.
<br />
4. Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click OK.<br />
5. Try installing the <strong>driver </strong>and <strong>check.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful, if not let us know with the updated status and we will be happy to assist you further.</span></span></p>

<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>

</p><p>This update is not required to get Windows 10, you can still get it even though you don't get the notification. Just download it on July 29th 2015 when it becomes available. You will have one year to do so. The Reserve app is just a reminder/notification
 for its availability.</p>

<h3> zrizt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t type and use mouse at the same time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>First and foremost, yes I know this question has been asked, but that question has been marked answered, while the original poster had commented saying that the purported answer DOES NOT WORK. And I have tried their solution and it does not work for me either.
 So please do NOT delete this question for the sole purpose of it being a repeated question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I have already scoured the internet for a solution and THEIR purported solution also DOES NOT WORK. So please do NOT suggest me that solution, of which I will be explaining below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem is self-explanatory if you read the title of the question. I cannot use my mouse and type at the same time, and vice versa. The solution that used to work on Windows 8.1 and previous versions was to set palm-check or PalmTracking to minimum.
 On Windows 10 that solution no longer works. I have also tried fiddling with Touch Sensitivity; neither maximum nor minimum works in conjunction to palm-check/PalmTracking's minimum/maximum settings. That is, I've tried every possible combination with palm-check/PalmTracking
 and Touch Sensitivity and none of them solve my problem. I also have the touchpad delay setting turned to No Delay (always on), so that isn't the problem either. Please help me find a solution.</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Power Troubleshooter as suggested, but unfortunately this has not solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually ran Windows update and Windows is fully up-to-date. I updated the drivers as per the instructions in the link you provided. I also visited the ASUS website and obtained the latest drivers from there (as applicable). Again, none of these actions
 have resolved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My version of Windows 10 should be relatively 'clean' as I recently performed a fresh install of the operating system from a USB key and have used the laptop sparingly since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The device is not brand new. It was purchased nearly two years ago but has had very little use.</p>
<p>- I haven't tried to change the advanced power settings before now, so I am unsure as to whether this is a new issue or has always been present.</p>
<p>- No changes were made prior to this, except maybe the installation of programs/apps since I have started using the laptop.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Explorer Unresponsive&#47;PC Locks Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmb48855  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Explorer Unresponsive&#47;PC Locks Up</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm not sure I'm in the right forum.&nbsp; Maybe this belongs in Performance &amp; Maintenance or possibly Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>
<p><br />
I am having trouble with Windows Explorer acting "lazy" for lack of a better way to describe my issue.&nbsp; I cannot for certain blame this issue on MSE, but the Windows Explorer problem to be described does seem to coincide with the installation and configuration
 of MSE.&nbsp; Maybe I am wrong?&nbsp; But this issue has been sporadic since mid-Nov, when I first installed MSE, and has progressively gotten worse in the past couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
What happens is basically that Windows Explorer goes to sleep or otherwise locks up my PC.&nbsp; This most often happens after the PC has been idle for some time, perhaps 2 hours or longer (or thereabouts).&nbsp; Ultimately, all I can do is do a hard reboot of the PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can no longer do a system Backup to my NAS drive as the PC becomes unresponsive several hours into the Backup.&nbsp; I can do a Backup to a second HD, but that's because the BU will proceed before Windows Explorer 'goes to sleep'.<br />
<br />
Windows Explorer will go 'unresponsive' even though I do not have any applications open.&nbsp; When I try to open the Task Manager, I just get the 'busy' circle and it won't open.<br />
<br />
My system is Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit), with 8 GB RAM.&nbsp; The PC is a Dell E520.&nbsp; I have an Nvidia GeForce 9500 GT graphics card.</p>
<p>When this first started happening (again after MSE installation, coincidence or not?), I only had 4 GB RAM.&nbsp; I upgraded to 8 GB (DDR2-800 MHz) thinking maybe that was the issue.&nbsp; But in Task Mgr, I seldom use much over 2 GB of RAM.<br />
<br />
Things that I've already tried are:&nbsp; <br />
(1)&nbsp; Clean Boot (several times)<br />
(2)&nbsp; Disk Clean (~ once per week)<br />
(3)&nbsp; Defrag disk (once per week on schedule)<br />
(4)&nbsp; Remove unnecessary applications<br />
<br />
I am sure that my old Trend Micro antivurs/malware has been removed.&nbsp; MSE does seem to be working fine.&nbsp; But I can't help but think that there is some 'behind the scenes' system service that is conflicting with MSE.<br />
<br />
Also, I've checked the system error log to the best of my ability and there are numerous "System or Application Hang-ups" reported.&nbsp; But I am not savvy enough to ferret out and interpret the logs.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to "repair" Windows Explorer without having to do a complete reinstall?&nbsp; Any Windows Update that may have caused this issue?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your support.<br />
<br />
John B.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input.&nbsp; This is a final update on this issue.&nbsp; Long story short........ my hard drive was incipient to failure.&nbsp; I replaced the drive and of course had to reload ALL my software (OS &amp; Apps).&nbsp; All is well now.</p>
<p>This problem was hard to diagnose, because the PC would not freeze in Safe Modes thus leading me to believe that it couldn't be a hardware issue.&nbsp; Be that as it may, I virtually replaced (singularly) just about every component in the PC except the hard drives
 and mobo.&nbsp; But when I eventually gave up and tried to reload W7, the install would lock-up the PC.&nbsp; I even went out and bought a new Full Install W7 (for another PC build).&nbsp; And my fussy PC would not get through the install of the new OS w/o freezing.&nbsp; So
 as a last resort, I went to the new hard drive, and reinstalled the OS and that finally fixed the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again and I hope that others can save some time if they experience similar problems.</p>
<p>John</p>
<p>PS&nbsp; Incidentally, I ran Chkdsk/R &amp; F numerous times to no avail.&nbsp; And error logs were clueless in interpreting this problem.</p>

    <title>File Explorer resetting to Details after Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ko1967  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Explorer resetting to Details after Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>This problem only started after Windows 10 updated to the Anniversary update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to the update in File Explorer I had all folders set to "List" and there was no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Anniversary update all folders began to display "Details". &nbsp;I had to Restore Defaults and Reset Folders and then change a folder to List view and then change my advanced settings,&nbsp;and then click Apply to Folders. &nbsp;That did not change all folders
 as it would done prior to the update in that the first time I accessed a folder it would still appear in Details mode. &nbsp;I could change it to List and for the most part, most folders stay in List view. But sometimes folders will change back to Details view
 and the Apply to Folders and Reset Folders is grayed out in the Folder Options - View tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is definitely some kind of bug that was released in the Anniversary update and this is annoying the crap out of me because details view doesn't allow enough files to be shown within a folder.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's get this sorted out. We suggest you try these troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start the Windows in clean boot. To do this, follow the steps <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</li><li>Once in clean boot environment, change the settings again to set it back to <strong>
List</strong>. Normally, changing the view style in the bottom right of the window and exiting File Explorer should do the trick. The next time you open File Explorer, it should default to the last view style selected.</li><li>If the issue persist, let's run SFC scan to look for corrupted files. Here's <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/bd832f07-1420-0c14-d2a5-0a5a24ba40be/using-system-file-checker-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
how</a>.</li><li>Restart the computer normally.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Share with us the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

                    <p>I have never signed up to the 'Family Safety' or 'Family Feature' program on my Microsoft account but lately I have no access to Chrome or Firefox. To this day I have no child or parent connected to my account&nbsp;yet every time I try to open Chrome or Firefox
 it goes to Microsoft Family Feature, which asks me to send an email to a parent. Then once I click on it, it says "Something is wrong" and gives me a Trace ID. I am using a Windows 10 desktop that is logged into my Microsoft account. I am above the age restrictions,
 that of which does not require a parent monitoring me. </p>

    <title>GTA V Xbox 360 Disc 2 Unreadible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drunkenpolish  say:</h3>
<h2>            GTA V Xbox 360 Disc 2 Unreadible</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought GTA V for my old Xbox 360 that I've had since around 2007. &nbsp;It has a 250 GB hard drive with 150+ GB free. &nbsp;I was able to successfully run disc 1 to install and then it prompted for disc 2. &nbsp;I put in disc 2 and after a minute it appeared to
 freeze (the loading circle icon stopped spinning). &nbsp;I restarted my console and it could not identify the game. &nbsp;When I attempted to play disc 2 it gives me a 'disc is unreadable' error. &nbsp;I thought maybe the disc was bad so I went back to the store and exchanged
 it for a new copy. &nbsp;This copy had the same exact problem. &nbsp;I did take this copy to my friend's house that has a newer XBox 360 and it worked fine. &nbsp;I searched the Internet and found there are numerous other people with older Xbox 360s that get the unreadable
 disc errors. &nbsp;My Xbox 360 plays all the other games that I have with no issues so it is not a laser issue. &nbsp;This game just isn't compatible with all the older consoles. &nbsp;The store I bought the game from won't let me return it since it is an open game so I
 am out of luck here. &nbsp;I see that GTA V is downloadable from XBox Live. &nbsp;Is there any way I can get credit for this game and have it granted to my Xbox Live account so I can download the game? &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<p>What I would do is call Microsoft at 1-800-4-MY-XBOX and tell them your issue and see if you can have your system sent in and see if they can see of there is a problem with your console. I know that people with older systems are having problems like you
 stated. You could also contact Rockstar Games about this and see if they can help you with a refund since their game is not working on your system. Another option could be to borrow your friends Xbox to play the game or buy a new Xbox.</p>

<p>go into your memory settings and see if the install has a yellow ! on the data and then delete it from your system - even if it does not just delete the install of disk 1 / all data except saved game ( thats if you have a save for it )</p>
<p>then Clear the system cache</p>
<p>reboot xbox</p>
<p>put disk 1 into the system - click on game options and install - once installed put in disk 2 and see if you can play it.</p>
<p>if that does not work try calling the above number and see if MS and arrange a repair to upgrade the disk drive.</p>

 was causing the crash to restart. thank you for your help with this.

            hello DanielQrz&nbsp; you will need to remove the Xtrap folder located in the game file. in my case it was in the&nbsp;uncharted waters online folder. this will force Xtrap to install the latest version when you restart the game after removing that folder. it will
 do this install on it's own when you launch your game.&nbsp;once you have the newest version of Xtrap you should be good. I hope this helps you. :) let us know if this fixes your issue.

<p>Ok, same thing happened to my husband and one of our friends, we &nbsp;called microsoft xbox support, they told us we'd have to call the games company to get any help because they just deal with the xbox system and components.... so we called activision/infinity
 ward 310-255-2050 and we used the www.activision.com/support site a few weeks later and this is the answer we got: they have no fix for the problem (even though it's been a problem for several months now) and although you can no longer just find a game on
 multiplayer or even start a private match, you can still be invited to play by someone else, and then you can gain xp normally (unless god forbid you end up in another hacked server, sigh) and you can work off the negative xp... eventually you're supposed
 to be able to play normally again after that, we haven't tested it out, since the other friend we had that plays is also negative on xp. But we also aren't buying anymore of their games until they can fix the old ones first. hope this gives you at least a
 glimmer of hope, or at least the number and website to their customer service.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, with the way Activision is, and how life cycles of games are...CoD 4 is really just in a cold, dark, damp, and musky part of the server room. Good luck trying to find help.</p>
<p>All you can do is report the modders.</p>

<p>activision can not fix deranks, they cant fix deranks if you went into a modded or hacked game.
</p>
<p>As Viral Elegy all you can do is report the modders that were in the game from your recently played players, using the file an complaint option on the gamers profile</p>

<p>Infinity Ward nor Xbox can put your original rank back. The fact that hacked lobbies is such a prominent issue on the older CoD games is a real bummer. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do about this. I would recommend you stay away from the game or
 risk constant de-ranking.</p>

<p>i am sorry karmzacnt but activision cant fix deranks as it happened to a close friend of mine, he ended up playing in a modded lobby by mistake and got derank. then he spoke to activsion and they told me there is nothing they can do it fix his derank, he
 has not played cod 4 since. also advising someone to go into a modded lobby will not help, but might get the person banned for being in a modded lobby.</p>

<h2>            People cant hear me talk </h2>
                    
<p>I was suspended from communications on the Xbox 1 but my suspension was lifted two days ago. &nbsp;my mics worked 100% &nbsp;before and after the ban. &nbsp;But now i only can I hear my friends talk (I couldn't &nbsp;hear or talk when I was suspended ) but they still cant hear
 me. My mic lights up when i talk but know one can hear what im saying at all I have tried multiple controllers, multiple headsets two different &nbsp;xbox ones and two adapters for the headset still nothing so this is definitely a issue on your end would really
 appreciate &nbsp;some help fixing the issue.</p>

                    I'm told that with Internet providers increasing their&nbsp;Internet speeds, people with XP OS&nbsp;is not getting the full advantage of it&nbsp;because there is a limit in the Bandwitht the OS can handle of&nbsp;up to 10MB. Any takers ?

<p>I have a Gigabit Ethernet card in my Windows XP machine and I have been able to get transfer rates of about 24 M<u>Bytes</u>/sec (not just&nbsp;"bits"/sec) with no problems at all.</p>
