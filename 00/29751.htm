<h2>            An unknown error has occurred Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    I have been using this Windows Live Mail for a few years on my Windows 7Pro 64bit without any problems. Just recently in the past few days I get an error window when I try to delete an email from the inbox. The window just pops-up on the screen and says,
 "An unknown error has occurred", and Windows Live Mail will not delete that email. If I continue with other emails I can delete most of them without any problems. I can't see a pattern to which emails are chosen to give the error window. The emails that Windows
 Live Mail will not let me delete seem to be chosen randomly. I have made no recent changes to my computer. I regularly run CCleaner, Windows Essentials, and Malwarebytes and I haven't had any viruses etc. I don't open suspicious emails. I don't tweet and I
 don't use facebook. Any ideas what may be going on and how to stop it?&nbsp; My Computer Build: i7-4930 Intel 6 core, Corsair 950W power supply, ASUS motherboard, EVGA 780 graphics card, 64GB RAM, Samsung 500GB SSD for system d

<p>This issue may occur due to corrupt or missing registry keys related to Windows live mail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do you say this? There's absolutely nothing in Joseph's problem description that points to 'corrupt or missing registry keys.'</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p><strong>Windows Live Mail stops responding or fails to start ...</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no indication of this in the problem description, either. Joseph is simply having trouble deleting some messages.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I would suggest you to use steps provided in this article and check.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Windows Live Mail stops responding or fails to start after you install KB2454826</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2505524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2505524</a></p>
<p>Note: Please refer "<strong>Let me fix it myself</strong>" section in the above article.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>KB2454826 was released three years ago to prepare Windows 7 for the upgrade to Internet Explorer 10. The changes it made to graphics handling are included in the update to IE10 and 11, and the (updated) registry entries corresponding to those in KB2505524
 will already be in place on a current installation of Windows 7. Adding entries might only make things worse for the user.</p>

<h3> alisterlockhart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Welcome screen in wrong language</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded Windows 7.1 to 10 approx 2 months ago</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally went OK but although it is using English (UK) as the working language the Welcome Screen always appears in Welsh, both day of the week and month of the year.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can live with this but would prefer to correct it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking CYM (Welsh) on the Welcome screen allows me to press the Windows key plus spacebar and choose English rather tham Welsh but this is only a temporary change which reverts to Welsh the next time I power up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chatted with Norydel at MS last night <span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">
Case Number:<span>1335858091</span></span> and although I allowed him to take control, there appeared to be no resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps it is something requiring a Windows update but if anyone can throw light on it I would be much obliged

    <title>Keyboard input corruption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> epiccool  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard input corruption</h2>
                    I recently bought a Lenovo laptop with windows 7. I started playing some games like Oblivion, Red Faction, etc. and they worked fine. But after a few days, the letters and numbers now type a random number (actually I think it sequentially types 1,2,3,4..9,0,1,...)
 I can get the true value of the key input if I hold alt while typing. I tried reinstalling the games, but their input remains corrupted, even on new games. I tried wiping out the partition with the OS and restored it to the original provided by Lenovo. This
 worked, but only for a few days, then it was corrupted again. I've wiped it out again, and it worked again, but became corrupted again. It's also important to note that it is only with specific programs, games really. Firefox is getting my input just fine,
 so does minesweeper, and most other programs. I think that the problem must be with some driver/dll that these games are using. Any ideas on how to find and correct the error?

            Not sure about your model but some laptops come with a "small keyboard" lay-out where some keys can have different characters based on special key.&nbsp; Some keys will be remapped to numbers when Num Lock is pressed.

    <title>Poor videocall quality - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Poor videocall quality</h2>
                    <p>Dear All, I live in Turkey and I'm experiencing in the last 4 days a very annoying problem during videocalls:<br />
for the first minute or so, I receive both video and audio at very good quality. After that, the video remains good, but the audio becomes noisy, with a lot of crackling, that makes impossible to understand what the person on the other side is saying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s.: My video and audio on the other side are perfect even when I'm having this problem.</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
Giovanni</p>

<p>I experienced the EXACT same problem while video conferencing with students.&nbsp; On MY end, the audio (and video) starts out fine, but it degrades after a few minutes.&nbsp; Video quality remains good for the duration of the call.&nbsp; On the STUDENTS' end, audio and
 video remains good.&nbsp; They can see/hear me just fine.&nbsp; I was forced to hang up and call again (and again and again, every few minutes) to finish the lecture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Ubuntu Linux (Mint 18.01, actually, which is based on Ubuntu 16.04), GNOME desktop environment.&nbsp; I have the latest Skype release (updated just a few days ago), whatever that is.&nbsp; Giovanni's reported problem mirrors mine EXACTLY.&nbsp; And it happens
 EVERY TIME I call the lecture or lab computers.&nbsp; It's a bug.&nbsp; Fix it, please!</p>

<h2>            Unable to activate Windows after formatting</h2>
                    <p>I bought lenovo laptop which had windows 10 home preinstalled in it. I had some virus issue with my laptop and had to format the system. I took it to a local vendor to format and I am not sure what he did, but windows got uninstalled. I feel he used a Windows
 version which was not authentic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I continuously find an "Activate Windows" icon on the bottom right of the screen. I tried to upgrade as well, but nothing's working out. Cant windows recognize the laptop and provide me with the original windows 10 version again?</p>

            <p>Hello S.Panchatcharam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a brand new Dell machine pre-installed with Windows 8? If so is it running a UEFI Bios?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with shrinking a drive is that Windows will only shrink the drive until it encounters unmoveable files. This is the reason why you cannot shrink the drive as far as you would wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I take it that you want to shrink the C: drive to 200GB then you want to create another drive of 150GB followed by a third drive at 102GB?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Santanu's post states that "Why because they have already given 4 Primary drive,,3 hidden and 1 is C drive..all are primary.So cant creat another primary". While this is correct for drive that use the MBR (Master Boot record) partition table it&nbsp;does not
 apply to drives using GPT (GUID Partition Table). A MBR partition table can support 4 primary partitions; a GPT partition table can supports 128 primary partitions. Transition to GPT drives started around 2010. Unfortunately, Windows Disk management doesn't
 actually tell you whether the Boot record is MBR or GPT simply by looking at the disk management graphical interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the third party partitioning software called EaseUS Partition Master <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Easeus-Partition-Master-Free-Edition/3000-2248_4-10863346.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Easeus-Partition-Master-Free-Edition/3000-2248_4-10863346.html</a>&nbsp;Install this to your PC and then run it. Once the Partition&nbsp;manager window opens you will see a list of your partitions. Look to the right of the list and see if the
 'type' is MBR or GPT. If it is GPT you can create extra partitions by shrinking your drive. Actually third party partitioning software is far better at partitioning than the built in Windows Disk management console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a brand new Samsung Intel i7 laptop. The hard drive has a GPT boot record. Originally there were four partitions. 3 were basic recovery partitions and the other was the C: drive. The C: drive had a total space allocation of over 800GB. I managed to
 shrink the C: drive (the one with the operating system on) to 300GB leaving me 500GB of unallocated space to create 1 partition of 200GB for my data files, 3 partitions of 40GB each for VM (virtual Machine) systems and I still have approximately 180GB of unallocated
 space to create further partitions if I want them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you do decide to try any partitioning make sure you have a full backup of your system - that includes recovery partitions. If your system has a UEFI Bios then you will not be able to create recovery disks as the UEFI Bios usually has the 'secure boot'
 option enabled which does not allow any other operating systems to be installed. In other words you cannot boot from a CD/DVD operating system disk such as Linux etc. Ordinary software disks will, of course, work as normal.</p>

Hi<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your posting In Microsoft Community<br />
<br />
If Os was provided by Delll ,System will not allow to do partition in preloded OEM .Why because they have already given 4 Primary drive,,3 hidden and 1 is C drive..all are primary.So cant creat another primary<br />
<br />
It seem to you have got preloaded(OEM) operating system,Which is C drive <br />
Partition is given by dell ,If you do partition you will be loosing OKR facilities as well as Genuine OS ,1st you need to make recovery disc by pen drive or external drive.<br />
Basically in OEM you are able to see 2 drive,actually that having 4 primary drive,which 3 is hidden,If you will go disk management you will be able to see another 3 hidden driven given by laptop vendor.If you use third party software like partition magic you
 will be do partition<br />
<br />
<b>NOTE</b>:BY third party software made partition will be deleted if you do one key recovery,Creat a recovery disc by pen drive or external hdd,then go for partition,Do it your own risk<br />
<br />
As this type of issue will not handle by Microsoft ,Kindly contact your laptop vendor toll free number and call them for assistance,they might have some other way to do<br />
<b><br />
CONTACT TO DELL WILL FAR GOOD </b><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate if you could answer a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you trying to install the app from store?</p>
<p>2. Does this issue occur to a specific app or all Microsoft apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have problems with app from the Windows store, try this app troubleshooter.

            <p>By accident I stumbled across a work around. While learning Win 10 I noticed that the programs under All Apps. Those that have full picture icons are the ones the Win 10 recognizes. Those with our a full picture are still there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on one - I chose Comodo. You will see the full picture icon - Comodo Dragon - in my case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click that icon and a pop up menu appears, chose uninstall (but do not uninstall.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Walla, the old XP-7-8 Programs and Features are available with all your programs listed. From here you can update and or uninstall. It seems that Win 10 is just window dressing with the functions of DOS&gt;XP still there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Yeah. I had found this already. First thing I did when upgrading was look for the control panel. It still exists and you can go to the old progams and features menu you are showing from there.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have the the same problem.</p>
<p>The so called UNAVAILABLE programs are working properly...</p>
<p>Uninstalling&nbsp;the program and doing a new installation afterwards doesn't help! The result is the same!</p>
<p>I would&nbsp;like to understand:</p>
<p>- is&nbsp;UNAVAILABLE not compatible to Windows 10?</p>
<p>- is UNAVAILABLE a Windows 10 bug?</p>
<p>- would a 'CLEAN' installation help in order to avoid this UNAVAILIBILITY?</p>
<p>Please advise,</p>

            I am having the same issue with AMD Catalyst Control Center.&nbsp; I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it several times, but it shows as "unavailable" in the apps and features list.&nbsp; The program itself is non-existent and I can't even open it.....There is
 no icon in the system tray, it is not listed in the list of apps, and the option is not there when I right-click on the desktop.&nbsp; It is gone!&nbsp; Yet, I know for certain it is installed.

            <p>On comparing with control panel&gt; programs and features, the apps not having their size information in control panel are the apps marked as unavailable in settings&gt;apps menu.</p>
<p>As settings&gt;apps by default arrange the apps by their size in descending order, here unavailable simply means the size information is not available and hence these apps could not be arranged by their size and are thus put in the bottom of the list. It doesn't

    <title>Windows 10 Freezing on CLONE PCs extensive troubleshooting steps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> techtug  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Freezing on CLONE PCs  extensive troubleshooting steps included... still freezing though...</h2>
                    <p>A Google search on this will confirm that we are not alone on this issue.&nbsp; Lots of suggestions out there but no fix as yet.</p>
<p>Thus far ...&nbsp; I have called Microsoft tech support. (got disconnected)&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had an extensive Microsoft&nbsp;CHAT (got disconnected). I have requested a call back&nbsp; (Got disconnected)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am hopeful that this will find its way to a TRUE solution and&nbsp; Give the engineers some data so we can finally find a fix for this....&nbsp; The last tech (chat) recommended "Reinstall"&nbsp;. Easier said than done with 4 different clients at 3 different locations</p>
<p>This is happening on 7 different PCs .....&nbsp;&nbsp; you get the picture...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the scenario and several steps done to try and solve:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows 10 freezing on clone PCs. Seems to be related to Outlook but can not say for sure.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows 10 freezes you have to use the power button to recover. Mouse and keyboard are useless. No indication of Hard drive crash or errors in event viewer. This is happening to SEVERAL of my clients. Have moved the USB keyboard and mouse to different
 ports ... no go...</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have 4 new clone PCs. It is happening on 3 of them. This started&nbsp;back in May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also have two upgraded PCs that this is happening to as well. 3 Different clients... all CLONE pcs though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have done an extensive amount of troubleshooting already and I can tell you all the things we have done.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have upgraded drivers. (And Motherboard Drivers)</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have uninstalled Antivirus.&nbsp; One PC has Norton. The other PCs have Trend for Antivirus. We had Trend tech support totally remove Trend using a removal tool to eliminate the possibility that it was the AnitiVirus locking things up. The PC still locked
 up.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>We ensured that Defender was not running at the same time as the Anti Virus was. In case that was doing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We have ensured Windows and Office are totally up to date</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
<br />
We have determined it is happening in Office 2016 as well as 2013.</p>
<p>Once again ...&nbsp;&nbsp; We SUSPECT the freezing is related to OFFICE but can not be sure. Lets face it EVERYONE has their email open all the time....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On SOME of the PCs we noted&nbsp;some DCOMM errors to do with permissions to a certain process. We have even edited the registry to&nbsp;allow in these cases....&nbsp; We still have PCs locking up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the users reported that the PC was fine for 3 days ....&nbsp; until they fired up Excel ....
</p>
<p>This would point to Microsoft Office in General and not just Outlook. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">in office got to settings and "Disable hardware graphics acceleration" (under options-advanced-display settings). Once you change in one of the office applications it will change
 it for all of them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Does anyone have a fix as yet???&nbsp;
</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
That is not unusual at Startup if it only does it then, something is loading that needs a lot of resources.<br />
<br />
If you want to check to see&nbsp;what it is&nbsp;use the clean boot method :<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>Do these :</strong><br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow<br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

</span></a><br />
To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Refer to these threads for many more excellent tips however be sure to check your antivirus<br />
programs, update major drivers and BIOS, and also troubleshoot with the cleanboot method<br />
first.<br />

    <title>Unable to access audacity files in Windows Movie Maker on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crazy d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to access audacity files in Windows Movie Maker on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I created an audacity file and tried to opened it in movie maker. It didn`t work. So, I exported it into an MP3 file (how is that different from an .mp3?) When I went into movie maker to try and open it, it didn`t appear. it did save in my folders, but the
 file name was just FILE. I tried to change it so that it would just open in media player and I could hear it coming from the speakers and see a box which read media player file, and yet the file name just stayed FILE with a blank page as the little icon. It
 still wouldn`t open in Movie Maker as the soundtrack. I`ve been at this for a week. I need help.</p>

            Sometimes Movie Maker will have problems with certain .mp3 files. It seems like it isn't 100% happy with the file coming from Audacity. So I suggest going to Audacity and saving the file in .wav format instead. See if Movie Maker can understand it then.

<p>If this keeps up ill post Gamertags and dont care about the rules of microsoft. This is got to stop. I seen people kneel and are able to move faster than people running. Is this the future of games now where we buy games and console and mod them to play?
 I tell you what if us players ban together and go to the BBB on microsoft I bet my money they will try harder to prevent this crap.</p>

<p>Naming and shaming really won't help. It will get you banned but not them. Report and move on. There really is nothing else you can do.....or is there. Something about a tag called Bancandy and she likes to hand out bans for MW3. You should look her up and
 give her the names :)</p>

<p>I wouldn't rely too much on bancandy or the activision support line for reporting cheaters/glitchers/hackers
</p>
<p>I am sure they do ban/reset or whatever, but they sure are selective on who gets the chop</p>
<p>Had video proof of a guy exploiting a glitch with which he ended up with a k/d ratio of 45-0.</p>
<p>This was a couple of months ago, and nothing has been done as far as I can see looking at his profile.</p>
<p>The funny thing was, as he got the final kill, everyone could see him glitching on the final kill cam</p>

<p>You have to remember the number of people on the game and how many report people for cheating every day. Most reports will be people who lost to someone and report them with no real reason. Not saying these cases aren't legit but they got to wade through
 so manybaseless acusations to find the real cheats. So it can take some time.</p>

<p>op before you make accusations you should watch the match on thearter mode. i get accused of cheating all the time just because people can't accept that someone is better than them or because they got lag and lots of wtf moments.
</p>
<p>you said these people were moving really fast , well that could be because they just died and got the "juiced" deathstreak aquipped. or they had lag, there's lots of explainations so picking the easiest one and accuse them of cheating isn't right in my opinion.
 also nameing and shaming is no point, none of us can help or bann people, it will just get you in trouble that's it.</p>
<p>p.s : fileing false complaints all the time will get you in trouble too.</p>

<p>Yea if you consider croutching while moving really fast. I know that that person did not die cause he was 40-0 on team team deathmatch. Also I do know that me and my other teammates put a whole clip into that persons back then in the kill cam shows he took
 no dmg at all. If they made it where I could have real proof that I would summit it but I dont count kill cams as proof.</p>
<p>p.s : fileing false complaints all the time will get you in trouble too. Um no it wont and by chance it does Microsoft is a @@@ to do so. When I file a report I dont do it cause that person was good or better than me I do it because I know that person cheated.
 Actually I have quit filiing reports due to microsoft not banning people. I reported so many cheaters on waw that I wrote there names down to see if they get banned and nope as of today they still play not only waw but mw3 mw2. Geek even says people cheat
 on mw3 and hes a ambassador for live.Also I do watch the video after the match and when I die 50% of the time they never saw me or knew I was there so my hunch is right. People cheat plain and simple the Hardcore cod fans wont admit it and probly cause they
 do it because they are less of a men or women to actually kill someone on their own instead of using a 3nd party program.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since Friday, June 9th, I have not been able to connect to Skype for Business from any Mac. I have no issue connecting from a PC. I use Mac as my primary and secondary devices for work. I must have a solution to this problem. I have conferred with my IT
 department and they have confirmed that there were no changes to the Skype for Business setup or my account.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your description, there is no issue connecting from a PC which indicates the DNS records used for the Skype for Business configured correctly. So, please try other suggestions to&nbsp; narrow down the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Change a network to check if the issue persists.</span></li><li><span>Make sure that your Mac clock is set to the correct time since Skype for Business uses a timestamp as part of the authentication process.</span></li><li><span>Try manually configure the Skype for Business client follow the steps below:</span>
<ol>
<li><span>When you are in login page, enter your account, and then click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced Option</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Don't select </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Auto-detect server</span><span>.</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">Internal/External Discover address</span><span> enter:
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">sipdir.online.lync.com:443</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Save</span><span>, and then click</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> Sign-in</span><span>.</span></li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">
</p><p>Meanwhile, we'd like to collect the following information to better understand your situation:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>The detailed Mac OS version. Click Apple logo &gt; About this Mac.</span></li><li><span>Your&nbsp;sign-in address that you're using&nbsp;when you&nbsp;try to sign in to skype for business online&nbsp;address via private message:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list/"><span>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list/</span></a><span>&nbsp;to

            Interestingly, the problem self-corrected the next day. My IT department didn't do anything. There was no update from Microsoft. All 3 Macs, on different networks, were able to work just fine. There was no reason for the problem and no reason for the resolution.
 It is a mystery was it wasn't working and why it now is.

<h2>            System and compressed memory disk usage 100&#37; at startup with reoccurring high usage</h2>
                    <p>For the past few weeks I've noticed my 8 month old laptop being very slow, not responding, and I am unable to play games I could play just fine before. After disabling my anti virus and startup programs I realized that the actual problem is that
 system and compressed memory is using up 20-50% of my disk at all times, and hitting 99% whenever I open a program. Every time I restart it is at 100% disk usage for 5-30 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have tried defragging, turned off tips, disabled Superfetch, checked maximum power savings options, and disabled BITS. It's still happening. Have not tried changing the size of the virtual memory paging file from automatic since I don't
 know what to put.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this problem?<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4D4699F958111391!7707&amp;authkey=!AAU5oaXVDwI3dLE&amp;ithint=file%2cetl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Here's a trace</a></p>

            Hi, thanks for responding. As I said in my question, "system and compressed memory" is using up the most disk usage causing it to be at 100% usage. It also causes my memory usage to stay around 20-30%. I did troubleshooting and it said history was taking
 up disk usage.It specifically said "Troubleshooting history and logs are currently taking up 0.001MB of disk space." Tried troubleshooting again and no problems were detected. I said above I already did a clean boot, but the problem still occurs.

            I followed your instructions and my laptop is slower now. It's now freezing. Disk usage is still at 100%.&nbsp;It says 100% usage when a program is using 50 MB/s, but also at 2 MB/s.

            <p>I have the same problem - it comes and goes each time there is a Windows Update - sometimes it&nbsp;improves and the 100% lasts only a few minutes, sometimes it gets much worse.&nbsp; The updates yesterday made it much worse - 100% disk usage for 30 minutes or more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest update today for Windows Defender&nbsp;Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 (Definition 1.223.2255.0) &nbsp;seems to have reduced it immediately after the update was installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that's helpful to the Windows admins as this problem is&nbsp;definitely something to do with the impact of the updates.</p>

    <title>Credit CARD Fraud on Microsoft SERVERS and they do nothing about - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aabcdefedddddrq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Credit CARD Fraud on Microsoft SERVERS and they do nothing about it&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I use Microsoft's Xbox live service, and have been using this service for well over seven years. I am currently twenty years old and work a minimum wage job. Being a loyal customer to Microsoft, I have spent well over 7,000 USD in the past seven years to
 Microsoft and their partner companies. July 30th my Xbox live account was "hijacked" by an unauthorized user. This user committed credit card fraud upon my banking account linked to my Xbox Live account. This user authorized a payment of 75 USD to my xbox
 account that I no longer have control of. Immediately receiving a notification of this transaction that I did NOT authorize, nor commit, I contacted Microsoft immediately to solve the problem. In short, a microsoft representative told me that my account was
 locked from billing (meaning it cannot authorize purchases) and locked from xbox live (meaning it could not sign into Microsoft's servers for use). I accepted these terms and was told I would receive a full refund of the amount stated and a full free month
 of xbox live gold subscription would be given to me for damages. I was told that this process would take "7 days at the most" and the problem would be solved. I have contacted Microsoft Xbox customer support almost daily and weekly since then and I receive
 the statement that it would take longer, and longer, and then longer each time when I placed the call and when the original date of satisfaction was given. The last date I was given as a recovery date was August 23rd, 2011. On this date I had not received
 email confirmation, nor a phone call from microsoft. I decided to call them for the Nth time. I went through the process of explaining my situation to the Nth representative for a Nth time. After asking how the status of my case was, I was told "Our technical
 team is currently still investigating this case." How can a multi-billion dollar company with the name of Microsoft take this long to finish an "investigation"? This is unacceptable for a company of this status to be keeping my hard earned money while they
 "investigate" for an unreasonable amount of time. I do not believe Microsoft treats Credit Card FRAUD over their OWN servers with utmost discipline. I have personally researched these types of cases over the internet and I am APPALLED that cases like this
 are not being handled like a company should handle them! I have read that an average of 4,000 users (out of the many million) have their accounts hacked and charged fraudulently for the highest amount , being 75 USD, on a WEEKLY BASIS! These numbers are staggering
 because that is 300,000 USD weekly, including the entire time that a case takes to "investigate". That is well over 1 million USD that microsoft "holds on to" during the time being of all of these "investigations"! I use quotations on investigations because
 I KNOW that microsoft can simply, and easily, change the credentials on their very own server from the fraudulent and unauthorized user, to the appropriate buyer and subscriber. They state that these "investigations" are to "identify the fraudulent user and
 to punish them deservedly." "Punish them deservedly"? If they were exacting punishment, I would be receiving a summons to court along with Microsoft to "punish" the fraudulent user with the use of the law, not "Investigating" the case while they hold my money
 for this long and the unauthorized user is still accessing my gaming account! That's right! With microsoft's own Xbox.com I can simply enter the gamertag that was accessed ILLEGALLY and see that my gamerscore (This is a system used on xbox live to track gaming
 accomplishments and achievements and does so in a numerical value) has risen since my account was take. Not only do I call microsoft daily, but I also check my gamerscore daily and can clearly see that it has gone up since the illegal access. Every time I
 ask a representative if my account was locked (from using the xbox live service and therefore unable to increase my gamerscore) they reply "Oh, I am sorry it seems it was not locked previously. I will do that for you now." Obviously they are not "locking"
 the account. I have seen my gamerscore rise 180-200 points than when it was originally in my control. Non-gamers would think this is a good thing. It is NOT! Being on my account illegally, this user is playing with my identity (has deleted all of my friends
 from my friends list), and is playing the games that *I* payed for, not the fraudulent user! This situation is obviously not being handled the way it should be and needs to be settled immediately. I also asked for them to send me the times and recordings of
 all of my calls to their representatives for the possibility of a lawsuit against Microsoft, and they replied "No". I am NOT recieving the service I am PAYING for. I am NOT being refunded the FRAUDULENT money charge. I AM having my IDENTITY played with, literally.
 (Identity theft). I am not being treated like a customer should be for having spent so much time(7 years), effort, and money (well over 7,000 USD)that has been dedicated to a company. Microsoft is NOT treating the situation like it should be with all seriousness.
 I have constantly been given the runaround on this situation. Microsoft continues to hold my money on the basis that they are "investigating". A multibillion dollar company keeping a 20 year old's minimum-wage when he has bills to pay is outrageous. 75 USD
 to me is alot and is what I work hard for. 75 USD to Microsoft is a drop in the ocean, but when you add all of the other cases similar to mine up to well over 1 million USD, something is obviously not right.<br />

<p>My account and gamertag was recently hacked too in a similar fashion to yours, I have dealt with 3 MS reps so far, and all 3 of them have acknowledged it was hacked, however 1 of them says it's impossible for it to happen as i told them it had.It's NOT &nbsp;impossible
 has it happened, I have my bank statements and the emails MS issued to me as my proof it happened! However 1 of the reps promised me that order would be restored in approx. 2 weeks time including a full refund so will have to wait and see, I hope they don't
 take as long as they are taking with your a/c, and I also hope that they pull out their finger and get your a/c sorted soon. Also I am not in the USA so I don;t know about privacy laws there but you should look up "the freedom of information act" you might
 be able to use it for MS to release the conversations you wanted from them.</p>

<p>Add me to the club was hacked today, noticed that i had 2 unauthorized transactions on my account one for $54 and another for $81. I called the tech support to let them know that my account was hacked and they told me that they would have to lock my account
 and complete a investigation. So i'm thinking it will take a week or so to complete like my bank does if i have fraud. NOPE the representative tells me its normally takes 21 days to complete an investigation. I have over $100 missing from my account and it
 takes you a month to see if i ordered the games?!?!?. Really... check my game console and see that games that were fraudulently downloaded are not on the console, Investigation done. See what gamer tag has my CC number on it &nbsp;and ban the account, not that
 hard. I'm beyond pissed because i was one of those people who loved PS3 and always bashed Xbox. But after buying one i fell in love with it... Also to add insult to injury i'm told i'll get a month free as a customer service... I wasn't able to use it for
 a month so i didn't get a month free. How can people be suing Play station for the hack they had on there system even though its free but Xbox gets away with this &nbsp;when we pay for a service? The best part about it is i just bought 3 new games from gamestop
 4 days ago and i cant play any of them. Playstation gave free game downloads when they got hacked. Xbox gives you a fake month.....
</p>
<p>21 days for a investigation..... that's a joke o and i get 9 days worth of Xbox live &nbsp;for free.... &nbsp;I bought my Xbox Slim less then a year ago is there someone i can talk to about getting a refund for this crappy service, i'll take my luck with my PS3 again.</p>
<p>I know i'm ranting but i work for a company that sometimes has the same issues, it takes up 3 days max to fix this type of situation. Have customer bring in CC, pull up who's account are connected to CC, verify with customer if all the people connected to
 cc are correct, if incorrect verify customer information with the fraudulent add-on and contact bank, refund customer for drafts, have a nice day.

<p>So i have an update for my account being hack, so i called them on 8/27/11 at about 6:30pm, they told me they were going to lock my account so no one could use my card or my live ID. So trusting what they say i go along with the 21 day investigation and
 the locked account. I get kinda pissed not being able to play any of my games so i turn on my Xbox at 7:00pm and see that my gamertag has be transferred to another console. So i do a gamertag recovery and my account comes back on my Xbox. So the representative
 told me that i couldn't log into live or use my gamertag, so someone please tell me how after recovering my gamer tag i am able to play a online match of halo reach.... SO now I'm furious that representative lied to me about locking my account, and the guy
 who stole my gamertag was still downloading all the games he purchased fraudulently..... So i call Xbox again and talk to another representative who confirms the account was never locked.... So i tell this representative I'm not currently logged into my account
 and I'm not getting off the phone till i see my account locked. So after 10 minutes of waiting i get a message on my Xbox that my account was suspended and i have a ban on my Microsoft ID till 8/29/11. So all this happened on 8/27/11 but i couldn't post it
 because the representative put a ban on my account instead of locking my Xbox live account..I have no confidence or trust in this company anymore.I get charged fraudulently over $100 for Microsoft points, get told the investigation will take 21 days, get lied
 to that my account would be locked to stop any further fraudulent charges, have to call back to actually place lock on account, get banned from even using my Microsoft ID to post on any forums... I need a supervisor or someone to contact me ASAP because this
 is ridiculous.</p>

<p>no forums mods go near this post. &nbsp;The guy on the phone says that this happened loads of times recently, and he started getting flustered when I asked for how many he gets a day. &nbsp;This along with the post from Xbox saying they will not divulge individual
 cases, clearly shows this is happening lot's.</p>

    <title>Xbox Gold Renewal Glitch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snazzbox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Gold Renewal Glitch</h2>
                    <p>For&nbsp;everything Xbox boasts, it becomes exceedingly frustrating when it can't perform the most essential and basic of tasks. I started up my Xbox One, and I found that my Gold subscription expired. Come to find out, it was trying to charge on a card that I removed a few months prior and never updated with the ONLY payment method I had on my account. Why wouldn't it automatically update the method of payment for Gold renewal if that's the only method I had available? Such an inconvenience for such a simple problem to fix.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live Friends List - Showing everyone as offline.</h2>
                    
<p>Last night my Xbox Live Friends List was showing people as 'online' and 'last seen online...' like normal.</p>
<p>This morning I turn my Xbox on and all my Xbox Live Friends List just says 'offline' not 'last seen online.</p>
<p>Even says the same on Smartglass and xbox.com</p>
<p>Is there any way to fix this issue?</p>

<h2>            Memory leak, windows removed the fix downlaod</h2>
                    <p>[Solved] It seems that I found a fix. It was my NIC driver, I had to upgrade it to the latest version and I don't know why not a single program told me it was outdated... http://www.killernetworking.com/support/driver-downloads I post it for anyone who has
 this problem it might help</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi, I recently noticed a memory leak in my memory's nonpaged pool. It went bad once I almost wasn't able to use my system anymore. I found out that the problem is the netio.sys driver, Windows knows about this problem and released a fix for it, but only
 for Windows Vista and Windows 7, but I have upgraded to Windows10, and last but not least the download is expired, it 404 NOT FOUND was the funniest part. What do I have to do now?&nbsp;<br />
Here is the fix page:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/979223<br />
It's really late here maybe there's a manual way to fix it but I'm so tired and I spent all my forces to find out what the problem is.<br />
Thanks in advance for any consideration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:<br />
I managed to download the file, the link was written wrong replacing all spaces with "%20". I extracted the file but when I run it an error appears: 0x80096002, it has something to do with the certificate. Probably becouse it's for Windows 7. &nbsp;So, what do I
 have to do now?</p>

            I'm not sure which application is leaking memory. I guess it started after I downloaded the free version of Avast? But now it leaks memory in every download, watching videos, downloading programs, everything brings a leak in the nonpaged pool memory. I
 would like to use that fix but I can't download it becouse the fix might has changed name, is unavailable or has been deleted, should I call the support?

            <p>A memory leak happens when an application exits but does not release the RAM it was using back to the CPU. Hence, you have to know which application is leaking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you determine which application is leaking, you have to write to the developers of that application and bring the details to their attention.</p>

<h2>            When is Skype for Business going to be a viable product</h2>
                    
<p>Skype for Business has been one of the worst rollouts I have seen Microsoft do as of yet. &nbsp;First we could not communicate with outside Skype users. Now I find out that you cannot share screens without side users. &nbsp;When is this product going to be useful
 for a business? &nbsp;I cannot cut over my existing Skype users to a product I am paying for and is included in my Office 365 for business subscription until I can allow my users to bring people outside my organization into a meeting. &nbsp;While I was excited to begin
 to use Skype for Business so our team could look professional by using skype id's that reflected our company name and was consistent with our email naming convention. It has become clear that while communicating with one another internally it is a good product
 but to communicate externally is not an option. &nbsp;I need one platform not two and it seems that regular Skype currently wins out. &nbsp;When are you going to get your act together and make this a true business product so I can weed my users off of regular Skype
 and all of their funky non-professional Skype ID's?</p>

<p>hi brucesmith5050,<br />
<br />
currently, office 365 users can use skype for business client to communicate with external skype users. to do this, it is required to do the following settings with an admin account:<br />
1. add the required dns records in your dns hosting provider.<br />
2. turn on external communication and public im connectivity in skype for business admin center.<br />
you can refer to the article below for more details about the steps.<br />
3. add the skype user as a contact in the skype for business client.<br />
you can refer to the article below for more detailed steps.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/let-skype-for-business-online-users-communicate-with-external-skype-for-business-or-skype-contacts-b414873a-0059-4cd5-aea1-e5d0857dbc94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">let skype for business online users communicate with external skype for
 business or skype contacts</a>.<br />
<br />
also for external skype users, they may not be able to directly join into a skype for business online meeting in their skype client. however, they can use skype for business web app to join into skype for business online meetings.
<br />
when an external skype user receives a skype for business online meeting invitation email, there will be a link for the user to join in the meeting.
<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d6d1f3ae-7212-41c9-9fd8-dc30ab5521a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd6d1f3ae-7212-41c9-9fd8-dc30ab5521a2" /></a><br />
the user can click on the link and then will be redirected to the skype for business web app. then the user can follow the instruction to install the plug-in and then join the meeting as a guest.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=61fa9a61-d63b-4fc6-9340-537d87266c8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d61fa9a61-d63b-4fc6-9340-537d87266c8f" /></a><br />
after join the meeting this can receive the desktop sharing from other skype for business users.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e5177d2e-8f29-4078-b3a7-f630392f50a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de5177d2e-8f29-4078-b3a7-f630392f50a2" /></a><br />

<p>Yang - Thanks very much. &nbsp;This has never been something shared with us before. &nbsp;We received a lot of notifications 5 or 6 months ago about the roll out of Skype for Business for Office 365 and I was very excited to roll it out to my company. &nbsp;The first issue
 we had was not being able to connect to external Skype Mac users. &nbsp;We never were given anything to let us know that there was a web app available to external users. That is actually better than connecting and sharing screens with external Skype users. &nbsp;Thanks
 for that information. &nbsp;I wish it had been more apparent to us as we would have implemented it along time ago. &nbsp;Hopefully it works well and even better than GoToMeeting. &nbsp;Would prefer to use something we are already paying for. &nbsp;Thanks again. &nbsp;I will give this
 a go.</p>
