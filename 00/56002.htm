<p>My e drive is not reading or playing music CDs or DVDs.&nbsp; It is ejecting the discs automatically.&nbsp; I already ran a Mr. Fix It but came up empty.&nbsp; Mr. Fix It then recommended I go through Windows but wanted to charge me even though I'm still under warranty
 (I need to fax my warranty documentation-can't do that right now).</p>

            Sounds like a hardware problem, is the drive able to read any data/audio CDs or DVDs? If not, then you may need to replace the drive. If only a few CDs and/or DVDs are affected, check if they're still clean and not scratched.

<h2>            Got sound, but microphone is not working. Same driver.</h2>
                    <p>I have the ASUS Xonar DX sound driver for both&nbsp;Recording and&nbsp;playback. Playback works fine, but Recording is not working at all. Both is in the same headset and i know&nbsp;that isn't the issue because i have tried with other headsets that works just fine on
 other PCs. I've tried&nbsp;to fix the problem&nbsp;online&nbsp;by reading forums and watching youtube&nbsp;vids for both the driver, for Windows 10 (thats what im using) and the "the application is being used&nbsp;somewhere else" thing, but it&nbsp;doesn't say that anymore now and still
 isn't working.&nbsp;Tonight i got fed up with everything and reset my entire system to no avail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just a last attempt to see if there is something i missed out on. If there is something&nbsp;anyone think i should attempt, please tell me. If not, im just going to assume that the issue is somewhere in the hardware and replace it all.

            <p>Hi Andreas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the troubleshooting steps you have tried to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you installed all pending Windows updates?</li><li>Do you get any error message?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to install all pending Windows updates and check the status of the issue.
<span><span>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have also mentioned that you have reset your PC and issue is still occurring then this might be an hardware issue. I suggest you to contact
<strong>ASUS support </strong>from the link below.</p>

    <title>Adding a printer twice to set preferences to pull from a separate tray - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding a printer twice to set preferences to pull from a separate tray</h2>
                    <p>Having a HORRIBLE time with Windows 10....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a printer that will ultimately be networked for others to use as well. Canon MF 6590 - In previous versions of windows I could add the printer twice, once regular to pull from a regular paper tray, then secondarily to pull from a multi-tray for different
 paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get the printer to show up in the printers section - they show up in the device manager. But in device manager I can't change the preferences to pull from a multi tray.</p>
<p>

            <p>If the printer doesn't show up in Devices and Printers, you must install the win 10 drivers and software that you get from the printer manufacturer support site. Those settings must be selected in the printer software utility, not device manager.&nbsp;</p>

            We keep two different types of paper, one being a heavier stock that is used with a software program we use to create dispatch tickets.&nbsp; It has to have a selection for that printer with that heavier stock being selected from a multi-tray.&nbsp; Needed it to
 AUTOMATICALLY go to that printer with the paper selection of multi-tray for it to work correctly as it did with Windows 7 Pro.<br />

What the original poster was saying is it is more EFFICIENT to have two instances of the same printer, with different settings. You seem to think that a 4-step process is just as good as a 1-step when it comes to computer users. Karma, man.

<p>Choose the user you want to change, then select Change the account type. Select administrator, then at the bottom select Change account type.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll want to login as the new administrator and basically follow the same procedure for getting rid of the other admin account, where you previously selected Change the account type select Delete the account instead. It will ask you if you want to save
 the files for that account. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all thank you very much for your fast return. Unfortunately youtube cannot help me. Because my speakers have no any aux, or connection with cable. Also<span>&nbsp;speakers
 appear as <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">software devices(what is it mean)</span> on device manager, not as audio input-output so i cannot see my speakers&nbsp;</span>under the "playback" tab in "sound" windows in&nbsp; "device manager". How can i introduce
 the my wifi speakers to the computer as a default audio? I'm going to eat the head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>

<div>Thank you for the update.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We apologize for the delay in response and the inconvenience caused to you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What is the kind of software that the issue persists with ?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please follow the bellow steps to troubleshoot:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: Run the Microsoft Safety Scanner.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software. Please refer the below link to download
 and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</div>
<div>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for using an antivirus software program that provides ongoing protection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue persists, please follow the below step.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: Clean boot.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I live in the U.S. and for some reason I can not download this game. I was able to download the Plants vs. Zombies arcade (Games with Gold) one and then I purchased this game and it won't download.</p>
<p>I have 172 free gigs of space</p>
<p>I made my ip address static</p>
<p>I have erased any incomplete versions of the game&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have cleared the system cache</p>
<p>I have restarted the system in an effort to try to get the game again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It fails at random points, sometimes I get 63%, sometimes 45%, it's not an exact point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was also able to download Game of Thrones without any trouble.</p>
<p>any help or any advice anyone could shed on this, I would be greatful.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

    <title>Is it possible to ban an account&#63; The user stole debit card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gingerelvis-4b5ffba3-b7b1-4240-abf1-2f04a68a3d6c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to ban an account&#63; The user stole debit card details and purchased &#38;&#35;163&#59;400 worth of digital content.</h2>
                    
<p>The gamertag and user are both known to me. I do not have access to the account. The user is a 17 year old boy in my care. I believe he is using his (deceased) father's account. He went into my wallet and stole the card details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not looking to recover the money from Microsoft (although it would be nice). At the very least I'd like the fraudulently purchased content removed, preferably I'd like the account banned.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any aassistance you can offer</p>

            <p>You'll need to use the dashboard reporting tools to report the tag in question. &nbsp;Go to his bio and select File Complaint then follow the instructions.</p>
<p>As for the credit card info you'll need to report the theft to the credit card company in order to get it investigated and possibly have a refund issued.</p>

<p>Any suggestions please?</p>

            Hello Marco_rev01.
<br />
<br />Regarding the battery issues better to update your drivers.
<br />
<br />Next step run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/403723...</a> 
<br />
<br />If any issues would be detected, you may need to uninstall and reinstall the battery driver.
<br />
<br />Please review these Surface power states: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4036282/surface-surface-power-states" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/403628...</a> 
<br />
<br />All recommendation about battery you could find here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4023450/surface-surface-battery-and-power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/402345...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you tried everything and an issue persist please contact this support: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/devices</a>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply however none of that resolves my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to contact the support yesterday and today, but somehow the support tool gets stuck to where I need to choose among the ways of getting in touch (ie call, chat etc.). It is surprising that it is not straightforward to just get in touch via email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Marco</p>

    <title>Coreldraw 7 and Help and support - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Coreldraw 7 and Help and support</h2>
                    I installed Coreldraw 7, but when I start using it, whatever I click on I keep getting this message from Help and Support:


'Why can't I get Help from this program?

The Help for this program was created in 
Windows Help format, which was used in previous versions of 
Windows and it is not supported in Windows&nbsp;Vista.

For more information, see 
Windows Help program (WinHlp32.exe) is no longer included with
Windows on the Microsoft support website.'


I never asked for any help from this program and I do not need it. How can I prevent this from popping out, as it makes using Coreldraw impossible?

 or "What time is it?" I only get the option to "Search the web".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently using a fully updated (as of 5 minutes ago) version of Windows 10 x64-bit. I've also tried restarting twice and yes, Cortana is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in any advance for any help you can provide me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT...again: So it seems like Microsoft deleted my previous edit. I found a list of fun questions for Cortana on Digitaltrends but only 2/3 works for me although I need to wait &gt;5 seconds before I get the "Let's Chat" option.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
That is by design :<br />
<br />
Reasons Cortana doesn't talk to me<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/reasons-cortana-doesnt-talk-to-me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/reasons-cortana-doesnt-talk-to-me</a>
<br />
<br />
Cortana &amp; Search<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/cortana-search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/cortana-search</a>
<br />
<br />
If you type "hey Cortana what time is it" - Cortana will show the time in her<br />
box.<br />
<br />
If you type "what time is it" - Cortana will show on internet.<br />
<br />
If you speak "Hey Cortana what time is it" - Cortana will show the time in her<br />
box and tell the time in speech.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            <p>Thank you for the reply but unfortunately, it still does not work. I tried "hey cortana what time is it?", "Hey Cortana, what time is it?" and "hey Cortana what time is it?" and they all still only gave me the "Search the Web" function even after waiting
 10+ seconds.</p>

            HI,<br />
<br />
If you are typing it in Cortana will not speak, only show it in Edge. Read<br />
the link at the top of my last reply.<br />
<br />
If you are speaking you may have Cortana set incorrectly for speech.<br />

            <p>I realize that. However, I expected it to show the time in the search bar like it does when I ask her via speech (see top image) or at least a "Let's Chat" option like I get when I ask for a joke via typing (see bottom image).</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Once you have the "Web" search in the box title that is all that will happen.<br />
<br />
Click the mic on Cortana's bar and retype to see the difference.<br />
<br />
It is a little clunky but it will work.<br />

<br />
Yes such is not that unusual. Often if a setting is as you wish&nbsp;yet not <br />
working properly if you change it to something else and then change<br />
it back that works.<br />
<br />
Glad you have it working!<br />

            Where is this location button?&nbsp; I am sorry but people keep referencing this and that button and I have no idea to what they refer.&nbsp; Cortana appears to be just some kind of search gimmick - or official malware.&nbsp; I'm going to give it one more try though,
 if you can tell me this. &nbsp;Thank you so much.

            <p>I deactivated and activated it in the "Action Center". You can open it by clicking that message-like symbol between the tray icons and the language bar or clock. You can find the "Location" button at the bottom of the "Action Center". It should be in the
 last row of symbols. </p>

    <title>Unable to delete emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clivegurman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to delete emails</h2>
                    I am using Windows Live Mail and Hotmail.&nbsp; After reading emails in my inbox I move any unwanted ones to the deleted mail box. I then try to empty this box and initially it shows as&nbsp;empty.&nbsp; However if I then shut down my email connection and then reopen,
 some of the emails have returned, either to my inbox or to the deleted email box.&nbsp; Only the heading of the email has reappeared, there is no text, and there is a message to tell me that the message has not been received.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I fix this?

            <div>Thank you for your reply to my query.&nbsp; Unfortunately this ‘fix’ has not worked. The problem still exists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Just to clarify – I can move e-mails from my inbox to the deleted items folder, by clicking on the ‘Delete’function on the top header.&nbsp; I then attempt to delete all items in this folder by right clicking on ‘deleted items’ and then clicking émpty deleted
 items folder’.&nbsp; At first appearance it seems the items have been deleted as the deleted items folder shows empty.&nbsp; However if I then close down my Windows Mail and then reopen, the deleted items reappear. All that shows is a heading – Message cannot be found
 – and then text of the messsage – The contents of this message cannot be found.&nbsp; If I then repeat the process to delete all items in the deleted items folder, then all seems to be OK, and they are finally deleted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Occasionallly a deleted item reappears back in my inbox, and on this occasion same message appears but in addition the original message with the full text is also showing. When this happens I am unable to delete the message as a box appears – An unknown
 error has occurred – and the only way I can then delete this message is to drag the email into the Deleted Items folder.&nbsp; I can then remove by emptying this folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Can you suggest any other fixes?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>This sounds like a <em>synchronizing</em> account - one that tries to keep folder contents both in Windows Live Mail and at the server identical. If you're not sure what type of account it is, right-click on&nbsp;an account name in the folder pane and select
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Who is the Email Service Provider (usually apparent from the part of the email address after the '@' symbol)?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
If it is an IMAP account, then when you delete a message, it's flagged as deleted and (in your case)moved to the
<em>Deleted items </em>folder. The account will then try and transmit this flag to the server to keep folder contents there up-to-date. Meanwhile, Windows Live Mail will create a log entry to reflect the change. Both of these actions take time - usually only
 a few seconds, but possibly longer if there are other things going on at the time.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
It sounds as if you may be interrupting this process by closing down Windows Live Mail and then reopening. The log entry may not be written to the message database until after the program has been closed down, so you should always wait a few minutes after closing
 down for this housekeeping to finish before re-opening the program or shutting down Windows. Typical symptoms of this interruption are seeing
<em>Message cannot be found</em> errors. The message list is constructed from the database index; when you select a message for viewing, the program will consult its index to find out where the message is located and then retrieve it for display. If the index
 is incomplete or corrupt, the message may not be where the index thinks it is and
<em>the </em><em>contents of this message cannot be found</em>. </p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I'd be interested to hear why you <em>close down my Windows Mail </em>[sic] <em>and then reopen.</em></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify regarding closing Windows Mail and then reopening - My normal procedure when I first start up my lap top is to access my e-mails.&nbsp; Having done this, I close Windows Mail and then carry out any other actions I wish to do on the computer. When I
 have finished this I reopen Windows Mail just to check in case any new emails have arrived, before finally shutting down my lap top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion that I might be shutting down Windows Mail too quickly, before all the actions have taken place seems to be correct. I now leave Windows Mail open whilst carrying out other functions on the lap top and only closing Mail when I shut down.&nbsp;
 This seems to have cleared the problem that I had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!!</p>

<p>Windows Update Died Tried Many Solutions Still Dead</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After october updates microsoft update no longer works, so i ran the ms fixit (that died) told me to run a tool that may help with that, then it proceeded to offer me a useless CAB file&nbsp; : /</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried unloading services, removing the said folders, and restoring the massive list of DLL files, adding the update urls to the trusted zone, registring dll's was ok then&nbsp;told 2 dll's are missing, another guide show'd how to restore registry settings to
 put my missing BIT service back into services, that ran and imported, but upon reboot no service is their under that back ground inteligence service&nbsp; (its still missing)</p>

<p>Unable to update to the new one as microsoft won't offer a direct download and windows update says FAILED on every update i try,&nbsp;I can find them KB Updates&nbsp;on download.microsoft.com and install them, and they then vanish from the windows update offerings,
 so i assume they have installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After trying the windows update fix-it and the microsoft update fix-it, they both fail saying files are missing, ive done an SFC from my SP3 pro cd and it restored files, since then when i use my start menu short cut to access "microsoft update"&nbsp; it tries
 to load then takes me to a microsoft help page about unable to open windows update Here

<p>Ive tried a number of online scanners, many stand alone removal tools, had a nose with autoruns and everything seams ok, i do however have those 2 missing files, i can't remember their exact names but the 2 that are missing i have similar named files, i
 think one is wucltui.dll, ive read somewere in the past that someone had this file and it was for vista not xp (this is a clean xp install on a freshly repartitiond drive)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSE wont update, says network error and when i click help it just takes me to a useless page to download MSE&nbsp; (manualy downloading the vir pattern installs with no problems) but until microsoft offer a direct app download i feel im not fully protected here</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the state of play</p>
<p>MSE wont update, network fail or missing component or invalid registry settings (IE it has no idea)</p>
<p>Windows update takes me to an MS help page</p>
<p>Bits service missing in services and the reg key file wont make it come back</p>
<p>even forcing the windowsUpdateAgent to install only got me back into windows update &amp; then the updates come up with FAILED when i try to download, i need help with this and if possible a link to get the newest MSE before anything else goes wrong with my
 system, it seams clean and could just be currupt settings now, but for how long im unsure..</p>

            <p>OMG lol ive fixed it, gawd how stupid was that : /</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i was reading about a Windows vista issue with bits, and a windows 7, both had reg tweek ideas, couldn't find an XP modification REG file so i made one..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if anyone can't find&nbsp; BITS in their services and it shows up as this</p>
<p>@%SystemRoot%\system32\qmgr.dll,-1000</p>
<p>and your unable to start the service</p>
<p>run this as a&nbsp; .reg file&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>reboot afterwards and bits should automaticly now be running</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for Windows XP Only....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>make a text file, paste the code in below, save it, right click select rename, name as bitfix.reg then right click and merge with registry (make sure no lines have odd characters at the end or spaces</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also having this problem&nbsp; with Surface Pro 3 and&nbsp; Window 8.1 since last friday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Infinite loop repair and restore doesn't work because apparently some virus detection software stops it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried safe mode infinite bcdedit changes included not so recommended turning off autorecovery which mean it took me ages to get into cmd again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Above not that useful....any other tips..</p>
<p>It looks like a memory problem to me something needs to be release as chkdsk worked fine but sfc /scannow also was complaining....it seems to be when the surface loses power when trying to restart for updates... this is because after a few times it just
 says restarting and i happened to be losing power which i could do nothing about..so i closed the lid and reopened a few hours later to find bsod<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking this is going to be a big problem unless your guys figure out how to clean up when a update messes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i can do anything from the cmd but everything else has issues...</p>

<p>I have to say windows 10 is done terribly. The friends are off to the side and the feed is hardly relevant, considering you can't see who did something unless you click on it, you can't see how much gamerscore a person got for an achievement, and clips don't
 even work have the time. I can't see anyone who's in a party and snap is harder to use. My profile background makes me disoriented since it's all the same shade of a color. I've been with Xbox for six years now and I can easily say that this update is not
 worth it. Plus, you cannot switch back unless you want to lose all your data. Moral of the story is: Don't get this update unless you are a disappointment addict.

<p>OP dont worry about it the games that have not yet released will remain in the Queue even after they have installed, they will only stop showing there once the game has gone live on its release date, its a new feature!!</p>
<p>@ther00kie48 this is a beta some things dont work properly yet and some things have not even been added yet, thats the whole point of having a beta to test things as they release, stop complaining about something you willingly agreed to do, and if by any
 chance you didn't read the known issues list before applying to get the NXOE update(which everyone was told check before applying) then you have no right to complain.</p>
<p>The new UI &nbsp;is faster and smoother i can invite friends to a party or game a lot quicker now aswell and thats without cortana there yet( although she is there if you know where to look for her).</p>

<p>I've had the windows 10 dash bored update for a little over a week now. games do start faster and the party does start faster, but the games and apps store is broken. I know this is a beta and all but isn't this supposed to go live next month? I've had to
 hard reset my xbox one about 8 times and its crashed on me 4 times. i tried buying a movie today and it won't let me, any time I go to the game section to see when games are coming out it kicks me back to the home screen. they have a lot of work to do before
 they push this update out. plus I called xbox today and the person i talked to couldn't even help me because she said shes not in the preview program....</p>

<p>Yeah, with it going live soon they have some work it seems. &nbsp;I have had little issue for the most part but when I had one it was big enough. &nbsp;Having issues getting back to the dash (actually not being able too) or even leave feedback and a restart was required.
 &nbsp;Issue persisted while I was using instant on and required a hard reset. &nbsp;Switch to power save mode and a restart was enough the second time it happened.</p>
<p>This is a beta that can be pushed unlike a "beta" for a game that has a hard release data 4 weeks or so away. &nbsp;Especially considering that the game must go gold in that time and patching is not quite as easy as fixing before launch. &nbsp;Also, they can continue
 to push test updates to users to get feedback often so this could be fixed fairly quickly with it working as well as it does.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install wmp 11 on windows 7</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 and have WMP12 that comes with it. I don't like the new WMP12 so I want to go back to WMP11. I read other forums on how to uninstall WMP12 by turning off the media feature in control penal. I did so. Now when i try to install WMP 11 it
 will not let me and comes up with this error message,<br />
"Operation failed with 0x8007047F<br />
The specified program is not a Windows or MS-DOS program."<br />
I don't know what to do and how can i install WMP11 so i can go back how how things were on my old laptop and listen to my music.<br />
Please help.<br />
Thank you.

            <p>You can't install Windows Media Player 11 on Windows 7, thats just the way it is. You say you want to listen to music, then all you need to do is simply go to Library Mode and you will see the classic Media Player look which is similar to WMP 11.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied, then you can look into alternatives such as Real Player, VLC, WinAmp or iTunes.</p>

    <title>Polk Audio 4 Shot Headset Review - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Polk Audio 4 Shot Headset Review</h2>
                    
<p>So i've had them out of the box playing with since about 11am...so about 2 hours now...I decided to try them out on battlefield 4.</p>
<p>The Good:</p>

<p>* Great bass/surround sound effects (jets whiz by from ear to ear with better bass then my pc corsair's i have to compare to)</p>
<p>* use them on the go with your phone...great sound on music and while calling polk SUPPORT (see notes below).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bad:</p>
<p>* They aren't wireless as you have to have them plugged into the controller (not too big of a deal as the wire is small enough...just figured it would be for the $$)</p>
<p>* not sure on this one but i think using the headset on my phone for music/calls will drain the phone battery fast..we'll see though.</p>
<p>*currently not able to hear in game audio and teammates/parties at the same time...ummm.</p>
<p>*customer support wasnt very good when i called....they just said this was a known issue with microsoft and are currently working on it &nbsp;and then said they were having a hard time hearing me and mysteriously disconnected. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Not having the ability to hear the in-game sounds and then your teammate/party members sounds just a little bit louder then the ingame audio when they speak...is a pretty much a deal breaker for me...i'll probably be returning these unless I hear of a fix
 real soon...30 day return policy and im not being stuck with a $160 team mate only or in game audio only sound options...it needs voice over. &nbsp;Buyer beware they just said they are working on a fix...not anything about they have a fix. &nbsp;It may or may not come...for
 that kind of money you'd expect them to have the product polished and finished working smoothly...why are all these companies going sub par all of a sudden?</p>

<p>Thanks great review. I wasn't in the market to get them right away so maybe I'll keep my eye on them but not a must buy with that bug (if they don't fix it). I want them to hear the game and party chat at the same time.</p>

<p>No problem...I would like to add that the voice over works on cod ghosts so it looks like it maybe from game to game depending...i'm currently in the process of going through multiplayer games. &nbsp;Forza's audio is still glitching and crackling...this is either
 the game or the system because it crackles and cuts out playing on my new headset and my older 5.1 surround setup.</p>

<p>Did you happen to update your controller? I heard that in order to properly use the new headset adapter, you must first update your controller. Which must be done by plugging it in with the micro usb. I updated mine last night(unrelated to headsets or the
 adapter, I just saw that it said update so I did) I had to unplug my headset and take the battery out then plugged it in with the cable. It updated.
</p>
<p>Hopefully this works for you. </p>
<p>Let me know as I am wanting these or the TB XO 7's</p>

<p>yes i actually updated my controller before I picked these up and then after plugging them in I tried updating again and it wasnt needed...yes though they were updated and obviously this is something the polk team knows about since that guy went directly
 to his explanation sheet stating this is a problem that polk audio is trying to work out with microsoft. &nbsp;I'm still using them...trying in different games...so far problems in battlefield 4, forza, and RYSE multiplayer...call of duty ghosts is the only one
 of the 4 that voice over works. &nbsp;I was going to ask the guy about a time frame but his next response after he stated what he did earlier was...sir...im having trouble hearing you...sir...*click* pffft...i know a trick when i see one lol...i wonder if anybody
 else calls they do the same thing if you say you're having trouble hearing your party/teammates over the audio in games. &nbsp;Interesting, polk audios customer support number is 1-800-377-7655 for anybody else that has bought these and are experiencing like issues.</p>

<p>Another note...they sound like garbage on your pc...they wont configure in windows for anything except stereo and they play media all distorted...so ya dont think you'll be using these with your pc..maybe not even on the playstation either like I was led
 to believe.</p>

<p>What exactly do you mean you can't hear game audio and chat? I have the TB XO7s and a friend is using the adapter with some TB Tangos and we can hear each other in both Ghostrs and BF4 (while hearing game audio too). Not to say that there aren't issues,
 but that didn't seem to be one. Maybe what you're receiving isn't what I was talking about, though? Otherwise, this problem just might be on Polk's side.</p>

<p>yes its on polks side...they are saying its a problem with microsoft and are working on it. &nbsp;However..i didnt wait...i took them back..for that price they should of been tested and fully working. &nbsp;The problem was not being able to hear in game audio and
 people chatting through the speakers....otherwords..voice over doesnt work in some games. &nbsp;I picked up the x0 4's today and will post a seperate review on them..though i can tell you from just putting them on my head they are on the ear so they aren't as comfortable
 to me as the polks were...too bad i feel like hearing teammates and game audio is more important then comfort.</p>

    <title>DVDS rippers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            DVDS rippers</h2>
                    <p>Hey:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been frustrated with the most of the DVD rippers I've tried. They either do a half-a#* job, or they expect you to pay through-the- nose for a piece of software that you may not want after all. So, just asking those who already have/use a DVD ripping
 program. In your opinion, which works best and which open source programs <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
work best on Win 7</span>. Must say, I've had trouble with VLC, WinX, Handbrake to name a few. No, I did not use the "purchased" versions, which may be why I'm having difficulties. Certainly, there has to be an easy to use program(?) and I prefer it to be open
 source. Also, tried to just "copy" DVD but it went to AUDIO_TS and VIDEO_TS, then I wasn't able to "open" and play both files together to create the "video" (documentary). Could use help and advice.</p>
<p>THANX:</p>

            <p>Afternoon <em><strong>Canadian Tech</strong></em>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I must say I've not tried "tools built into Win7". The reason being, I'm not at all familiar with what your suggesting. Could you offer up the 'tools" your describing and/or a site that would explain. My problem is getting a decent DVD ripper that
 is compatible with Win7. I've tried several and each has/had their own inherent problems. Almost all I tried were of inferior production or just simply didn't work well (picture quality, watermarks, extremely slow...etc..) Will be waiting on your reply.</p>

            There are no tools in Windows 7 (or any other version of Windows) that will allow you to circumvent copy protection in commercial DVDs.&nbsp; That's because circumventing copy protection is illegal.

            <p>I am not at all sure I understand what you mean specifically by "ripper."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use DVDs a lot to make copies of things.&nbsp;I use this tool to create CDs with MP3 files on them to play on my car radio.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Windows 7 built-in process works well for me.&nbsp; It handles ISOs too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply create a folder containing what you want to burn on the DVD or CD.&nbsp; Then slip a blank in.&nbsp; The system will ask you a question about what you want to do next and eventually you get to the point to where you simply copy the files from that folder into
 the one that&nbsp; you are presented with. Then click burn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can tell you that there is a lot of confusion around compatibility of CDs and DVDs.&nbsp; CDs are pretty standard and work on most devices.&nbsp; DVDs vary a lot and you really need to know specifics about the player you want to use.&nbsp; I have learned through experience
 that DVD +Rs are superior to -Rs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing very fancy about the in-built tools, but&nbsp;they always seem to&nbsp;work for me and are usually pretty quick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot see how&nbsp;burning a DVD could affect picture quality.&nbsp; I have never experienced slowness.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;What I'm seeking is a program that works essentially the way Handbrake, VLC, WinX, or other "DVD ripper" would work....except I don't want any of the aforementioned "rippers" for they have inherent problems built-in. &nbsp;I have some DVD's that I want/need
 to "rip" so that I/my son and daughter-in-law can watch on my/their laptop, or if I should get a tablet. I have a CD ripper that I'm already quite satisfied with (Fairstars CD Ripper vesion 1.90), but appreciate your suggestions. I'm not familiar with any
 of the "Microsoft" tools available. I'm from the Linux community and therefore unfamiliar with Microsoft tools and technics. I'm not trying to

            If you're trying to rip DVDs that aren't copy-protected, you can use the free
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">imgburn</a> to create an ISO image of the disc being copied, and then use it again to burn the image to a recordable DVD.
