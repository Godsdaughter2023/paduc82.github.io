            Hi, hasp221.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
You could install the software on a separate device within your household but not on a separate partition of the same device.&nbsp; See the quote below from
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/HA102333141033.aspx?pid=CL100796341033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Frequently asked questions about Microsoft Office Retail Licensing - Products - Microsoft Office Online</a> and other FAQ's on that page.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>I have partitioned my hard drive and I would like to install my copy of Microsoft Office on each partition on the same device. Can I do that?
<p>No, each partition, as combined with the rest of the machine, counts as a separate device. If you are installing on a laptop, you could install your copy of Microsoft Office on up to two partitions, but the second partition could only be used by the primary
 user of the first partition. The first partition would be your licensed device, while the second would be under your portable installation right.</p>

            Hi yachtkulta, sorry, but the only route back to Windows 10 Home is a clean install of Windows 10 Home
<br />
<br />Backup your Data before proceeding . . .
<br />
<br />,You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            You will have to perform a clean install or you can the following option first:
<br />
<br />55. Open Registry Editor (WIN + R, type regedit, hit Enter) 
<br />56. Browse to key HKEY_Local Machine &gt; Software &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows NT &gt; CurrentVersion
<br />57. Change EditionID to Core (double click EditionID, change value, click OK). In your case it should at the moment show Pro
<br />58. Change ProductName to Windows 10 Core. In your case it should at the moment show Windows 10 Professional
<br />59. Browse to key HKEY_Local Machine &gt; Software &gt; Wow6432Node &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows NT &gt; CurrentVersion, change the same two values as in steps 3 and 4 above
<br />60. Close the Registry Editor
<br />61. Insert the Windows 10 Home installation media, do an in-place upgrade by launching the setup from desktop (not booting with Windows 10 Home install media)
<br />62. When asked, enter your valid Windows 10 Home product key and select what to keep (settings, personal files and apps, only personal files or nothing)
<br />63. Windows 10 Home in-place upgrade will be done now. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work....
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<br />You can do this with the Media Creation tool, which can be found here:

    <title>After update, Windows 10 &#34;hangs&#34; after launching one app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> old desert lizard  say:</h3>
<h2>            After update, Windows 10 &#34;hangs&#34; after launching one app</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 a few months ago.&nbsp; This past Wednesday (March 9, the day after patches were released) I woke up to find the background on my desktop machine was changed and all the desktop icons had been rearranged... but the apps
 were still up from the night before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However... the mouse would move the cursor, but no amount of clicking on anything would work.&nbsp; Figuring that an auto-update had occurred, I attempted to restart, but even when clicking on the task bar, the little blue "I'm busy" whirling circle would appear.&nbsp;
 I could do nothing "useful"... so I forced a reboot from the tower's restart button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 comes up, it waits for me to enter my password, and then everything SEEMS to come up normally.&nbsp; But as soon as click to launch any app, I get back in the same mode: the mouse moves the cursor, but whenever the blue spinning circle is over the
 task bar or the one opened app, I can do nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hoped to restart in Safe Mode... but the hoops you have to jump through in Windows 10 are horrible!&nbsp; I can set Safe Mode booting in MSConfig, but then I can't get it to Restart through the task bar, and hard-rebooting doesn't go into Safe Mode.&nbsp; The other
 option is to insert the Windows 10 install media... but who has that after the upgrade from Windows 7/8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stuck.&nbsp; Help!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ray,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to run app troubleshooter and check if it helps. Follow the below link to run app troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persist, try the below method.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If a computer is infected by a virus, lots of resources will be taken up to greatly slow down computer performance. I suggest you to run virus scan (<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>) and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to boot the system in clean boot state and check if the issue still persist.
<span>Clean boot</span> process will help you determine which third party program/app that is causing this issue. It could be some other application or programs, which runs on the computer at the background, leading to this issue. Please visit the below link
 on how to perform <span>Clean boot.</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you want to boot the system in safe mode, visit to the below link Microsoft article.</span></p>

            <p>Mr. Debbarma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply was NOT helpful, I'm sorry to report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 seems intended for Windows Store Apps issues.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I did attempt to run it, but due to the fact that my system will not continue to respond normally after opening one application, I could not get it to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 would not run for the same reason.&nbsp; I tried a couple of ways to run for virus checks -- I cannot proceed past the first couple of clicks in Windows Explorer, and a CMD window similarly "locks up" after launching any external app, though it will
 perform internal command like DIR and CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3 seemed promising, except that you pointed me to a web page which does a good job covering how to clean boot in a Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1 environment, but alas, EVERYTHING is different in Windows 10, and that link was of no assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, during another reboot attempt, I got an error:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb348780-0693-44e6-b612-50e887742990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb348780-0693-44e6-b612-50e887742990" /></a></p>
<p>By pressing F8, I was able to select an option for (sorry, I can't recall the exact name) something like "Windows in Safe Mode + Networking", which then allowed multiple applications to be launched and run normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I was able to get to the point of selecting a System Restore:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c61a1de-1675-4b4c-b0be-95171cc7b468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c61a1de-1675-4b4c-b0be-95171cc7b468" /></a></p>
<p>THIS was EXACTLY when my problems had all started!&nbsp; I selected this restore point and went through the Next buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took 30 minutes for the following screen:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96ca2ca8-ecbe-4608-acc3-132bbd7e29bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96ca2ca8-ecbe-4608-acc3-132bbd7e29bc" /></a></p>
<p>... and it has just now gone to:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9fe9634f-c1ce-4627-a8c5-2adffaf28cc4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9fe9634f-c1ce-4627-a8c5-2adffaf28cc4" /></a></p>
<p>I'm hoping (sometime today!) to be able to report success -- or at least additional progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ray</p>

            <p>Latest status:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The restore completed, and the system seemed to work "normally" for about 10 minutes.&nbsp; by "normally", I mean that there was no lack of responsiveness, and I was able to launch more than one application and switch back and forth, without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then... it started again.&nbsp; It's as if Windows Update applied whatever patch or "un-fix" it had applied before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted - again.&nbsp; And again, after launching an app, no response.&nbsp; With patience I have learned that -- if I wait 12-15 minutes -the system will all of a sudden come back to normal.&nbsp; In that intervening 12-15 minutes, I can double-click a desktop icon,
 then&nbsp;press Windows-E (to launch File Explorer) and nothing happens... even the clock on the task bar stops updating!&nbsp; But then, 12-15 minutes later... boom-boom-boom -- all of the queued-up clicks start to happen: the clock updates to the correct time, the
 double-clicked icon launches its app, and a File Explorer window pops up.&nbsp; All normal!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Photo taken at 6:46am; note clock has been "frozen" at 6:38, and the "spinning circle" cursor that appears any time you hover over the task bar or any app window (but not while floating over "unused space" on the desktop):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cda52c00-f790-4bbc-a73c-2ee68a104767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cda52c00-f790-4bbc-a73c-2ee68a104767" /></a></p>
<p>At 6:50am, the clock went back to "real time", and explorer completed queued-up clicks, then operated "normally".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran Norton virus scan -- all is good there.&nbsp; I turned off several Services and rebooted... same (bad) result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrating, indeed.</p>

            <p><span>I’m not one to be outdone by a mere piece of software… no matter how powerful. *chuckle*&nbsp; I think I have solved the dilemma of the “sit there and twiddle your thumbs for 15 minutes until you get your system back after a reboot” issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Perusing the Event log, I found this around the “start time” of a self-initiated reboot:</span></p>
<p><span>…a</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8bc6dfd-dc9c-4fc7-b1ff-3a1fa0d75b8e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a8bc6dfd-dc9c-4fc7-b1ff-3a1fa0d75b8e" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I followed instructions I found here:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-update-delivery-optimization-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-update-delivery-optimization-faq</span></a></p>
<p><span>… in the “How do I turn Delivery Optimization off?” section.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>NOW… I can reboot and immediately get back to work without delay or interruption.&nbsp; (At least this has been the case for THREE test restarts.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To be fair, I don’t know WHY this is a problem.&nbsp; Sounds to me like there’s a 15 minute timeout timer somewhere that, well, blocks EVERYTHING.&nbsp; When I have time later this weekend, I intend to re-enable Delivery Optimization and see if the problem re-occurs.&nbsp;
 But I’ve sunk a whole week into trying to get my Old Reliable Desktop back to its old giddy-up self… time to make some retirement money.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, there were other errors in the vicinity (time wise), but this one seemed more “spot on” and also most intriguing… since, I believe, Delivery Optimization is something relatively new.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If this issue plagues you, and my solution helps you, I'm happy to be of some help!</span></p>

<h2>            Game not launching on Windows 10</h2>
                    I've recently bought a game from the Microsoft store on Windows 10, but when I try to launch the game, the games' artwork/Cover appears in a Window, then crashes after about a minute. I've tried to find solutions for this problem but nothing works. I've
 even tried a repair install and that didn't fix the problem. This problem does not seem to happen with any free games/apps I've gotten from the Windows store. Does anyone have any suggestions to fix the problem?

<p>Hi InvincibleHawk8,</p>

<h2>            singing into microsoft account problems</h2>
                    Whenever I go and Click on "Sign in to a Microsoft Account" On different applications on Windows 10, such as Account Settings, Xbox, Windows Store, etc., I never get the sign in page and it either never shows up, or it gives me an error. For example, When
 I try to sign in through Account Settings, it never shows up. On Xbox, it gives me error code 0x3fb. And for the Windows store, it states that there was an error and to try again later. Its been a whole day since I have been having this problem. Is there a
 solution?

<p>Iam realy shocked i havent seen more threads on this subject?Since Friday i have been in games that the Host dashboards right at&nbsp; the end on the game.It wouldnt realy bother me so much if i still earend my points i worked for.Its getting crazy as hell already
 with this crap.Its happing more and&nbsp; more everyday.</p>
<p>Since friday i would have to say its happened at least 20x.I would host myself,but for some reason it wont let me?I always have 4 strong green bars while playing.Very rare to have even 3 green bars.Isnt there a way to catch these guys?Its just not right.They
 should show who the host is by highlighting there name in the game lobbie?This way we know who dashbored and turn them in.All i play is FFA.And i dont get very much time during the week to play,so when i finaly do get a chance its sucks when people gotta do
 crap like this cause of the K/D or whatever the reason it is that they leave?</p>

<h2>            260ci WIA driver &#40;USB&#41;</h2>
                    In WORD there are check marks on the side of most of my files and white Xs with a red back drop. I am not sure if this is a result of the driver message that says I have a driver problem. I'm only assuming the checks and Xs is a result of something else.

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Battery drain along with type cover connector failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> br0mz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Battery drain along with type cover connector failure</h2>
                    <p>Since my reply to another topic won't get attention, I'll make my own topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time ago, out of the blue, my type cover stopped working.</p>
<p>After lots of troubleshooting, these are my findings:</p>
<p>- This happened before, soft reset to uefi normally does the trick, but not this time.</p>
<p>- Tried al common solutions to this problem, none worked.</p>
<p>- Tried to remove the drivers and install the ones from here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826, didn't help.</p>
<p>- Did a full reset to the official win8.1 image, didn't help.</p>
<p>- Did a full reset to the official win10 image, didn't help.</p>
<p>- Tried several other type covers, none of them did work.</p>
<p>- Tried my type cover on other Surface Pro devices, works perfectly.</p>
<p>- My battery drains abnormally fast since this occured: full reset, load to 100% battery, push the power button to go in standby, 24hours later completely drained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a 'workaround' to get the keyboard working sometimes:</p>
<p>If I let my surface drain completely, beyond the level that the white "battery empty" icon flashes when you try to turn it on;
</p>
<p>and then I connect the keyboard, plug in the charger and power on the device; the keyboard works flawlessly.</p>
<p>However, when I close the lid or when I disconnect the keyboard, I can't get it working again without letting the battery drain untill it is completely empty again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I'm asking for Microsoft to take it responsibility with this issue.</p>
<p>My surface is worthless now altough it never fell and was treated with utmost care.
</p>
<p>This problem arose from one day to another and is clearly some type of hardware issue which should be covered by a warranty extension plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll gladly want to help to get my Surface to Microsoft to learn from this issue in which I'm not the only one affected.</p>
<p>All I ask in return is a device which works like it should.</p>
<p />

            my surface pro 3 has exactly the same symptoms as described. I have been a keen surface pro 3 user and supporter and I have trusted microsoft in ironing out such issues in the past.&nbsp; I love the device a lot. However, I am rather disillusioned this time
 as the type cover and power draining issues have been around for a few months and not properly addressed. I also hold my plan in purchasing the new surface pro, as there is no guarantee that such issue will not recur on newer device.

<p>Same problem since a bit less than two months. Sometimes the type cover will power on again, but battery will then drain fast and two days later... type cover dead again.</p>
<p>Of course this has happenned just after warranty period so sending it to support is a pay for option and I don't like it because this is completely anormal failure spread upon a vast part of surface owners. There were rumors of a fix, but nothing proposed
 so far, so I fear either it is a hardware issue or Microsoft doesn't care. This was supposed to be a 'pro' product with some premium hardware and software (at least I did pay a premium on the price compared to a standard laptop), it is obviously not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering Microsoft does not seem to read that much what is said here, I hope someone will launch a class action (unfortunately I can't as I don't live in the US). They just deserve it.</p>
<p>Now on my side, lesson learned, no hardware from Microsoft anymore and considering shutting down office 360 also. Bye bye Microsoft.</p>

<p>I've the exactly same Problem.</p>
<p>Your 'workaround' for the keyboard also worked for me, but with the same restriction.</p>
<p>I don't use my Surface Pro 3 often, but i've had the Problem fo about two months. 2% battery drain per hour, even when complete turned off and the cover does not work anymore. For me it sounds like an software/firmware problem, a very poor one.</p>
<p>Microsoft should fix it quickly. I'm very disappointed; this should not happen for a premium Product.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I'm struggling with the exact same problem since months now. At first the TypeCover could be revived by letting the battery drain (as described by Br0mZ), but since a few days even this trick isn't working any more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Sven,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The challenge that you are experiencing with your Type Cover might be software-related. This means that a setting may not be set up appropriately, or that a specific driver is not installed correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you follow the method below for troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Reboot your Surface</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be corruption issues on your operating system that result in your keyboard issue. So you need to reboot your Surface to clear these issues. To do so:<br />
<br />
1. Disconnect your Keyboard<br />
2. Reboot your Surface<br />
3. Reconnect your Keyboard.<br />
<br />
If this method works for you, you will be able to use your keyboard now.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Perform a two button shutdown.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be corruption issues on your hardware of your tablet that lead to your keyboard issue, and a simple restart is not enough to get rid of them. You need to perform a two button shutdown or force a shutdown to turn off your tablet completely. To do
 so:<br />
<br />
1. Press and hold the power button on the edge of your device for around 30 seconds and then release it.<br />
2. Press and hold the power button and the volume-up (+) button on the edge of your Surface at the same time for about 15 seconds and then release them. (Do NOT let go the buttons when the Surface logo pops up on the screen.)<br />
3. Wait for about 10 seconds.<br />
4. Power on your Surface. If this methods solves your problem, your keyboard will be recovered.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Update or reinstall your driver</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The keyboard of your Surface may fail to work if you are using the wrong keyboard driver or it is out of date. So you should update or reinstall your driver to see if it fixes the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Get back to us with the outcome so we can help you out further.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Regards.</span></p>

<p>You may want to try your keyboard on another Surface. If you have a friend that has a Surface, see if he/she will allow you to swap keyboards for a while. If the problem moves with the keyboard, it’s probably the keyboard that’s at fault.</p>

    <title>Windows Update error 800F0816 ---- in a loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sharzah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows  Update error 800F0816 ---- in a loop</h2>
                    <p>So, after this past Tuesday's automated updates, my computer (Toshiba laptop running Windows 7) failed to start... it would get most of the way thru, applying the post-boot updates, and then reboot thru blue screen of death (which, if I didn't do anything,
 would try to start Windows normally and the cycle would repeat).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; I can start Windows in safe mode with networking (or without).&nbsp; I can then System Restore to before the update was applied and it works fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; So I tried doing the updates 1 at a time.&nbsp; There were 3 updates.&nbsp; The Malicious Software Removal Tool said it was successful, so I skipped it.&nbsp; The other Important one was the 2017-07 Security Monthly one, so I tried it first.&nbsp; Initial install was OK,
 and it said I needed to reboot for changes to take effect.&nbsp; I did so, and the problem came back.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; So, next thing I know to do is check the error code, shown in snip below...&nbsp;&nbsp; The only info I seem to be able to get on this code just tells me to do the same things I've already been doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd really appreciate some useful advice...</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;after this past Tuesday's automated updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here, too. Of 10 almost identical systems in the office, 6 of them are now in continuous reboot mode immediately following the July 2017 Windows updates.</p>
<p>All systems are Dell Optiplex 780 SFF, running Windows 7 Professional 64 bit edition.</p>
<p>All have same software installed; nothing odd or "fancy"...no games. These machines are for simple office use; documentation keeping and email once in a while (but no local email client installed; all access via webmail). All use Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried using System Repair disc; no luck.</p>
<p>Have tried booting into safe mode; no luck (the machines reboot before safe mode loads).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This began IMMEDIATELY after the Windows automatic update for July completed. Of the 2 I saw finish their updates, no errors were shown; said "Updates successful".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a puzzle why some&nbsp;of the systems here suffer this problem while the others restarted normally without any issues after the updates. As mentioned, all systems are virtually identical; same hardware, same software installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance with this problem GREATLY appreciated, as nothing tried [yet] has helped.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Still having this problem.&nbsp; I tend to shutdown my computer every night, and every night it installs the same updates, even tho<strong> I have it set to only install updates that I request</strong>, and (I believe) I have dis-requested the problem one.&nbsp; Then
 the next morning when I start it up, it does the same thing again.&nbsp; So every morning I have to do a System Restore again if I want to use the computer.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 System Won&#39;t Boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b_phillips  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 System Won&#39;t Boot</h2>
                    <p>I have a dual-boot Windows 10 system. Each Windows 10 system is on a separate drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary partition (the first one installed and the one on the drive with the system reserved partition) became unstable and and wouldn't boot. I believe that the master boot record was also damaged because booting the secondary partition became unreliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after several tries the secondary Windows 10 partition booted and went through a system repair and update process that took several hours and rebooted a number of times. Once this process was complete, a recovery partition had been added to the
 disk containing the secondary partition and the secondary became the primary partition. Now it's the secondary (used to be the primary) Windows 10 partition that won't boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to restore Windows on the currently secondary partition? Before it quit working all together I'd tried creating recovery media on a USB drive but I haven't been able to figure a way to use it. I also haven't been able to find any instructions
 on how to use it. &nbsp;Is there some way I might be able to use that to restore the partition? If not, can I create and use install media for the repair?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, how can I go about restoring the the repaired system as the primary system and reactivating the system reserved partition on that disk? Then can I get rid of the Recovery Partition on the other system drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Bill</p>

            <p>I have seen other posts with other people having the exact same problem with Windows 10 seeing their HDD as a Solid State Drive...when it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not an issue with bad sectors on the HDD, it is obviously a Windows 10 issue, since defrag worked&nbsp;flawlessly with Windows 7 on the same computer and chkdsk finds no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft Support aware of this issue preventing Optimize Drive to NOT work?</p>

<br />
<br />Try resetting the OneDrive sync app on each computer and make sure that you are sign into the same account in each app. 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key + R on your keyboard. 
<br />
<br />Then copy and paste this text into the Run window that appears and press Enter:
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />
<br />That will reset OneDrive
<br />After a couple of minutes, the OneDrive cloud icon should show in the system tray.
<br />
<br />If it doesn’t start, open Start, find OneDrive and start it
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<h2>            Rear Speaker is not working in 5.1 or quadraphonic configuration. VIA HD audio driver</h2>
                    <p>I have asus P8H61-M LX3 motherboard with VIA audio driver. It was fine on windows 7, could access all the functions through VIA HD deck. But after the windows10 update,W10 automatically updated the driver to "VIA HD audio(Win10)" and sound is still works
 well. But I found that in 5.1 and quadraphonic configuration, there is no sound through rear speakers (those&nbsp;which connected to the BLUE line in port of CPU) .And also the HD audioDeck interface also became unable to open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to fix it? can I enable dolby digital in this driver?</p>

    <title>Cascade Windows doesnt allow me anymore to direct access my Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelgaliatsos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cascade Windows doesnt allow me anymore to direct access my Desktop &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I used the Cascade Windows option and even after i chose the UNDO Cascade Windows option all windows i open from now and on seem to always be on top in terms to my desktop.<br />
<br />
Before if i had a word or a notepad file open for example and i clicked on my desktop then i would go directly to my desktop. Now after using the Cascade Windows option and even after undoing it if i click on my desktop when i am using any program then the
 program stays on top and i have to either close it or minimize it to be able to access my desktop or to press the show desktop option and thats frustrating.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help in advance.

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael, once you cascade windows and if you click on an empty space on your desktop, the cascade windows will still remain on the desktop. If you want those cascade windows to be minimized, then you either need to minimize them manually or click on the
<strong>Show Desktop</strong> icon beside to the <strong>Action Center</strong> icon or
<strong>Right Click</strong> on the <strong>Taskbar</strong> and click on <strong>
Show Desktop</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 shortcuts of minimizing the current window.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Alt</strong> + <strong>Space</strong> + <strong>N</strong> keys from your keyboard to minimize the current window.</li><li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> key and the <strong>Down Arrow</strong> key 2 times to minimize the current window.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you want that window to be on your desktop again, then you can toggle the windows by press the
<strong>Alt</strong> key and the <strong>Tab</strong> key from your keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to minimize all the current windows on your computer, then you can press the
<strong>Windows</strong> key and the <strong>M</strong> key from your keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can post your feedback about the option by posting it in <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p>I did cascade windows but right after i did it i chose to UNDO this action.<br />
<br />
I am aware of all the manual actions and shortcuts you mentioned to me but they are not convenient to me.<br />
<br />
So far when i had open windows all i needed to do to go to my desktop was just to click on it and this is what i want to do again and i dont understand why its not possible anymore.<br />
</p>
<p>Now when i click on my desktop the other windows always remain on top and i dont understand why.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael, if you want to minimize the current open windows from your desktop, then you need to do it manually, There is no option that you can click anywhere on the desktop and all the windows from your desktop will be minimized. You can use the shortcuts
 that I have mentioned in my previous post to minimize a single window and all the windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Else, you can click on <strong>Show the Desktop</strong> option by right-clicking on the taskbar to minimize all the current open windows and you can access your desktop..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can create a Show Desktop shortcut and place it on your taskbar, so that you can just click on that shortcut and all your windows will be minimized. Follow the below steps to do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Right-click</strong> on an empty space on the desktop &gt;
<strong>New</strong> &gt; Shortcut.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Then, type the following command and click on <strong>
Next</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>%windir%\explorer.exe shell:::{3080F90D-D7AD-11D9-BD98-0000947B0257}</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Then, type any name for that shortcut and click on <strong>
Finish</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once you have successfully created the shortcut, <strong>
drag and drop</strong> that shortcut to your taskbar.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Then, open some multiple windows and just click on that shortcut from the taskbar and all your windows will be minimized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As clicking on the desktop and minimizing all the windows feature is not available in Windows 10, I suggest you to post

<p>I am sorry but you are mistaken. Clicking on the desktop and minimizing all the windows feature IS AVAILABLE in Windows 10 and i am doing it right now on my second desktop and also on my brothers laptop. I was doing it all the time also on my first desktop
 (using windows 10 home edition) until i chose to cascade windows and then after that everything got stuck.<br />
</p>
<p>I am for example opening now on my brothers laptop a notepad file, a word file and the control panel of the computer and when i am clicking on my desktop they all get minimized and i am able to work directly on my desktop.<br />
<br />
I am afraid there is a bug when you choose to cascade windows because then this option gets stuck, even when you choose afterwards to UNDO THE CASCADE. I hope somebody will be able to fix this soon because its really frustrating.<br />

                    <p>Hello!&nbsp; I have a fresh Windows 7 machine with SP1 (100% confirmed) and .NET Framework 4.6.2 installed but when I install Visual Studio 2017, it trips over itself with lots of error boxes.&nbsp; The first error box that pops up says "The 'ExtensionManagerPackage'
 package did not load correctly. / The problem may have been caused by a configuration change or by the installation of another extension.&nbsp; You can get more information by examining the file ....&nbsp; Restarting Visual Studio could help resolve the issue."&nbsp; I've
 reinstalled and restarted VIsual Studio 2017 several times but this issue will not go away.&nbsp; By the way, Visual Studio 2017 installs fine on my Windows 10 laptop.&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas how to resolve this issue so I can run Visual Studio 2017 on my desktop
 PC?</p>
