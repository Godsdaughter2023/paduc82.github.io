                    <p>I am using Microsoft Windows 10 on my PC and am attempting to make DVDs from home movies that I have shot.&nbsp; On completion of editing a movie and saving the movie in a selected format I can find no option to publish this movie on my PC's DVD burner.&nbsp; here
 seems to be no option to add my DVD burner to the electable burning options.&nbsp; How can I burn my home movies to DVD?</p>

<p>There was a program that was part of Windows 7 called Windows DVD Maker that would allow you to author a video DVD. If Movie Maker was running on Windows 7 it would detect the presence of that program and then offer the "Burn to DVD" option in the
 menus. It would then pass the project file off to Windows DVD Maker to author the video DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, that program has not been included in later versions of Windows so if you have Windows 8, 8.1 or 10, you'll have to find other options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice: The video DVD standard was created in the late 1990s before the era of HDTVs so it has a maximum resolution of 480p. It's really considered a "legacy" format and neither Microsoft nor Apple has direct support of authoring the video DVD format
 anymore. For example, Apple dropped iDVD from its iLife suite back in 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can find 3rd-party software for burning a video DVD. You'll first have to save your project as a movie (<span>File &gt; Save movie</span>) and then use the software to down-rez the video to 480p and the older MPEG-2 format needed on a
 video DVD.</li><li>You can save your movie (<span>File &gt; Save movie</span>) and then just burn the resulting .mp4 direction onto an optical disc (even a DVD as a *data* DVD). That movie is then playable on another PC or in a *Blu-ray* player. As a side benefit,
 the resolution will be HD rather than SD.</li><li>You can always just share the resulting movie on video sharing sites like YouTube, Vimeo, etc. Or you can copy the .mp4 file onto a USB drive and give that to someone that wants to see your movie. Or if you want to keep a library of movies, you
 could put them on a larger capacity external hard drive.</li></ol>

    <title>Unable to initialize Windows Server Backup on Server 2008 R2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vulpesd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to initialize Windows Server Backup on Server 2008 R2</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I've been searching around for a bit now trying to find a resolution to my error, but so far have turned up empty-handed.<br />
<br />
Operating System: Windows Server 2008 R2<br />
<br />
Goal:<br />
To get Windows Server Backup working so I can commence backups of my server.<br />
<br />
Problem 1:<br />
When attempting to start Windows Server Backup through the Server Manager interface, I'm greeted with the following error:<br />
<br />
A fatal error occured during a Windows Server Backup snap-in (wbadmin.msc) operation.<br />
Error Details: Server Execution Failed<br />
<br />
Close wbadmin.msc and then restart it.<br />
<br />
Result 1: Looking into wbadmin gets me to problem #2...<br />
<br />
Problem 2:<br />
Apparently, Block Level Backup Engine Server was not active.&nbsp; When trying to start the Block Level Backup Engine Service, I get this:<br />
<br />
Windows could not start the Block Level Backup Engine Server service on Local Computer.<br />
Error 0x800700b7: cannot create a file where that file already exists.<br />
<br />
Result 2: No idea where to go from here.<br />
<br />
Problem 3:<br />
Opening up the cmd prompt, as an administrator, I type in the following to see what I get: net start wbengine<br />
<br />
And get...<br />
<br />
The Block Level Backup Engine Service service is starting.<br />
The Block Level Backup Engine Service service could not be started.<br />
<br />
A system error has occurred.<br />
<br />
System error 183 has occurred.<br />
<br />
Cannot create a file when that file already exists.<br />
<br />
Result 3: No idea how to get this started.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I'm left thinking the following: Block Level Backup Engine Server needs to be running in order for wbadmin to function correctly.&nbsp; However, considering that I cannot start WBEngine, that is where I currently am.<br />
<br />
If anyone has an idea or could tell me what I need to do to get this functioning, it would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I can give more information if necessary.<br />
<br />
Thank you.

    <title>Windows Update Error 80070005 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gamemaster406  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Error 80070005</h2>
                    I have Windows Vista Home Premium SP2.<br />
<br />
I tried to install the update "Update Rollup for ActiveX KillBits" which is KB969898, and got the Windows Update Error code 80070005, I looked it up on some other websites and they say you need administrative permissions.&nbsp; I use an Administrator account with
 full permissions, so what can I do to get this update installed?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mike

            Hi gamemaster<br />
<br />
Please go to the location c:\windows, rename the software distrubtion folder to softwaredistrubution.old, before doing this stop the services windowsupdate, bits and cryptographic from your services menu, to access services menu, click on start(or windows logo)
 type in services.msc.<br />
<br />
You can also try these steps if the above doesn't work:<br />
<br />
<p>Log on with the administrator credentials</p>
<p>Open elevated command prompt window in case you are using Vista(i.e right click on the cmd and run the application as an administrator.</p>
<p>Run the below commands:</p>
<p>reg delete HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate /f<br />
wmic /namespace:\\root\ccm\SoftwareUpdates\Wuahandler path CCM_UpdateSource delete---failed<br />
wmic /namespace:\\root\ccm\ScanAgent path CCM_ScanToolHistory delete--failed<br />
net stop wuauserv<br />
net start wuauserv</p>
<p>Reboot the machine and then check for the updates,you should be able to install them successfully</p>

<p>Hi, thx for your reply, I tried the troubleshooter, well maybe it feels not so lag as before. but I think it would be btr if it is a simpler and instant viewer. and the link u gave me is the photo app which I dont really like it.<br />
<br />
another thing is the mail app, it is a long story:</p>
<p>1. i tried to register a mailbox in it</p>
<p>2. i keyed in a wrong pin for the mailbox</p>
<p>3. i realized and tried to reset the pin but it failed</p>
<p>4. i've tried every possible solution i can found on web<br />
5. i've contact online service and they ya i mean they remote controlled my computer using some special program they asked me to download, they tried everything too.</p>
<p>6. they even reinstalled all the windows app and restarted my computer which really took a long time and nth is going btr.</p>
<p>7. still, the mail app forever recorded the first pin i keyed in wrong as the pin of the mail box</p>

                    The mixer slider instantly resets to zero when released. I have reloaded the drivers for my sound card and even tried a secondary usb sound card. Same result. I am running Windows 7 64 bit on an Asus with a Realtek sound board and drivers.

            I tried all of that BEFORE I posted here.<br />
<br />
And the above had no advice for the specific problem which was that the slider even when place at max would simply slide back down to 0. Repeatedly.<br />
<br />
I used the Fix Bot&nbsp; no joy.<br />
<br />
I reverted to an earlier sound driver. No joy.<br />
<br />
I reverted to an earlier version of Flash. This proved to be a temporary fix that worked while I was in the browser but the problem returned as soon as Imoved to a game or a music program.<br />
<br />
I ran 4 different&nbsp; registry repair programs. The last one found 2 damaged Active-X keys. This seems to have repaired the problem. We shall see if it returns.<br />
<br />
And since I still have no idea what caused the damage in the first place.&nbsp; I worry it is just going to come again.<br />

    <title>What happens with the windows 7 key after upgrade to win8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gmariust  say:</h3>
<h2>            What happens with the windows 7 key after upgrade to win8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I would like to know what happens with the instance of win7 home premium retail,&nbsp;after upgrading to win 8 pro? In case I decide that I do not like win 8 and want to&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;back win7,&nbsp;I can still use the same win7 home premium key to activate it? Or is
 it overridden by the win 8 upgrade key&nbsp;and it is not valid anymore? As win 8&nbsp;is an upgrade,&nbsp;it seems to be a bit tricky in the case you want to do a clean install. I was under the impression that with the new win8 you will have the same advantages like with
 the win7 retail. You can just clean re-install the system if you want or perform an upgrade of components and activate for the new PC. Now I read many contradictory information, some say that you can upgrade just 5 times, some say that you can only re-install
 your system if you&nbsp; install previously the win7 and afterwards&nbsp;on top of that you re-do the&nbsp;upgrade to win8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone can clarify this for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you upgrade your Win7 to WIN8 upgrade, the license for 8 is tied to the win7, which you cannot move or use ---while this win8 upgrade is on your system.</p>
<p>You do have the right to revert back to your Windows 7 on this pc, but you would have to wipe/delete the windows partition before doing a clean install of your Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, do not get things over-confused.&nbsp; For the Win8 upgrade offer, -you- are limited to the purchase of up to 5 licenses, if you had more than 1 pc to upgrade, say at your house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, do not get things over-confused.&nbsp; But yes you can do a clean install of the Windows 8 upgrade.&nbsp; See Paul Thurrott's Clean Install Windows 8 with Upgrade Media<br />
<a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows8/clean-install-windows-8-upgrade-media-144648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows8/clean-install-windows-8-upgrade-media-144648</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, do not get over-confused:&nbsp; If Windows 7 was pre-loaded when you bought the system, then Windows 7 can only be used on that specific machine&nbsp; {in case you revert back to Windows 7).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see what your license rights are, start WINVER.exe and click on the link to Microsoft License Terms.</p>

            <p>From the Windows 8 license agreement:</p>
<p><b>What about upgrading the software? </b>The software covered by this agreement is an upgrade to your existing operating system software, so the
<u>upgrade replaces the original software that you are upgrading</u>. You do not retain any rights to the original software after you have upgraded and you may not continue to use it or transfer it in any way. This agreement governs your rights to use the upgrade
 software and replaces the agreement for the software from which you upgraded.<i>
</i>After you complete your upgrade, additional software will be required to playback or record certain types of media, including DVDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.
</li><li>Check the manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows Vista it will likely work with Windows 8 since
 they share the same driver model. </li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Thankfully, all editions of Windows 7 includes system imaging, which means you can backup your
 entire Windows 7 installation and restore it if it fails. Learn more about how to backup your Window 7 installation

<p>If you want to backup themes, wallpapers and other minor features, Windows Easy Transfer is another option, you can learn more about it
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade. </li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed. </li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.
</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications). </li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing. </li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.
</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Type: MSCONFIG. </li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard </li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup. </li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. </li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
</li><li>Click OK. </li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart. </li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>

            <p>Hi, and thank you for the quick answer. This service agreement may&nbsp;raise some&nbsp;interesting&nbsp; situations:
</p>
<p>What happens in the case I want to do a hardware complete&nbsp;upgrade of the current win8pro (I mean a new mainboard, cpu, memory, videocard, ssd) . I will be able to activate it again online or over the phone?
</p>
<p>As per the license agreement it is not very clear:</p>
<p>&nbsp;"<em>is an upgrade to your existing operating system software, so the <u>upgrade replaces the original software that you are upgrading</u>. You do not retain any rights to the original software after you have upgraded and you may not continue to use it
 or transfer it in any way. This agreement governs your rights to use the upgrade software and replaces the agreement for the software from which you upgraded.</em>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>according to this the win7 license and all the rights which you previously had for win7 software are&nbsp;gone, being replaced by the win8 license and agreement</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"Under our license, we grant you the right to install and run that one copy on one computer (the licensed computer), for use by one person at a time, but only if you comply with all the terms of this agreement. Typically, this means you can install one
 copy of the software on a personal computer and then you can use the software on that computer."</em></p>
<p>according to this, it is linked to current hardware&nbsp;only</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><b>"Can I transfer the software to another computer or user? </b>You may transfer the software to another computer that belongs
<u>to you</u>. You may also transfer the software (together with the license) to a computer owned by
<u>someone else</u> if a) you are the first licensed user of the software and b) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. To make that transfer, you must transfer the original media, the certificate of authenticity, the product key and the proof
 of purchase directly to that other person, without retaining any copies of the software. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software.
<u>Anytime you transfer the software to a new computer, you must remove the software from the prior computer</u>. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between computers. You may transfer Get Genuine Windows software, Pro Pack or Media Center
 Pack software only together with the licensed computer."</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to this I may also transfer (transfer to another computer = hardware&nbsp;upgrade)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is&nbsp;like Maurice said :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"If you upgrade your Win7 to WIN8 upgrade, the license for 8 is tied to the win7, which you cannot move or use ---while this win8 upgrade is on your system.</em></p>
<p><em>You do have the right to revert back to your Windows 7 on this pc, but you would have to wipe/delete the windows partition before doing a clean install of your Windows 7."</em></p>
<p>then nothing stops me to install my old win7 and activate it on some new hardware. How will Microsoft activation procedure will be able to determine&nbsp;that I do not want to use Win8 anymore and want to go back to win 7. If I have&nbsp;deleted my win8 software from
 my old PC and re-install win7 over my old hardware?</p>
<p>If I install win 7 on new hardware,&nbsp;I&nbsp;will be&nbsp;able to activate win 7 again or the license is locked forever as long as I have upgraded once to Win8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the long post, and thank you for your answers.</p>

<p>If you mean that the color of the desktop has changed, you can change that by right-clicking the desktop&gt; Properties&gt; Desktop tab&gt; Color.</p>
<p>If by sensor, you mean the mouse pointer, change that from Start&gt; Settings&gt; Control Panel&gt; Mouse&gt; Pointers. If that's not what you're referring to, please explain.</p>

            What I do for add-ons supported in Bedrock is transfer worlds via realms. You can use an add-on in a world, upload it to a realm then download the world on xbox. This is currently the only way to do at this time.

<p>Im having this issue as well. It has happened twice so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have multiple things open when this happens but I think it might be my Box app&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.im not sure how to check updates. But it hasn't been long since the last big update&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. No big changes besides the big update. But might be good to note that the first time the stop code happened it was probably the same day or day after the most recent big update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone is having problems uploading the screenshot but here's what the screen said:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stop code: KERNAL SECURITY CHECK FAILURE</p>

</p><p>I hope this is enough information for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for checking in. I tried to follow the instructions in the article and undid some updates that I think might have been the problem (updates for word and excel since the stop codes happened when opening word docs or excel sheets from my Box app). This
 was a couple days ago and so far the stop code hasn't happened again. So it's good for now, but not sure that it's totally fixed. I'll update again if it happens though.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the stop code just happened again. Apparently whatever I did before did not fix the issue. It happened right after I tried saving an excel document. I've been working on the excel doc and saving it multiple times with no problem this morning and then
 took a break. When I came back to it I saved it again to make sure not to lose anything and then the stop code happened. Not really sure what other updates to undo since most of them were security things. Would appreciate any other suggestions to fix the issue
 .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            And I also was waiting for OneNote to open when I went to save the excel doc so maybe that is also something that contributed.&nbsp;

            Hi Julie,<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Blue Screen of death</strong> is caused by an outdated driver, a recently installed application that causes conflict on the system, or due to missing updates.
<strong>Stop errors</strong> (also known as blue screen or black screen errors) can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, to isolate your concern, we suggest that you boot your computer in Safe mode.
<strong>Safe mode</strong> starts Windows in a limited state, where only the bare essentials are started. Check if you will encounter the same issue while in Safe mode. For instructions, you may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>. You can choose whether to boot your computer from Settings or from the sign-in screen.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your response.

    <title>Issue with Skyrim Add Ons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cosmicinbalance  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with Skyrim Add Ons</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm becoming more and more frustrated with my Xbox lately. Today I tried to re-download all of the add ons for Skyrim (Hearthfire, Dragonborn, and Dawnguard) but they aren't showing up on the 'Add Ons' section on the Skyrim start menu. I purchased all
 three around January with a credit card through my Xbox Live account onto my external hard drive. They worked originally, but my Xbox recently deleted everything off its internal memory and left me with nothing. *I copy and pasted my old post detailing what
 happened with that below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The add ons are all on my external hard drive and seem fine. But every time I start Skyrim, the Add Ons section just says 'No Add Ons Downloaded' despite everything I do to fix it. I've tried everything to re-install these add ons to my Skyrim game. I deleted
 them, re-downloaded them, cleared my cache multiple times, took my hard drive out and put it back in, deleted and re-installed my Xbox Live profile, deleted my Marketplace cache, I even updated my licenses even though this was the Xbox (and profile) I bought
 them on. I feel like I've tried everything I've found and now I'm at a loss. Please help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Here is my post about losing everything off my Xbox. I'm not sure if it's related to this problem with the Add Ons:</p>
<p>(So I have a 4GB Xbox 360 and out of nowhere this morning, it seems to have deleted all of my profiles. I went to turn it on and it skipped the sign-in page completely, which was when I realized the 3 profiles and one Xbox Live profile were completely gone.
 It prompted me to update (which I did) but that didn't help. It prompted me to update a second time and that didn't help either. I then tried to re-download my Xbox Live profile onto the Memory Unit and it gave me an error message (80070570). So then I tried
 taking out my external hard drive, which did nothing, but I could re-download my Xbox Live profile onto that hard drive without a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go into storage, my Memory Unit still says I have a significant amount of space used up, but when I click on it, all the categories (Games &amp; Apps, Profiles, etc.) all say 0KB. Clearly my external hard drive seems fine, but my Xbox's Memory Unit seems
 to have completely wiped itself out overnight. I have a lot of saves on those other non-Xbox Live profiles and I really need to know if there's any way of getting that data back without having to lose it all reformatting. I'm having a hard time finding the
 right answer online and I'd appreciate some help!)</p>

            <p>Hey there,&nbsp;CosmicInbalance! Oh, man, am I very sorry to see the situation you're in! You've definitely done a lot of troubleshooting, so I mostly have some clarification questions for you that may help shed some light on what you're running into.</p>
<p>You state that your console initially gave an error code and all of your information was cleared out. I am sorry to see that happened to you! When this happened, did you format your console and was it fine again? Or did you have to send it in for repair and you recently got it back? This will help nail some things down.</p>
<p>Your DLC is on an external hard drive, but is the game there, too? Is it on a different hard drive or the internal memory? If they are on separate storage devices, I suggest making sure they are both on the same device and launching the game after that.</p>
<p>Get back to me with the clarification questions and if the game and DLC are separated. We'll get to the bottom of this so that you can access your DLC! :)</p>

<h2>            Win 10 Files</h2>
                    In win 10, I have a sub-directory titled "winSvS" and it contains a large number of sub-directories, two of which are titled "winamd64* and "WOW64*.*." &nbsp;I don't have any amd products on my computer and I think WOW is a pain in the ****. &nbsp;Are these part

            Don't let the amd in this folder name fool you.&nbsp; The only reason that it is called amd is because AMD beat Intel to 64-bit, and when Microsoft put in 64-bit support they used that name.&nbsp; You should not mess with anything under winSvS.&nbsp; What's more even
 though I agree that WOW is a pain, it is a pain you can't live without.&nbsp; WOW is the system that allows 32-bit programs to run under Windows 64-bit.&nbsp; And there is literally no way you can run Windows without it because core parts of Windows are still 32-bit
 programs.<br />

<h2>            I am unable to download my profile on my Xbox 360. &#40;80154002&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, so I have been playing on Xbox One for a while know and just recently decided to plug in my old Xbox 360 so i could play with some friends, but once i tried downloading my profile I was prompt with a message saying, "&nbsp;<span>Sorry, Xbox Live Profiles
 can't be downloaded right now. Try again Later. 80154002."&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I have tried every possible console troubleshooting&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;by Xbox support agents.</span>
</li><li><span>Tried downloading a different account, which worked!</span> </li><li><span>Tried changing my security info.</span> </li><li><span>Updating Billing Information.</span> </li></ul>
<p><span>This seems to be a glitch in my account itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Also, another thing I noticed is that, my account seems to be so glitched that when you search for my gamertag it states that it doesn't exist. It clearly does exist since I do play on it on my Xbox One and when i log in to xbox.com it shows
 what my gamertag is <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Lcz</span></em> , but if someone else tries searching for me to&nbsp;attempt&nbsp;to&nbsp;send me a friend request it gives them an error as if it doesn't exist.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><br />
</strong>If anyone knows any solution to this problem, please let me know as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>A couple of things can cause this. &nbsp;Firstly I would suggest you clear the system cache as follows:</p>
<p>1. Remove profile - SETTINGS page (far right from home page), select STORAGE, then find your profile and remove.</p>
<p>2. While in you hard drive under GAMES &amp; APPS look for any red or yellow icons with incomplete or unknown. &nbsp;Delete them.</p>
<p>3.Clear System Cache - SETTINGS page, select STORAGE and highlight a drive but don't select it. &nbsp;Press Y and select Clear System Cache. &nbsp;Agree when asked.</p>
<p>4. Be Patient - turn your console off for a full minute. &nbsp;This assists in resetting the console.</p>
<p>5. Turn on the console and download your profile - it is the icon next to 'create a profile'. &nbsp;Try again</p>
<p>The only other thing I can suggest is to move where you are downloading your profile to. &nbsp;My slim has an issue with the memory unit and kept showing the fault until I followed the above then downloaded my profile to the hard drive instead of the memory unit.
 &nbsp;This fixed it.</p>
<p>Good luck &amp; happy gaming</p>

<p>Okay I've already tried that as I said in the post. It has nothing to do with my Xbox.. It's my profile.. I have tried using a different Xbox 360 in a different room and I still get the same results. I am able to download any OTHER account perfectly EXCEPT
 for mine. </p>

<p>How do I do this. I tried adding her individual AD account to each of the 20 subfolders and gave her Read rights but she still has Modify rights to them&nbsp;because she is part of the Accounting Team" AD group.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be possible that the preorder was canceled and the license was revoked. Preorder's do not charge your credit or debit card until about 10 days before release, only account credit gets drained immediately after a pre-order. If the payment method
 could not be charged due to insufficient funds or an authorization failure from the bank, then the license for the game gets taken since the game was not payed for and that can take a few days to allow time for the payment to be made hence why you were able
 to play it for about a week and now it doesn't say you own it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure to check your purchase history to see what the status shows from that transaction:
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders">
<p>
</p><p>You can contact customer support and they can go over your account with you for further clarification on what happened to the preorder and the payment method it was tied to:

Microsoft Account website</a> (under Payment &amp; Billing -&gt; Order history) and find where you pre-ordered it. It's possible that an issue arose with your payment method and the purchase was cancelled, even if it was after the launch date.

            I had already run the update troubleshooter before posting the problem.&nbsp; It found no problems, but told me there was a newer troubleshooter.&nbsp; So I ran that troubleshooter, and it also found no problems.&nbsp; I don't understand why the initial troubleshooter
 link did not take me directly to the latest troubleshooter, but that's another question and irrelevant to my problem!

            <p>Reran the troubleshooter today.&nbsp; Nothing found.&nbsp; Ran it as administrator and got a generic message that it had&nbsp;reset update components (and showed the stopping and restarting of the services, which agrees with the description given of the troubleshooter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarted windows and tried update.&nbsp; Same problem as described in my original post!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a time limit set for how long update will search for updates?&nbsp; Windows 7 had a problem for a while with very long searches for updates, and the update failure comes reliably in about 30 minutes from the start of the search.&nbsp; If there is a time limit
 where is it, and how long should it be increased to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noted that <span>"Security&nbsp;</span><span>and Quality Rollup updates 3210142 and 3205402 have been&nbsp;</span><span>rereleased with a detection change for WSUS customers that&nbsp;</span><span>removes
 a supersedence relationship between these and previously&nbsp;</span><span>released October Security-Only updates 3188736 and 3188730,&nbsp;respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are detection changes only."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>My problem appears to be with detection of needed updates.&nbsp; Does the quote point to the problem I have, and if so what is the solution?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Windows updates and service packs may fail to install if there are corruption errors. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The DISM or<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System
 Update Readiness tool</a><span><span>&nbsp;</span>may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.<span>
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this problem, use the inbox Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. Then, install the Windows update or service pack again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Search</span></strong>. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Search</span></strong>.
 Type<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Command Prompt</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span>in the<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Search</span><span>&nbsp;</span>box, right-click<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Command Prompt</span>, and then click<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Run as administrator</span>. If you
 are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Allow</span></strong>.</li><li>Type the following command, and then press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.<br />
It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></div>
<span>Important</span><span>&nbsp;</span>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair source,
 or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:
<div style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:<var>C:\RepairSource\Windows</var></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>/LimitAccess</strong></div>
<span>Note</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Replace the<span>&nbsp;</span><var>C:\RepairSource\Windows</var><span>&nbsp;</span>placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824869.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair
 a Windows Image</a>.</li><li>Type the following command and press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.<br />
It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<div style="margin-left: 90px"><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></div>
</li><li>Close the command prompt, and then run<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Update</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>again.</li></ol>
<p>

            <p>I ran the DISM or System Update Readiness Tool as described in knowledge base article 947821.&nbsp; Unfortunately I missed that I was supposed to run the System File Checker&nbsp; (sfc).&nbsp; But when I ran WIndows Update from Settings again, I still had my original error!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca and used the link at the top of the page to get the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (downloaded and ran Windows10Update28084.exe) which ran fine (though lengthy).&nbsp; When it finished I could then use Windows
 Update from Settings to get the December updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving to Windows 10 Anniversary Update (which I could do through the link given on the support page) has evaded the original problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The description of the DISM tool says that the log captures any issues found or fixed.&nbsp; Unfortunately is also captures a LOT more.&nbsp; My log was over 40,000 lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I don't know if there was fix or problem hidden in there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another disappointment is that somewhere along the way my update history was lost.&nbsp; I suspect the DISM tool.</p>

<p>Ecco la risposta. Se sono stati vietati in modo permanente, non sarà in grado di ottenere le licenze indietro. Per quanto riguarda PERCHE 'ti sono stati vietati, si dovrà inviare in altri forum, numero 14, che è "Il mio account è stato sospeso" e sarà in
 grado di aiutarti ulteriormente. Ma per una risposta, no, non sarà in grado di ottenere le licenze indietro. Ci dispiace. Fate attenzione!</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Boy, you were extremely busy on 04/05/2012. I'm guessing your permanent ban has something to do with your use of modifications. If you need proof of your own gamer score modding just check how many games you unlocked cheevos for
 on the date listed above. Even if you played for a full 24 hours that day you still couldn't unlock that many. I say good riddence. If you need an official answer, post in the forum below:</span></p>

    <title>Sound disappears after restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound disappears after restart</h2>
                    
<p>This started 2 months ago. Before that I haven't had this issue at all. I have the X-Fi Xtreme Gamer card. It happens that when the windows starts up sometimes I have no sounds. This sometimes occurs after every 2 or 3 startups, but sometimes after 10th
 or so. When I check in the Volume Mixer there is no Speakers, only the SPDIF Out and the Internal AUX Jack appears.</p>
<p>Then I need to reinstall the drivers to get the sound back. And it works ok again until couple of restarts.</p>
<p>I was using the latest official Creative drivers when this started, then I tried the XFI Support Pack by Daniel K, and currently I'm using PAX drivers, but no luck.</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 x64 Ultimate, with the latest updates.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

            Since my last post on July 16 I've been offered beta 64-bit drivers by Creative, which I tried. They worked for about 6 weeks then the problem reappeared. An additional requirement for this particular problem seems to be a several week delay between a
If you just uninstall and reinstall the fix lasts only a few days, if that.<br />
Since the failure of the first set of Beta test drivers I gave up and installed Microsoft's generic 64-bit driver and this works and continues to do so. The only other thing I have to do is to ensure that Windows Update does not install the Creative drivers,
 which it initially tries to do.<br />

<h2>            No sound on HP Pavilion 23 w&#47; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shortly after installing Windows 10, my sound stopped working. &nbsp;Every thread I have read says to remove the sound hardware in Device Manager and reinstall. &nbsp;However, the system doesn't seem to exist any longer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There is no speaker icon in the lower right of my screen</p>
<p>- There is no sound through the speaker jack</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Going into services.msc and tried to restart Windows Audio. &nbsp;I get an error 1068 : service or dependency failed to start</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I went into Regedit and confirmed that %SystemRoot%\System32\AudioEndpointBuilder.dll was properly set</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? &nbsp;The only option I haven't tried is to reinstall Windows 10. &nbsp;But if I do that, then I lose my Microsoft Office install which cost me $150. &nbsp;We don't have the discs any longer as they accidentally got thrown away and I don't want to have
 to repurchase. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />

Since you upgraded to Windows 10 recently, you would need to get the latest driver for your Speakers. You can contact your device's Manufacturer for further assistance on how to get the specific driver for your computer. You can reach them using this
