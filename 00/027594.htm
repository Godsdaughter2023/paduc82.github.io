    <title>Embedding Excel Table in Powerpoint with hyperlinks in the cells - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Embedding Excel Table in Powerpoint with hyperlinks in the cells</h2>
                    <p>Hi. &nbsp;I'm embedding Excel table objects into Powerpoint. &nbsp;They're linked and update automatically when I make changes in Excel. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trouble is that I have hyperlinks in some Excel cells and I want those hyperlinks to be active after the table is embedded in Powerpoint. &nbsp;I can't find a way to make this work. &nbsp;I have to double click the table object to instantiate Excel and then I
 can click the link, but I don't want my audience to do this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to make the Excel hyperlinks work in PPT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>-sharon</p>

            <p>It might help if you paste special from Excel to PPT as HTML (which in my experience always converts your info to a PPT table). &nbsp;I don't know whether this will preserve the hyperlinks or not but it's worth a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drawback: &nbsp;the table will no longer be linked to Excel; &nbsp;changes you make to the info in Excel won't automatically update into the PPT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option that'd preserve the link to XL would be to paste special as Excel workbook object, then draw rectangles over the cells that contain hyperlinks and apply the links to the rectangles; then give the rectangles no fill, no line so that they disappear.</p>

            You could try uninstalling it and the driver files in Device Manager.&nbsp; Then redetect hardware to reinstall it, or choose Update driver.&nbsp; Maybe compare what drivers are being used in each install.&nbsp; Build 10240 is the same base Build as RTM, so there should
 be a way to make the 2 installs match up.

            Thanks for your Help, I tried updating the driver but stated that latest drive already installed. Comparing the two systems I found that on the Technical Preview drive C:/ under Drivers\WIN there was an extra directory AUDIOC. I copied this to the RTM
 system and in that directory was a setup.exe which I ran and low and behold the microphone now works! brilliant!<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t sign in with just my skype name &#40;i pay for skype services under that name&#41; because i have not linked that name to a stupid microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Hello; </p>
<p>i have had a skype account since skype was launched and i never used it with a microsoft account. since microsoft acquired skype, it has been a disaster. In my microsoft computer, i managed to log in under the old microsoft account because that's a given
 option (though not easy to find) . i bought a used mac computer. there is skype already installed. (yes, al prior user's info and settings are gone.) Skype would not connect. (same as on my phone) it tries to force me into creating a stupid skype account under
 my microsoft log in info, which i refuse to do since i have money in my original skype name and all records of prior conversations. how can i do to log in using this apple mac? it offers the option to log in with skype name but it would not really connect.
 it says "skype cannot connect"&nbsp; In order to post in this forum, i had to sign with microsoft account. how can i either merge the two without losing my credit or prior records of communications?</p>
<p>Before skype offered chat and phone service. now it **** sucks! i would not buy any extra services from skype cause chances is there will be problems and you cannot find a real human being to solve them.</p>

<h2>            How to create a bootable USB-stick from the commandline &#40;Powershell script&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>ROFL. Turns out, I can't create a Wiki article. Oh well...Ill put it in this Question or some new Discussion...somewhere...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all! I think, no am sure the question has been answered so I can proceed. But please tell me..is anybody even interested in such an Wiki-article and if so,
<strong>what would you like that script be able to do?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>===========</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently working on a Powershell script to turn an <strong>Install.ESD</strong> file (WU) into an ISO and then
<strong>into a bootable USB stick</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found (and tweaked) a .ps1 script that will decrypt the .ESD into an ISO (without using a 3rd-party tool), but the second part deludes me. I have looked at Diskpart but that seems to be mainly about HD/SDD's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the whole, I like to avoid 3rd-party tools to do this because...</p>
<p>a) Because it's supposed to be a 'one-click' solution.</p>
<p>b) I don't know of any that I can fully ...configure using startup parameters.</p>
<p>c) For the sport of it</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is, of course, my idea to "publish" that script once I have it complete and to my liking. Maybe a Wiki-article?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks already,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Does this error appear when accessing a particular website or does&nbsp;it happen all the time when you try to access Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>- Do you have any toolbars, search installed for Internet Explorer? If so, please uninstall it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check the issue in Safe mode with networking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps from this link to boot into Safe mode with networking <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2809468/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2809468/en-us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue does not persists, then place the computer in Clean boot State to check if there is any service that is causing this problem with Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Once done troubleshooting, place the computer back to normal mode by following the steps mentioned in the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, check the Event Viewer logs for any errors related to Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>- In the Search, type Event Viewer and press enter.</p>
<p>- On the left pane, select Windows logs and then click on Applications.</p>
<p>- In the list, see if you get an error related to Internet Explorer. If yes, please provide us the error details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results after trying Safe mode with networking and clean boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>What do you really want with windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            What do you really want with windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So heres the deal. What are you absolutely looking for from Windows 10? What can you accept and not accept? What is it about windows that you like/dislike and how could it be fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll go first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The data mining has to be limited to unidentifiable info only. Anything thats used to identify me or the usage of my PC i consider a direct invasion into my home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Appearance customization MUST return. Skins/themes/schemes or whatever else you want to call it. Aero simply must return. I would prefer a more controllable version with adjustment settings and the like but windows components such as edge, captions, and
 menu's simply need to be 3D and a lot more colorful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Windows update needs to be revamped. I should be allowed to control what, when , and where. If i dont want a particular update i should never see it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Settings in general need to get way more robust and the simply MUST honor my choices. If i turn off a setting it should stay off throughout all the rest of time. Unless i choose to re-enable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Various functionality needs to be fixed. Pinning items on the start menu for example as well as simple searches through cortana (off or on) needs to just work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things i can live with</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I dont mind some data collecting. As long as it isnt used to target me or my usage im ok with it. It should also use as little bandwidth as possible since im the one paying for it i would like the majority of it to go to me not MSFT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The square corners are fine i used them for years that way in older versions of windows so i can take it or leave it. Borders needs to be fixed. They need to be slightly larger (3-5 px would be great) and they need to handle hit testing properly (currently
 windows still thinks they are 15 px wide even though you cant see it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The inclusion of Metro (or whatever you want to call them) "apps". I dont care if they exist i can choose not to use them. They need to be removable if i choose to do so and not magically reappear. I may use some and not use others. I would uninstall
 people but im likely to keep groove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things id like to keep but improve. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Metro itself needs revamped. Its almost 5 years old now and is still one of the most limited environments to date. Its far to large and clunky and has far too many restriction to be as useful as it could be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Continuum, tablet mode, whatever you call it needs to actually be implemented. It doesnt really exist. Windows 10 looks and operates the exact same way in both modes. When not in tablet mode context menu's need not use the entire vertical real estate
 of my monitor.</p>

</p><p>3. Multiple desktops still needs work. We should be able to name the desktops as well as order them any way we want. We should have a choice of switching animations be it a slide, cover flow, or cube. I should be able to lock a specific desktop with a password
 so it cant be used or viewed while locked. There should be application rules where as launching specific programs (of the users choice) will always launch in a certain desktop. You should be able to customize every aspect of the desktop including, but not
 limited to, icons, wallpaper, taskbar pins, start menu pins, etc... on a per desktop case. You should also be able to directly access a desktop via customizable kbd shortcuts. for example ctrl+win+G may be used for a desktop named Games or even ctrl+win+numpad[1-9].
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Task view could use some features. While in taskview mode you can view the programs of a remote desktop by hovering the desktop (i.e not the current one) you should also be able to hover each running program to get a larger view (think aero peek) for
 things like chat windows and so on. This will allow you to decide if you want to switch or not. There should be a tray icon or something similar that allows you to preview desktops not only in taskview mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Multiple monitors should work more like multiple workstations. When opening a program from start on monitor 3 the launched program should start on that monitor. I should be able to customize pins on the alternate taskbars. Each monitors taskbar should
 also include a system tray. in this case i personally would prefer it to simply clone/mirror the main one but options are always nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not an exhaustive list but i feel if those things, or at least most of them, were addressed to an acceptable degree i could overlook some of the other smaller issues and feel more like using windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While i do love windows 7 and i feel it got most everything right i have wanted to move on for a long time now. i simply cant because windows has decided to stop being great and settled for being mediocre. Follow the leader instead of being the leader.</p>

            <p>Thanks. As i said the list is very incomplete. I think there are some misunderstandings when it comes to what people want. Believe it or not even some of the hard core folks here dont really want windows or msft to fail. we didnt want it with 8 either. How
 that message is portrayed various from user to user and sometimes things can be misread or could have been said better but in the end the msg is the same. We just want a good version of windows we can get behind and be excited about. I used to stay up late
 getting new builds of xp (my first real beta run with windows) even when there was very little changes. I cant even count the number of times i formatted in a week it was insane but i was happier than a pig is schmitt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now its just like meh who cares. Theres been like 3 noticeable changes since january 2015 none of which were actually any good or worth the several hours it took to get it going. I want that excitement back. i want to drool over the rumors of the all new
 Aero thats about to come out. I want to stay up super late foolin with it even though i know i have to work in a few hours and ive been up for 72 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could go on but im more interested in hearing what others want (not as much because i already know most of them) but more over what others are willing to sacrifice in order to get a windows we can love again.</p>

            <p>used to be, in past beta programs (through XP anyway), that new features *were* "drool worthy" and worth playing around with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THEN, someone at microsoft *TOTALLY* dropped the ball, or performed a laughably disgusting act with a 'pooch', and COMPLETELY broke that "wow" factor, starting with Vista, then 8.x, then 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lack of "clue" about what people actually *WANT* is _APPALLING_.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey MS: &nbsp;pay attention to that list, will ya?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, give me the equivalent of *WINDOWS 7*, k-thx. &nbsp;THAT ESPECIALLY includes the actual "start menu", not that "start thing", and 3D decorations on the windows, and 3D 'thicker' borders, and 3D-looking buttons and other controls, not those flat Windows 1.01
 "1985 called and wants their look/feel back" 2D flat disgusting appearance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and don't forget GET RID OF THE SPYWARE AND ADWARE.</p>

            <p>i said the same thing. i didnt add it to my list it is one of the things i could live without. However i dont think you can pin websites to the start menu. i havent been able to do so at least not with edge. Am i missing something?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;In fact that brings me to another thing i want to add to the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pining arbitrary files to start/taskbar. It shouldnt matter if it s an exe or txt file i should be able to pin anything that can be represented on my pc. Anything that a person would need/want to access whether its a file or location. They seem to be doing
 some of it with settings but the idea for settings is that they be collected in a single area you access not pinning 500 of them into a menu etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files and folders are different in that you have short term and long term files. I have some files on my PC that are 15+ years old and just get transferred to a new HDD when the old one dies. Those files/folders i would like to pin.</p>

            <p>i dont use edge. Pinning any file has been available since windows 95. In 95 you could just open the start menu folder (location varied by version) and simply create shortcuts there. Now windows 10 gives an error msg saying it cannot create a shortcut there
 and asks if instead you want it on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet explorer would allow you to simply click in the url bar or tear a tab away and drag it to the start button which would open the start menu. Of course windows 7 had an area for pinning items and just an MRU list controlled by the OS which is also
 broken and fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the help on the edge however since i dont use it it wont do me much good. In fact ive taken to firefox as of late because adblock rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im well aware of the tile section and its 3 functions. I have never been able to arrange anything in an acceptable pattern for me. one such problem is the fact that you cant have both a tile and an MRU entry of the same program. Sadly you cant have jumplists
 on the tiles so while i have a development tile group i have to disclude Visual studio so that i can have it in the MRU in order to use jumplists. Of course if i open too many programs VS could be bumped as it can only display 6 items max so im constantly
 opening and clicking "Dont show in this list" forced to choose lesser programs in order to keep the more common ones i use a lot. Again functionality that windows 7 had (or did better) that was robbed from us in 8+.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another such functionality is hover activation "Activate submenus when i pause on them" feature. most of my common tasks were one mouse click away. simply open the start menu hover over a pinned program to activate jumplist's and select the file (2 clicks
 sorry). It doesnt sound like much (addmittedly its not) however there have been scores of these "little gems" that have been removed. Combined they remove a lot and detract from ease of operation that windows took 20 years to get to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i said in my first list i could continue. I would have to start 3 threads just to fit them all in but im curious if others have issues that i havent seen or maybe theres a solution to some of mine that im missing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still good lookin out on the page pins much obliged.</p>

            <p>*This accidental turned into a long essay haha*<br />
<br />
I suspect most here will have similar lists as we have mentioned them all along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Must have:</p>
<p>First and foremost, I want it to actually work. On hardware that is perfectly capable of running it but may be slightly dated (5 year old i5 in my case). It crashed and burned on the RTM and after builds on my L640 but was stable enough on builds before
 that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Privacy. Data mining be gone. Sending error messages I can live with. Sending email content or cookies... no. (just examples that may not be real)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hands off my third party apps. By this I mean make a real effort not to break programs people choose to use instead of Microsoft apps. Email, browser, antivirus, firewall, media players, chat apps and so on. The way antivirus is blamed for every conflict
 error in Windows10 nowadays actually makes me angry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings, customisation, options. Without wanting to say make it like 7, make it at least similar to 7. In as much as there were options, things could be customised and they did actually save settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Start Menu. Not a Start List with tiles. I would rather create a folder on the desktop and navigate shortcuts in it than use what you call a menu now. Thanks for bringing it back, but change for changes sake doesn't make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty. This falls into customisation and options also. Aero. Or similar. I can temporarily live with a flat ugly interface but I suspect over time it'll cause me to not want to bother using it. Much like the XP box in the corner of the room that never gets
 turned on even tho it still works. I use the GUI. I don't skip over it for a few seconds each boot. I deal with files and folders and drop down menus. What I look at in 10 is plain, boring and spaced out for fat thumbs on a non touch laptop screen. It is ugly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates. Not forced. Able to be deselected long term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet data. Too many background "apps" using data in secret. I don't want to live in flight mode. I don't want to live in mobile data mode. I want to live in business mode and not have it screw up my bandwidth when it feels like it. Gamers for example
 are complaining right now that 10's internet use is screwing up their games with lag.<br />
It is unnecessary and is unacceptable. I feel sorry for the majority of the world's internet users who don't have high quality American internet speed. (800kbms down 128kbps up is my limit here. I could get more but why should I have to just for Windows itself?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are my bottom line. Under that I just won't use it for anything but a toy. For some of those issues I don't actually trust 10 to be reliable for real work. If an OS can't be trusted to be actually reliable for real work then what point does it have
 past facebook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What I can live with but want gone:<br />
Metro in all forms. I still use a Windows98 video editing program, self contained in its own 10mb folder. It looks prettier and works better than the metro calculator that now taked 60-80mb ram.<br />
Metro is a waste of time, money and resources both for the user and the Microsoft teams designing it.</p>
<p>But some like it. Perhaps if it were an option (there's that word again) to have it or not have it during install. It is really only an add-on gimmick anyway like gadgets were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notifications popups.</p>
<p>Onedrive. In any form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet based user account login. I can deal with having to use it but I don't want to have to create a new account for every machine I use, nor do I want them tied to each other in any way. I much prefer a local user but also want the full function that
 requires an online account by 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that brings me to the store. I have used it for one thing. AOE Castle Siege or whatever it was. And I got sick of that many months ago.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the store I want. Can I uninstall it like the gadgets too? Perhaps this is part of the bandwidth hog and online account requirements... sensing a theme here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>DVD player. Let's face it... Media Player sucked at modern video and everyone knows where to find better dvd players. Media Player Classic is my interface of choice for all video (and I create and use lots of various video contents). Media Player original
 is still my default for audio but for just that it's a bloated hog. (Again with the online store junk!)</p>
<p>I haven't even wanted to know what Groove is like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge. I use firefox. Edge might as well be IE to me. I just don't care so long as it stays out of my way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings fat thumb interface. It needs a lot of work. Actually what it really needs is a link to control panel which is what I have on my desktop still. I can navigate the limited function of Settings but if I can find the same thing in control panel I'm
 going there first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The chick that you talk to who gives you search results you don't care about. I don't know if Cortana works in NZ, and I don't care to find out either. Another gadget to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other fat thumb screens. I'm thinking of Wifi networks here but I assume there are many more. I can use them, but I don't like them. Win7 had wifi in a tight quick access list. Win10 has a clunky thing that takes up half my laptop screen to display 2
 networks, and takes 5-10 seconds to fly open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows8's system repair options. Seriously... do they work? All repairs I've tried have failed. Win10 in particular likes to force them on boot and crash in blue screen error messages resulting in going back to my last partition clone.<br />
Sidenote: A Windows "Reboot and clone partition" option would be huge. Think Norton Ghost (before symantic bought it). I still have a 2gb flash drive that thinks it is a 1.44mb floppy disk with this on it, tho I prefer live boot xp for this now.</p>
<p>A clean install is always the cleanest alternative to a clone. You never know what mess a recover leaves behind. Or a system restore (off on all my machines).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Things I'd like to see:<br />
Preboot partion and disk cloning options. If you are going to force average users to do complete OS upgrades unassisted at least give them the option to do a real backup too. Think of all those average users who have wiped their recovery partitions by doing
 a fresh dvd install (instead of upgrade) as the engineers in the main forum were advising early on. The forums throw that problem up daily from users who now have a useless computer.<br />
And of course advanced users would love you for it even more for such a tool.<br />
<br />
Optional Aero. The metro calc uses more resources than the old Aero did. I'd gladly trade. Not that my puny laptop would notice any performance hit from it anyway.<br />
<br />
Optional non-touch mouse GUI. By this I mean the older tighter layout as opposed to the new fat thumb interface (compare settings app to control panel folder). Not everyone uses touch. For my video production I probably never will. It isn't practical.<br />
<br />
To be honest, thinking of what I'd want that isn't there is the hardest part of this list. That is a credit to what has been put into it. This is why Windows7 was so good - it had a lot of what most people wanted. And 10 has kept a bunch of that apart from
 what we constantly list over and over again (see above).</p>

    <title>IE 10 prompting differently with &#39;Open or Save&#39; for .csv file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adaddy3x  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE 10 prompting differently with &#39;Open or Save&#39; for .csv file</h2>
                    I have a form on a webpage (in tab 1) that is getting 2 different results on our systems at work.&nbsp; About the form, it is using:&nbsp; target="_blank"&nbsp; and it is suppose to return a .csv file via the a new tab (tab 2).&nbsp; This works correctly in IE 9 and in our
 Windows 8/IE 10 machines that were upgraded from Windows 7/IE 9.&nbsp; This is the prompt that is returned in the new tab (tab 2) in these machines as expected:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71d11db5-9a05-4e45-a11b-2880bc5cc40b" /><br />
<br />
Now, on the clean install Windows 8/IE 10 machines, this does not happen.&nbsp; The new tab (tab 2) opens and we just end up looking at a blank tab with no prompt.&nbsp; What we discovered is in the original tab (tab 1), we have this message being prompted instead:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8bcec79b-7db6-49ac-be6a-28344d212c76" /><br />
<br />
I assume there is some setting from the Windows 7/IE 9 machines that got carried over during the upgrade to Windows 8/IE 10 that allows things to continue to work the same as before and was hoping someone would know.&nbsp; I know that upgrading rather than clean
 installing seems to be a no-no via all the posts out there on the web, but in our case, the desired (same) result as before is only happening in this case.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help (and please don't post any 'reset all defaults' type of&nbsp; canned replies)...<br />

            Where are you based out or Yaqub?<br />
<br />
It is just that I am disappointed once again with a response that I am reading here.&nbsp; It just seems like another "support level 1 - I have no clue at all about the inner workings of this product I am suppose to be supporting beside some settings or base canned
 responses" kind of answer.&nbsp; It is no wonder microsoft has had such a bad reputation for as long as it has.<br />
<br />
Turns out, the reason why things opened different on the 2 types of machine setups had NOTHING to do with the website and was not a development issue (which is the very reason why I posted it here instead of in the development area... because I am a Software
 Engineer... and I understand the difference).&nbsp; The difference between the machines turned out to be that the Win 7/IE 9 machines also had Excel installed.&nbsp; And because of the intertwining that microsoft does with their products (hopefully will some day end!),
 they understood better how to open the CSV file that was being returned and prompted the user with the more friendly, in the SAME tab, "What do you want to do with...?" pop-up.<br />
<br />
This really is kinda basic stuff... at least I would hope it was something a microsoft support engineer would know about if they were monitoring these posts.&nbsp; Or even maybe a microsoft support engineer should do a little research with the actual programmers
 before the canned "I don't have a clue so I will direct you to another forum" response eh?<br />
<br />
Of course, I am assuming microsoft support engineers get graded on the number of responses they post, not whether their answers are no better than my 12 yr old who knows only Minecraft!<br />

                    Hello&nbsp; <br />
<br />
With the problems&nbsp; lots of people&nbsp; (me included )&nbsp;&nbsp; have with&nbsp; Outlook and its weird disfunctional ways&nbsp;&nbsp; , then&nbsp; microsoft techie types how about this .... make an&nbsp; overlay&nbsp;&nbsp; or skin&nbsp; 0r whatever you want to call it for&nbsp; the disgruntled&nbsp; hotmail&nbsp; fans&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that
 works jsut like hotmail !&nbsp; TAAAA DAAAAAA &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; !!!!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
This would&nbsp; stop&nbsp; people&nbsp; migrating to the other free competition&nbsp; who really really really&nbsp; dont like&nbsp; having hotmail&nbsp; stolen off them&nbsp; by force and turned into an odd frankenstien&nbsp; that doesnt work !&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Dont tell me its not&nbsp; possible&nbsp; as&nbsp; lots of&nbsp; products come&nbsp; with different skins&nbsp; to change the appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Taskbar auto-hide bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christoph142  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar auto-hide bug</h2>
                    <p>As I had reported for Windows 8.1 earlier ( answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-tms/windows-taskbar-auto-hide-bug/56098bae-c708-4e59-bfc4-75ab459eaf3b ), the taskbar vanishes behind all opened windows in some circumstances and isn't accessible
 anymore then.</p>
<p>I was hoping that this issue would finally be gone in Windows 10, but it's not:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32d18d4c-163d-4479-97fa-b516549d447e" /></p>
<p>Can anyone confirm this?</p>
<p>And could someone with some internal connections forward this to devs? It's a major usability issue not being able to access the UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(There's a second UI accessibility issue with detailed repro steps that I mentioned

            <p>Hi Christopher, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>From the issue description, I understand that the Taskbar on the computer is getting overlapped by other programs&nbsp;at times. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. Please provide us with the following information to assist you in a better way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does this issue occur when you are using a particular program?</p>
<p>2. Do you get any error message on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the screenshot attached in your query, I tried to use Google Chrome on my computer and the Task bar was not getting over lapped by that program.
</p>
<p>So please provide us with the required information and we will be glad to assist you further.
</p>
<p />
        </p>

            <p>Hi Karthik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. yes and no. This issue appears pretty often with Chromium (Opera (in my screenshot) and Chrome). This issue depends on various factors and is non-reproducible, though. You can read about it in this Chromium bug report:&nbsp;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=279467</p>
<p>Please see the bug report I linked above, too. Chromium is <strong>not </strong>
the only program causing this. Screenshots in linked bug report show that it also happens with Microsoft Word.<br />
Basically repro steps are: use any application maximized for several hours.</p>
<p>The second UI issue I linked <strong>also </strong>makes the taskbar unusable and provides detailed 100% repro steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. There are <strong>no </strong>errors. This happens randomly at any point of time. After some time taskbar just doesn't show up anymore and one needs to unmaximize the window, click the taskbar and maximize it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Christoph</p>

            <p>I can't believe it, I just found incredibly simple&nbsp;<strong>100% repro steps</strong>, yet nobody was able to grasp this issue before. Do the following:</p>
<p>

<p>Yes this works. On Windows 8.1 I was able to reproduce the error this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Mozilla open with some windows and taskbar was disabled only for the most front window before I did the experiment with Paint. However, I was able to get rid of the error using alt+tab a few times.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Different thing with Chrome was, with Chrome it was impossible to remove the error without restarting the computer. Because of that I am not sure if it is a Chrome-special bug or a wider one. It is fized for my Chrome but I still follow the thread because
 it was fixed multiple times and restarted again.<br />

<p>Yes, it is slightly different from the annoying one in Chromium, because Paint only sends the taskbar behind its own window, while Chrome manages to send it behind
<strong>all </strong>windows. But if Microsoft analyzes this bug thoroughly and determines why the taskbar can end up behind any window at all in the first place instead of just fixing this "Save as..." window (<strong>Please don't! It's one way to reproduce
 this issue, not the only one.</strong>), it can finally be fixed for good :)</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>I never ever had to do this. I always unmaximize all windows, click the taskbar and maximize Chromium again to make it work again.</p>

            <p>Hi Christoph,</p>
<p>Unfortunately I am not able to reproduce the issue even&nbsp;when I am using Paint.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in developmental stage, you can expect more features in the upcoming Builds.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>I recommend you join the Windows Insider Program to get more frequent preview builds and send your feedback straight to the people building Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you’re an Insider, use the Windows Feedback app to tell us which features you love, which features you could do without, or when something could be better.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to this article by “<strong>Nirmal S</strong>” to know more on “<strong>How to share feedback on Windows 10 Technical Preview?</strong>” :

<p>Now I understand.&nbsp; We are only to give feedback on features that exist.&nbsp; We are NOT to give feedback on features we want and need that have been deleted nor on features we would like to see added.&nbsp; That explains why nearly every "moderator" and "support"
 person rejects any comment that is NOT about what features Microsoft, in its divine wisdom, deems that will be and in what form.&nbsp; They insist we must LOVE what we get without question or quibble.&nbsp; This is why we get "help" that is never helpful.&nbsp; It is simply
 words that add up to "use it, love it, and shut up because you are too stupid to know what's good for you!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not an insider blog, it is a Microsoft echo chamber with Microsoft the only voice allowed to speak.&nbsp; We so called insiders are simply to relay the message to outsiders.&nbsp; Wonderful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now repeat after me:&nbsp; We love Big Brother.&nbsp; He is the giver of all good. In his loving arms we will prosper and thrive no matter how impoverished our OS becomes.</p>

            <p>Hi Christoph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have mentioned&nbsp;in my previous responses we are not able to reproduce this issue in our computer.
</p>
<p>In your Windows 8.1 computer, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
I suggest you to place the computer in clean boot and check for any software conflicts. You can perform the following troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Try in Clean Boot and check if you still face the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<strong><span>Perform a Clean Boot</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Follow the instructions (Step 1 for Windows 8) given in this link to perform a clean boot:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note: After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow these steps to return the computer to Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click ok.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Linley,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We mean all current(old forum)&nbsp;subscribed alerts will be gone after the transition. And that would be a problem to find them back and keep track of those</p>

<p><span>I Have a couple of things in the new forum I would like to see.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When typing a post a HTTP:// address is not automatically recognized as a link. I have to use the link manager to again paste this link in the hyper link field.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It should automatically recognize it is a link.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Book marks are great to have some previous answer handy. However if you want to reply to a question using a bookmark link that links back to this previous answer I can’t do
 it easy.. I have to go to my bookmarks first<span>&nbsp; </span>highlight the post link. Go back to the original post and insert this link in the post. But I have to use the link manager again to make sure the hyperlink works.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If I click on Filter by “unread” it does filter but it is not really clear this is a button on and button off function (maybe have buttons and more color differential) Just Like
 when you mark a question as answered…I like the green (<a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/comsandbox/thread/d9d03306-4f65-40c0-844d-2f32ed491f2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/comsandbox/thread/d9d03306-4f65-40c0-844d-2f32ed491f2b</a>
 )</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the quick view using the little drop down box in the main forum list, I have to use view complete thread first before I can Mark as answer</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will send this as well in an e-mail</p>

<h2>            &#34;Focus&#34; view mode does not allow me to change background</h2>
                    <p>According to this support document:&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Bring-focus-to-the-content-in-your-document-51af2fb2-194f-424b-ab7e-b65de9ec9292, it is possible, when in "Focus" mode (a full-screen window with a background "behind" the document,
 which is currently black), to change the background color by clicking on the Background button in the View ribbon. I don't have a "Background" button at all, and I can't seem to customize this feature in any way.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>how do I print an envelope from Outlook&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jordanfiddle  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do I print an envelope from Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have thousands of contacts in my Outlook.&nbsp; &nbsp;I only want to print envelopes for either one contact, or perhaps 22.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Canon Printer, and am hoping I can do this within Outlook and that I don't need to export to WORD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I print only one do I need to do a mail merge, hopefully not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would seem to be simple to create a contact envelope for only one, no?</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Jordan,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s true that you need to do a mail merge to print an envelope from your Outlook contacts. I know this is tedious since you mentioned that you want to print only one contact envelope
 on your Outlook. However, that’s the only way to do it in Outlook app. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Therefore, this can be a great idea for our product innovation. We’d like to hear feedback from you. To share your thoughts, go to the
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/284136-outlook-com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook UserVoice forum</a> and pick the Outlook that matches your concern. You can submit or vote on the ideas or issues that you’d like to see addressed, and we’ll respond directly to the top
 comments and suggestions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3> benastoria  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Mac - Saving Emails</h2>
                    <p>I have two questions about Outlook for Map.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; How do I save emails other than in a .pst file?&nbsp; For example, I have several thousand Gmails in Outlook that I would like to save on my computer.&nbsp; I don't seem able to drag and drop several thousand emails into a folder at one time.&nbsp; Is there a way to
 do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Is there a way to stop Outlook from deleting emails that I've deleted from Gmail?&nbsp; What I mean is, if I delete emails through Gmail on the webpage, they will then get moved to the trash in Outlook automatically.&nbsp; Is there a way in Outlook for Mac to
 have the program save emails -- and not automatically delete them -- even if I delete them and get rid of them on Gmail itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>You can export to a .olm, but it's an archiving format that's not very convenient if you ever want to go back to your emails.</p>
<p>You can also drag and drop the messages to a folder on the desktop. That will create a .elm copy of each messages.</p>
<p>Personally, for archiving, I use a third party app (in my case EagleFiler, but there are many others), that allows me to export all emails in an app where I can read them, search them, etc.</p>

<h2>            Outllook.com Contact List Disappears</h2>
                    <p>I've submitted this topic twice with no response.&nbsp; Where is my contact list in Outlook.com?&nbsp; For the past 2 days I've switched to the "People" option and it displays a blank page.&nbsp; Also my contacts are not coming up automatically when I send emails.&nbsp; With
 Hotmail when I sent and email I only had to type the first few letters of the address/name and the contact choices would appear for me to choose from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been trying to give&nbsp; Outlook a chance since March but it appears to be getting worse.&nbsp; There is no "live" support that you can talk with that can answer my questions and your video does not explain much.&nbsp; If this keeps up I'll probably have to switch
 to another email provider.</p>

 entered correctly, and have double-checked it numerous times since last night.</p>
<p>Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Everything else on the phone, including the Gmail and Facebook syncs, are working fine.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Xanders84, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When you manually&nbsp;set up an email account on your windows phone the option "Use the same username and password for sending email" is selected by default, however, you should be able to uncheck this option from the advanced settings.
</span></p>
<p><span>If your account settings are recognised automatically when you first set up your account try going to Settings &gt; email + account &gt; Add an account &gt; Advanced setup, enter any nonexistent email address and password, then in the next step you'll be prompt
 to choose the account type, select Internet email, scroll down and select advanced settings to uncheck the box i mentioned before "Use the same username and password for scenting email".
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sergio P.</span></p>

    <title>How do you submit an artist image to Groove Music &#40;as a band - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexandrejulien  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you submit an artist image to Groove Music &#40;as a band member&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My music is now on Groove Music through an aggregator. How do I go about getting an artist image added for my band?&nbsp;I see tons of bands in my collection that have official band images at the top of the player but my newly added band has that grey icon. I'm
 talking about the actual band picture, NOT album artworks. How does one submit an official band image to Groove Music for their own band? Is there some sort of Artist Center offered by Microsoft where bands can customize their own pages? I've looked everywhere
 online and I can't seem to find any info on how to accomplish that.</p>

            I wish I had a solid answer to this, but I think you might want to try going through Gracenote and/or CDBaby to get the images associated to the artist.&nbsp;

                    <p>Since I upgraded to Windows 10, I cannot open any MS Office attachments that I send or receive in Outlook.&nbsp; I can't even save them to my desktop and open them.&nbsp; However, I CAN open any MS office files that were already saved on my computer or that I created
 on my computer.&nbsp; The only problem is with anything I send or receive via Outlook.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any attachments sent or received before upgrading to 10 work just fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; AND PDFs and pictures work just fine as well.&nbsp; It's just MS Office - Word, Excel, PowerPoint - attachments that tell me they are corrupt.&nbsp;

 to another WIndows&nbsp;7 Outlook user, who can open the attachment just fine.&nbsp; He saves it to a common directory and I can open it.&nbsp; He emails it to me and I get the same error.&nbsp; There is a windows 10/Outlook attachment bug.

            <p>I first upgraded to 10 last week and had these problems.&nbsp; I eventually reverted back to 7.&nbsp; Over the weekend, I upgraded again to 10, assuming there was a fix and I had time to make it happen.&nbsp; No go.&nbsp; I tried the fix recommended here.&nbsp; I spent lots of time
 with my friend Google...to no avail.&nbsp; Yesterday morning I reverted back to 7 for the second time.&nbsp; I guess I'm stuck with 7 until I hear of a rock solid fix to this issue.&nbsp; Very frustrating that it only seems to impact Outlook attachments that are MS Office
 files.&nbsp; PDFs and pictures are not impacted.&nbsp; Only MS Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.&nbsp; I have MS Office 2013 and after upgrading to 10, Office said I was all set.&nbsp; Again, seems very strange.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi there</p>
<p>This same problem is cropping up all over the place.</p>
<p>There is a fix, but it doesnt let you preview, that appears to be a bug.</p>
<p>Go into the Microsoft applications you want to view as attachements (word, excel, Powerpoint - all work the same)</p>
<p>file&gt;options&gt;trust centre&gt;trust centre settings&gt;protected view:&nbsp;<span>only tick</span>&nbsp;"enable Protected view for files located in potentially unsafe locations"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This allows you to download files from Outlook, Skype etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to repeat for all the Microsoft applications. Only changing one doesn't affect the others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

            If you've only played it for 10 mins then you haven't seen the vast majority of the game. It becomes very, very challenging when you get onto the later levels - following the correct paths, hexagonal levels, time limits etc, etc.

<h2>            Can&#39;t Link Multiple Excel Charts to a Powerpoint any more&#33; -Now Can Only Link 1 Chart per Excel File- Per Microsoft - Office 365 Pro Plus Ver 1701</h2>
                    <p>For several years, I have had a Powerpoint File that has several graphs that are linked to data and graphs in an Excel file. &nbsp;Formerly, I could update the Excel File, which updates the graphs, and all graphs update when I open the Powerpoint file.<br />
</p>
<p>Before 2016, I could "COPY" a graph, then "Paste Special" using "Keep Source Formatting and Link Data option. &nbsp;Graphs would update as data was changed in Excel or at least when the PPT file was opened. &nbsp;When a "Right-Click" was done on the graph in PPT,
 there was an "Update Link" option. &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Sometime during 2016, existing graphs update in PPT, but new graphs do not. &nbsp;The "COPY", "Paste Special", "Keep Source Formatting and Link Data" option still appears normal, but now, the "Update Link" command is not active in Powerpoint, and the only way
 to update more than ONE graph in PPT is to go to Excel, and copy and paste each graph in place of the old one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft customer service told me on 6-23-2017 that now only one graph from an Excel file can be linked at a time, and if I have 10 charts, that I need to have auto updated, that I should use 10 Excel files.....WOW let's go backwards about ten years!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft told me that the graph that I want to link to should be the active page when the Excel file is opened. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All instructions that I have seen on youtube etc. say to do it just like I have been.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Ideas? &nbsp;Microsoft...any updates on this? &nbsp;why it was done? &nbsp;Is it a bug or a feature?</p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this test on 17.1(Build 7766.2092) (the latest version for Deferred Channel) which means we probable use the save version of Office applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a989269-7e66-4c15-861f-b153e990f021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a989269-7e66-4c15-861f-b153e990f021" /></a></p>
<p>I saw your video just now, the steps are different from my post mentioned above. Would you mind follow the steps above to check it again. I know it's odd somehow to use a different way but it's worth to give it shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still can't proceed, please share the following information with us:</p>
<p>1) Capture a screenshot about the Products Information in PowerPoint.</p>
<p>2) Share a sample file with us so that we can check it from our side. </p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The Link Data keeps the chart linked to the original worksheet which means you can edit it PowerPoint inside while using Paste link will regard it as chart object which means you have to edit it in Excel. Besides, the latter will automatically update
 the data by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The instruction in your post is applied to PowerPoint 2010 instead of Office 2016, which is the reason why you failed before. Please refer to the instructions in the following article.</p>

<h2>            Text message issue on 6.1</h2>
                    I have windows mobile 6.1 standard on my samsung blackjack II and when i access my text messages screen, next to the messages title in the top left of the screen there is a "(1)" showing that there is a new message, and it will not go away even after looking
 at all messages. On the home screen, it says there are no new messages. This just recently happened and it is beginning to become an annoyance. Please, somebody help me.
<br />
<br />
P.S. I have even deleted every conversation on my phone and it still has the "(1)".

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/15e33559-0b1a-4043-871e-9c485e4197e8" title="BrentKristofferson">
<p>
</p><p>Skype is fully dependent on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned, it works fine using the 4g connection via your mobile data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the WiFi connection maybe unstable or reception is weak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There a lot of factors to consider when using wireless connection including signal interruptions and the number of users/device connected to your Wifi network.</p>
