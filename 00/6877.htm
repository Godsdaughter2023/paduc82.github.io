            Hi thanks for your reply. I upgraded with win 10 upgrade tool. If I put wrong password in it tells me it's wrong, without password nothing happens. I have loaded win 10 before with no problems, but went back to win 7. My set up is a Dell Optiplex 755 with
 a Netgear &nbsp;AC1200 wifi adaptor which i have upgraded for win 10

<h2>            Delete Account Created Using Incorrect Work Email</h2>
                    <p>My employer uses two domains, since we are planning on migrating from our current email provider to Office 365 for Business. I absentmindedly created my first account using the incorrect email, and I have no way of deleting it. While logged in under the
 account I want to delete (I'm writing this under the correct account), I run into a page asking me if I'm ready to become an admin for my company's domain. Any other Microsoft login portal returns an error when I attempt to log in (Additional technical information,
 below).</p>

<p><span>As we discussed above, you don’t have to delete that incorrect tenant. System will delete that no subscription tenant automatically after certain days. You don’t have to
 concern about it. Below are some articles for your reference:</span></p>

<p>Hi Pawan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing your experience.</p>
<p>According to your description, as you have created code and published on server, it is more related to customization and development.</p>
<p>Given the situation, we suggest you post the question to our <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home?forum=sharepointdevelopment%2Csharepointcustomization%2Csharepointgeneral%2Csharepointadmin&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSDN forum</a> for dedicated help, to better understand the situation, I suggest you provide the code on there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Qing</p>

    <title>Cannot &#64;mention another Yammer user. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot &#64;mention another Yammer user.</h2>
                    
<p>I just created a Yammer Basic account and Network. My network is verified and everything seems to be working fine. I added my boss via an email invite through Yammer. She logged on and created her account successfully, but I am completely unable to use the
 @ mention function to tag her in any posts. Everything with her account seems fine, we are following one another, etc.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

    <title>sharing personal folders &#40;pst files&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            sharing personal folders &#40;pst files&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am hoping there is a way to do this. My boss would like to share one of his personal folders with me. (The .pst file is on a private network drive.) The only way I know how&nbsp;share folders is for him to export the folder to a network drive that we&nbsp;both have
 access to and then for me to import it. This is great as far as it goes, but he would like to file things from his inbox into the folder and then have me be able to access it right away, without going through the export\inport process each time, I don't see
 how we can do that.</p>
<p>Is there a way to accomplish this that I am not seeing? And is the export\import method I described the best way to go about this in the first place?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Monika</p>

            What kind of email accounts are you using? It would be much better if you were using a sharable email account because .PST files were never designed to be shared. Export/Import is not the way to go because the .PST import/Export feature does not and never
 has worked well, it loses a good deal of data. The way to do this is for your Boss to create a .PST file with the folders he want you to have and update it. He then closes Outlook and copies this .PST to your share area. When finished, you copy the .PST from
 the share area to your local machine and open it. If you make changes that he must see, the process is reversed; you close Outlook and copy the .PST file back to the share area, he downloads it and opens it. As to "Private drives", if these are on a network,
 using .PST files from them is not supported for the reasons Palcouk stated, it can/will lead to .PST file corruption. Having said all this, there are a number of third party applications that address this issue, a quick Internet search on "share Outlook data"
 will reveal many of them. Should you, in the future, consider either Exchange Server or Office 365, the issue will become a non-issue, as this sort of sharing is built-in.<br />

            There is no opt.ion to "disable" SkyDrive. OneNote on your Windows Phone always syncs with SkyDrive&nbsp;(or a Sharepoint siter) and cannot be used in a standalone mode. This is by design.

            I think this is a terrible thing to have default on the phone. Not only does it take away control over where your data is stored, but it probably exposes whatever information you have stored in OneNote to being sold and used for marketing, etc. I got so
 mad about this that I deleted everything I had written in OneNote and refuse to use it again for anything. Very disappointing that Windows would do this.

            <p>Does Word Sync the same way?</p>
<p>No it is not nonsense!!! I want to be in complete control of my data and know when and where it is.&nbsp; I have one and only one copy of certain notes. When I delete that copy I want to know that they are gone. My wife and my assistant both have my&nbsp;hotmail account
 password. What if I put my wifes birthday gift notes in my phone..... My hotmail account is something I consider to be low security. My password is simple. My phone is high security....&nbsp;I&nbsp;keep classified information on it. &nbsp;How do I know that my notes will
 not end up on Facebook. I am constantly being asked to integrate with Facebook.... For example... I made&nbsp;a play list of songs on Pandora and gave&nbsp;it a&nbsp;lude name. Then to my suprise, one day, I&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;Facebook and there it was for all of my&nbsp;relatives to
 see.&nbsp;I was hummiliated. This is B.S. microsoft should always give people the option before moving their data around. I am going to see if there is a way to delete&nbsp;Microsoft Office from my 7 Phone. This is sooooo &lt;deleted&gt;</p>

<li>If you delete a OneNote note on your phone, it will be deleted on the server. Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents from SkyDrive will only get deleted from your phone. However, with Word, Excel and PowerPoint, you have the option of local storage only and
 this is where documents from emails go.</li><li>You could use a local Word document to store gift notes I guess.</li><li>OneNote has no Facebook integration. There is no way for OneNote to post to Facebook.</li><li>You allowed your Pandora account to link with Facebook. There is no other way your example could have happened. If you don't think you did, then you clicked through a confirmation screen, which is your own fault for not reading what you were accepting.</li><li>You cannot remove Office from your phone</li><li>Please think of the words you are using before insulting something.

            <p>Thank you for the information. However, I&nbsp;will have to think about whether to&nbsp;use Word, or not. How can I trust Microsoft not to decide that&nbsp;Word should have the same policies as one note? I am sure that I can find Apps on MarketPlace that will work in place
 of MS Office.</p>
<p>I did not insult anyone except Microsoft as a company. You however were both insulting and wrong, in reply. You set the tone for the&nbsp;forum.</p>
<p>A better answer would have been that Pandora is not Microsoft. There were a number of articles pertaining to Pandora having passed such information to Facebook without having to click through a confirmation screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft passed my information to&nbsp;Skydrive without first asking.</p>
<p>The tone of anger is to emphasize that you should pass this complaint along to Program Management rather than defend a bad policy.</p>
<p>Microsoft should have a policy of never moving or duplicating data without asking the owner.</p>
<p>I will make a huge stink with Verizon over this.</p>

            If I remember correctly, my notes were actually local first (called Personal (Phone)) and I had to upload the notebook manually to the SkyDrive, at which point my default notebook became Personal (Web). I do not know if this behaviour has changed with
 Mango. Not willing to reset my device to find out.<br />
We don't know what Microsoft's plans are for the Office Hub. OneNote's main drive is the fact that Microsoft has OneNote clients everywhere at this point and keeping them in sync is crucial.<br />
As for Pandora, an app requires your explicit permission to post things to your wall. I would suggest you check your Facebook app permissions for anything amiss. I am not trying to single you out. Millions of people click without reading each day. It's much
 safer to assume this has happened before anything else.<br />

            Use the Merge to Individual Documents utility on th<span>e MergeTools – 20150309.dotm Add-in that you can download from the following page of my One Drive:<br />

</span>
<p><span><br />
The MergeTools – 20150309.dotm file needs to be saved in the Word Startup folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, the default location for that folder is<br />
<br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box of "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
In Windows 8 and 8.1, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box of
 "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
When that has been done and Word is started\re-started, the tab shown below will be added to the Ribbon:<br />

</span><span><span><br />
</span></span><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The mail merge main document must be of the Letter type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet
 in the Excel workbook. If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.
<span>&nbsp;</span>For the Chart Merge utility, download the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page of my OneDrive for additional requirements of the data source for use with that utility</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row that are within the range of columns that contain the data.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character (0-9).</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the data must start in the second row of the worksheet and there should be no empty rows within the range of data that is to be processed.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>You may also want to download:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">the Merging with Attachments document that is also on that page which explains how the system is used.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not actually necessary to have separate attachments as the facility can be used to send just the documents created by the merge itself as attachments, either as the body of the message itself or in the form of Word files or .pdf files.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That document explains how you must set up the Excel Data Source and the Mail Merge Main document to be able to execute a merge with a Chart that is unique to each record in the data source.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t take vertical panoramas after update</h2>
                    I love my 1020 - especially the panorama mode. Before the update I took panoramic pictures with a horizontal view and a vertical view - lots of sky - but since the update included panorama with portrait view I can no longer take pictures with vertical
 panorama -is there anything I can do? Still love the camera! I hope this isn't too confusing 8-)

            I can hold my phone and take a panorama photo in portrait mode - but before I could take a long vertical picture - e.g. multiple exposures of a tall tree from the top to the bottom of the tree.

<h3> hans  l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Times New Roman has no Regular font</h2>
                    Hello:<br />
<br />
In Word 2010, my Times New Roman has no Regular font in the Font dialog box.<br />
<br />
I know this is a problem for others as well, but I have not been able to find a fix.
<br />
<br />
I cannot delete the font and replace it, because it is a system-protected font.<br />
<br />
This happens in all existing and new documents.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what I could try to do?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Hans L<br />

            After all this, it took a "failed" attempt to update Windows from the CD (and from there to the MS website for the latest Windows version; there were, however, some issues that made it "fail") for me to finally realize that I could go into my wife's computer
 and copy her Times New Roman *regular* font into my Font folder. Duuuuh :-)<br />
<br />
When I copied the file, it said that it already existed in the folder (but it was not visible), so I overwrote it, and now, everything is fine.<br />
<br />
However, it means that the file was somehow affected by something, and it could probably have been made visible again. If anyone knows how that could have been done, I would still appreciate to learn how. (I have scoured the Web to no avail).<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 1020 &#38; Microsoft accounts problem</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone tell me why my nokia Lumia 1020 is not showing when I try to use the find my phone feature, after I sign in to windowsphone.com . I'm signed in but looking through other issues of this nature, I found one to say I must be signed in with the Microsoft
 account I used with my phone but for the life of me I can remember if I did set one up with my phone and if I did I can't remember it....<br />
<br />
Any help would be very much appreciated. </p>

            <p>HI Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To download apps on your Windows Phone you need to have used a main Microsoft account email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to settings-email+accounts the account will be listed there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use that email to login at <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.windowsphone.com</a> on the right top. If you had a previous windows phone before, make sure to select the correct windows phone (see image below). After that select "Find my Phone"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also make sure that on your Phone is Settings-"Find my phone" is turned on as well.</p>

    <title>Deleting an email causing the one above disappeared from UI, but not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldbees  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting an email causing the one above disappeared from UI, but not actually deleted.</h2>
                    <p>I have been working with Microsoft L1, 2 and 3 support for the following issues, but after about 4 weeks. They gave up and declared there is no resolution because "we only saw this once".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is their official reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"Issue summary: Outlook not able to sync emails | Deleting emails | duplicating emails<br />
Resolution: We perfomed several troubleshooting steps on outlook and even tried different email clients with your account. Sync issue is still there as we discussed it could be a problem with you using this account overseas, sent items duplicating issue has
 now been resolved but for the disappearing emails while deleting any email we don’t have any resolution as discussed."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Background:</span></p>
<p><span>I am using paid outlook 2016 to sync with the imap server of QQ (Tencent, the biggest internet provider in China).
</span></p>
<p><span>they have oversea imap servers:</span></p>
<p>hwimap.exmail.qq.com SSL 993</p>
<p>hwsmtp.exmail.qq.com SSL 465</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Foxmail (email client from QQ/Tencent) and do not see any issues that are happening on Outlook 2016 client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also tried Thunderbird and found no issue neither.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most annoying issue is when I delete an email from Outlook, the one above will also disappear from the UI, though it is not deleted from the server.&nbsp; The same email will appear again when I restart the Outlook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The L3 support guy was OK working with me but he told me there is no other escalation or "complaint" path for this case and his senior technician has the final word on this "non-resolution".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Komal</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it seems impossible to install KB 302466 correctly I decided to install build 9926 on a other HD.</p>
<p>This installation was successful and smoothly. Only I had to reinstall many apps but as a resigned solicitor I had plenty time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the SSD with build 9879 I reinstalled my Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Now everything is working fine.</p>
<p>So you can close my question because I solved my problem, only on a other way as you were advising.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<h3> nonative  say:</h3>
<h2>            File opens Blank after using macro to put superscript and subscript in Quick Access Toolbar</h2>
                    <p>Several days ago, in Excel 2010 on Windows 7 Professionsl, I created personal.xlsb workbook, &nbsp;wrote a macro in that file that I found on the internet to &nbsp;put superscript and subscript in Quick Access Toolbar, put it in the proper XLS Start folder in my User&gt;et
 cetera location per instructions, and sucessfully put some superscript letters in a few cells in my CLOSEOUT_INFO.xls file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that when opening Excel, the blank personal.xlsb file always opened and I would have to separately open a blank worksheet from the File&gt;Open toolbar process to start a new workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Anyway, today, when I opened the CLOSEOUT INFO.XLS, the blank personal.xlsb would open, and that's it. &nbsp;I couldn't see my CLOSEOUTFILE.XLS file at all. &nbsp;In my repair efforts, I managed to save a version of &nbsp;the file with (supposedly), all the data in the
 cells, but no formatting (I don't think there are any formulas in the file to begin with, but it's about 1,000 lines by 30 columns of data. &nbsp;Meanwhile, I still have the original file with a save date of 5 days ago with about 400kb of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've deleted the personal.xlsb file and the XLS Start folder, but all I get when opening&nbsp;CLOSEOUT INFO.XLS is a gray screen with no filename at the top of the window - it just says Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to repair the original&nbsp;CLOSEOUT INFO.XLS file with it's formatting so I can actually see it?</p>

            Original Poster here. &nbsp;Looks like some operator error. &nbsp;Apparently, last time I worked with the file, I had two separate excel files (workbooks) open side-by-side within one Excel "frame" stretched out over my two 21" monitors. &nbsp; And the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">CLOSEOUT
 INFO.XLS file was, of course, just "floating" within the Excel frame. &nbsp;So, when I opened up&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">CLOSEOUT INFO.XLS yesterday, the Excel frame that opened was just normal size within one of the monitors
 (not fullscreen) and the file was open "off-screen" to the right, out of the picture, so that all you see was gray. &nbsp;Because file&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">CLOSEOUT INFO.XLS was just floating over there, the header over the
 toolbar just said Microsoft Excel and not the filename. &nbsp;Happy thanksgiving ya'll!</span>

            Hello leosherifi, there will be an option in your phone itself for updating the software(SWupdate). Or else connect your phone to PC using Nokia suite then use the update present in it. If the update is available then only you will be able to update.

<h2>            Word crashes every time when trying to open one particular document only that uses a template</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the final stages of dissertation writing. My school requires me to format the dissertation according to the school's style-sheet. They also offer a template on the school's website, which I downloaded and used to format my dissertation
 in MS Word 2016. Since then, every time I try to open the formatted document, Word crashes. Sometimes it opens the document for a few minutes before crashing. I have tried opening the document in protected view, safe mode and also tried repairing the document
 by clicking on "open and repair" from inside MS Word, but nothing worked. The file was originally saved in my local Onedrive folder, so I tried accessing it from my other computer that has Word 2013 and I again faced the same problem. Interestingly, Word could
 open all other documents on both my computers without any issue, leading me to think the problem lies somewhere in the template I used. I found someone else's post in a forum on the Internet who had had the exact same problem with Word 2013 after he added
 a downloaded stylesheet from a trusted source to his document in the local Onedrive folder on his computer. I tried the suggestions that people had given on the forum, namely, opening the document in the Safe Mode and then disabling all plugins but the document
 couldn't be opened in the Safe Mode either. Apparently, those suggestions didn't help him either and he had to open the file with Word Online and strip it off the formatting used earlier to make it work. However, that doesn't solve my problem as my school
 would accept my dissertation only in that particular format. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, my work isn't lost - I can still open the file with Word Online or with Open Office; just that I cannot get Word 2013 or Word 2016 to open the document, which is precisely what I need. Both my computers run on Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />Try working with the Word Safe mode and check if it helps.
<br />Hold the windows key + Letter ‘R’ on the keyboard to launch the Run command &gt; Copy and paste the following command line in the open box and click Ok.
<br />Winword /safe
<br />
<br />If, word works properly do you need to disable add-ins:
<br />Go into Word
<br />Click on File menu.
<br />Click Options.
<br />Click Add-ins.
<br />Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-Add-in.
<br />Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.
<br />Close the Word and restart it.
<br />
<br />In the link below explain how disable add-in:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-m...</a>
<br />
<br />If, the procedures above didn't work, I refer to repair Office in the following link for more information:
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel &gt;&gt; Add and Remove Programs and highlight Microsoft Office. Click on Remove. A menu will pop up allowing you to choose repair or reinstall. Try a Repair Online and verified after repair it fix.

</p><p>For the record, my work isn't lost - I can still open the file with Word Online or with Open Office; just that I cannot get Word 2013 or Word 2016 to open the document, which is precisely what I need. Both my computers run on Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hello Charles.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time. You're right, I didn't post here to get a lecture on writing. To be honest, I didn't like your tone and felt inclined to point out that as a non-native speaker, you are likely unable to read or write a single sentence in the languages
 I speak at home (Bengali, Hindi, and Urdu), let alone a full paragraph. But then I thought I shouldn't let my ego get the better of me. Besides, it doesn't hurt for me to get a few pointers from you if it helps improve&nbsp;my English. So if you could give me some
 tips or point me to some resources on how to write better paragraphs in English - ones that are worthy of a Ph.D. student - I would greatly appreciate that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, your suggestions to repair the document didn't work, but I appreciate your trying to help. Also, I don't think I mentioned this in my post, but I do have backups - several of them actually (one cannot be too careful when it comes to such things!),
 but since I applied the formatting to the document, none of the backups are working either (which is what led me to suspect that it's an issue with the particular template I used). So I used Open Office - not to edit the document, but simply to check if it
 can be opened with other word processors. And thank God that it could be opened with Open Office, otherwise, I would have lost a whole lot more than just the formatting on the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other suggestions you gave (like not using a flash drive for working with the document or keeping regular backups, etc.) are pretty basic and well-known to regular users of word processors but, nevertheless, thank you. And, yes, I realize that I can
 start from a brand new document based on the template and reformat the whole damn three-hundred-and-some-pages long dissertation; and at this point, it seems like that is what I will ultimately have to do. But with submission&nbsp;deadline&nbsp;around the corner, I
 was hoping to avoid the extra work that this option, as you rightly pointed out, entails with some quick-fixes maybe. And that was the point of my post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thanks, anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Your ability in English is superb. I was just noting the length of the paragraph, which made it difficult
<em>for me</em> to read. That may have been the reason you got such a bad answer from Diego.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have little ability in other languages and&nbsp; none in non-Romance languages (other than English). I am in awe.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Did you try copying all but the last paragraph into a new document from Word Online?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also assuming that you started the document from your school's template rather than trying to "apply" the template to the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem you are seeing may be in section breaks.</p>
<p>With a copy of your document, when you can open it in Word, try replacing ^b with ^p.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That will mess up your headers and footers and maybe your pagination. However, the rest of your formatting should be fine. If that document works, write back for help to get back formatting specific to your template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can put a copy of the template on OnDrive with a link here or a link to it on your school's site, I or someone else can take a look at it to see if that is the source of the problem. I would be surprised if it is. Nevertheless, I've seen some very
 bad university-promoted templates.</p>

<p>the same applies for other sites like google and bing... they will work just as well if you do not place them in your Trusted Sites list.... With Win7 and IE9 much of the built-in IE security is now handled by the Phishing filter and your AV product.</p>
<p>long lists of sites in the Trusted and Restricted sites lists (old way of helping to protect your computer) actually slow your web browser down.</p>
