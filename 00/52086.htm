</p><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox 360 games acquired via Games with Gold will continue to work even if you don't have a Gold subscription anymore.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about the games for the original Xbox though. For Xbox One games an active Gold subscription is required.</p>
<p>

            I believe OG Xbox Games With Gold titles are considered Xbox 360 content and fall under the same rules; that is, the title is yours to keep forever. Only native Xbox One GWG titles require that you maintain the subscription to keep access.

<p>With Xbox 360 titles you will own the games in perpetuity regardless of if your Xbox Live Gold subscription is active or not.</p>

<p>Original Xbox titles are much like Xbox One games and purchased through that store under backwards compatibility so the same rules as Xbox One titles apply and you will need to have an active Xbox Live Gold subscription to play those. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Xbox 360 titles are different because of how that store was engineered and handled licensing, and the limitations of that store are why the "purchases" are permanent.&nbsp; Since the OG Xbox titles are purchased via the Xbox One digital storefront, they do
 not have the same stipulations as the 360 titles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that I have not verified this myself, but a friend of mine tested this and was unable to play the backwards Xbox titles without an active Gold subscription, so if there is conflicting information, please feel free to correct me.</p>

that I purchased and downloaded on Jan 10, 2016. I have attempted to run the game for several times and accumulated a total playtime of 3 hours while trying to load it. I am still unable to play it until now and have put request to refund via Steam Support
 but it was rejected. Paying for a game which cannot be played is really annoying. Can anyone help me pls?&nbsp;</p>

            <span>If you have forgotten your password, if you have another user account with administrative privileges you can log into that account and change your original user account's password from the User Accounts applet in Control Panel.
 If you don't have another account like this set up or don't have the password to it, you'll need to log into the built-in Administrator account. In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting
 up. This will get you to the right menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here. Once in Safe Mode, you will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode. At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows.<br />
<br />
If you have XP Pro or Media Center and were using the built-in Administrator account for your regular work and it is therefore the only user account on the system, there are ways to change the password for that account to a blank. Microsoft doesn't permit us
 to tell you how in these forums. Their house, their rules. Use Google or ask a local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place).<br />

    <title>Unable to uninstall PowerDVD 6 from Windows Vista - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to uninstall PowerDVD 6 from Windows Vista</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For&nbsp;unknown reason I was able to install PowerDVD 6 in my new Dell laptop with OS Vista, unaware of its incompatiblity. Now I want to uninstall it and Vista would not let me complete the process: in the Control Panel/Programs and Features, after I clicked
 uninstall PowerDVD, half way thru the process, I received this warning dialog box: "Severe: The installation will be terminated at this time. The software is intended for Windows 98 SE, ME, 2000 or above versions only," then the end.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate if someone could tell me how to uninstall this software from my computer system as I no longer need a DVD player software -- Had I known this before! -- since&nbsp;my new&nbsp;Dell XPS system has already had Windows Media Center preinstalled in which
 you can do a lot more stuffs than just playing a movie. Also, I'd like to pass this info onto whomever that would need this so such mistake like mine won't happen again to others.</p>
<p>Thanks much.</p>

<h2>            Windows XP &#34;Date Modified&#34; option</h2>
                    In Windows XP, I want to be able to sort my items by Date Modified. I can no longer do this because my folder is now treated as a music folder, so I only get music options when using the "Sort by" submenu. I already moved all of the music out of my folder
 and it's still treated like a music folder. How do I change it back so it's treated like a normal folder?

            Desktop.ini files open using Notepad when I manually type in the file name. However, I can't seem to find a way of deleting the one for My Documents. It responds to Notepad, but when I run a search for desktop.ini, the one for My Documents doesn't show
 up. Even after turning on the setting for showing hidden files, desktop.ini files don't show up.<br />
<br />
I edited the ini file for another big folder I have, and it reverted to being recognized as a normal folder instead of a music one. But editing the My Documents desktop.ini doesn't stop it from being recognized as a music folder.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Never mind, I found another solution for myself! View &gt; Choose Details &gt; There's a checkbox list of stuff I want to show up in the Arrange Icons By menu, including Date Modified! Thanks for the help though.<br />

<h2>            optional update mistakenly downloaded</h2>
                    On the recent round of Widnows Updates, I mistakenly opted to download an optional Bluetooth adapter update, which wouldn't install anyway,&nbsp; and now it keeps trying to install, over and over again each time I restart Window. I can't find it in the list
 of installed items in Windows Update screen, and I don't know how to stop it from trying to install again and again. Please advise.<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

            <p>Hi Lori,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's best to let Windows automatically download recommended drivers and detailed information for your hardware and devices via Windows Update. This is a good way to make sure all your hardware and devices work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you do not want Windows to do this automatically and if you can do this on your own regularly, then you may disable this option. Please follow these steps for the same:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “<b><i>Start</i></b>” button and then click on “<b><i>Devices and Printers</i></b>” in the start menu.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click the name of your computer, and then click “<span><b><i>Device installation settings</i></b>”</span>.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select the option “<b><i>No, let me choose what to do</i></b>” and then from its sub-menu select the option “<b><i>Never installs driver software from Windows Update</i></b>”.</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on “<b><i>Save Changes</i></b>”.</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart the computer and check if it is still prompting you to install the driver update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>
        </p>

            Try performing a system restore to an earlier date this should revert the windows updates. There are two ways to perform system restore:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open start menu click run and then type cmd to open command prompt.</p>
<p>Type CD.. to make c:\ only.</p>
<p>Type CD windows then CD System32 and then restore.</p>
<p>After once you find yourself in c:\ windows\system32\restore&gt;</p>
<p>Then type restrui.exe press enter.</p>
<p>Once the system restore window open then click next to select any available restore point.</p>
<p>This process shall take couple of minutes to perform restore and please make sure that once this process started it wont be reversible and neither you will lose any personal data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Other way to perform system restore is to open safe mode by clicking F8 on start-up and check safe mode option then further a dialogue box will open to ask for system restore and then follow
 the above steps.&nbsp;</span>

    <title>Network adapter is dropping and causing freezes. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lostshaolin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network adapter is dropping and causing freezes.</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 8.1 64 bit with an laptop Acer Aspire E 15 Start ES1-512-C1W0. Also using the Chrome browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a network adapter that seems to be not functioning some days and I don't understand why. Couple of examples of what I mean is, once I boot up my laptop, the network icon that usually shows full white bars will end up disappearing and switches to the
 PC icon with red/white x. Which indicates it can't connect or unable find my wireless connection. Another time the issue occurs is when I'm browsing on the internet or I could be watching a random video, the network will completely disconnect and will not
 show my wireless connection name anymore. Then once I try to reconnect, the laptop completely freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only ways I have to get the network back to normal again is usually either restarting the laptop or through a hard reset by holding the power button. I tried updating the network adapter driver in device manager to see if that would help the problem,
 but windows claims I already have the latest driver software. My network adapter is called Qualcomm Atheros AR956x Wireless Network Adapter Driver Version 10.0.0.288</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one have any other solutions? Thanks for the help.</p>

            1. Download the latest driver from acer and keep a copy of this.
<br />
<br />Driver Link - <a href="https://global-download.acer.com/GDFiles/Driver/Wireless%20LAN/Wireless%20LAN_Atheros_10.0.0.288_W81x64_A.zip?acerid=635524972111251252&amp;Step1=NOTEBOOK&amp;Step2=ASPIRE&amp;Step3=ASPIRE%20ES1-512&amp;OS=81P1&amp;LC=en&amp;BC=ACER&amp;SC=PA_6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://global-download.acer.com/GDFiles/Driver...</a>
<br />
<br />You should right click on your network adapter in Device Manager and uninstall and reboot your computer.
<br />
<br />After reboot, your computer will automatically install the driver.
<br />
<br />(In case, automatic installation fails, you can install the driver from the downloaded copy)
<br />
<br />2. If above doesn't work - Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there
<br />

<p>Hello everyone. Sorry for taking weeks to respond as I've been busy with personal issues. I decided to return to give you a quick update on my current computer status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To Ugo Lopez,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your advice regarding the Power Settings and I have to say, I've had good results since then. For over a couple weeks, I've experienced no disconnects or freezes. So it seemed like your solution helped a lot. Thank you very much! Appreciate the
 help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, just recently today, I've encountered another freezing issue after watching a youtube video. It unfroze for a couple seconds, but went back to freezing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network connection is still stable, so I'm not entirely sure if it's still network adapter related or caused by something else. If I can find out, I'll be sure to post back to see if anyone else has any other solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I want to say thank you to E for Excel and auggy for the responses. If my freezing is indeed network related, I'll be sure to use the information you both provided.</p>

    <title>cannot access boot menu nor bios settings in windows 8.1 on acer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            cannot access boot menu nor bios settings in windows 8.1 on acer x1430g&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Help! I am trying to restore my computer back to Windows 7 using factory recovery discs,but I cannot access either the boot menu options nor the bios settings! I have tried everything and all it does is just boot straight into Windows 8.1. I did a "Refresh"
 about a month back,but I want to re-install back to Windows 7 in order to recover the programs that came with my computer when I purchased it and then re-install the Windows 8 Pro upgrade. My system is an Acer Aspire X1430G Desktop that I purchased just over
 a year ago. Any help here would be really appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE: Since I cannot seem to even get to the Bios Settings on it,I'm wondering,can I use the "Remove everything and reinstall Windows" option in Windows 8&nbsp;to accomplish the restoration to factory? This really has me ticked off! There is no way of contacting
 Acer about this problem that I can find that doesn't cost me! It would seem to that since this is a problem that is occuring on more than just MY system they should fix it at no cost! I just spent $20 bucks to get the recovery discs from Acer and now I can't
 even use them! If this is a problem with Windows 8 then&nbsp;Microsoft should fix this for me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>UPDATE: I just tried the "Remove everything" and it said that the media was invalid. I cancelled that since there wasn't a way to make it accept it and it opened Windows Explorer to show all the media on the disc. It shows 6
<u>Folders</u> (1) ACERBOOT (2) BOOT (3) EFI (4) GAIA (5) PATCH (6) SOURCES and then after those there are 6
<u>Files</u> (1) ACERBOOT_FOLDER.TAG (2) AUTORUN (3)BOOTMGR (4)CHECKFILES (5) PBFIX.DAT (6) SYSTEMCD.DAT . Is there a way to install it this way?
<br />
</p>
<p>ALSO, Can anybody tell me if there is a limit on how many times I can reinstall my copy of Windows 8 Pro?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>UPDATE to UPDATE to UPDATE: After much hit and miss, I have finally gotten into the bios and changed the boot order to boot from disc. Now I have THIS going on; I inserted the first disc and got to this point and these options (1.) Restore Operating System
 to Factory Defaults. (2.) Restore Operating System and retain User Data and&nbsp; (3.) Completely Restore Computer to Factory Defaults.</p>
<p>I chose the third option since it seems to be what I'm trying to do. The problem now is that it is telling me "Remove all files from your hard disc before starting. This function will not work if there are any files on the hard drive." What do I do? Am I
 picking the wrong option? How do I "Remove all files from hard drive"? Please let me know quick because my computer is just sitting here with a disc in the op drive and open in that window.<br />

<p>What are you doing?&nbsp; Timing will be critical.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like you should be mashing the Delete key as soon as you press the Power On switch...</p>

<p>Power on the system. As soon as the first logo screen appears, immediately press
<strong>F2</strong> for notebooks or <strong>Delete</strong> for desktops to enter the BIOS.<br />
&lt;/quote&gt;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Other users in your circumstance on other machines which have a feature called "Fast Boot" have found it necessary to reset the BIOS by pulling the CMOS battery.&nbsp; Fortunately you don't seem to have that issue to deal with.&nbsp; However, one strange thing I noticed
 about your product is that there is a BIOS update for Linux users but not one for Windows.&nbsp; Maybe Acer aren't telling you something?&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hmm...&nbsp; search with "dual boot" as a search phrase shows that some Acer users are trying this for W8 but I don't see any who are using your model in particular.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The idea would be that if someone was successfully dualbooting your machine there might be
 reason to be optimistic about trying that BIOS update.)</p>

            Hi Robert,<br />
<br />
I have tried the holding down the F2,F12 and Delete in the same way (Not at the same time) as you suggested and am still getting the same result. Also,if you read my question,I cannot even access the bios settings at all! As for all the updates,I did all of
 those when I refreshed my machine a little over a month ago. Unfortunately my experience is limited mostly to changing out HDDs,reinstalling O.S.'s and installing new Ram when it comes to working on a computer. I don't even know the first thing about the CMOS.
 How complicated is it to do? I don't want to screw my system up completely so I'm wondering; if I were able to Refresh my Windows 8 again if that would fix the problem and I could try to reinstall the Factory System then? That leads me to the problem of "Just
 how many times am I allowed to Reinstall my Windows 8 Pro"? Is there any set limit?
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />
        </p>

<p>That's the point of <u><strong>quickly</strong></u> pressing Delete when you power on.&nbsp; In fact, perhaps you should try pressing Delete at the
<u>same time</u> as you power on?&nbsp; But I have seen other discussions where it was shown that that tactic would not work because the key would not repeat fast enough.&nbsp; The users actually had to try to press it more quickly than it would repeat.&nbsp; See why some
 other manufacturers have started providing a second power on button reserved for this function?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Otherwise try asking Acer what they recommend?&nbsp;&nbsp; The site sounds definitely skittish about recommending a BIOS update.&nbsp; It shouldn't cost you anything to use their forums and they obviously have Acer staff monitoring the questions there.&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks to me
 that you probably do have a "Fast boot" option in effect which as I indicated will just make your job of trying to get into the BIOS menus even harder.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there anything that you can do regarding booting?&nbsp; E.g. would a bootable DVD be recognized?&nbsp; Then you could boot your W7 DVD and use its delay to get into your BIOS.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Oh.&nbsp; I just noticed the Update in your OP.&nbsp; So you can actually use W8.1?&nbsp; Then this may not be so difficult to fix after all.&nbsp; E.g. you should be able to use a &nbsp;Shift-Restart method of getting into the Advanced Options boot menu.&nbsp; Then booting just to the
 command only boot and working from there.</p>

            Hey Robert,<br />
I watched the video and it got me zip. I still don't know how to get to the "Boot from DVD/Cd option! If anything it left me even more confused! I got to advanced options and it shows this; System Restore. System Image Recovery. Startup Repair. Command Prompt.
 Startup settings. When I try System Image Recovery option I get "Windows cannot find a system image on this computer" although I put the first of the 5 recovery discs into the drive. When I select Startup Settings it takes me to the restart which in turn gives
 me a long list of options that I don't want. It does give me an option of "Launch recovery environment,but that just takes me to Choose an Option&nbsp; 1. Continue 2.Troubleshoot and 3. Turn off your PC. How do I get this stupid thing to boot from my recovery discs?
 Although this got me a lot further than I was,it still doesn't solve the problem.
<br />
BTW: I just want to recover the programs that I lost when I did the refresh. It did not save anything! It told me files were missing and to insert my media. I did and it just loaded Windows 8 onto my computer like I had done a Custom Install and left me with
 nothing but the Windows 8!&nbsp; I like Windows 8 and will upgrade it back to 8 after I get the original Windows 7 back on it with my lost programs.<br />

            Yes. I tried Acer and no help there. I don't care if everything is deleted,but it doesn't let me go any further until I get rid of all files on the hard drive. How do I do that? Do I have to stop everything and wipe my entire hard drive? That seems a little
 extreme to me. Or should I try the "restore OS to factory defaults". It says that it will delete all files on C: drive,but is that going to let me use the other discs to install the programs?<br />
<br />
Here are the options I get: <br />
1. Restore operating system to factory defaults;Restores operating system to factory default status. All data on drive c: will be deleted.<br />
2.Restore operating system and retain user data;Restores only the operating system of your PC to the factory defaults. Files from your user accounts will be transferred to C:/Backup. This option will not remove persistant viruses or malware.<br />
3. Completely restore your computer to factory defaults. Restores your computer to factory default status. All data in the hidden partition and on the system partition will be restored. Before restoring,please delete any data on the hard disc.<br />
What to do! What to do! Help!<br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note that "C: drive" is only a partition.&nbsp; If the hidden partition is there it probably still has your original W7 restore to factory condition files.&nbsp; Did you look?&nbsp; Apparently you could have got at it using F10.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What is the DVD going to do?&nbsp; As I indicated I don't know what the implementation of the procedure is.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the DVD is just to substitute for the files in your hidden partition I imagine it will let you go back to W7 as originally installed but if you have
 any files that you want you had better back them up somewhere first.&nbsp; If you now have proof that the procedure you are into&nbsp;won't restore the C: partition unless it is reformatted I guess you will have to format it.&nbsp; You could do that from the command only
 boot.&nbsp; I wouldn't try formatting the other partitions until you get some more clear signals that that is necessary.&nbsp; All the documentation that I am finding suggests that you are just getting a warning about losing everything and there is no mention of having
 to do any other separate procedure.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also don't know what you think you are going to be getting from this DVD when you refer to "install the programs".&nbsp;&nbsp; Factory condition would mean to me whatever the machine had loaded from the factory.&nbsp; So,&nbsp; if you bought the machine from a retailer and
 it was loaded with other programs you probably should be trying to get whatever they offer in terms of "bootable recovery media" instead.&nbsp; Ideally you would have created one of your own and been able to use it instead.</p>

            I was thinking of the same thing. Problem is that I believe when it was "refreshed" it took it off. So it still leaves me with the only option of "restore operating system to factory defaults" as I don't know how to get rid of the data on the hard drive.
 I bought the computer a little over a year ago and all I had to do was turn it on and it all installed itself. I was assured by Acer that all the original programs would be on the recovery discs they sent me. So you are saying that it won't do what I'm trying
 to do by restoring the OS to factory default? Well if I don't hear back from you in an hour I'm going to try it anyway since I have no other options. It is now 11:35 CDT where I'm at. I can't just leave it like it is and if it screws it up I just hope nobody
 gets in my way between my door and the dumpster! It's gonna be open season. I'm out a lot of money and I ain't a happy camper! I have several PCs and 4 of them run Windows 8. Every single one of the ones with 8 on them ask me for a media disc when I try to
 Refresh it and this is not supposed to happen according to Microsoft! I just checked the other three. I could see it happening on one,but FOUR?!!? I owe this to Microsoft and their screwing up the process in boot menu in Windows 8 and their dumb*** "Refresh"
 B.S.! <br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem with my ACER ASPIRE V3-771G on which I have installed 2 HD with Windows 8.1 on both of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the solution I found to access boot setup &lt;F2&gt; or boot device&nbsp; order&nbsp;menu &lt;F12&gt;:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Shut down the system holding SHIFT key until computer is completly off</p>
<p>&nbsp; ==&gt; This will show the &lt;F2&gt; and &lt;F12&gt; options at boot time. (but you can spam these keys, it will not work)</p>
<p>2) Insert bootable Windows 8.1 installation DVD</p>
<p>3) Turn on computer</p>
<p>4) when asked to boot from DVD, hit a key to proceed</p>
<p>5) On the first installation window (asking keyboard laoyout, ...) just cancel installation by clicking upper right X red box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; ==&gt; doing so, the computer will restart still showing boot options menu (&lt;F2&gt; and &lt;F12&gt;)</p>
<p>6) At restart, hit &lt;F2&gt; or &lt;F12&gt; when boot options menu shows up</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remark : not sure if first step is mandatory</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will help</p>
<p>regards</p>

                    <p>HI,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 10 <strong>home</strong> OS (<strong>OEM</strong>) which came pre-installed on my laptop. Now im gonna buy Windows 10
<strong>Pro</strong> (<strong>retail</strong>) pack and activate it on the same laptop. But the vendor informed me that windows 10 Pro will not be successfully activated on my lap top hence it is having a windows 10 home license which is
<strong>injected to the BIOS of the mother board</strong> and it will automatically convert to windows 10 home again. So i want to know whether it's true or false ? &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>It will automatically activate when you purchase through the store which will upgrade you to Windows 10 Pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why the vendor would say that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; activation &gt; go to store </p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase. Please note, you won't get a product key. It will be attached to your account. If you wish to transfer the Windows 10 Pro license in the future, learn how in the following article:</p>

<h2>            Screen resolution changes after sleep&#47;hibernate &#58; Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Precision workstation with an NVIDIA K2200 graphics card driving two identical Dell 4K monitors at their native display resolution of 3840x2160 configured as 'Extended Display'.&nbsp; After power on and start up there is NEVER a problem.&nbsp; However
 after a forced sleep/hibernate (via the Start button) or timed out (Power Options) one of the screens sometimes (but not always) changes to the lower resolution of&nbsp; 2560x1440 and open windows all get reduced in size and pushed up into the top left hand corner
 of the display designated as&nbsp; 'Main'.&nbsp; The higher native resolution is no longer an option choice for that display .&nbsp; On ocassions&nbsp; I have seen the display automatically return back to its native resolution of 3840x2160 following a subsequent sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 is up to date</p>
<p>BIOS is up to date</p>
<p>Graphics card drivers are up to date</p>
<p>On my third graphics card installed under warranty</p>
<p>A temporary&nbsp; 'upgrade' to Windows 10 appeared to make the probelm worse</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen many similar questions posted in various forums but no clear solution.&nbsp; Some answers point the finger at some of the entries in the Registry.&nbsp; Does someone (MicroSoft perhaps?) out there know exactly what is going on and how to fix it ? Thanks
 in advance for a solution ...</p>

    <title>Moved from America to Italy - Xbox fail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barbyfirefly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moved from America to Italy - Xbox fail</h2>
                    
<p>So I am able to get online fine. I can send messages and stuff but I've only been able to join two of my friends parties and failed to join many others. I cannot join my friends games. I was able to play multiplayer Dead Island for a bit but most of the
 people I could join were in Europe. Sadly, most of my friends are in America along with my family and it is meant to be a means of communication for me since I will be here for a year at a time. Routers are not the same in Italy. They are very complicated
 and only customer service can change settings. I was wondering if anyone has experience with something like this? Please help.</p>

<p>Blvr - Italy is not on that list. I am not prepared to not return my xbox to it's original state when I move back to America anyway. Would it be possible or easier for me to just make a brand new gamertag and set that location to Italy? Or would it have
 any effect at all? </p>
<p>Miss - I can try my best to get some of that information. Like I said, it's a big hassle here in Italy. The only way to get information about the router here is to call and they only speak Italian. We will see in the next few days if I can find out anything
 at all.</p>

<p>I was able to connect just now to a couple parties. I changed my region to Germany instead. Maybe that will help. Internet is all shared here so maybe during high usage it will be impossible to connect to anyone.

            First, whenever a computer is delivered with USB 3.0 port, the ports should have blue plastic in the middle of the port's connections.&nbsp; This seems to be a standard that was adopted for USB 3.0 ports.<br />
<br />
If the ports have stopped working, you need to:<br />
<br />
1) Consult the computer's user manual and check for any possible controls, in the BIOS or via keys / button, that can turn off the USB 3.0 functions / ports.<br />
<br />
2) Locate the correct drivers for the USB 3.0 controller, off the manufacturer's support site download sections, and try to re-install these.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the above two (2) suggestions do not help, you might need to contact the tech support department and you may need to get your laptop repaired.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Blocked mrt.exe by administrator and refuses to run MRT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickp2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Blocked mrt.exe by administrator and refuses to run MRT</h2>
                    <p>I recently had a download that seemed suspicious. I haven't experienced any issues but wanted to be on the safe side. So i ran my anti-virus scan and got no issues and, as I have never used mrt , I had heard about it and figured it wouldn't be a bad idea
 to run as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When i try to run it i get a message that it has been blocked by the admin.. I am the admin and am the ONLY person/account that has ever used this computer.&nbsp; This worries me that I do have something malicious that is blocking mrt.&nbsp; I want to know if anyone
 else can run mrt without issues or if I am the only one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>the only thing I have found in forums is people talking about updates and such but those posts are from mid 2017, and I understand that Windows updates these things monthly. So is there an issue with this version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not amazing at IT stuff but i know how to do at least basic stuff with a computer.&nbsp; I just need some direction and help, and some understanding of why windows 10 is blocking an administrator from doing administrator things..</p>

            Hey Nick.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When you get a download that is blocked but you know is from a safe source (like Microsoft) right click it to open Properties, check for an Unblock button to choose.  
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running the built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best. 
<br />
<br />To be surest of your install integrity go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Steps 4, 7 and 11 to turn off Startup freeloaders that throttle performance and cause issues, scan for infection with the best standalone scanners which are good to have on call, and test for broken system files.  Then you can continue with the rest of the steps if you have performance issues remaining.  
<br />
<br />If you have specfiic performance problems please also report those back.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Mouse in windows 10 keeps playing the loading animation and won&#39;t let me do anything fullscreen</h2>
                    <p>So I've just updated to windows 10. The same day I updated to windows 8.1. The mouse keeps repeating the loading animation and when I go on a game, YouTube or windows media player. It is like it clicks on the desktop and it sends me back there. I didn't
 have problems with my mouse in windows 8.1. When I hover over an open application down in the taskbar, It shows the preview for one second before "clicking on the desktop"&nbsp;</p>

<p>All drivers on my laptop are updated and it's still playing the loading animation. I've looked on the HP website for mouse drivers. I've looked on device manager. It's just windows 10 doing it? I might just go back to windows 8.</p>

<h2>            how to factory reset computer&#63;</h2>
                    For 25 hours now My computer has been playing up.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was playing a game (Sims 3) and it cut off. Then if i tried to load it again an error message would pop up saying " unable to start game. service&nbsp;initialization failed 0x024e424f". so i tried to remove the game through the control panel and it gave me
 another error message saying&nbsp;&nbsp;"an error[-5005 : 0x80070002] please make sure you have finished any previous set up and closed other applications. If the error occurs cont the vendor: electronic arts"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I removed any custom content I had downloaded and any caches that was in the Sims folder. Then tried to uninstall it again it did not work. I had a loook in the regedit thing and the Electronic Arts folder is not there. I did not remove it or any of
 the folders in the programme files folder. I tried to do system restore on the computer but that would not go back to earlier date before the issue started..&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can not do a factory reset as I do not have a recovery disc.&nbsp;</div>
<div>My computer is a&nbsp;<em>Fujitsu</em>&nbsp;Esprimo&nbsp;<em>P1500.&nbsp;</em></div>
<div><em><br />
</em></div>
<div><em>Any ideas to how i can fix this rather annoying issue? Also where I can get a recovery disc for it? have researched but cant find any thing.&nbsp;</em></div>
<div><em><br />
</em></div>
<div><em>Thank you&nbsp;</em></div>
<div><em>Rhue&nbsp;</em></div>
                </div>

            <p>You may be able to buy Recovery Disks from Fujitsu.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.ts.fujitsu.com/contact/servicedesk/ServiceDeskNumber.asp?LNG=EN&amp;LNID=5410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.ts.fujitsu.com/contact/servicedesk/ServiceDeskNumber.asp?LNG=EN&amp;LNID=5410</a></p>
<p>Select your country to obtain contact details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The manual for this model states that it is delivered with Recovery Disks and the instructions are on their case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most Fujitsu systems I've seen have a Recovery partition on the hard disk. To use this the following procedure is used.</p>
<p>Shutdown Windows</p>
<p>Power on</p>
<p>Press the F8 key repeatedly. If Windows starts shutdown and try again.</p>
<p>Select 'Repair your computer'</p>
<p>Enter language and user and password if requires</p>
<p>You should get a System Recovery Options menu; select Fujitsu Recovery (or similar)</p>
<p>Select the option to Restore as-delivered status</p>
<p>Select&nbsp;hard disk as Source.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your model may vary but, if present, the instructions should be straight-forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download instructions from: <a href="http://support.ts.fujitsu.com/Download/ShowDescription.asp?Info=FTS&amp;SoftwareGUID=581DCDCA-7DE4-4449-BA3F-C059A3F717FA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
