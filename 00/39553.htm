            I am Administrator on my Windows 10 Pro 64-bit computer. I went to the Programs and Features control panel and clicked the "Turn Windows on or off" link at the top left. Then selected Legacy Components from the list and installed DirectPlay. I then opened
 the properties of the Totala.exe file and told it to run in Windows 95 mode. The game runs fine now. I'm using the Cavedog CD version of the game.

<p><span><span>Hi Matthew Dragon,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can transfer data from one computer to another but you cannot transfer programs. Unless
 it is portable and does not require installation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to install the game in the new computer and copy the game files(including
 save game files)from the old computer and save it in the same location in your new computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Save game files will be in either the folder where the game is installed or in My documents.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Regards,<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check in Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot - watch screen for keys - check to be sure<br />
on-board sound/audio is enabled for all laptops and some PC's (that do not have separate sound cards).<br />
If a PC and separate sound card remove ALL power - remove and reseat the card - do not just snug.<br />
<br />
For those with on-board sound if needed you can get&nbsp; USB sound card and for those with separate cards<br />
a new sound card can be used - neither of those options are expensive if required.<br />
<br />
=========================<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to
<br />
see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take
<br />
several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Movie Maker 2012 issue - There&#39;s a tiny darker line on the sides - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eacan98  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movie Maker 2012 issue - There&#39;s a tiny darker line on the sides of my video, even 4&#58;3 or 16&#58;9, all the time.</h2>
                    I'm using Movie Maker 2012 <b>(build 16.4.3503.0728)</b>,&nbsp; I saw a&nbsp;little&nbsp;darker line on the sides of my video on the preview, it's okay. But the worse thing is, that tiny darker line still can be seen on the sides of my video&nbsp;even 4:3 or 16:9,&nbsp;regardless
 of photo or video content on my saved movie.&nbsp;
<div>That tiny darker line appears all the time! The sides are including left, right, top and&nbsp;bottom. You need to see it in full screen to see the tiny darker lines on the sides. This issue does not occur in the previous version of Movie Maker until this version
 of Movie Maker.
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This's&nbsp;ridiculous,&nbsp;other video editing software doesn't have this&nbsp;ridiculous issue, even it's free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<div>I believe it can be solve by the future software update........</div>

            <p>I've just reproduced your issue.&nbsp; I created a <a href="http://imageshack.us/a/img580/4964/darkenededgesmm2012.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
comparison image</a> to show the Movie Maker team the exact symptoms.&nbsp; These are close-up screenshots of the lower-left corner of a saved movie.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first two are from Windows Movie Maker 6.0 (from Vista) and&nbsp;Windows Live Movie Maker 2011.&nbsp; There are no darkened edges in these movies.</p>
<p>The second two are from Movie Maker 2012.&nbsp; I captured images from movies made before and after the October update, so the issue has been and continues to be there.</p>
<p>All of these were made on the same computer running Windows 7 with the same graphics card and driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my untrained eye, it looks like the rendering logic is actually blending black pixels offscreen when rendering both the previews and the final movie.&nbsp; In other words, it looks like they aren't just sampling the pixels from the image or video, but extra
 pixels (i.e. black ones) outside the frame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I hadn't really noticed the darkening until you mentioned it, but it is definitely there and certainly an undesirable "feature" (can I say "bug"?).&nbsp; Let's hope this gets escalated to the Movie Maker team and they can remove this "feature".</p>

    <title>How to delete a language from the list of used languages&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to delete a language from the list of used languages&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On my Surface pro 4 tablet in the list of installed languages are 2 English Languages: "English (Unated States)" and "English (Singaporе)".</p>
<p>I do not know, how the "Singapore" English appeared on my device. I was not able to delete this item from the list of installed languages.</p>
<p>Deleting with Regedit all strings in Registry, containing the substring "Singapore"&nbsp; gave no result :(
</p>
<p>I placed this language as the last item in languages panel, after that there appeared the possibility to delete the corresponding language pack</p>
<p>from my comp. This operation lasted very long, but when I restarted windows, I saw that Singapore was not removed from the list</p>
<p>of languages. My question is: is it possible to delete some language from the list, and if it is possible, how I can do this?</p>

<p>Hi Vlad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to assist you, can you confirm the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did you first notice that "English (Singapore)" was added in the list of installed language?</li><li>Are you referring to the keyboard language or Language Interface Pack?</li><li>When and where did you purchase your Surface Pro 4?</li><li>In the Language Panel, when "English (Singapore)" is highlighted, do you see a "Remove" button?</li><li>Can you send us the screenshot so that we can check your concern?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Trying to restore my computer to factory settings</h2>
                    
<p>When I go through the restore process and enter a disk to back up, my computer tells me that the "formatting" of the disk was unsuccessful. I'm using a "memorex" CD-R disk with 700mb. Is this the right kind of disk. If it is what do I do?<br />
Thanks all help is greatly appreciated.!<br />

            <br />
For any question re the&nbsp;Recovery to Factory Settings Process, you will have to ask the Computer Manufacturer.<br />
<br />
It is their Recovery Process, not Microsoft's.<br />
<br />
Each Manufacturer has their own way of doing it.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Here is general info on how to obtain Recovery media and/or use the Recovery Partition:</span></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.<br />
</span><span><br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Ask them if you can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

<p>Background-&nbsp; I am trying to install a new SSD in a computer I built 2 years ago.&nbsp; Considering this was my first build I can do a much better job installing the software I want to do a fresh install.&nbsp; Plus I will be running programs on the SSD and storing
 everything else on the old HD, besides my old partition is larger than the new SSD.&nbsp; I am using my original XP Home 32 bit OEM disk to load the OS from.&nbsp; I don't have problems with my computer nor have I had problems with the cd/dvd player.&nbsp; SSD was properly
 partitioned and formatted before I tried loading software.</p>

    <title>Skype 8.xx does not ring&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liket73  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype 8.xx does not ring&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like <strong>many</strong> other skype users, I have a headset for talking on skype, and speakers.</p>
<p>Skype for desktop classic (7.41) had an option to ring in a separate device. This makes all the sense in the world, because just like every telephone ever made for the last
<strong>100 years</strong>, when someone calls, the telephone <strong>rings out loud
</strong>so that you can hear it. </p>
<p>If the telephone had required you to stand there holding the handset to your ear at all times just so you can know if someone is calling, is positively asinine. If that was how telephones worked, the telephone would not have taken off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current version of skype (8.xx) inexplicably <strong>does not have this option.</strong> Nor does it have an API, or even user-selectable ringtones, either of which could have been used to form a workaround..</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, like many other users (because a simple google search tells me I'm not the only one to go WTF at this) I've stuck with the classic version.. 7.41. The one that rings, and thus the one that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So WHY in the name of I don't know what does it now <strong>prevent you from signing in, forcing you to upgrade to the new, broken skype for windows which does not allow RINGING??
</strong>Seriously, is this a joke? What kind of communications device <em>doesn't know how to ring</em><em>??</em> What use is it to ring only in a headset which OF COURSE I will not be wearing unless I'm talking?</p>
<p>Skype just became<em> useless.</em> It is beyond shameful that skype for desktop was allowed to expire
<em>before the new version was ready for prime-time. </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the love of god, please fix it. Having the phone ring in a separate device from the one you are talking on is the most obvious thing in the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>You are incorrect. The ability to ring to an additional device is located in the Skype 8.x desktop and Skype 14.x App settings (since 8.30 ~ Sep 12, 2018). There is nothing to fix in that regard. There is no support in the latest clients for the long discontinued
 Desktop API, which is incompatible with the newer Skype protocols.</p>

<p>Thanks for your response, Techfreak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your screenshot is <em>not</em> how it looked here, or I would not have posted, obviously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now figured out what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My workstation is running skype 7.40, and it's logged in, working great.</p>
<p>I just got a new surface pro, and I installed 7.40, which then refused to log in... so I installed 8.37, which
<em>did not</em> show the Ring on additional device option. As it turns out, the reason why it wasn't shown, is that my surface pro
<em>had</em> no additional devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, good on microsoft for finally putting that feature in (it wasn't there several months ago when I last tried skype 8.xx on my workstation). It might have made for better discoverability to have the "Ring on additional device" option present and grayed
 out, rather than completely missing on single-device systems, but fair enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plugged in a USB speaker to the surface pro, and the option is now there. I guess I'll bite the bullet and install 8.37 on my workstation -- no choice at this point.</p>

<h2>            Headphone jack isn&#39;t working.</h2>
                    I have windows 10. When i connect my headphones , there's no pop-up or anything. In sounds , i have just a thing , "Speakers/Headphones". I've update my realtek drivers. I don't know what to do anymore :)))).

            <p>No , I haven't , but I'm 100% sure that my headphones are working. They are working just fine on my phone , and I don't know what's the issue.</p>
<p>At the moment I don't have another pair to test , but as I searched on the internet for answers , I saw that there are alot of other guys struggling with the same issue. And they are saying that the W10 is the issue here.</p>

    <title>STOP forcing us to use CORTANA&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laddieervin  say:</h3>
<h2>            STOP forcing us to use CORTANA&#33;</h2>
                    <p>A new windows update and now MS is FORCING us to use Cortana. Who cares if we don't want to? The customer service reps will tell you "It's part of Windows now" - like that explains it. What is WRONG with the Product managers/Directors/VPS who are charged
 with making Windows better?&nbsp; Has Microsoft learned nothing from the disaster that was launching Xbox One with Connect in the box? Customers don't want to be FORCED to use, or pay for, features, software and hardware that they DON'T want.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I know there's money to be made in data mining, but at what cost?&nbsp; Consumer satisfaction be damned? When will MS learn? Why take away the OPTION to turn the feature off? certainly, it's not to make the consumer's experience better, regardless of what
 the paid customer service reps have been instructed to say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm using Windows on my work machine, I DO NOT need Cortana to pop up friendly messages asking me if I want help finding a restaurant. What I really need help with is how to turn Cortana off for good.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only ray of sunshine I got from the customer service rep when I contacted MS about this issue was: "if enough people complain, maybe they'll put the option back in in a future update."<br />
<br />
I have Windows Pro on one machine, so I can use GP Edit to turn Cortona off (allegedly). On my other machines, I'll have to edit the registry. Yeah, I know. MS says don't edit the registry, it could be bad. You don't want me to edit the registry? Why not stop
 forcing unwanted features on me and giving me no other option?<br />
<br />
I'm very unhappy about where windows is going. It seems like every update brings new totalitarian "features" that MS claims are "to make the Windows experience better." Yeah, better for them, at the expense of the consumer - not better for the users who find
 themselves having to play around in the registry because all other options have been eliminated.<br />

            On pc it is possible to nuke cortana, pc world has an article/guide. That's what I did on my only W10 pc (my other 3 will stay on W7). The i nvasiveness of MS really shows their PRISM side. Very Brave New World.

<p>I have v.1709 and I never see or hear anything from Cortana. I just went on the web and learned how to disable the extra features - Microsoft shows us how to do it - so now I use Cortana only to search locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, whenever I have a question or issue with Windows I go on the web and look for an answer. With experience you learn how to distinguish between sources that know what they're talking about and crackpots who post garbage. Then I take what I've learned,
 implement it, and go on with my life. This is much more satifying in the long run than busting my guts in public forums. With apologies to Billy Joel, I'd rather laugh with the saints than cry with the sinners.</p>

<p>In the last several years, particularly since Window 8 was squeezed out of MS's sphincter, I've not found a single Microsoft help page that was correct.&nbsp; I've also not received a single response for help from a Microsoft source that was correct.&nbsp; The problem
 is many of the help files are created with a program and other pages are just plain out of date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue isn't necessarily with "cortana", the issue is that people no longer trust MS.&nbsp; I used to blissfully use the latest version of whatever product I needed.&nbsp; Not anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS switched its programming environments to the .NET approach about 18 years ago.&nbsp; They still have not created any way to actually learn anything beyond the bare basics.&nbsp; I've tried several times to modernize my programming skills and get into using the
 .NET environment.&nbsp; I can find dozens of websites and books that cover the basics but NOTHING that goes beyond the basics.&nbsp; I've come to this very community to ask for help a number of times, the response is almost invariably a version of "you're an idiot,
 you the wizard".&nbsp; First using a wizard doesn't teach me anything, second, I most certainly can't tell my customers, "Oh, just use the wizard!".&nbsp; Usually this is accompanied by a lecture about how I'm wasting my time trying to "learn" what I'm trying to learn.<br />
<br />
I've even found a couple books written by long time IT professionals that are concerned that programmers are no longer being taught how to program, that programming courses in college are very basic, leaving potential graduates completely unprepared for the
 real world.</p>

            Cortana here doesn't make any extra actions.&nbsp; I use Cortana for reminders &amp; package delivery schedules.&nbsp; Occasionally I'll ask her, hows the weather by voice.&nbsp; I've set things up apparently so Cortana relays my android notifications, which works out nicely.
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I have the tips enabled but she never tips me.

<p>I have v.1709 and I never see or hear anything from Cortana. I just went on the web and learned how to disable the extra features - Microsoft shows us how to do it - so now I use Cortana only to search locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, whenever I have a question or issue with Windows I go on the web and look for an answer. With experience you learn how to distinguish between sources that know what they're talking about and crackpots who post garbage. Then I take what I've learned,
 implement it, and go on with my life. This is much more satifying in the long run than busting my guts in public forums. With apologies to Billy Joel, I'd rather laugh with the saints than cry with the sinners.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I completely get what you are saying.&nbsp; It's an approach I've used in the past.&nbsp; But I think the time has come for MS to start listening to customers.&nbsp; I shouldn't have to resort to Google every time Microsoft updates windows and I most certainly should not
 be forced to edit registry entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone to the database entries about me on MS's website and cleared them but those are only what they'll let me see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just sick of them shoving whatever piece of garbage they want onto my computer.&nbsp; I have apps that I don't even know what they do.&nbsp; Of course none of them have any helpful information included with them. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't have a cell phone or smart phone or ipad, I just have my two computers.&nbsp; I don't need them to sync and I don't need Microsoft keeping records about them.&nbsp; I don't have a Camera so I certainly don't need a "Camera App".&nbsp; The Calendar and a couple others
 might be useful but I'm certainly not going to log into a freaking Microsoft Account to use them.&nbsp; OneDrive is a constant annoyance, can't turn it off, though I've received two completely different completely inaccurate sets of instructions from MS on how
 to disable it.&nbsp; I now have two versions of OneNote on my computer.&nbsp; The instructions I received from MS to correct that problem were completely inaccurate.</p>

<h2>            Unable to block youtube using family safety</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Running Win10, I added a child to the family safety and attempted to block access to youtube. This does not prevent access to the site.</p>
<p>I tried blocking both http and https versions, however it doesn't actually block the site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see the attached screenshot</p>

<br />if so remove that update and see if that brings it back.

    <title>Windows 10 crackling sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 crackling sound</h2>
                    <p>I had to re-install my windows 10 Pro and i noticed that my sound was cracking, and i though downloading sound driver would help but after downloading all of my nvidia, asus and intel drivers i still could hear it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First i tough i had broken my headphones (HyperX Revolver S) which has a USB dongle.</p>
<p>So then i tested the sound on my laptop (Has windows 10 aswell) and it was fine, so my headset or the dongle is not the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then i started removing drivers and downloading them again and i still have the problem when i have the USB dongle in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every tip i have found on google and nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

                    <p>I have a PC running windows 10 enterprise th2 build 1511/10586</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is joined to a domain. The issue occurs in a Domain User Account with Standard User permissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First - The photo app kept on crashing after about 5 seconds of being launched.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i attempted to re-register the UWA's on the PC using ....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">(Admin: Powershell)<br />
<br />
This did not fix the issue ... so i attempted to do a user re-registration. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Get-AppxPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">(User Level Powershell)</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">After this i had lost many application ... Photos, store, video, maps, messenger had become all "Semi" registered. No Icons, and long packages names in the start menu - also none of them would launch.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">so i tried the Admin registration again... this time receiving my error for the first time ....&nbsp;Add-AppxPackage : Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80073CF6 ....&nbsp;Merge Failure : error 0x80070003 ... etc for the 5 apps. The rest
 of the UWA's were unaffected.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">At this point i followed -&gt;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/224798/how-to-uninstall-windows-10s-built-in-apps-and-how-to-reinstall-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/224798/how-to-uninstall-windows-10s-built-in-apps-and-how-to-reinstall-them/</a>&nbsp;and
 attempted to reinstalled the apps.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">This did not work either. Photo apps didn't even seem to be found by the Remove-AppxPackage ...&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Then i tried...</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Get-AppxPackage *photos* | Add-AppxPackage</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">This appeared to work but did not change anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I also tried to login with my username (domain administrator) and theses apps all worked (however the name was not correct). I then performed an all user registration again from admin Powershell, which fixed my profiles app names
 but did nothing to the other user account.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Doing research this issue has been around for a long time. How do i completely remove these applications, sideload the store app and then proceed to reinstall them like they never existed as i would do with a win32? or alternatively
 what other ways is there to repair a users installation of these applications? <br />
<br />
When are we going to get a stable fix for this issue as well... since this isn't the first time i have seen it and has existed since early betas.</p>

<h3> corvo314  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gears of War 2 code redeemed but not in library &#40;but can install&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I was recently given a code for Gears of War 2.&nbsp; I redeemed on my console (and it worked), but it doesn't appear in my "Ready to Install" list and if I go to the store page for it just says "You can play this game now or buy it to own forever".&nbsp; If I got
 into my MS account it doesn't even appear as under purchases as a redeemed code like they normally would; so it appears that somehow I can install it, but I don't own it.&nbsp; Can anyone explain this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding to the weirdness, I grabbed the (currently) free DLC for GoW2 within my console store, and if I look in my MS account page it's coming up that I own that but under PC games, not Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>RESOLVED:&nbsp; </strong>After a few days the game now appears in my "My Games" tab.&nbsp; Not sure what caused the delay, and still doesn't show in my Order History as a redeemed code however.</p>

            Xbox code (given away on the Xbox subreddit).&nbsp; And it's not showing up at all (I don't have game pass, or EA access), within console or checking my account online.&nbsp; The DLC is even weirder because I got that within the xbox store, on my xbox, but under
 my MS account it's listed as 'PC - DLC'

            I am in Australia, but Gears of War is sold here and my account has no age limitations on it.&nbsp; I did see another suggestion that it's just glitching because it's currently on a service Game Pass or EA access and the store is getting confused.

<p>With gears codes you have to be careful</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to remember that game codes tend to be region locked especially pronotional codes</p>
<p>It maybe available but it might not be the right code for your region</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes australia has one of the strictest content laws</p>
<p>When signing up for contests you should always check what region it is for and what region the promotion is running in</p>
<p>And yes there arw some promotions that are specific</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Remote Desktop Zoom not correct</h2>
                    <p>My windows 10 notebook has a very high DPI monitor. &nbsp;When I connect to one of the servers via remote desktop, the view will be very small and difficult to work with. &nbsp;So I zoom in at 150% and the size is good, but I lose access to part the the remote desktop.
 &nbsp;There are no scroll bars, I simply can not access part of the remote servers desktop. &nbsp;Also there is a problem it doesn't correctly detect where the mouse cursor is. &nbsp;If I click one place, the remote computer registers that click in another, as if there is
 a translation error. &nbsp;Changing the zoom back to 100% will allow me to see the full desktop again and will correct the mouse cursor location problem, but then it's very hard to work with. &nbsp;Images of what this looks like at 100 and 150% zoom attached. &nbsp;Notice
 how the task bar isn't visible when zoomed in. &nbsp;The window can not be scrolled or expanded further.</p>
