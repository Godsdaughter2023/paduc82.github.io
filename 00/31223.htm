<h2>            Advance Orders are not recognized</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p><p>I'm rewards-member since 09. January 2017. Since than I ordered in advance Halo Wars 2 (09 Jan. 2017), Ghost Recon Wildlands (15 Jan. 2017) and Mass Effect Andromeda (15 Jan. 2017). When I ordered Wildlands and Andromeda there already was one of three holes filled on my punch card (for Halo Wars, I guess). Since than there was only one hole added, although I ordered two additional games from your list. Please check my orders in advance and correct the punch card, so that I will get the rewards I deserve. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Quick Access&#58; Folder Name Change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikemontana70  say:</h3>
<h2>            Quick Access&#58; Folder Name Change</h2>
                    <p>I work for an institution that will not allow us to change folder names on our network drives. We use a standard format/naming contention for naming folders in the file pathways for each project. We just switched over to Windows 10 and now I see that my
 Favorites in File Explorer has been replaced by Quick Access. Because our folder organization/naming convention is standardized to let people find files on our network drive easily there are dozens of folders with the same name in each pathway for different
 projects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project A/Procurement/Contracts/2018</p>
<p>Project B/Procurement/Contracts/2018</p>
<p>Project C/Procurement/Contracts/2018</p>
<p>Project D/Procurement/Contracts/2018</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I drag the 2018 folder over for each of the four projects (A-D) into Quick Access they all appear with the same name, 2018. With Favorites I could rename the favorite without renaming the actual folder (which we are not authorized to do to prevent confusion
 among dozens of employees that access the multiple shared folders).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to rename the Quick Access folder names in a manner like Favorites used to do that I am not seeing? If not then Quick Access is worthless to me and anyone else that works for a large organization that cannot rename folders in their network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selecting "voicemail" will give you the same result. The website has been updated and change it from
<strong>Voice messaging to Voicemail. </strong>By the way, custom outgoing voice messages are no longer supported. Instead, Skype will use the default message for your app language.</p>

<p>I have a Skype Number from way back...for years, the voicemail feature worked well. &nbsp;But lately, it has stopped working. &nbsp;Now, when people call the number, they get a busy signal and no ability to leave a voice message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my settings...voice mail is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it's something on my side of the equation...it appears to be a system problem with Skype.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Skype Number is ringing busy, you probably need to adjust your privacy settings to allow incoming calls. Please follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Skype for Windows</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>In Skype select <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong></li><li>Click the Privacy tab, then under <strong>Allow calls to my Skype Number(s) from…</strong> select
<strong>anyone</strong>, and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If the privacy settings were already configured like this, complete the two steps below to refresh the settings.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Go back to the Privacy tab by selecting <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Options</strong> and change the privacy settings to allow calls to Skype Number(s) from
<strong>phone numbers in my Contact list only</strong> and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li><li>Wait approximately 5 minutes then open the privacy settings once more and change the setting back to
<strong>anyone</strong> and <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Skype for Mac</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>In Skype, go to <strong>Skype</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>
Privacy</strong></li><li>Under <strong>Receive calls to my Skype Number from</strong>, select <strong>
Anyone</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If the privacy settings were already configured like this, complete the two steps below to refresh the settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go back to the Privacy tab by selecting <strong>Skype</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt;
<strong>Privacy</strong> and change the privacy settings to allow calls to your Skype Number from
<strong>Only people in my contact list</strong></li><li>Wait approximately 5 minutes then open the privacy settings once more and change the setting back to
<strong>Anyone</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

                    <p>I recently installed Windows 10. &nbsp;I am sometimes required to have Administrator permissions before I can do something, e.g. when for instance seeking to file software files under Program Files, and wish to be able to do so without the present built-in obstructions.
 &nbsp;How do I (permanently) establish Administrator permission whenever I am using my computer, and having done so can I then exercise my Administrator rights without first logging out of my 'ordinary' account (ie the one in my name) and then logging in to the
 Administrator account? &nbsp;A step-by-step answer suitable for the non-technically-savvy would be appreciated! &nbsp;Thank you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posted this as a new question, despite the website's constant nudging to look at the backlog of existing answers, as all or most existing answers on this topic seem to relate to earlier versions of Windows, not Wiindows 10, and I can't spend the rest
 of my life searching through the Microsoft Community website on the offchance that there may be something there that might be relevant to my question.</p>

            It's possible I'm being slow, but I cannot see how Abdul-Malik's reply is relevant to the question I put. &nbsp;I was not reporting a system breakdown, corrupted file or malfunction. &nbsp;I was asking for advice (if you like, a lesson in how to use Windows 10 correctly)
 on how I sign on as administrator, rather than as 'William Longland', and then how (or whether) I can 'retain' this administrator status permanently even when using my ordinary 'William Longland' account, so that if for instance I decide to download a piece
 of security software or some other app I can place the downloaded files in a place of my choosing, not one selected by the Windows software, and thereby avoid the dreaded 'You do not have permission' response that so often crops up in these circumstances.
 &nbsp;How do I obtain 'permission' to act as administrator when I am the administrator? &nbsp;

            I too have been searching for this answer - no one will address it directly! I also want to eliminate the sign-in with a password, but for some reason MS is very evasive. Over all of my decades with MS, I have found that there is ALWAYS a way to do a thing,
 however, getting an answer from "support" is rarely the place to find it. Do post if you find a solution....

<p>William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>[You were right to dismiss the first reply as irrelevant.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is designed to work the way you are experiencing.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>When an Admin user logs in, it is given the same rights as a Standard user.&nbsp; </li><li>The Admin prompts you are referring to are there so that specific processes can be given "elevated" permission [Admin permission] to proceed.&nbsp;
</li><li>You do not need to log out of anything or back in to anything, you are simply authorising that specific process [such as an installation].</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you are logged in to an Admin account, the Admin prompt looks like this and you just click on the Yes button if you want to approve the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28c43618-ba92-4020-9872-2758aed5ddb9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28c43618-ba92-4020-9872-2758aed5ddb9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are logged in to a Standard account, the Admin prompt looks like this and you have to select the name of an Admin account &amp; enter its password then click on the Yes button to approve the process.&nbsp; If the different users were really different people,
 an Admin account holder would have to walk over to the computer to enter the info.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62371e7b-d7ce-4283-850b-440e60db2316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/62371e7b-d7ce-4283-850b-440e60db2316" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Admin prompts appear when the process being run needs to alter something that affects other users.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">You can alter the level slightly without endangering your computer - see Control panel, User accounts, Change user account control settings [UAC].</p>
<ul>
<li>As you will see there, you can have UAC at its highest level to include changes to Windows settings triggering the Admin prompt routine or you can have it at its second highest level [default] if you are not fussed about changes to Windows settings.</li><li>The two lowest settings make it easier for online hackers to get into your computer and start running their own installations without you even noticing.</li><li>I would urge you never to be connected to the internet if you had UAC at its lowest setting, which is turned off.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">It is the whole set of security improvements that have established Windows 10 as a pretty secure OS but UAC is a significant part of it [even though it was actually invented just for the convenience of office admins [<em>who got fed
 up having to log into their colleagues' computers every time something needed to be set up</em>].</p>

<p>Tori,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have not found the answer.&nbsp; There are serious ramifications of what you are doing that your linked webpage does not bother to explain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Built-In Admin account you have enabled is a recovery tool and cannot be used for day-to-day computing.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike its equivalent in Windows 7, the Windows 10 Built-In Admin account has its capabilities deliberately restricted.</li><li>If you keep using it for day-to-day computing then it is exposed to the risk of user profile corruption which would stop it being able to act in its recovery role.</li><li>Everything you need to do can be done in an Admin account of your own creation but that is not true of the Built-In Admin account.</li></ul>

            <p>Sadly not so helpful, neither were the live Microsoft help phone &nbsp;people who were only there to sell new solutions/software and support&nbsp;( or was is it more of the same )</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deduce that windows live mail is being made to fail when you upgrade. Sadly wherever my calendar was, the data has disappeared. And now because I cant find help it seems my email account has also stopped working. So syncing is not occurring properly.</p>
<p>It all went wrong when I was pushed to choose a new login live&nbsp;password to link everything up, it didn't work and it all fell apart.</p>
<p>I have probably mucked up some of the settings as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps this is punishment for buying a new PC and a brand new W10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I concluded that there is no alternative but to use the Mail and calendar app in the start menu. Unfortunately it wont sync I presume I don't understand the jargon properly where can I get some real help with my new product so that it can do what it was
 bought for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is for all&nbsp;devices my family use to&nbsp; keep up to date with messages, contact info and&nbsp;calendars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a very long and loyal user of Microsoft operating systems and am beginning to wonder&nbsp; what I can I do to get some honest and simple support.&nbsp;I am&nbsp;very very frustrated with all the wasted time and lack of success.</p>
<p>HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Posted a little later that day</p>
<p>
</p><p>After discussion with my wife we have between us &nbsp;managed to make some progress.</p>
<p>We have got both our&nbsp; emails to work in Mail, and we have set up the calendar accounts.
</p>
<p>We cannot set up accounts for People as the account settings are saying both accounts have a red attention required notice and error code 0x85010014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The calendars are not actually syncing already entered data between devices. People&nbsp;addresses are not visible and are not available to mail out activities.</p>
<p>There seems to be no delete account within people in order to start again. there is no function box&nbsp;appearing for entering the data required to sync for telling people account&nbsp; where to sync etc.</p>
<p>Classically not ready for use. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole system of setting up accounts within mail, calendar and people&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp; somewhat bizarre&nbsp; and incredibly difficult to understand or get right&nbsp;.&nbsp; Instructions making sense not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We eventually realised that the account box was intended for all 3 apps (combined for MAIL and CALENDAR) thus needing 3 separate accounts entered&nbsp; and also 1 for each per both of us to link together. 6 in total.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finding the server or providers identity all extremely confusing for us simple punters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to top it all we had to work this all out for ourselves. is it meant to be a Mensa type activity????? and to top it all the experts in the help desk could only revert to lets sell you something different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Common Microsoft&nbsp; this is not the way to succeed. </p>

            <p>I have read firedog and much more and &nbsp;nothing relates to the info/help I need.</p>
<p>simply</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone has my people contacts but is not syncing with my PC any more , but the calender is no longer syncing with my wifes calender entries and neither is her syncing happening either.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I know live mail is said to be unsupported. but it does provide me with my e-mails and has all my contacts but in triplicate all listed as from address book. So where is the contact data&nbsp;coming from ie which 3 places and how do I simplify that. It has to
 be in my Microsoft account but I cant find function to enable this. Isuspect that now I have updated to the new windows live account and resubmitted a new password the sync function will cease.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People app has no contacts but says it knows 2 accounts ( mine and my wifes) but I do not know what the account should be called or where to find it.&nbsp; I cant delete the accounts in settings as no function button ? I can set upo accounts but I have no idea
 whether it is outlook, Exchange, google,&nbsp; I cloud or advanced&nbsp;. Again no link or help in my Microsoft account.The account say the need attention and syncing produces error 0x85010014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Calendar app has not synced with my old p|C data and now there appears to be no syncing with my Windows phone either. Manage account is confusing as I don't know what to change my mail box settings to or which server it would run from .Change account refers
 me to my Microsoft account and I can't find any thing to assist in any shape or form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mail app</p>
<p>&nbsp;has my e-mails but no contact dat so I can t use it to send emails to any of my contacts as I can't look them up in people .</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this looks like it is a setting up issue inside Microsoft account. I cant make a decision to migrate to new apps</p>
<p>until they work as expected. I suspect windows live mail&nbsp; and all the apps will work properly and sync once the sync/account issue is resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get help please&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Post script</p>
<p>Have now spoken to help desk again and after 1 and half hrs it was accepted that the problem was real and complex and that a Microsoft level 2 operative should be involved. A phone session has been booked.</p>
<p>I believe the problems are all related to differences in&nbsp; function&nbsp;between&nbsp; POP and IMAP and the complexities of setting up of accounts with the new logon id/Microsoft account with both multi app function and sync capability.</p>
<p>I have no doubt it can be fixed eventually.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I thought I would let you know the outcome to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After nearly 2 days with a help person (&nbsp;Level 2) the problems were not properly&nbsp;resolved. A lot of time was spent reloading W10 and downloading updates and checking the system. Operative eventually gave up. Not willing or allowed to work on devices other
 than a PC and didn't accept that the problems were in the setting up of accounts within Mail, Contacts and Calendar apps, which he appeared not to understand.</p>
<p>During the process I deduced that the mail problems were solved by changing from Pop to Imap. This was a system new&nbsp;requirement forced by the new&nbsp;Microsoft sign on. I have managed to finally get Live mail and Mail to sync and keep e-mails up to date across
 devices and for my wife as well.&nbsp;All without the help of an expert!!!!</p>
<p>My Calendar and my wife's calendar has lost&nbsp;most or all entries and I expect to get help with this from a call back from support tomorrow 20th Dec. The problem is with setting up of accounts, terminology and getting the sync&nbsp;set up.</p>
<p>Contacts are all present in the people app, but live mail has each contact in triplicate. I am trying to understand from where Live mail syncs contacts arrive and to determine which to delete. I am unsure whteher any syncing is occurring at present.</p>
<p>Mail doesn't dynamically pick up a contact with a new e-mail , but does in our Tablet,&nbsp;It doesn't seem to be able to offer to manage a list of blocked e-mails. It is therefore not useful as a replacement for Live mail.</p>
<p>One of life's problems in todays world is being bombarded with non requested,&nbsp;advertising , phone calls and fraudulent phishing attempts by email&nbsp;to&nbsp;aquire your data. Managing or keeping these people away&nbsp; is vital and is additional to a security defender
 etc..</p>
<p>I am a retired home user and don't wish to spend the money on Outlook 2016, which was&nbsp;one of the less useful solutions offered by support desk who don't offer&nbsp; support on Live mail&nbsp;although according to the website that shouldn't end until January 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue of setting up of accounts within the 3 apps People, Mail and Calendar is very confusing and it is &nbsp;very difficult to stumble upon the correct combination. The auto generation of account names is confusing the form box headings are not app specific.</p>
<p>I have no idea what type of account relates to which app. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I only hope that someone from Microsoft reads this and attends to the issues, I am willing to assist if asked for further&nbsp;explanation, but would hate for other people to have to go through this. A real potential turn off, even&nbsp;when the current new W10 is
 really so comprehensively clever.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>27th Dec Update reply to query as to have I solved this yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately no, I have learnt a lot but still no solution there has been 3 long sessions with phone support at level 2, and I session with level 3, and today I hope that after another level 3&nbsp;session the problems may be solved or at least there will be
 a complete understanding of the that have issues that have emerged. There is an open case no 1365941411 for those reading this&nbsp;that have&nbsp;access to the support&nbsp;history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion this is a complex multi device, multi app,&nbsp;syncing issue exacerbated by the new approach to the new logon id not being covered with adequate basic user friendly instructions and backed up with properly robust and working server routines and
 error codes are not delivering enough clues as to "what to do now info". Even the early&nbsp;support operatives found the whole subject outside their abilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in hope still but as yet no solution.</p>

            <p>27th Update. Still no overall progress,&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft support operative ran out of time and we have agreed to reconvene on morning of 3rd Jan. Although progress has been made with demonstration and&nbsp;understanding of the several manifestations of&nbsp; the problems
 , a solution is not yet immediately&nbsp;obvious. The causes of the issues are not immediately obvious either.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pause in activity will allow for&nbsp;behind the scenes examination of the problems and opportunity to construct and propose a solution.</p>
<p>I am content that the careful progression will allow an eventual&nbsp;resolution from which will emerge learning points for others who may come across the same problems.</p>

            <p>13th Jan Update. There Still ongoing&nbsp;work to complete&nbsp;on the various problems. There has been much activity and obvious system&nbsp;changes and improvements behind the scenes as well as introduction to&nbsp;practical&nbsp;tools for self management&nbsp;of my app settings .
 Hands on remote Assistance has been supplied to clean up data caused by earlier system corruptions. I am most pleased with the level of attention and willingness to address the issues that have emerged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fully expect full and complete resolution within next 24 hours. The original case no&nbsp; was 1365941411
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone reading this. Hardware is 1 PC (new), 1 Laptop, I tablet, 1&nbsp;W8.1 Microsoft Lumia phone&nbsp;535, and 1 W10 Microsoft Lumia phone 550. My wife and I share mail, people and calendar on the different devices&nbsp; with separate accounts.</p>
<p>After the recent Windows logonid changes (I believe the major contribution to my woes)</p>
<p>There has also been&nbsp; significant updates across devices. More work is still occurring to correct my people files to be able to share corrected data accurately&nbsp; across my&nbsp;&nbsp;devices&nbsp;. This &nbsp;has involved uploading corrected data directly to the&nbsp;server with hands
 on Microsoft assistance&nbsp;( My individual people entries had been multiplied by 4 and had brought in old deleted records a real mess grew to approx &nbsp;1000 records)</p>
<p>I now have a working; Windows Live mail using POP3; also Mail;, People; and Calendar all&nbsp;syncing .
</p>
<p>A ghost Outlook account has been required for both of us which works along the Microsoft account.</p>
<p>Although I now&nbsp; superficially understand how to use the component parts of the solution and how the accounts now work, as well as how to manage them and the various settings.&nbsp; I feel that the process to a solution has been complex and difficult to grasp.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I can probably maintain it but I couldn't set it all up from scratch.</p>
<p>I am never the less extremely pleased with the progressing outcome which is very nearly sorted.</p>

            <p>15th Jan update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite my optimism of the 13th and after several hours of work ( for me late into the evening)&nbsp;on 13th still no final resolution and my leval3 operative is now off on leave till 23rd Jan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-establishing the phones into original working state with all apps and settings&nbsp; on our 2 phones took us several hours of work after a full reset was undertaken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pleased to advise that Calendar is now working satisfactorily across all my devices and is useable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Live mail. working on POP is providing e-mails, but the contacts are in a total mess, with records in quadruplicate which include old record data. So restorative work has failed nearly 300 useable contact records have repopulated to 1249.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People. despite having been cleaned and replaced with accurate up to date&nbsp;data , this still seems to be syncing incorrectly, indvidual records&nbsp; have grown from duplicates&nbsp;as expected to 3 when alterations are made and then the whole 3 records are then duplicated
 again as a separate linked entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mail appears to be delivering e mails satisfactorily, but stopped&nbsp;inexplicably on my phone last night. other devices all okay.</p>
<p>The way that People contacts work with Mail is less than satisfactory and not acceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shall continue to use this method of&nbsp; reporting what is happening as I have no other sensible method of providing relevant feed back other than when the level 3 operative is able to ring me. I am expecting him to call again on 23rd Jan.</p>
<p>The case 1365941411 remains open still not fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone is watching this saga please let me know that you find this method of providing information of use and that I am not wasting my time.</p>

            <p>20th Jan update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware that subtle changes have occurred behind the scenes, which lead me to deduce that work is being undertaken on the systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to previous posts and the way that the outlook accounts are now&nbsp;behaving and presenting synced data within</p>
<p>2 Apps Namely Calendar and Mail. I have been able to delete and&nbsp;reinstate accounts&nbsp;on he 2 apps and harmonise the content across devices (Pc, Laptop, Tablet a W8.1 and a W10 phone.) My wife and I can now share and sync&nbsp;the content of our accounts across
 all devices on these apps satisfactorily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Live mail is presenting all&nbsp; e-mails satisfactorily&nbsp;using POP for us both (used only on Pc and Laptop) , but contacts despite&nbsp; all efforts so far, are getting worse and syncing is compounding the duplications which are also showing up in People.</p>
<p>In live mail entries are now increased to x 4 per entry and the record count is up to 1250 and should be nearer c 300.</p>
<p>some are records that have not updated and are therefore old records.</p>
<p>In People each contact is shown x2 probably because it comes from 2 different accounts but within each account the source for editing is x 3. We can deduce that old records are appearing from previous edits and this affects what is seen accurately as the
 record. So this side of things still not working.</p>
<p>On my phone each People entry shows&nbsp;once but the data content can be multiplied i.e 2 addresses, and edit indicates 4 different records.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacts and People and Syncing still need attention and I expect analysis between myself and my level 3 person will enable understanding of the issue. I believe the problem resides in the setup/use of the outlook/microsoft &nbsp;account and the way that syncing
 is handled between various apps. So change may required in the way accounts are set up and used and the recognition within the data of which is the latest record and the method of turning off the old records. My wife and I&nbsp;may be better to use a single account
 for this data and share that rather than try to have 2 different accounts across apps and devices.&nbsp; At present it is a muddle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume from the changing view count at the top of this item that it is being read by interested parties.</p>

<p>I have tried every solution that has been posted and I still can't stay connected to xbox live. I just now got this status code that came up 7fffffff-00000000-00000000</p>

<h2>            Trouble with Minecraft cross platform...</h2>
                    <p>I recently started playing Minecraft PE&nbsp;with my friend on a realm he created on his Xbox One. I also have Minecraft on my computer (Mac) and Xbox 360. I found out that it was only cross platform from Xbox One, Mobile, Nintendo Switch, and PC. I only have my phone and PC out of those options. But I wasn't&nbsp;able to find a way&nbsp;to sign in with my Xbox Live account on the computer version. Is it because I'm on a Mac?</p>

            <p>As I understand the question, you are wondering if the reason why you can't see your friends Minecraft realm, recently created on xbox one, is because you are using a mac. I do nto believe this is the case. I think the reason you are having trouble is a conflict of edition and not really hardware. The minecraft now being played on xbox and pocket edition is based on what is called the bedrock version of minecraft. I can only assume that the version you are running on your pc (mac) is the Java edition. If you check the version you are running on people and compare it to the version on your pc, I believe you will find your problem. Hope this helped.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to download from one site using any browser</h2>
                    <p>I use PlayOn app on my Windows 10 PC and have used it for sometime now. I have developed some issues to which support has advised me to download an updated file (playon dot tv/getplayon) Not any of browsers will allow the file to be downloaded. I even booted
 into safe mode with networking, without any change. Tried Chrome, Edge, Vivaldi, Firefox. Disabled windows firewall, etc. No success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be caused by a download restriction itself. To help you resolve the issue, try resetting the browsers and see if it helps. For resetting Edge to default, follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to<strong> Settings,</strong> select <strong>Apps </strong>then click<strong> Apps &amp; features.
</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> from the list, click it then click <strong>
Advanced options</strong> link.</li><li>Click the <strong>Repair</strong> button. If repairing did not work, then try the
<strong>Reset </strong>button instead. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For resetting Internet Explorer, refer to this article: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/923737/how-to-reset-internet-explorer-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to reset Internet Explorer Settings</a></strong><strong>.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, and if you can download files from other sites, then try contacting the website support itself as it may be an internal issue of the website that's why you cannot download from it.
</p>
<p>

            I have tried all these approaches with no success. Why it won't work across any browser even in safe mode with security turned off yet I can download most anything else from most any other site. (no other failures that I recall.) I guess I will try to
 download it to a USB drive from another computer at a library, etc. Thanks to everyone who tried to help though.

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Where can I download Windows 10?</span></strong></p>
<p>You can upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 by going to the Windows 10 Software Download page to download the Media Creation Tool. The Media Creation Tool can be used to create a USB or DVD media to upgrade your current PC to Windows
 10 or install Windows 10 on a different PC.<br />
</p>
<p>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</a>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> When upgrading to Windows 10 from media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to perform a clean install, you must have upgraded to Windows 10 previously. Performing
 a clean install of Windows 10 with media without upgrading to Windows 10 is not supported and will have activation issues.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player Plays Videos Haltingly &#40;Windows XP SP3&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Please help me.</p>
<p>Before this afternoon, I was a happy man enjoying my videos using Windows Media Player 11.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">While I was using another software, my&nbsp;notebook&nbsp;"froze"</span>, that is, an hour glass appeared and stayed there and my&nbsp;notebook&nbsp;would
 not respond to any clicking of my mouse.&nbsp; Not wanting to wait forever,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I forced a restart by pressing and holding down the power key</span>.&nbsp; As a result of this restart, Windows XP SP3&nbsp;checked my hard drive for consistency,
 which took about two hours, and discovered some bad clusters which Windows dealt with.</p>
<p>Then the usual login screen appeared.&nbsp; I entered my password and the first sign of trouble showed up.&nbsp; Normally Windows will play a short tune soon after I log into my account.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This time, it still played the short
 tune but with pauses.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Next, when I tried to use Windows Media Player to play a video, the video played haltingly, that is, there would be pauses at short intervals.</span>&nbsp; Before this, the same video played perfectly using Windows Media
 Player.&nbsp; I tried playing other videos and I encountered the same problem.&nbsp; These other videos had also been played without problems using Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>I restarted my notebook a few times and the same problem persisted&nbsp;&nbsp; But when I tried to play those videos using another video player, they played fine except for one.</p>
<p>Windows normally plays a short tune when it is shutting down.&nbsp; Windows still plays that short tune without pauses.</p>
<p>What have I tried ?&nbsp; I have run a full system scan using Norton Antivirus 2010 but nothing bad was detected.&nbsp; I have rolled back from Windows Media Player 11 to Windows Media Player 8 but the problem is still there.&nbsp; I have run the DirectX diagnostic tool
 for DirectX 9.0c and there seemed to be no problem.</p>

======================================================<br />
No doubt...I could be incorrect but I still think it's overheating. Video is CPU intensive.<br />

<h2>            Photo Stream not updating to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    All of my iCloud Photo Sharing albums appear and populate / update quickly, however the Photo Stream folder&nbsp;itself has always been and &nbsp;is currently empty and never updates with any photos.&nbsp; I suspect a directory / path problem however cannot find any

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description, I understand that Photo Stream folder does not update and is empty on your Windows 8.1 computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Which version of iCloud is currently installed on your computer?</li><li>Has this issue started recently or ever since you installed Windows 8.1 on this computer?</li></ol>
<p><span><span>Let's try these steps below and check if that helps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Log out of iCloud and uninstall it.</span></li><li><span>Open <strong>Computer</strong> and then open your C:\ drive.&nbsp; Go to <strong>
Tools/Folder Options</strong> and click on the <strong>View</strong> tab.&nbsp; Select the “<strong>Show hidden…</strong>” radio button and click on
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Open the <strong>Users</strong> folder.</span></li><li><span>Open <strong>your</strong> user folder</span></li><li><span>Open <strong>ProgramData</strong> (previously hidden folder)</span></li><li><span>Open the <strong>Apple</strong> folder – <em>not the Apple Computer folder</em>.</span></li><li><span>Open the <strong>Installer Cache</strong> folder</span></li><li><span>In <strong>Details</strong> view sort on <strong>Name</strong></span></li><li><span>Open the folder for the newest entry for <strong>iCloud Control Panel.</strong></span></li><li><span>Right click on<strong> iCloud64.msi</strong> and select Install.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>When finished, the synching between iCloud and your PC&nbsp;should be back to working perfectly as before.&nbsp; The pictures&nbsp;should be synched to the same Photostream folder as before the “upgrade”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. Please let us know the results. feel free to write us back for any further assistance with Windows, we'll be glad to assist you.

<h2>            Stuck on Aptio Setup Utilities screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past couple of months, my Samsung laptop has been acting difficult. When I boot the laptop, it first starts with a
<strong>clicking noise coming from the left side of the laptop.</strong> After 8 or 12 clicks, it stops and "tries" to load the start up screen, but
<strong>then it goes directly to the APTIO SETUP UTILITIES screen.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tired to exit out of the screen, but it just keeps coming back. I've also tried the F10 option (Save and Exit), which it then goes through the process of trying to reboot, but then taking me BACK to the APTIO SETUP screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't report this earlier because sometimes the laptop will boot normally, but this APTIO screen problem has been happening over and over--</p>

    <title>When running MKV files in Media Player 12, the NEXT and PREVIOUS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sir glame  say:</h3>
<h2>            When running MKV files in Media Player 12, the NEXT and PREVIOUS buttons do not work</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 64-bit. When running AVI or MKV files on Media Player 12, the NEXT and PREVIOUS buttons are not lit up and do not work. I cannot fast forward or rewind by pressing them. In particular, when I run MKV files, the SEEK bar does not even
 work, and trying to skip ahead in a movie just results in it jumping back to the start again.</p>
<p>I have tried downloading the Media Player Codec pack but that does not fix the problem. Is there anything I can do to get MKV and AVI to run properly on WMP12???</p>
<p>HELP!!!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Josh.</p>

<h3> rowankeller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 says it has been activated on another device after I received my pre-built desktop.</h2>
                    I received a pre-built, new desktop from newegg, and when I got it, it tells me that I cannot activate windows because the product key is being used on another device. I do not have the original product key, so I cannot try to enter it again and I do not
 want to buy windows again because I have already paid for it, is there anything I can do?

            The best way would be to contact Newegg and ask for a replacement or a refund.
<br />Microsoft would usually say they have no liability for a license purchased through 3rd Party website.

<p>I am having problem. As most of the time, I find that this setup program wlsetup-custom.exe appears whenever I run my messenger. The computer automatically tries to download this program without my consent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, what can I do to stop this form happening from now onward? Please suggest me to your earliest.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to let you know that Skype Metro is no longer supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was already replaced by the Skype for desktop application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you uninstall Skype Metro and instead, download the Skype for desktop from this link:

<h3> jeremy s k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupted user profile in windows 7,I am unable to copy corrupted files to a new profile</h2>
                    This is the advice given to create a new user profile:<br />
<br />
<div>
To create a new user profile
<div>
<div>
<p>To create a new profile, you must first create a new user account. When the account is created, a profile will also be created.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open User Accounts by clicking the <span>
Start</span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_47.png" />,
 clicking <span>Control Panel</span>, clicking <span>User Accounts and Family Safety</span> (or clicking
<span>User Accounts</span>, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking
<span>User Accounts</span>, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking
<span>User Accounts</span>.</span> </p>
<span>User Accounts</span>.</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <span>Manage another account</span>. <span>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_41.png" />&nbsp;If you are
 prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <span>Create a new account</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click
<span>Create Account</span>. </p>
<span>Create Account</span>. </p>
</li></ol>
</div>
</div>
To copy files to the new user profile
<div>
<p>After you create the profile, you can copy the files from the existing profile. You must have at least three user accounts on the computer to complete these steps, including the new account you just created.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Log on as a user other than the new user you just created or the user that you want to copy files from.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Open Documents by clicking the <span>
Start</span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_47.png" />,
 and then clicking <span>Documents</span>.</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>Tools</span> menu, and then click <span>
Folder Options</span>.</p>
<p>If you don't see the Tools menu, press ALT.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>View</span> tab, click <span>
Show hidden files and folders</span>, clear the <span>Hide protected operating system files</span> check box, and then click
<span>OK</span>.</p>
<span>OK</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Locate the <span>C</span>:\Users\<span>Old_Username</span> folder, where
<span>C</span> is the drive that <span>
<span>C</span> is the drive that <span>
Windows</span> is installed, and <span>Old_Username</span> is the name of the profile you want to copy files from.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select all of the files and folders in this folder, except the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ntuser.dat </p>
</li><li>
<p>Ntuser.dat.log</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ntuser.ini </p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>Edit</span> menu, and then click <span>
Copy</span>.</p>
<p>If you don't see the Edit menu, press ALT.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Locate the <span>C</span>:\Users\<span>New_Username</span> folder, where
<span>C</span> is the drive that <span>
<span>C</span> is the drive that <span>
Windows</span> is installed, and <span>New_Username</span> is the name of the new user profile you created.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>Edit</span> menu, and then click <span>
Paste</span>.</p>
<p>If you don't see the Edit menu, press ALT.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Log off, and then log back on as the new user.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Unfortunately I am unable to copy the corrupted user files to the new profile because my user profile is corrupted and says that i don't have the administative privaleges to perform that action. Please advise?<br />
</p>

    <title>Lexmark Z23 printer driver for Windows Vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> damcdona  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lexmark Z23 printer driver for Windows Vista</h2>
                    I have a Lexmark Z23 printer that, apparently, is not compatible with Vista Home Basic and my Dell Vostro 1510.&nbsp; It worked well with XP, but does not work with Vista.&nbsp; Do I have to throw the nearly new printer out, or can it be made to work with Vista?&nbsp;
<br />
I have already downloaded two driver files from the Lexmark website that are supposed to help, (lcZ2300en32 and cjZ2300en32) but my computer does not recognize the new drivers on my desktop.&nbsp; The Lexmark software works up until it says "connect the USB cable
 from the printer" whereupon Windows takes over and says that IT is trying to find the drivers.&nbsp; (I accept the option to let Windows try to install the drivers since the Lexmark software seems to freeze at this point.) Once the&nbsp;USB to the printer&nbsp;is connected,
 nothing further happens until Windows pops up a box in a minute or so&nbsp;that&nbsp;says that it located the software but encountered an error and could not install it,&nbsp;explaining that&nbsp;"This operation requires an interactive window station."
<br />
I am only barely computer literate, so if anyone can help, please make your instructions very specific.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, <br />

            Unfortunately, if Lexmark has not written Vista Compatible Drivers for your Model Printer, there is nothing you can do to rectify the problem.<br />
<br />
All Hardware Manufacturers write the Driver for their Hardware, not Microsoft.<br />
<br />
It is up to them whether they write them, or not, for older Model Printers, Scaners, etc.<br />
<br />
If it does not work with the last Drivers that they wrote(XP), it is time to buy a new Printer.<br />
<br />
Cheers.

                    As a long term user of Microsoft Money and now Money Sunset Delux I am keen to learn if the programme will still work on the imending Windows 10? I would be happy to resume paying for Money, as for me, this is the 'Killer App' which keeps me on the Windows
 platform. Does anyone esle out there still use Money? How can we get this fantastic Personnal Finance software continued? or, Have you found a realisticly alternative application?

<p>
</p><p>I am back from a work trip, and I played around with a few settings.&nbsp; I can now get Money Sunset Edition to run in the Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 9879.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the Compatibility settings:</p>
