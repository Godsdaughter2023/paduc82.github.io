    <title>Issues with Globe Tattoo Mobile Broadband and WIndows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues with Globe Tattoo Mobile Broadband and WIndows 8</h2>
                    I am having issues with my Globe Tattoo Broadband in Windows 8. It has been OK yesterday. But after the third attempt trying to dodge my daughter on hammering the keyboard, I can no longer connect to the internet with the Tattoo Stick. I am now high-jacking
 my friends lappy just to post this question. The problem is, whenever I inserted the Stick, Win8 hangs.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have done basic Win8 troubleshooting:</div>
<div>1) sfc /scannow tells no problem;&nbsp;</div>
<div>2) disk check utility tells no problem;&nbsp;</div>
<div>3) uninstalling and reinstalling Globe Tattoo Broadband software ok but did not solve the problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div>4) checking compatibility, it is still adjucted to the previous settings for Win7</div>
<div>5) complete virus scan using Windows Defender tells no virus.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also do some drastic troubleshooting method, though most of them did not work well.</div>
<div>1) System Restore: It won't allow, in fact all restore points have been lost.&nbsp;</div>
<div>2) Refresh won't work.
</div>
                </div>

            Hi,
<div><br />
Thanks for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You have mentioned that you are unable to connect to the internet with the Globe tattoo broadband dongle even though it was working fine earlier. Don’t worry’ we’ll help you with this issue.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Just a few questions first, to get a clear picture of the issue;<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) What exactly happened before the broadband stopped working?<br />
2) Does the computer recognize the dongle when you insert it?<br />
3) What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
4) Do you get any error message?<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since the computer hangs after you insert the disc, it seems that you are facing this issue due to some hardware issue with the dongle or some incorrect internet settings. I would suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Internet connection troubleshooter</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>The Internet connection troubleshooter can detect and fix errors and incorrect settings with internet connections. I would suggest you to run this built-in troubleshooter by referring to these steps:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Press Windows key +X, select Control panel<br />
b) Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons<br />
c) Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel<br />
d) Run the Internet connections troubleshooter.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Disable Security software</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>If you have installed any third party security software like antivirus or firewall, I would suggest you to temporarily disable it and check.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong></div>
<div>I would also suggest you to check the steps mentioned in this link and check:<br />
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/cant-connect-to-internet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/cant-connect-to-internet</a><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 4: Install latest firmware</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>I would also suggest you to install the latest firmware for the broadband stick and check. You can download the firmware from here:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://tattoo.globe.com.ph/tools/tattoo-software-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tattoo.globe.com.ph/tools/tattoo-software-upgrade</a>

<div>Hope this helps. Please get back to us with the status of the issue so that we can help you accordingly.<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span>As Suzanne S. Barnhill MVP has suggested you can check the mouse settings as mentioned by her.</span></p>
<p><span>To change how the mouse buttons work</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 Mouse Properties by clicking the&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span> button, and then clicking&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Control

 and then click&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Mouse</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the&nbsp; <span>Buttons</span> tab, and then do the following:</span></p>
<p><span>To swap the functions of the right and left mouse buttons, under&nbsp;<span>Button configuration</span>, uncheck the box for “<span>Switch primary and secondary
 buttons</span>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 OK.</span></p>
<p><span>This will switch the primary button function to the left button of the mouse.</span></p>

    <title>Name resolution fails when using multiple static IPs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tech.kyle.st  say:</h3>
<h2>            Name resolution fails when using multiple static IPs</h2>
                    When multiple static IPs are set on my only Ethernet adapter, name resolution fails most of the time in both directions. It does occasionally work, but that seems to be only when I can trick it in to returning the correct IP for a particular subnet (changing
 the order of IPs in the config?).<br />
<br />
The Ethernet adapter's IPv4 settings (which I'll refer to as PC-1, Win8) are typically as follows:<br />
IP: 192.168.15.180/24<br />
IP: 192.168.1.254/24<br />
IP: 169.254.1.1/16<br />
Gateway: 192.168.15.1<br />
<br />
Checking name resolution from another PC (which I'll refer to as PC-2, Win7) on the 192.168.15.0 subnet via ping often returns one of the other two IPs. PC-2's IPv4 settings are as follows:<br />
IP: 192.168.15.182/24<br />
Gateway: 192.168.15.1<br />
<br />
From PC-2:<br />
c:\&gt;ping PC-1<br />
Pinging PC-1 [192.168.1.254] with 32 bytes of data:<br />
Request Timed Out<br />
<br />
The expected result here is, of course, that PC-1 sees a name request from a computer on 192.168.15.0 subnet and that it returns the appropriate IP for that subnet.<br />
<br />
Additionally, and more to my main problem, PC-1 does not return an IP for our local servers (I'll refer to as Server-1), returning the following error.<br />
c:\&gt;ping Server-1<br />
Ping request could not find host Server-1. Please check the name and try again.<br />
Pinging the IP address directly works without issue.<br />
<br />
Both issues are fixed when both the 169.254.0.0 subnet and 192.168.1.0 subnet are removed from PC-1, leaving only the statically assigned 192.168.15.0 subnet. The issue can be reproduced on PC-2 (Win7) as well by assigning similar static IPs.<br />
<br />
Anyone have a suggestion or two to try?<br />

            Here is what has worked for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got this from another thread I was monitoring.<br />
<br />
1- Slave the infected drive<br />
2- install Dr.Web anti-malware( download &nbsp;here: <a href="http://www.freedrweb.com/download+cureit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.freedrweb.com/download+cureit/</a> )<br />
3 - do a custom scan on the slaved drive.<br />
4- It should find the culprit(s): A0000258.exe + beghrt.tmp<br />
5- after quarenting them we put the drive back and rebooted and everythigs seems to be acting normal.<br />
<br />
<br />
We use symantec corporate here.&nbsp; I did not get a chance to try it.&nbsp; Symantec did detect the A000xxxx.exe during the scan by drweb.&nbsp; Also the said file seemed to exist in the restore system file.&nbsp; Not sure how the virus works, but after cleaning with drweb,
 the machines work as normal.<br />

    <title>Surface Pro WiFi connectivity issues with Sprint Hot Spot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro WiFi connectivity issues with Sprint Hot Spot</h2>
                    <p>Surface cannot connect to Sprint WiFi hot spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connect is haunted, if you use the troubleshooter to reconnect, sometimes after repeated tries it connects and works for hours before dropping WiFi.&nbsp;&nbsp; Other times even after repeated attempts it cannot connect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 There are three other devices using the Sprint Hot Spot without any connectivity issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drivers have been updated and this did not have any positive affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a solution to this problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Is there a fix from Microsoft?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Love the Surface but unless the connectivity issues can be resolved it is useless for the purpose we purchased it.</p>

            <p>Hi Norma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for reaching out to the Surface Community and I'm very sorry to hear that your device is not connecting to Spring Wi-Fi spot. I'd love to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that you have all updates for the drivers; do you have all Windows updates installed on your Surface Pro as well?<br />
When did this issue start happening?<br />
Does the Wi-Fi dropping occur when you're on another Wi-Fi connection?<br />
If you turn the airplane mode ON then OFF, can you reconnect to Wi-Fi?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know!</p>

            <p>Thank you for offering to help resolve connectivity issue with Surface Pro &amp; Sprint HotSpot.</p>
<p>Update are set to auto and it&nbsp;appears from the history we are receiving regular updates from Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried turning the airplane mode on and off and this did not&nbsp; resolve issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only time we are successful with making a connection and maintaining it is sporadic at best.&nbsp; In some instances&nbsp; we use the troubleshooter multiple times, which does a "reset WiFi Adopter" and then we can maintain Internet connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other instances
 even after resetting the WiFi Adopter 7 or 8 times the connection cannot be made.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have also done a manual adopter reset, which made no difference than using the troubleshooter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all instances, the troubleshooter resolution is to reset the WiFi adopter
 and indicates "fixed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also read that this problem could have something to do with turning the power off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried leaving the surface on &amp; letting it go to sleep mode but&nbsp;this did not seem to make any difference either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other suggestions?</p>

            <p>Sorry, didn't answer all your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface was purchased one year ago the end of June.&nbsp;&nbsp; We gave had the same Sprint HotSpot the entire time.&nbsp; The problem started approx. 2 months ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem isn't dropping.&nbsp;&nbsp; If an when the connection can be made it is ok as long as you stay on-line.&nbsp; We have three other devices using the HotSpot, including a laptop, Nook and iPod and we have never had any connection or dropping problems with them.</p>

            <p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for answering my questions and clarifying that the problem you are having is making a connection and maintaining the Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried restarting the Surface AND the adapter when this happened?<br />
Can you check to see if the same issue occurs when you connect the Surface with other networks?<br />
Does the location of the Hotspot make a difference? Try moving to a different location and see if it works better.<br />
How many devices are connected to the Mobile Hotspot at once?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of them works, you may want to consider a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/restore-refresh-or-reset-surface-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
refresh</a>.</p>
<p>A refresh is different from a reset, and will not erase all of your personal data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know the results!</p>

<h2>            Long time NBA online 2k player worried help&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've recently been having problems playing online. Now I've been using the spurs for about a good 2 years now and for some reason when I play with them now it seems that they are damn near impossible to score with. I make sure I have their shots all to green
 and they are wide open. Posting up seem easy but to get duncan to actually make a hook shot is terrible. For some reason when I get space for mid-ranges with Parker and Hill I can't make none of them. Im also wondering if this maybe could have something to
 do with me using the shot stick like is it proven that X or the Shot stick is better or worse than using the other? Not looking for trolls looking for real honest answers. Thanks in advanced</p>

                    <p>I have been using 32-bit windows 7 desktop pc.&nbsp;It's hard disc is 1000 GB. It is a&nbsp;7-year-old pc. Today morning I found some strange sound from my pc. I restart my pc and found that the sound has gone.&nbsp; After restarting I also found that one of the partitions
 is not appearing.&nbsp; There were three partitions only (C, D, E) and D had the maximum size about 900 GB. Now the D drive is completely lost. Even&nbsp;I checked in disc management section and found that there was no partition named D drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my pc D drive had all the important documents. I would like to request you to suggest me an&nbsp;efficient way so that I can recover the D drive as soon as possible.&nbsp; Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things you need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try one of the many "Undelete Partition" tools you will find on the net.</li><li>Implement a robust backup process to an external disk. Not backing up important document regularly (e.g. weekly) is high-risk stuff. A 500 GByte USB backup disk costs less than $50.00.<br />

<h2>            iTunes download keeps hanging at 75&#37;</h2>
                    I've Windows 7, IE 9, and am trying to download iTunes from the apple website but no matter what I do the download keeps hanging at 75%. Download speed is ok until I hit this marker and then it just falls straight down to 0% every time. I've had problems
 downloading larger files from some sites, but others even larger go ok. I've tried at different times of the day; accessing other web pages whilst downloading; not accessing any other web pages whilst downloading. I've tried using Fedora Linux and same problem&nbsp;occurs.
 Frustrated at amount of bandwidth - and money - wasted on this.&nbsp;Any&nbsp;advice?&nbsp;I've run disk clean up to make sure it's a fresh download attempt every time. I've even tried installing an older version of iTunes, this does run but you can't access the iTunes store,
 and even the updater that comes with it hangs at 75%!!!

<h2>            Cannot login to Laptop</h2>
                    Hi, I have an &nbsp;Asus Note Book running Windows 8.1. I did a &nbsp; system restore a couple of weeks ago which was successful. When I went to login following the system restore with my PIN which I have had since I set it up. When I entered my PIN I got a message
 on the screen saying &nbsp;"Your PIN signin enrollment contains an old password. Please sign in with your new password" About a week before doing the system restore I changed the email address for login. I have no idea what the password is. Any suggestions. I have
 contacted Microsoft on several occasions and always seem to get cut off, whether by phone or online chat. Any ideas out there??? I don't want to have to buy new software or hardware. ��

<h2>            Lost Odyssey - Double Bonus Pack</h2>
                    
<p>Out of curiosity, since Microsoft Game Studios was the publisher of the game,&nbsp; will this content ever be available for download?&nbsp; It was originally a pre-order bonus back from 2008, but other regions are allowed to download it for free.&nbsp; And it has yet to
 become available in US, which led to players creating alternate accounts to download it (the dream stories are so well written, it's worth it. :D)</p>
<p>I'm asking because it's eluded availability ever since there was an exploit to download preorder DLC for free by manipulating URL address.&nbsp; Since then, content like it were marked at 99,999 MSP.</p>
<p>It's probably a long shot to find the right person to bug this about, but options are limited since Mistwalker and feelplus are both Japanese developers. :P</p>

<p>As much as I would like to see it, I cant see them bringing it out here as the game has since passed into memory. Its almost 5yr's since it was released in NA, which is the reason they probably wont go and open it up for us to download just that one pack.
 &nbsp;That doesn't mean you cant make a scene and demand it! :O. But I assume you will just get told, "should have pre-ordered", as if they were to open up pre-order bonuses for every game out there, there would be no reason to pre-order anymore.</p>
<p><br />
It like me wishing they would fix the DLC boss bug which has happened to me every time I try to fight him. &nbsp;I use only 2 spells, either the light spell hitting 9999 or the reverse of my hp spells hitting 9998 if I'm at 1hp. &nbsp;However after a few casts, I think
 the game gets consfused as sometimes I will prep for the reverse HP and absorb the bosses atk, healing myself, which now means I will only do 1 damage to him. &nbsp;The error is that my game doesn't cast a spell at all and just keep spinning in circle around the
 boss not doing anything.. I've waited for an hr hoping it would remember that it was suppose to cast but doesn't, &nbsp;Just keeps spinning and the screen gets farther and farther away, basically ending up with a 1 inch square in the middle where the fight is taking
 place and the rest of the screen is black cause its zoomed out so far and spun in like 99999999 circles. &nbsp;As a result I've never beaten that DLC boss, because I dont feel like running down 25 floors and keep having the game screw up and spin in circles.. &nbsp;(Happened
 3/3 so far)</p>

<p>Hahah,a that just sounds horrible. &nbsp;I haven't played Lost Odyssey since last year since I went for the Treasure Trove achievement (was successful too). Although it doesn't take much effort to go get it via Japanese Xbox Live, it'd be nice if the US region
 would get it. &nbsp;:P</p>
<p>Thanks for a response though, it's cool to see someone else that actually played this game.</p>

<h2>            How do I stop Windows 10 from Updating on my computer when I scheduled it&#63;</h2>
                    I have downloaded Windows 10 on my laptop and I scheduled it to do the full update tomorrow but already have windows 10 update on another laptop. I have decided that I do not want Windows 10 as I would rather keep Windows 8.1 but I am stuck on how to cancel
 my reservation and schedule update. Any help would be welcomed

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The Standalone Installer should have (following the prompts) checked for the updates you were trying to uninstall and when they found them, prompted you to uninstall the update or not. This will only happen if the update has previously been installed; otherwise,
 the prompt will tell you "not found".</p>
<p>I just installed an important update today (not paying attention to the update number-kb:3035583) and the Windows 10 reserve your copy icon came back into the lower right corner screen tray.</p>
<p>I went through the Command Prompt and did the above (wusa /uninstall /kb:3035583), enter,&nbsp;and restarted my computer.</p>
<p>The icon went away, but the Windows Update had it back listed as pending for install (I immediately checked Windows Update after the restart).</p>
<p>So, in Windows Update, I right clicked on the update, clicked on "Hide Update", and now it is removed as a pending update in Windows Update.</p>
<p>This is the 3rd time for this and each time I accidently&nbsp;installed this update I have had to do what I just stated.</p>
<p>One time when it automatically was reserved in the icon tray (Windows 10 icon), I right clicked on the icon and clicked on "Cancel Reservation".</p>
<p>To summarize: </p>
<p>1. If the Windows 10&nbsp;tray icon shows as your copy is reserved, right click on it and cancel it.</p>
<p>2. If you catch either of the above kb's pending for install in Windows Update, right click on them and "Hide" the update.</p>
<p>3. If either or both of the above kb's are installed on your computer (you can find out by searching installed updates and uninstall them through that search-sometimes??), go through the Command Prompt procedure listed above (best way).</p>
<p>Hope this helps...it works for my Window 7 Home Premium Version. You have to watch out for these updates, especially kb:3035583, because Microsoft keeps sending them as important updates and if you allow Windows Update to update automatically, they will
 install if you don't check your updates frequently.</p>
<p>They want you to try Windows 10! For me there is too much conflict with hardware, software and programs I have on my Windows&nbsp;7 Version PC...</p>

<h3> cydniherrera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paint 3d isn&#39;t saving correctly</h2>
                    <p>When I save a fbx file from paint 3d; as seen, it is normal in the software itself</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a21a689c-4f69-4dea-a9d3-5f8caa0b63f3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a21a689c-4f69-4dea-a9d3-5f8caa0b63f3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>But when I load it into Blender ( a 3d animation/ viewing program) this is what I get:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5dfc4482-4cf1-4c31-8b17-5c7de9a084e4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5dfc4482-4cf1-4c31-8b17-5c7de9a084e4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The textures aren't right at all. So I went to another software viewer, which is a game maker software and loaded the same exact file into there and got this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/663f90eb-0501-47b9-ab88-ec346dd9a945?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/663f90eb-0501-47b9-ab88-ec346dd9a945?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Which textures are missing and the model itself is all messed up but the rest of it is mostly put together.</p>
<p>I have a windows 10 Acer laptop that runs good ram.</p>
<p>Heres the information for the Acer</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/212e25e4-c4e8-49ba-aa9c-d8ae0fd7dfb3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/212e25e4-c4e8-49ba-aa9c-d8ae0fd7dfb3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I blurred device and product id in case if something was to happen such as someone trying to hack my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in those 2 programs, its the same file being loaded into both. In paint 3d, I have to wait 30+ minutes just for my model to load and save.</p>

            Hi Cyndi.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Try resetting 3D Paint at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; 3D Paint &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Reset.  
<br />
<br />2) If that's not enough re-register the app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />3) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />4) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />5) Have you tried updating to Version 1809 yet?  I'd try that now to see if it makes a difference, by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.   This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />6) Finally I notice you're running 4gb RAM on a core i5.  The best thing I did for rendering on my Core i5 is doubling the RAM which cost me $50 for first quality RAM.  Install the Crucial System Scanner to check the RAM   specs and configuration, what upgrade options exist for first quality RAM:  <a href="https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/systemscanner?cm_re=us-footer-_-us-upgrade-_-us-upgrade-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/systemscanner?cm...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>After firmware updates on 18&#47;1, SP4 hibernates after &#126;1 hour - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidwin  say:</h3>
<h2>            After firmware updates on 18&#47;1, SP4 hibernates after &#126;1 hour of standby regardless of power settings</h2>
                    <p>I prefer a tablet that wakes instantly, has connected standby,&nbsp;and don't mind it losing some charge overnight. Previously, I have modified the power settings on my SP4 to have it&nbsp;hibernate after 12 hours of standby, instead of the default&nbsp;2 hours. However,
 after the firmware updates&nbsp;this January, the SP4 will <em>always </em>hibernate after I leave it in standby for about an hour. I have checked the advanced power settings in the Control Panel, and they still indicate hibernation after 720 minutes of sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So, was this the great "optimization" to make the battery last longer during standby?</strong> Of course the battery will last longer this way, because the tablet is completely turned off! This move effectively makes the SP4 even less of a "real"
 tablet, and I can't believe how I am no longer allowed to decide for myself whether I prefer the longer battery life or the benefits of the widely touted connected standby mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else seeing this?</p>

            Ditto, this is happening to me as well.&nbsp; This new issue is why I checked the forum to see if anyone else was experiencing the issue.&nbsp; MS had finally had my SP4 i7 256 working correctly with connected standby after a year of the dark wake issue.&nbsp; Now they
 go and make it impossible to have connected standby when the unit is left for about an hour.&nbsp; Great work MS.

<h2>            My Account is from US but appears Mexico</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I am new here, in the world of Xbox.<br />
<br />
I buy a Xbox 360 Slim on Ebay, and the problem is, when I create my Live Profile (in my msn/hotmail account) and do not leave me to choose United States, and automatic appears Mexico.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is: Now, I can not buy microsoft points (for buy some old games) because all point I found is for US or Europe.<br />
<br />
<strong>My question is: ¿How I can change the Country to US for can buy Microsoft Points Cards?</strong><br />
<br />
I try with the profile of xbox.com and billing.microsoft.com and I can change the address but not the country and I do not want delete my profile because is on my email account)<br />
<br />
I must talk with some one? and where?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time</p>

<p>The most important, is my NickName/GamerTag. I do not want loose that. I use that nickname in every game/website/registration and I do not like have other NickName/GamerTag.</p>
<p>By other way, is the GamerTag is on my MSN/Hotmail Account where I have all my services and I do not want to change that too.</p>
<p>The problem of this is simple:</p>
<p>A) Or change the country of my account to US</p>
<p>B) Or found a website for buy Microsoft Points for Mexico and can download the "code" for put in my account and have the points I buy.</p>
<p>The problem of the second, is I do not live on Mexico and I do not have Idea where can buy Microsoft Points for that Country. I Search over Internet and do not found Microsoft Points for Mexico &amp; DOWNLOAD the code. All is of US (Or Europe)</p>
<p>Any One can recommend me a online store where I can buy Mexico MicrosoftPoint 's OR buy International Microsoft Points Please?</p>
<p>I Do not know what I can do. I prefer change my country (because I have more posibilitis of found &amp; buy Points)</p>

<p>A) no once set a region of an account can never be changed</p>
<p>you must create an new account</p>
<p>B) that is upto you to find the mexican ms points</p>
<p>you can change your name to a temporary account and then create a new account and change it to the name you want</p>
<p>mexican ms points can be purchased at any store </p>
<p>it is upto you what service you can purchase the ms points at</p>
<p>in order to purchase mexican ms points you need mexican billing info for a mexican creditcard on xbox.com</p>
<p>if you change the xbox.com region to mexico and then they will have links to other sides for cards and games</p>
<p>however there is no garentee if there is a mexican website</p>
<p>your best option is to create a new account in your correct region</p>

<p>I do not have problem to buy Microsoft Point in other currency (until will be a little more expensive, I do not care that). The important to me is "buy microsoft point of US or Europe, and can use in my Mexico account". If you can confirm that, I will be
 so happy! ahahaha... that fix my problem.</p>
<p>And respect this:</p>

<h3> greenbeard  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I disable or remove RAID 1 Mirror in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I have just bought a new desktop with Windows 7.&nbsp; I bought it on-line, and ticked the box marked "RAID 1 Mirror" without understanding properly what it meant.&nbsp; My machine is now here, and of course one hard disk is partioned into two, whilst the other
 is invisible on my sytem and, I assume, just a copy of the data on disk one.<br />
<br />
Now that I know what RAID is, I realise I don't need it, and would like to have regular use of my two hard discs.&nbsp; I have the 64-bit Windows 7 disc so can simply re-install Windows 7 if need be, if that is the answer, but would welcome nice clear advice, please.

            Greenbeard,
<div><br />
<div>Since there are multiple ways to create a RAID 1, many of which are outside of Windows, the instructions vary per system. Thus, you will need to contact the system manufacturer for assistance. Sorry we can't be of more assistance!</div>
