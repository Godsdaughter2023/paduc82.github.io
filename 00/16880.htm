<h2>            resetting my phone</h2>
                    I have resorted to resetting my Nokia Lumia phone because I realized that the phone memory was full. It's been two days since I started the process and it's been loading ever since. I don't know what to do to remedy the situation. Is it really normal that
 resetting the phone takes this long? Please I need urgent and complete help. Thanks!

<h3> sandragifford  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSN is spamming me with notifications.</h2>
                    <p>MSN is spamming me with notifications. I just got six notifications in a row about the Ohio voter purge. How do I get Microsoft to stop doing this? It makes it impossible to actually work on my computer with these things popping up over and over again. Why
 is Microsoft doing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it looks like MSN changed their application or did I change something without meaning to? There used to be categories at the top to click on if you wanted to see News about politics or US news, for instance. Did I do something to make this option disappear?
 It was super useful, and allowed me to see the category of news I was interested in at that particular moment. Without it the app is useless, in my opinion. How do I get those options back?</p>

    <title>Problem Playing .WMV files In Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> herculesunchained  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem Playing .WMV files In Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I've noticed that some of the older .WMV files that I have will no longer&nbsp;play in Windows Media Player. This is quite annoying, as they were purchased and downloaded on line, and I'm now unable to play them. I recently upgraded to Windows 10, so I'm thinking
 there is a connection there. When I try to open one, a window appears with the message "Media Changing". This is followed by another message "WMP encountered a problem while playing the file".&nbsp; Clicking Web Help was equally unhelpful :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried opening it with VLC Player, and got the following:</p>
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Could not demux ASF stream:</span>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DRM protected streams are not supported.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">VLC can't recognise the input's format:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The format of 'file:///F:/Storage/Files/WMV/v44.wmv' cannot be detected. Have a look at the log for details.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I'm sure that it isn't a corrupted file, as I have a long list of them, and I also have many bought more recently that play OK.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is there a way to find out what the problem is and how to fix it ?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I'd appreciate any help.</span></p>

<p>Having looked into this a bit further, I've found a bit of a 'mixed bag'. I've been collecting .wmv files for some years, and all of those I've tried originating in 2005 play OK with the latest version of WMP. If I come forward to videos purchased in 2007
 and 2008 then quite a few of these won't play. Later still, I have some in 2010 and 2011 that don't play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to convert these files into some other format that might be playable, bearing in mind they might be DRM protected?</p>
<p>

<p>Oh well - It doesn't look like I'm going to find an answer here. I suppose its just something that's been taken out of the earlier versions of the software, leaving people like me in the lurch with paid for video files that are unplayable.</p>
<p>

<p>The titles that have DRM will likely have to played using the app provided by the company you bought them from.&nbsp; If you bought them from Microsoft, try using the Movies &amp; TV app to play them.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. The website I bought the files from did not provide an app to play them. simply a download facility that arrived as a .wmv file that played&nbsp;perfectly fine with Windows Media Player&nbsp;and Vista/Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Its only since I've upgraded to Windows 10 and WMP 12 that I've started to have problems.</p>
<p>Luckily, I still have an old XP box that I was about to replace with a new machine, and this plays the videos fine, so I'm going to keep it for now. No wonder there are so many not wanting to replace their old operating systems!</p>
<p>Sorry about the DRM thing - not even sure what it is.</p>

<p>Ah, I see.&nbsp; Can you reach out to the provider of the movies to see if they may have updated something on their end?&nbsp; Possibly allow you to redownload them?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that Windows 10 isn't compatible with the copy protection scheme they used.&nbsp; Perhaps they've since updated things on their end to be more up to date.</p>

</p><p>Can someone please help? Previously I could use Office Lens to create contacts on my phone (a Samsung S10e and to a Google account) Office Lens would store contacts both in OneNote and locally to the phone. I am now finding that it will only create the OneNote
 contact and not the VCF, the message "Waiting for Transfer" appears and then defaults to "Can't Recognise Contact Information". The same also happens on my Samsung Tab S4.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to help you, I have installed the Office Lens on my phone, I also meet the issue on our side.</p>
<p>As our category is focus on Office, when you store it on OneNote without issue, the issue may be related to the tool “Office Lens”.</p>

<p>Given the situation, I suggest you report the issue via Feedback option, it is the best way to let our related team hear your voice:</p>
<p>1. Open Office Lens.</p>

Is that going to help me get a resolution? Posting feedback seems to imply that I will register a complaint and no action or solution will likely be forthcoming.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac - Indexing&#47;Search Issues</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently migrated my system from one Mac to another, including all of the Outlook messages. The Outlook for Mac software pulled in all of my messages perfectly, however the search function at the right right no longer works - it simply reads, "No Results"
 anytime I search for anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reindexed my Spotlight on Mac and that also works fine, but for some reason I'm unable to utilize Outlook's search function to search within my mail box for messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you kindly.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Search Results Removal From Bing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenaking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search Results Removal From Bing</h2>
                    <p>I would like outdated content removed from Bing search results, the Content Removal page is less than helpful to say the least. I'm not removing my own site's content, but content which is outdated from other sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two URLs which I would like removed, upon entering the data on the Content Removal page, I get the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The URL you submitted still works on the web and isn’t a broken link. You can only request an outdated cache removal for this page. Please enter a word that appears in the cached version of the page but no longer appears on the web page."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not entirely correct. The URL does work and technically is not broken, it automatically forwards to another page. The Content Removal page therefore thinks it is live and will not remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, when the remove outdated cache option is selected, the following is requested:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The URL you submitted still works on the web and isn’t a broken link. You can only request an outdated cache removal for this page. Please enter a word that appears in the cached version of the page but no longer appears on the web page."</p>
<p>
</p><p>For cached page text I enter: zynperor</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the following reply from the removal page:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The highlighted word does not appear in the Bing cached version of the page. Please enter a word that appears in the cached version of the page but no longer appears on the web page."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The highlighted word does appear in the cached version of the page. A word has been entered that appears on the cached version of the page but no longer appears on the web page, as the URL to be removed, http://creator.wonderhowto.com/zynperor/ automatically
 forwards to http://www.wonderhowto.com/community/</p>
<p>
</p><p>While looking at the cached page at the following URL, zyperor - the text entered, is even highlighted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Links needing removed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://creator.wonderhowto.com/zynperor/</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/zynperor</p>

</p><p>Thanks,</p>

Bing doesn’t control the content that websites publish or that appears in Bing search results. To make sure content is removed from search results,
<strong>your best option is to contact the webmaster for the website that published the content and request that it be deleted or removed.
</strong>Until the webmaster removes the content from their website, it will continue to exist and can be discovered by going directly to the web address or by search engines like Bing.
</p><p>If the website has removed the content but it still appears on Bing, you can remove broken links or cached content from search results with the

<p>You both seem to have missed the point of the original question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem, so let's call it a "bug report".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bing.com/webmaster/tools/content-removal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">content removal tool</a> fails and returns an incorrect error code when I request that obsolete data be removed from the bing cache.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. enter the URL</p>
<p>2. select removal type = "remove outdated cache"</p>
<p>3. Enter text that appears in the cached page but is not on the live page. In my case, it's a phone number. I enter it exactly as it appears in the cached page.</p>
<p>4. Click Submit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though the text I have entered most definitely does appear in the cached page, I get this incorrect error message from the removal too:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(217, 0, 38, 1)">The highlighted word does not appear in the Bing cached version of the page. Please enter a word that appears in the

            <p>Hi Santosh, thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed a business advert from the advert listing website www.yellowleaf.co.uk about 5 weeks ago, but a preview listing personal details still appears on the bing search engine. &nbsp;when you click on the link the page redirects to the yellowleaf homepage
 because my listing has been deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to remove the URL using the content removal tool, however, because the page redirects the content removal tool believes this to still be an active page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the remove outdated cached data function on the content removal tool, but I get the message:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(217, 0, 38, 1)">The highlighted word does not appear in the Bing cached version of the page. Please enter a word that appears in the cached version of the page but no longer appears on the web page.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not true, the word i used was part of the outdated cached search result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help removing this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p />

    <title>Bug in buying from market place when insuffiencet space is available - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bug in buying from market place when insuffiencet space is available</h2>
                    I have a Samsung Focus v1.3 with quite a few games on it, and I'm running out of space. I did have enough memory (about 600 MB) to download the trial of Tentacles. I liked the game, so I decided to purchase it from my phone on the Marketplace. Marketplace
 wouldn't let me buy the game because it thought I didn't have enough space, even though I had already downloaded the game. I had to delete several other games in order to free up space, then Marketplace let me buy it. When I did buy the game, nothing else
 was downloaded and I had the same amount of space that I had right before I bought the game.<br />
<br />
Could you fix this, please?<br />

            It's because the trial and the full version are considered different to the phone. No idea if that behaviour is changed in Mango, but the better idea would have been to uninstall the trial.<br />

    <title>Empty workbook after just saving and closing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zemaitiz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Empty workbook after just saving and closing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a workbook which I was working on, was adding series to a chart, when ctrl+shift+down arrow key stopped working. I ran into this before and the solution that helped was to just save and reopen the file. I did this, but after I reopened this my workbook
 was completely empty, not a single sheet was there. This workbook was a <strong>
copy</strong> of another one (<strong>original</strong>) and the latter I opened just fine. I tried reopening it again and again. Unfortunately, it seems that Excel failed to recover this file (it managed to do that before). Then I tried restarting PC, reseting
 the programs that open files (with which they associate), disabling something about DDE in Excel advanced settings (don't remember how it sounds exactly because my Windows and Office is not in English), and finally repairing my Office instalation (all these
 I found on google) and now Excel opens all workbooks as empty, without any sheet or anything. I tried to open these two files that I mentioned on another pc and it only opened the original but not the copy. Then I tried to open copy in Google Sheets and the
 data is all there, so it seems that the files weren't damaged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should I do to fix this? Haven't tried reinstalling yet, thought that I'd ask here first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 10, MS Office 2016</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Try following one by one as check after every step whether it resolves the issue-
<br />
<br />1. If Online repair is already done, ignore this - Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />4. Try to login through another Windows profile. If there is some corruption in profile which is causing this problem, this would correct.
<br />
<br />5. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />6. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus  etc. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start Outlook. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />Refer to the section - How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot. 
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />7. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:
<br />Open Excel &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration' &gt; Click Ok and restart Excel.

<h2>            My Internet Exporer icon has disappeared from my Windows 8 start screen and the desktop.</h2>
                    My Internet Explorer icon has disappeared from my Windows 8 start screen and the desktop.&nbsp; Under the help topics, Microsoft said to swipe to the right hand side and do a search for the IE app.&nbsp; Well, I did the search&nbsp;like Microsoft suggested, but Internet
 Explorer doesn't come up under apps.&nbsp; I was finally able to "trick" opening internet explorer&nbsp;on the desktop by&nbsp;into the control panel and typing in a web address, then pinning it to the taskbar on the desktop, but I still cannot get it to come up anywhere
 on the start menu.&nbsp; This happened after a windows update.&nbsp; Any suggestions or has anyone else had this problem?

            <p>Thank you ideleted for this answer!&nbsp; You were a big help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I went into "Turn Windows Features on or off", the Internet Explorer box was already checked.&nbsp; I decided to try restoring it, but I guess whatever&nbsp;glitch made internet explorer disappear&nbsp;was causing problems with other areas of my computer as well because
 the system restore wouldn't go back to a restore point.&nbsp; It just kept saying that the system couldn't be restored because&nbsp;of interference with a program, that it was likely to be my&nbsp;Antivirus, and to try turning my Antivirus off and restore again (which still
 didn't work).&nbsp; Finally I went back to "Turn Windows Features on or off" and decided to uncheck the Internet Explorer 10 option, let my compute reboot, go back into "Turn Windows Features on or off" and check the Internet Explorer 10 option again and reboot
 once more.&nbsp; This finally fixed my problem!&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again for your help!</p>

    <title>Mouse always indicate &#34;working in the background&#34; and scvhost - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ouwen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse always indicate &#34;working in the background&#34; and scvhost sometime takes a lot ram</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>My OS version is Win 10 build 10162. It started fine with upgrade from 8.1. Recently my mouse always starts to indicate "working in the background" 1 minute after boot and scvhost (service host: local service) might takes as much as 1 gb ram (it slowly adds
 up 1mb per sec). I tried clean boot with disabling all third party services. However, the mouse indicator problem still prevails. Because the scvhost takes so much ram usage when my 16 gb ram is half used, I hypothesize the mouse indicator might have something
 to do with scvhost. But after end the service host process, mouse still indicates same thing. I also run scan with Nod32 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not affect my desktop at least from my experience even gaming. But the circle flashing around my mouse is really bugging me. Any advice?</p>

            Hi Michelle
<br />
<br />If your company has a Skype Account, they can purchase Skype credit and then transfer that to you as a gift, they can also purchase a Skype Voucher, either way, the credit is charged to their Skype account . . .

<h2>            How to control junk mail in iOS</h2>
                    I am using (not by choice) the mail app that my iOS seems to require. How do I mark and or block junk mail so that it is blocked from my address. &nbsp;if I send it to junk it is not blocked from the next round of incoming. &nbsp;Please help.

            Hello brucewaldron 
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. I'm an independent Advisor  
<br />
<br />When you instruct iOS Mail to move a spam email to the Junk folder, it does just that, as long as it knows about the account's spam folder as it does for iCloud Mail, Gmail, Outlook Mail, and some others. If the Junk folder does not exist in the account, iOS Mail creates it.
<br />
<br />The effect of moving messages from the inbox or any other folder to the Junk folder depends on how your email service interprets the action. Most common email services treat messages you move to the Junk folder as a signal to update their spam filter to identify similar messages in the future, but  sometimes they are not.
<br />
<br />Spam filters aren't perfect. If you end up receiving spam email in the iOS Mail app even after you mark the sender or email address as Junk, the best solution is to block the sender entirely. Tap Settings &gt; Messages &gt; Blocked &gt; Add New and then type or paste in the sender's email address to block all email from that address.
<br />
<br />Or another workaround is go to your account directly from the web and make the process of spam filter from there, IOS Mail App will reproduce the same change that you previously did on Web
<br />
<br />I hope this information has been useful, please let me know if you still need assistance.

<h3> winliveid  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE loses all tabs &#38; windows after shut down, &#34;reopen the last browsing session&#34; NEVER works&#33;&#33; Will it ever&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Before you read on: this is most likely only bothering people who, like me, use lots of tabs in several windows, and always use hibernate instead of complete shut&nbsp; down, so I have all programs open everytime I power up &amp; log on....all others won't understand
 my complete inconvenience and dispair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok....IE8 ALWAYS loses the "last browsing session", ALL Tabs,everything!! (...funny enough, "always" is except 2%...why on earth I do not know!&nbsp;)</p>
<p>And this is since 8 came out, and obviously nothing has been done against it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been polite questions about this in here, with no useful response at all, like here in 2009 from&nbsp;coolguy949&nbsp;:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie8-windows_other/reopen-last-browsing-session-broken/40fbd8cb-2df9-4895-9291-64918a47055a">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie8-windows_other/reopen-last-browsing-session-broken/40fbd8cb-2df9-4895-9291-64918a47055a</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can it be that no-one is interested in this feature?&nbsp; Is there something going to happen about it?
</p>
<p>Other browsers liek Opera &amp; Firefox ALWAYS give you back your whole session (ALL windows with ALL tabs)&nbsp;after a hard-shutdown,whatever! It became a horror to run windows updates with a restart to me because it is SURE to lose all my tabs after restart!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just today, I lost all research work, due to this, that's why I am a bit upset - &nbsp;yes, sure - the "tabs" are SOMEWHERE in the history... great, when the tab you miss&nbsp;was from some 2 weeks ago, what a hassle to search through..I am so sick of it. :O(&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really like IE, the other features are fine, since tab browsing was implemented in 8 it is a real alternative and competitor to opera and FF.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, is there anybody with a solution, or someone with the same problem, so we can at least be together in solace?

<p>
</p><p>It's still an issue in IE11 on W8.1 where the implementation has probably changed from what you have.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, does my current workaround for getting out of the problem state work in IE8?&nbsp; Use the Restore button in the Tab Settings dialog.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I don't use the automatic feature but I just checked and the background one is still there for me.&nbsp; I do use it occasionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is definitely not an easy thing to reproduce when using IE normally.&nbsp; You can see that I last posted about it 2 months
 ago and I'm not even sure that I was in the problem state then.</p>

<h2>            Excel adding quotes when exporting to a text file.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using the following code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Export()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets("Export").Select<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets("Export").Copy<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets("Export").SaveAs "C:\limits.xml", xlTextWindows<br />

End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part of the text in the sheet is:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?&gt;</span></strong></p>
<p>When this exports to the xml file for some reason the text shows as:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""yes""?&gt;</span></strong></p>

            <p>You're not really exporting XML. You're saving the spreadsheet as text and adding a .xml ending, that's a whole different thing. Open the resulting file in a text editor and you'll see it's still an Excel spreadsheet. The double double-quotes are the least

<h2>            Sending emails to a group from single email address and the sending a receipt to the sender.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook of Office 365, how do I set up an email address that will send an email to a group of emails and then will send a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>single</strong></span> email back to the sender with a delivery receipt. For example, if we set up an email address -- *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and a user sends an email to this address, can we redirect this message
 to all the managers such as *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***? Then if the sender has "request a delivery receipt" checked, they will receive a
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">single</span></strong> delivery receipt email giving details if *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** successfully received this email?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried distribution list which works for sending emails to all the users in the list but the sender receives a delivery receipt email per user and not a single delivery receipt. I tried setting up a separate email address and redirecting emails to
 the users in the list, but then the sender only receives a delivery email receipt from the first email address and doesn't include the emails that it's redirecting it to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<h2>            Hotmail to Outlook Switch, Now Having a Bunch of Issues&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>My beloved Hotmail account was recently switched to Outlook Mail by MS w/o prior notice. After the switch, I've spent a good deal of time getting used to its format and features. It's not terribly different, but it's very frustrating bc I keep NOT receiving
 my regular email EVEN from my trusted people already in my Hotmail contacts. They keep showing up either in junk folder or in my deleted folder.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I used to create a rule for multiple junk emails at once but now I have to select one at a time (asking the server to delete them automatically) but they still show up in my junk folder w/o getting deleted.</p>
<p>My point is that this forced transition from Hotmail to Outlook has not gone smooth at all and I keep having to go through every folder to find/recover my lost mail, not to mention how many may have been lost already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very frustrating and I feel I can no longer trust this email server. Any thoughts and/or solutions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 header and footer - they both change when I only want the footer to change&#33;</h2>
                    I am trying to put headers and footers in a book. I have divided the chapters into sections.&nbsp; I have the footer, which is a simple page number, on all pages except for the introduction, etc. which are i, ii,iii, etc. That is all fine and good. It only
 took me 2 days of figuring this out to get this far! Thought I had it figured out, but now, when I go to the first chapter, which is section 2, and do the header, which is the name of the chapter which will appear at the top of every page in this chapter,
 and tell it "Different First Page" it also takes the footer page number off the first page!&nbsp; I didn't think the two were linked together at all (header and footer).&nbsp; So if I take "Diff First Page" off the footer for section 2, then it takes it off the header
 so that the header then shows on the top of the Chapter 1 page, which I DON'T WANT!&nbsp; How do I separate the two?&nbsp; I have unlinked previous and I thought the header and footer in each section works independently

            The different first page option applies to both header and footer. If you want the footer to be the same in both first and subsequent pages then you need to copy the footer to both footer ranges.<br />
<br />
There are potentially four different header footer ranges relevant to each section of the document but only a maximum of three can be used in the same document.
<br />
<br />
You can have a different first page header in conjunction with odd and even page headers (thus three header footer ranges). If some of these ranges are to carry the same information you will have to duplicate it in the appropriate header footers and avoid using
 same as previous.<br />
