<h2>            Problems signing in to Skype</h2>
                    I am having troubles signing in to Skype with my laptop. It keeps saying showing an error sign saying, "Skype can't connect."&nbsp; My laptop automatically updated the app the other night and now it won't let me in.&nbsp; I've tried deleting the app and downloading
 it again but still have the same problem.&nbsp; It's letting me sign into Skype online though, so I don't know if it's just my laptop or my internet maybe???

            Solution (worked for me):<br />
<br />
- Rollback before Patchday in Safe Mode<br />
- first install kb2667402<br />
- restart<br />
- install all other patches<br />
<br />
Hope it will help all other having this problem ...<br />

<h2>            Connect NAS drive to Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Don't know if this has been covered elsewhere in the forum but it might help a few people....</p>
<p>So far there is no way to directly connect a NAS to the X1 (that I've found anyway).</p>
<p>Had a genius idea today..... connected my WD Live TV box to the hdmi input.... Hey presto!! NAS drive now on the X1. I understand it's an extra box and remote control but it's a nice little work around for now!</p>

<p>So far, it's not easy by any means. Hopefully this is improved in the future. So far though the "all-in-one" box seems to be quite the opposite. Maybe one day MS will get their **** together though and actually figure out what direction they want to head
 in, and then actually move forward instead of backward. </p>

<p>I assume it is a type of hard drive they are talking about not astronauts or the national security agency. Are you joking? Or do you have a fear of spacemen watching you sleep at night from the moon and the government spying on you with the kinect, learning
 all your secrets? If so I suggest you seek help.. as your mental health should be more of a priority than paranoia and conspiricy. Yet again I could be compromised by the spacemen and I could be feeding you lies and propoganda.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes it can be done. You can set a screen save that looks like machine is off and leave the camera active.<br />
<br />
Years ago a camera came with software that was motion sensing so I could set the cam in that mode - activate<br />
the screen saver (locked) and if something moved in range of the camera it was recorded and if nothing moved<br />
then nothing was recorded.<br />
<br />
The bad news I do not know where you can find these however I guarantee you that the screen saver and motion<br />
sensing software do exist. Sounds like you have some sessions with your favorite search engine.<br />
<br />
In fact I would repost on this and other forums two separate questions.&nbsp;One about a screen saver that locks and<br />
makes it look like the computer is off.&nbsp; And a totally separate question about motion sensing camera software.<br />
<br />
If disk space is not an issue then motion sensing is not required.<br />
<br />
Good luck.

<h2>            Moving a gamertag to another Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I don't have an Xbox, but I would like to change the gamertag associated with my Microsoft account. Currently, I have a mess of accounts that I want to be organized. I want to have all of my Microsoft-related accounts under one Microsoft account, including
 my gamertag, which I use for multiple Windows 8 apps on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, my Xbox gamertag is associated with my Gmail, but I want it to be associated with my Microsoft account because of sign-in issues with some of my apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked around the Xbox and Microsoft sites, but I couldn't find any article that tells how to do this on a PC, and not just an Xbox. Because i don't have an Xbox, I need to be able to do this without one. How can one move their gamertag to another
 Microsoft account?</p>

            At present this ability is only available via an Xbox.&nbsp; The team is very aware that this is a gap, but I can't say when it may be resolved.&nbsp; At this point you are stuck unless you can use someone else's or visit an electronics store and use one there.

    <title>NBA 2K16 Frustration&#33; Thoughts and Suggestions Needed&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hauntingsteam89  say:</h3>
<h2>            NBA 2K16 Frustration&#33;  Thoughts and Suggestions Needed&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Platform:&nbsp; Xbox 360</p>
<p>Game:&nbsp; NBA2K16</p>
<p>Issue:&nbsp; My son can’t play this game on-line.&nbsp; Message says “You do not meet the requirements to play on line or edit your my player account”</p>
<p><br />
Suspected reason:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My son is 12 years old. You have to be 13 to play on line apparently.&nbsp; I suspect that when he first installed the NBA2k16 game and created his User Profile, he either put in his real date of birth or breezed past the date of birth section
 allowing it to default to whatever day it was the day he installed it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There appears to be no way to edit his profile (change his date of birth) on the game itself.</p>
<p>As a parent I have given him full permissions. For instance he has been playing Call of Duty on line for over a year now.</p>
<p>This 2K company has no phone support. You must submit issues on their website.&nbsp; To be fair to them, they do actually respond, although sometimes it takes three or more days, but the frustrating thing is half the time their responses give me the impression
 they have difficulties with reading comprehension; they don’t directly answer my questions or they suggest things that either cannot be done at all or are unfair, such as create a new gamertag to play their game on line, which would require a new Xbox Live
 Gold account (why should I pay for a second one?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried uninstalling the game and uninstalling the Gamertag, reinstalling them both.&nbsp; Didn’t help. I&nbsp; truly suspect his date of birth showing he is under 13 is locked into his profile and there is no way to change it on my end.&nbsp; What I find really hard
 to believe is that they cannot do it on their end!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn’t it on their server that my son’s 2k account profile is stored? They can’t pull it up and delete it or change it?&nbsp; My son makes one simple mistake of entering a date of birth showing he is under 13 and he is forever barred from playing online, unless
 he creates a new gamer tag and pays for a new Xbox live gold membership?&nbsp;&nbsp; I know life isn’t always fair but isn’t his a case of selling a product that doesn’t work?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate your thoughts/comments/suggestions.&nbsp; Even if you tell me you have had similar frustrating experiences, at least it might make me feel better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi HauntingSteam89!</p>
<p>Really sorry to hear your frustrations with this! Your son's age definitely sounds to be the cause of the trouble. If he set the age of his account to his current date of birth he would need to wait for his 13th birthday in order to access the game's online features. </p>
<p>Unfortunately once an account's age has been set there isn't an option to change it. Age requirements can vary from publisher to publisher, 2K does require the user to be at least 13 in order to access their online multiplayer. </p>

<p>The part I don't get is why can't anyone at 2k access my account for me and make changes, or delete it so my son can start over. &nbsp;If I contact any other business about my account, whether it is comcast, or the electric company, or my credit card company,
 how come an agent there can pull up my account and make changes for me or delete things, but 2k just shrugs its shoulders? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Heya HauntingSteam89.</p>
<p>The account age is tied to your son's Microsoft account which is unable to be changed for privacy and safety. We aren't able to speculate on 2K's decisions for online play I'm afraid. </p>

<p>This was a weird fix. &nbsp;If the child is not 13 it simply will not let him utilize this functionality. &nbsp;You can change the year of his birth, though still maintain his 'child' status. &nbsp;More information can be found here: &nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/child-birthdate-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">windows.microsoft.com/.../child-birthdate-microsoft-account</a>.</p>

<p>That is because once an account has been created the age is set; regardless of what changes you make the child status will remain.</p>

    <title>Keypads not typing correctly in HP laptop. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keypads not typing correctly in HP laptop.</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: Looks like a keyboard error, my keyboard just repeats eights.</p>
<p>Hi There</p>
<p>I have a HP laptop that has a numbers keypad. When I start windows and it it's up and running. When I click on the start menu the search area fills up with number eights. Also when I go to log in to my internet connection the username area just gets replaced
 with eights. If I click on the start menu, and the eights start running, I click on the ESC key and go back, that usually stops that problem, but it has now been creeping into my webpages and e-mails now, any solutions. It doesn't appear to be a hardware problem.
 As I am typing this there i8s an occasional eight popping up. Cheers Denzil</p>

<p>Well, that driver did not work.&nbsp; Windows says it could not finish installation, so I'm still using the basic driver.</p>
<p>I may simply have to go to a complete clean install forgetting win 7 but that means re-installing all of my programs and that's such a pain.</p>
<p>If there is anything else you can think of I'm game to try it.</p>

            I recommend using SFC
<br />The System File Checker tool built into Windows can scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a file has been modified, it will automatically replace that file with the correct version. Here’s how to use it.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow 
<br />

<br />
<br />Then try to reinstall the driver, if this does not work, then if I recommend you to do a new Windows installation

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. Let me see if I have understood correctly, you are getting a pop up message asking if you want to open JRX files when you open Photo Gallery. Is that right? If yes, it is possible that there JRX files were included in
 your Library and JRX files were not supported by Photo Gallery. We would also like to verify if the JRX files were video files or photo files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photo Gallery will show pictures with any of these file types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BMP</p>
</li><li>
<p>JPEG</p>
</li><li>
<p>JFIF</p>
</li><li>
<p>TIFF</p>
</li><li>
<p>PNG</p>
</li><li>
<p>WDP</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If <span>Windows</span> Movie Maker is installed, Photo Gallery will also play videos in these file types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ASF</p>
</li><li>
<p>AVI</p>
</li><li>
<p>MPEG</p>
</li><li>
<p>WMV</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yet if I execute an xcopy in a command window (without elevated privilege) the files copy across just fine!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Rob</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your prompt and comprehensive reply and sorry it's taken me a week to get back to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I work through those utilities you linked to I'd like to provide some additional information on the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just plugged the offending USB drive in and (<em>of course) </em>I was able to right-click copy and then right-click paste to the Music folder of my hard drive with NO PROBLEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got to thinking what could be different and then remembered on previous occasions I had added the entire drive letter as a Windows Defender excluded folder so I took the following actions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Added the drive to Windows Defender excluded folders and the problem re-emerged (unable to right-click paste)</li><li>I removed the drive letter from excluded folders but the problem persisted</li><li>I ejected the drive</li><li>I physically disconnected the drive</li><li>Reconnected USB drive</li><li>Tried right-click copy and paste and it's working again</li><li>Added the drive letter back into Windows Defender excluded folders</li><li>Ejected drive</li><li>Physically removed drive</li><li>Reconnected drive - right-click copy / paste works successfully</li><li>Removed drive letter from excluded folder - right-click copy / paste still working</li><li>Ejected / physically removed drive</li><li>Reconnected drive</li><li>Added drive letter to excluded folders - didn't work!</li></ul>
<p>Sorry about all the detail but my conclusion is my problem seems specific to the situation where the drive letter corresponding to the external USB drive is added to
<strong>Windows Defender excluded folders</strong> <strong>AND </strong>(I just realised) when using
<strong>the back and forward buttons in Windows Explorer</strong> to navigate. If I click on the external drive and re-navigate to source and also start at the top clicking on C drive then Music I do not experience the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I found this in the Administrative Filter of the Event Viewer, a bunch of "An error was detected on device \Device\Harddisk2\DR7 during a paging operation" warnings and a "The shadow copies of volume Q: were aborted during detection." error:</p>
<p>

    <title>Keyboard and touchpad not working on Windows 10&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fritze ong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard and touchpad not working on Windows 10&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I am using an ASUS laptop K55V model that I bought in 2013, previously running on Windows 8 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upgraded to Windows 10, everything was okay.</p>
<p>However, there was an update in Windows 10 (Mandatory) which messed up my keyboard, touch pad, and USB port drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't type nor click anything, can't even get past the log-in screen. At first I'm not sure what caused this. When I enter the BIOS Setup, it works just fine. I decided to make a system restore. Luckily, there was a restore point dated just a few days
 back, prior to the windows update. Upon doing so, everything went back to normal (Win10). But for some reason, the next day I encountered the same problem. I tried doing system restore again to the same date as the first time. After doing so, I see the windows
 update prompting again. I didn't do anything, I just "Update and Shut Down". When I opened my laptop, there it is again! My keyboard, touchpad, and sometimes my mouse also don't work, even if I switch USB ports or other mouses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling the device drivers, updating the drivers, shutting down the laptop, removing the battery, etc. I even tried to go to the manufacturer's site for device drivers for Win10. But for my laptop model. I can't find any drivers for touchpad
 or keyboard for Win10, only until Win8 and earlier OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does this mean? Is my laptop not compatible to Win10, should I roll back to Win8? Would really appreciate the help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Ms. Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted ASUS Support a while ago, and they have recently replied to my query. They have confirmed that my laptop model is not compatible to Win10. I would have to go back to using Win8 to avoid any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But still, thank you very much for your reply!<br />

<h2>            Router constantly disappears, reappears in Network Infrastructure</h2>
                    I recently bought a D-link DIR-835 router to replace an older Linksys that was crapping out, and shortly after install I noticed that my VPN connection to work would drop after about 3-5 minutes. I rebooted everything, but no luck. In addition, my internet
 connection (Comcast broadband) seems to work fine generally, but on&nbsp;occasion it seems to freeze for a few seconds before responding again. This happens with wired or wireless.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I notice in my Network panel (Windows 7) that the DIR-835 shows in Network Infrastructure, but it consistently disappears, reappears, disappears, reappears...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any idea why this is happening? Are the issues related?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks.</div>

I'm an MVP?&nbsp; Interesting.</p>
<p>Use logic.&nbsp; You purchased a new router and you have only noticed the issue since then.&nbsp; What made you come to a Microsoft Windows 7 forum to figure out what was going wrong when you replaced one thing (hardware router that has no connection/driver with/for
 Windows 7 and is not manufactured by Microsoft) and started noticing the issue.</p>
<p>You either need to read up on the router itself and figure out what is going wrong - or replace the router.&nbsp; My comment is based off, as is everyone elses in forums that are peer-to-peer like these, personal experience and opinions based off those experiences.&nbsp;
 I would not recommend D-Link to people I don't like, much less others.</p>
<p>As for the router you have (if you like D-Link), make sure it is fully patched and configured correctly.&nbsp; You might reset it to defaults and see if it still exhibits the same issue.</p>
<p>My suggestion remains the same based off my experience however - replace it with a better router.</p>

<div>Yes, it makes sense that it's the router, but the reason I come to a forum like this is that I was unable to find any information about known DIR-835 connectivity problems and I thought I'd check to make sure I'm not overlooking a known Win7conflict/setting

If you were insulted - that was you reading into what I gave you.&nbsp; In fact - if you were insulted by, "Replace it with a better router." &lt;-- I have to ask - what about that insulted you?&nbsp; Genuine curiosity, nothing more.</p>
<p>This is a Microsoft forum where&nbsp;issues about Microsoft products can be discussed.&nbsp; Peer-to-peer, person to person.&nbsp; No one here knows all and I certainly do not claim to.</p>
<p>I just used logic to take what information you had given about just having replaced a router and suddenly you had connection issues to deduce where the problem likely was and give you the short answer. Could I have gone long and drawn-out like this has become
 in the beginning? Sure - but you could have been the type that either would not have read all that and/or would have taken offense to the long and drawn out answers that included&nbsp;personal&nbsp;opinions on things...</p>
<p>&nbsp;*shrug* Playing the odds and saving myself time in the process.</p>
<p>Then you came back and attempted to insult me - without a doubt -&nbsp;an attempt at an insult.&nbsp; You asked a question, I gave the answer that would likely fix your issue in the fastest manner based on the information given and you came back and attempted to insult
 me instead of asking me to expand on why I thought that and/or discount my advice with evidence.</p>
<p>I just told you originally to get a better router - not even degrading a particular brand.&nbsp; This is a discussion, so if you wanted to know particulars, you would ask.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or you wouldn't.&nbsp; You didn't,&nbsp;but I gave some more information anyway in response to
 your attempted insult&nbsp;- I don't like D-Link.</p>
<p>You asked a further question... so I will add: I like NetGear products.&nbsp; Simplest one usually - now the WNR1000 if I recall - usually works best for most people.</p>

Maybe you should stick to posting somewhere where you do know the answers. Telling someone to "find out what the problem is" isnt very much help seeing as thats the whole point of posting on a p2p forum like this one.&nbsp;

<div>&nbsp;By the way im having a similar issue with this and you've done nothing at all to help me. Infact you have somehow managed to make my day significantly worse with your display of sheer ignorance.&nbsp;</div>

You come here, hijack an older conversation for which you have no input just to insult someone and you are not the one with an issue?&nbsp; Okay...</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If your day was made worse by reading a conversation you had nothing to do with and nothing to contribute - but did anyway - that all seems to be a personal decision.&nbsp; You made each one of those - so you contributed totally to your own mood and reaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>You came here for advice.&nbsp; So did the original poster.&nbsp; If you worked with the equipment everyday, you might have opinions on what is easier to use and what would be better - if you don't want opinions as such - don't ask the questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is a Microsoft P2P forum - so asking for help about a D-Link router and how to configure it wouldn't even make sense here; but telling someone they may have misconfigured it and they should learn to use the equipment they purchased and plan on using
 makes sense no matter if it was posted here or D-Link's forums (where they might actually assist with it as well.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
If that offends you - so be it.&nbsp; You feeling I did not help you in a conversation where you have contributed nothing and asked nothing doesn't really bother me all that much.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you want help - ask.&nbsp; Start your own conversation with your own details.&nbsp; If you want to jump on just to troll - perhaps you should take your own advice?</p>

            BradHallet: Shenan was correct that the router was the problem, and after a replacement D-link also failed, I switched to Apple Airport and haven't had any problems since. I've never even had to restart it. Best router I've ever owned. Best of luck to
 you.
<div><br />
<div>Shenan: Your suggestion was correct, so thank you. But you never seemed to understand that my question wasn't about the router, but rather were there any known issues with Windows 7 that might be causing the problem. A simple, "no, I know of no issues
 with W7 causing this" would've been a better, more direct answer to my orignal question.</div>

            <blockquote>BradHallet: Shenan was correct that the router was the problem, and after a replacement D-link also failed, I switched to Apple Airport and haven't had any problems since. I've never even had to restart it. Best router I've ever owned. Best of luck
 to you.
<div><br />
<div>Shenan: Your suggestion was correct, so thank you. But you never seemed to understand that my question wasn't about the router, but rather were there any known issues with Windows 7 that might be causing the problem. A simple, "no, I know of no issues
 with W7 causing this" would've been a better, more direct answer to my orignal question.</div>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Yet without a suggestion to replace the router - would you have as quickly/at all?&nbsp; I thought it better to give the answer to the issue as given as opposed to anything else.<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>You actually asked, "Any idea why this is happening?" and I answered, "Replace it with a better router."&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Sure - we danced around again - but... in the end, eh?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>People come here for answers, usually wanting the shortest path.&nbsp; I tried to give that originally in the shortest manner possible.<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thanks for coming back and letting everyone know how you resolved your issue.</p>

<p>Its was snarky and unnecessary ... replace with a' better' is an insult.. pure and simple... I have been seeing a lot of this nonsense on MS forums lately... \</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; There is in fact a problem with UpNp and discovery in windows 10.. routers either are gone or constantly appearing and disappearing from "network infrastructure' heading. resetting the router is a temp fix... going into router setup and dis and en abling
 upnp is also temp fix.</p>

So my question is what am I doing wrong? Or did I choose the wrong HDD? I have the 2 HDD's set up in a striped raid with optimal setting. Which I believe is 64kb, Ill have to look in the bios set up again.
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the advice :)

<h2>            Can connect to xboxlive but cannot play multiplayer why</h2>
                    Hi please help, I'm desperate, I can connect to xboxlive and download demo games etc but when ever I try and play against others online, like multiplayer it just says that the server is not available at that time. It does not matter what time or what game.
 My parental settings are good and the connection is fine. Any ideas

<p>Hey there Nebula! I understand you are having some issues playing on LIVE. Exactly which games does this happen in? Are there any games that you can play fine in? Also, just to clarify, you are not being disconnected from LIVE at all, you simply cannot connect
 to certain game servers, correct? How about if you use a different profile on your console and try these sames games, do you still have issues? Let me know, thanks!

<p>Hi, thanks for the answer,</p>
<p>It happens on all games and I do not get disconnected at all, i can download demo games fine and mi Internet is good with the gold account.</p>
<p>The only thing that comes to mind is that I live in the republic of Ireland and the visa card I used is a uk visa card, could that be an issue.</p>
<p>As I said every thing is good, connection, broadband, etc but cannot get to see anyone else, also cannot connect to live party. Any help please</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hey Crazier, the point you brought up about the payment option could be an issue. To be sure, I recommend calling phone support in your region, as they're our billing specialists.

<h2>            Skype for MAC - connection too weak</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Macbook pro (13inch 2017) with touch bar&nbsp; with MacOS High sierra 10.13.4</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype does not work correctly with Apple Airpods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using the latest version of Skype for Mac 8.22.0.2 with calling Version 2018.20.01.7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the Airpods are fine working with Skype on the Iphone 6s. NO issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also know the Airpods work fine - when you go into system preferences - the mic is shown to be working. When you speak the levels change - also you can hear music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is when you connect - the connection on skype drops and says the 'Connection is weak'. Thats odd as I am on a physical internet CAT5 cable which connects to a fibre connection at 50Mbps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ma using a very standard setup - I am sure this is a software bug in Skype for MAC somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know the issue or how to fix this?</p>
<p>
