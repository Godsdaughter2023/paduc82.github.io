<p>Hi Tyler,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be default, the person who purchased your Office 365 business subscription is the global administrator. You need to contact your global admin. You cannot create / delete a global admin with roles above. For your reference:</p>

            Hi <strong>Manoj</strong>,<br />
<br />
The error code<strong> 0xE00001BB</strong> is mostly related to file syncing issues with
<strong>OneNote</strong>. To isolate your concern, we'd like to know if you're using the OneNote app or if you're using a browser to access the files.
<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we suggest you create a new notebook in <strong>
<a href="https://www.onenote.com/hrd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote online</a></strong> and copy the sections from the affected notebook to a new one.<br />
<br />
We hope to hear from you soon.

<h2>            MS Office runtime error - Repair</h2>
                    <p>When I boot up any of the MS Office applications, I am met with an error immediately</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We're sorry, but (Application) has run into an error preventing it from running correctly. (Application) will need to close to be closed as a result. Would you like us to repair now?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select Repair now, the application closes and then nothing else happens. When I go through the control panel and initiate the repair via Programs and Features, and let it go through the process of repairing the programs I am still met with the same
 error when I boot up any of the applications.</p>

            Have you tried doing the online repair of the installation, or the quick repair? If the quick repair didn't work, try the online repair.
<br />
<br />Please click Windows Start
<br />Choose Settings
<br />Click Apps
<br />Click on Microsoft Office in the list
<br />Click Modify
<br />Choose Online Repair
<br />
<br />
<br />The instructions to follow to do this are here:

            Use the fix it tool to completely uninstall Office:

<br />
<br />then
<br />
<br />Reinstall Office
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.
<br />
<br />Forgot your account details? See I forgot the account I use with Office.

<br />
<br />On the Office home page, do the following depending on your version of Office.
<br />
<br />If you signed in with a Microsoft account, from the Office home page select Install Office &gt; Install. (Office 365 subscribers should select Install again).
<br />

                    <p><span><span>Original title : windows error: 0x800106b5 won't let me start windows defender, help and support, connect to the internet, etcetc</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Okay, I'm on Windows Vista &amp; I keep receiving the same windows error: 0x800106b5. I need help with this issue as I can't do anything!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I've searched on the internet, but nothing.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Everytime I try to start up Windows Defender it says "Windows Defender is turned off. Windows Defender won't provide protection against harmful or potentially unwanted software and it won't send you alerts because it is off. To help protect your
 computer against harmful or potentially unwanted software,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Turn on and open Windows Defender</span>."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So I click the link...takes forever to load and it says "Your computer is running normally." Well, it's not because when I try to connect to the internet when I scroll down to network it says "Connection Status: Unknown. The dependency service
 or group failed to start" When I right click and press "Connect to a network" it says "Windows cannot find any networks" and behind the Network, Windows Defender stops and says "Service has stopped. A problem cause this program's service to stop. To start
 the service, restart your computer or search Help and Support" It won't let go on Help and Support "Help and Support was not able to start. For more information contact your system administrator or visit http://windowshelp.microsoft.com."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I've searched on the internet and found this website</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555962</span></a><span>&nbsp;but when I type in the commands it comes back with "<strong><span>WMI
 repository is consistent</span></strong>"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I don't know what to do! I've tried almost everything and running out of ideas. :(</span></span></p>

<p>Nope, i've tried everything, nothing seems to be working. When I go into services everything says Automatic and Started,&nbsp;Including Windows Firewall. It says it's automatic but the service status has stopped. When I press Start a pop-up comes up saying "Windows
 could not start the Windows Firewall on Local Computer. For more information, review the System Event Log. If this is a non-Microsoft service, contact the service vendor, and refer to service-specific error code 87."</p>
<p>When I go onto Windows Firewall with Advanced Security it says "Windows Firewall with Advanced Secuirty snap-in failed to load. Restart the Windows Firewall service on the computer that you are managing. Error code: 0x6D9."</p>
<p>Also, when I restart my computer, when I log onto my user it says Welcome for a long time (It didn't used to take so long) then it changes to a black screen for an extra 5 minutes and finally brings up my wallpaper and everything starts. But, something pops
 up everytime in the task bar when&nbsp;I turn on my laptop which I've never seen before. "Failed to connect to a windows service. Windows could not connect to the System Event Notification Service service. This problem prevents limited users from logging on to
 the system. As an administrative user, you can review the System Event Log for details about why the service didn't respond." But it doesn't give me an error code to try and fix.</p>
<p>When I go into Windows Security Center, under Security essentials the four options which include Firewall, Automatic Updating, Malware Protection and Other security settings. Everything is set as OK apart from Automatic Updating. When I try to change the
 settings, I click "Change Settings..." and it pops up "Install updates automatically (recommended)" so I click onto it but nothing changes.</p>
<p>I do not have any other software any more as I've uninstalled all the limited time ones and the ones which aren't free. But I believe everything started happening after uninstalling these programs. I used to have PC Tools: Spyware Doctor, Malwarebytes: Anti-Malware:
 Malwarebytes, Fake Anti-Virus 1.64, McAfee and possibly more. (I recently removed a malicious virus/fake anti-virus software.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry about the long paragraphs, it's a&nbsp; very stressful matter and I have a lot of things wrong with my computer and it's taking me around in circles!</p>

<h2>            How to estimate the cost for SharePoint &#40;online&#41; &#38; SharePoint &#40;on-premises&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had a requirement from the customer to develop a SharePoint application. I'm in need to do server-sizing &amp; compute the cost required. Say I have 1000 concurrent users for now &amp; so if I develop an application on SharePoint online &amp; on-premises (2016),
 what is the most likely&nbsp;estimated cost including licensing, server &amp; other infrastructure requirements? Is there any cost calculator available or something else that would actually help me out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shall appreciate responses!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Tejas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For SharePoint Online, the basic cost is licenses. We need to buy licenses for each user's account. Below is a product page. You may check the basic cost for 1000 licenses.
</p>
<p><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/compare-sharepoint-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Compare SharePoint Online options</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For SharePoint server, we need to buy the SharePoint server 2016 product. Meanwhile, SharePoint Online is stored in cloud server. Using on-premises SharePoint, we need to buy some severs. We may also need to contact some services provider for deploying the
 on-premises SharePoint server. For more details and further support, see <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/sharepoint-partners-sharepoint-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint partners</a>. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other community members are welcome to share your experience here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

    <title>SIM card on Nokia 6301&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jc3512  say:</h3>
<h2>            SIM card on Nokia 6301&#63;</h2>
                    So my mom let me have her Nokia 6301 as she bought a 5760. She takes her SIM card out and puts it on her new phone, while I put mine on the 6301. I turn it on and I wait a bit, then I check my contacts. They're out of order, and when people call me, I
 can't see the names, only the numbers. I thought it was the door thing that keeps the SIM card in place, which doesn't really click to make it stay there. Not like another Nokia I once had. I thought it was that, but nothing. I also tried to Move my contacts
 from the SIM card to the phone, to no avail. And when I select "View phone numbers only", it says I need a password or something. I tried the same with my dad's SIM card, and it has the names at random and You can't see the contact's name. I even search for
 a certain name. I'm pretty sure it's the phone, but I just wanna make sure. I like this phone, and I would very much like to keep it without any problems at all.<br />
<br />
Help, please.

<p>did she have her contacts stored on the sim or the phone go into contacts and select phone memory and leave out the sim card and see if there is anything in there,then use the sim and select sim memory and see if any thing pops uo it could be an fissue where
 your having duplicated contacts if&nbsp;your numbers are stored on sim delete the contacts that are on the phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in contacts go to settings and see what the settings is at ie name only or name and number view this should bring them up alphabetically in order</p>

            Here's what I did: She had her contacts on the phone's memory, and I had to transfer them to the SIM card. On the SIM card, there were already a few contacts there, the ones pre-installed like 611, the number thing to check her balance and text usage,
 etc. Then I transfered all of those from the SIM card to her NEW phone. Is this what you're referring to?<br />
<br />
12345 gives me "Code error". And I tried doing the name and number view thing but still it's all messed up. And I can't see the names of people calling me. I don't recognize my contacts by their numbers. =[

<p>In the example video, that's a new browser window opening when they click the link, not the IE download window.<br />
</p>
<p>That's probably why the settings you are trying have no effect on it.</p>

    <title>Total Aggregate Function Queries - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> z_a_s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Total Aggregate Function Queries</h2>
                    <p>I am doing a bit of learning when it comes to Total Aggregate Function Queries in Access (specifically in design view). I want to have a full understanding of each function, but am having trouble getting a grasp of {Min/Max/First/Last/GroupBy/Expression/Where}.
 I was hoping to run through some of these with the Micrsoft Answers Community and maybe get some feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Min/Max</strong></li></ol>
<p>I usually use Min/Max on strings of text as opposed to numbers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">I have a field where the values can only be "Alpha" "Beta" or "Gamma." Sometimes, I can have both "Alpha" and "Beta" linked to the same IDNumber (as a combined key/joined key). The IDNumber, Alpha/Beta/Gamma Field, and a number of
 other fields exist on a form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">When I have an IDNumber that has BOTH "Alpha" and "Beta" I usually use the "Min" function to return values where a particular field is Alpha. In my database, "Alpha" supersedes "Beta." Now, say for example I wish to return "Beta".
 I would then use the "Max" function to return "Beta" and ignore "Alpha".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">Is this a reasonable way to do this? It works so far, but down the road I fear I will have trouble. For example, what if I have an IDNumber attached to Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. "Min" would get me Alpha. "Max" would get me "Gamma".
 How would I get Beta?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>First/Last</strong></li></ol>
<p>I have heard many bad things about these functions. I used to think they worked similarly to the Min/Max. But research online, it seems that I should only use these functions to get results from an existing table? In other words, I should not use the "First"
 and "Last" function if I am querying data for the first time from a table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Expression</strong></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">I have used the Expression function a number of times in my Total queries. Its my understanding that the Expression makes a new column for you in the query results. This new column is based on a specific expression, such as “expr1:
 [first name] &amp; [last name]”. This would create a column where first and last name are combined. Ive also used the expr: to remove parts of words in a Coolum. For example, if I have alpha-red, alpha-blue, alpha-green, I can use an expression to ignore anything
 that comes after alpha. What are some other common usages of the Expression function in a Totals query.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Where</strong></li></ol>
<p>Does the “Where” function do the same thing as the “Criteria” row? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Group By:</strong></li></ol>
<p>This is by far the most confusing to me. When I select a Total query, the default function is Group By. I do not know what this does. It sounds as though it sorts my data (acending/descending). But I know this is wrong. A definition I found online says “The
 GROUP BY clause in Access combines records with identical values in the specified field list into a single record.” I am having difficulty understanding.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, is there a difference between a simple select query and a Totals query were all the columns are “Group By”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. And forgive my ignorance. If you would rather point me to a direction where I can learn this, that would be much appreciated as well!</p>

            <strong>Min/Max</strong>: I would have a small lookup table that stores Alpha, Beta,... with a numeric field/column that specifies the order. I would not rely on the text field.<br />
<br />
<strong>First/Last</strong>: I would never use these<br />
<br />
<strong>Expression</strong>: There are times when the aggregate functions only work with Expression. In these instances the Field: row would include the aggregate function<br />
<br />
<strong>Where/Having</strong>: This is the criteria row(s). In a totals query HAVING should only be used in a non-Group By column. It would be appropriate to use the HAVING with columns like: Sum(Quantity) where you want to filter based on the Sum of the quantity.<br />
<br />
<strong>Group By</strong>: Don't get in the habit of assuming the Group By will always provide the Sort By. If you upsize to SQL Server, this will bite you. Think of Group By as buckets. If you group by department, each department has its own buck that you
 count or sum values into. If you are familiar with Excel Pivot tables, these are like Row Headings.

    <title>Can I Export multiple subfolders each to its own PST&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephen rutkey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I Export multiple subfolders each to its own PST&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Outlook 2010 (v14.0.7177.5000), although I think my question is generic and might apply to many versions. &nbsp;I work in engineering and my company assigns a unique 8-digit project number to each project. &nbsp;I have a PST that contains a subfolder for
 each project (named by the 8-digit number plus description). &nbsp;This single PST is backed up to a server, which prevents loss of the data, and this method of using one PST works well for me during the fast-paced handling of many jobs over many months. &nbsp;However,
 ideally my subfolders would be written *separately* (such as for final archiving) to their separate project locations on our server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any built-in or free-ware type batch operation that would allow me to write each subfolder to a separate PST? &nbsp;In a basic and suitable outcome, these can output to the same location and I would then distribute (cut and paste) the PSTs to their separate
 server project locations. &nbsp;In a more advanced situation, I could provide a path (different for each project) for the output to write to, for example by populating an Excel list or similar, and then all would output directly to their intended archive location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any recommendations are appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>
<p>

There is noting build-in that would do that nor have I've ever seen anything that would remotely come close to the requirement. Would be really surprised if something like that exists - leastwise in any kind of public venue</span></p>

            Thank you for responding, Karl.&nbsp; I'll wait to see if anyone else chimes in with a solution or recommendation.&nbsp; From a programming point of view, it seems pretty simple:&nbsp; Outlook can already select a folder and export to PST, so this is just repeating that
 operation through a sequence of files.&nbsp; Alas, I'm not a programmer :)&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Yep don't disagree but this, in the scheme of things, would be a highly specialized export, translated to mean that I don't think this is something that would be widely requested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the "complexity" - that comes into play in terms of handling all the potential error-handling to deal with all the potential permutations of what a user may want to do, something that has to be taken into account by someone who makes something publicly
 available</p>
<p>
</p><p>...................but you never know, someone may have done it and certainly would be curious to see if that's the case.</p>

            I've solved the problem by myself.
<div><br />
<div>I had attempted to send a message with a bad address. &nbsp;When this attempt failed, it put the message in a "Smart Folder" entitled Outbox waaaaaay down at the bottom of my very long long folder pane and out of sight.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm used to the "outbox" being more visible at the top of the folder pane.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once I found it, I located the defective message, fixed the offending address and all is well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My conclusion: "Smart Folder" is not aptly named if you can't see it.</div>

<p>Somewhere along the way between 10041 and 10049 you picked up the language packs. That's why you have the 2 icons.</p>
<p>Search the forums, because there is a fix for it before you download 10061.</p>

</p><p>Please provide a Workaround or a solution to unlock the screen <strong>
without hard reset or recovery software.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I don't want to loose all my data on the phone!!</strong></p>

            Unfortunately you'll have to hard reset using the device recovery tool or the phone button combo(this is a better option) and update the OS after finishing the reset.

                    At least once a day, I somehow hit the wrong combination of keys on my laptop keyboard. I'm not sure which ones; it doesn't seem to be consistent, but it only happens when I'm typing quickly and never when I'm typing slowly. My .docx file then starts to
 scroll either up or down without stopping until it gets to the bottom or top of the document. The entire program freezes. I can use my mouse and keyboard in other programs, but not in Word. In order to use Word again, I've been forced to open Windows Start
 Task Manager, end the program and reopen it again.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The files are pretty big, so I wonder if the file size may be part of the problem. Does anyone have any idea what I may be doing, if something's wrong with my copy of the software, and/or how to fix it or avoid it happening in the future? Thank you so
 much in advance for your help.

            What do you consider "big" files, number of KB/MB?<br />
<br />
Often, unexplained problems in Office / Word are caused by addins and 3rd party programs. Here are some generic trouble shooting techniques to help identify causes of this type of problem:<br />
<b>Trouble Shoot Word problems that occur when you start or use Word 2010, 2007, 2003, or 2002
</b>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921541</span></span></a><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>2003-2010</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=820919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=820919</span></a><span><span> -2002-2003
</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>NOTE:
</b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin, ie “send to Bluetooth”, installed. Disabling BlueTooth is rapidly moving to the top of my Office trouble shooting process.
 Blue Tooth drivers have been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s not that I think there is anything inherently bad with Blue Tooth. The problem is with the people writing the drivers.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<b>Don’t Assume ANYTHING!</b>
<p>Don’t assume some part of the trouble shooting processes listed below doesn’t apply to you. Often there are things going on in the background that you just aren’t aware of. For example, when installing software it is all too easy to have
 an unwanted app installed if you don’t carefully read every screen. </p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<b>Uninstall Recent Software</b>
<p>At this point, you have also think about any software or plugins that you may have installed on your computer. Annoyingly, this problem with Word can be caused by a program that is completely unrelated to Word!</p>
<p>Did you recently install some new hardware? A printer, scanner, label machine, web cam, tablet, etc? Have you installed any software? If so, uninstall it and see if the problem goes away.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The following Skype links are an example of this issue</p>

&lt;snip&gt;I found some posts on line about opening each product that was closing in safe mode and disabling the ABBYY Reader add-on.&nbsp; THis solved my problems.&nbsp; Not sure why but I disabled that add on in WORD, EXCEL, and OUTLOOK and they all work now.&nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; While I couldn't precisely say whether the problems from Office stemmed from the iCloud Panel software, I decided to uninstall the software as I don't use it anyway. After doing that, Office is now working perfectly fine. No more
 re-starting or crashing when I'm running IE at the back, nor trying to copy something in Word or Excel. It looks like the iCloud Panel software does have some compatibility issues with Office. &lt;/snip&gt;

<p>Starting in March 2012, "Skype click to Call" has been causing problems File Open problems, and Copy/Paste problems in Office Apps.
</p>
<p>The quick test for this problem is to close all open browsers. If the problem goes away it is probably Skype.</p>
<p>March 30 – MS has released an update to Skype that fixes the problem. Go to the Skype site, download and install the newest version ofc the program.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>For anyone reading this, I figured out the problem after surfing the web for the past 3-4 weeks. Painful process. I have a paid version of Advanced SystemCare Pro, v5.2.0. 3-4 weeks ago, while scanning through it's vast offerings, I came
 across a feature I could activate called "Smart RAM". I turned it on and checked the 5 boxes it offers in the settings. The last of those 5 is "Clean Clipboard". I unchecked this box a few minutes ago and it fixed my issues. I now have no problems with copy/paste.
 Info only, it case it helps anyone.</p>

<p>&lt;snip&gt;<span>&nbsp; </span>Hi, I recently came across this problem in MS Word 2007 where after I type or hit any key on my keyboard while in the Word window, I can no longer highlight text with my mouse (by clicking once at the beginning
 of the text and dragging the mouse to the end of the text portion that I want to highlight). I have found that if I click out of the Word window and press any key on the keyboard, this seems to resolve the problem and I can finally highlight with my mouse.
 However, as soon as I type anything in the Word window again, highlighting with the mouse no longer works. Clicking on any key again within the Word window does not resolve the issue- I have to push a key outside the Word window in order to resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; Hi, I just figured out the problem. I had installed the Synergy program 1.5 weeks ago and by uninstalling it the problem appears to be resolved. Thank you both for your time and help. &nbsp;&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; I had the same problem, i ran windword in safe mode successfully and disabled ABBYY FineReader 9.0 and the problem was solved as well, all is fine now and office is awesome!!&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; <span>
I ran my old Word 2010 and removed the ABBYY add-in. I didn't have to disable the whole program. I also did the "Quick Repair" and the "Online Repair" of Office 2013 Preview, but I'm pretty sure it was the add-in removal that made the difference.
</span>&lt;/snip</p>

</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Alright, well, I found the answer to this final issue: I only needed to disable the Bluetooth add-in on Options. I have no idea why that would have been the problem, but I found it as a suggested fix

<p>Thanks for all your help everyone.</p>
<p>As a recap:</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>My Office 2010 was a Click-to-Run version</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Word suddenly giving me messages about "Downloading the Required Feature," freezing up, slowing down...</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Ultimately had to uninstall Office</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Reinstalled it from the Microsoft website with my product key, choosing the 64-bit version instead of the Click-to-Run version</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Installed all new updates from Windows Updates</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restarted computer</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Word working quickly with no messages, but became unresponsive when trying to open old files</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Went to File-&gt;Options-&gt;Add-Ins-&gt;Go-&gt; and unchecked Bluetooth.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Everything seems to be back to normal, if not better than before.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
<p>
My problem is if I copy text from a web site or from Excel, Access etc into Word all I get is a black spot.</p>
<p>
I have tried a repair install and checking all the settings against my laptop - where this function works properly.
</p>
<p>The problem is caused by a defective Bluetooth add-in for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, turn off the Com Addin.</p>
<p><b><span>Additional Notes:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The defective Bluetooth add-in is usually installed by a Bluetooth driver. (In my case - Intel Centrino Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed Adaptor (v1.1))</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Updating your Bluetooth driver (or reverting to an older version) may also resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Unfortunately simply disabling the add-in through the Word options may result in a 3 second freeze when loading Word 2007. (If this is a problem, changing to a different bluetooth driver version may be the better option)</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Oddly enough, this ended up being the cause of my problem. I had an older print driver installed on my Win7 machine and once I removed that driver, Word started working without any problems!</p>
<p>You can delete individual printer drivers by going into the registry. Note that simply going to Printers and Faxes and deleting a printer there does not delete the printer driver.</p>
<p>Follow <strong><span>Step 3</span></strong> in my previous post about a printer error to remove the printer drivers:</p>

<span>Here is a truely Off-the-wall solution that is in the same class as bad RAM and bad Video Cards</span></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; My problem turned out to be related to the WYSE thin clients we were using to connect to the Win 2008 R2 Terminal servers.&nbsp; The software that allows/enhances use of dual screens called WYSE TXC Multi-Display v1.2.1.7 was causing
 the applications to crash (including IE 9 32bit).&nbsp; Once this software was disabled - The errors stopped.</p>
<p>I have a feeling this software doesn't like Windows Server 2008 R2.&nbsp; It was being used successfully on Server 2003.&nbsp; I have seen a&nbsp; few other posts on Google for people searching for an updated version without success. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<i>Office 2013 instead.&nbsp; I am having problems with Excel, Word and Outlook printing to two separate HP laserjet printers, models 1522nf and model 3015.&nbsp; I can print one file from these applications.&nbsp; The second file locks up the Excel, Word or Outlook
 program and the only solution that I have found is to close out of the program.&nbsp; If I restart my computer, I can then print one file beofre it locks up again.&nbsp; This only happens with my HP Laserjet Printers.&nbsp; I have a HP Officejet 8600 printer that does not&nbsp;have
 any problems printing in Office 2013 Excel, Word or Outlook.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both of my Laserjet printers will print anything on Internet Exployer or non Office based programs without any issues.&nbsp; I have downloaded the latest drivers for these printers and looked for any
 latest updates to Office 2013 and made sure that I had the most recent.</i></p>
<p>I installed the printer driver Vista version for my HP Laserjet 1522 and that fixed the problem with the Spolling / Cache issue with Office 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Buy and HP via phone could not come up with this answer.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks again!</p>

<b>Starting point when Word does something unexpected</b>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word, any version, go to Tools and then Options and study all the settings on all the tabs. You may even find some settings that
 you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If you're wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each time
 the answer was, "I'd use a Word table." By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>

            BTW - pretty sure the key combo to cause this behavior is CTRL + double tap on Left Arrow. &nbsp;On my laptop, the Home key shares with left arrow, so that may have something to do with this. &nbsp;Typically I have to hold a Function key to access Home, but maybe
 the quick double-tap is confusing it?

            <p>I ran the repair tool as you suggested, but unfortunately the issue occurred again the next day. &nbsp;I then uninstalled Office completely and re-installed. &nbsp;Two days later, the issue occurred again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think there is anything wrong with my installation of Word or Office. &nbsp;This is a problem with Word, and it sounds as if it has been around for several versions of Word, at least from this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had this happen on my desktop PC, nor on any laptops that I have owned that have dedicated keys for Home/End/Pg Up/Pg Down. &nbsp;But the two laptops that i have owned that have smaller keyboards, and combine those four keys with the arrow keys,
 have both suffered this issue. &nbsp;To me, that indicates that there is an issue with Word interpreting input from that keyboard type correctly. &nbsp;No, it is not my keyboard. &nbsp;I have seen this issue on two different laptops, plus a replacement keyboard, plus it
 does NOT occur in any other application, including other Office applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an extremely harmful issue, as Word is completely unresponsive after it happens, and you lose all work since the last save. &nbsp;Surely there is a work-around or a fix out there?</p>

            <p>Since you think the problem is related to specific keyboards or keyboard types, have you tried using a different keyboard with those problem computers.&nbsp; Yes, lugging an external keyboard with a laptop is a PITA, so your users have to decide which is more

</p><p>I've been using external keyboards (MS Wave) with my last 2 laptops, for almost 10 years now.&nbsp; It can be done.

    <title>Lumia 520 battery issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lulusantos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 520 battery issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm using the Nokia Lumia 520. Please bear with me while I explained my usage of the phone throughout the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I charged the phone to full at 11pm. Use it for news before bed (Nextgen Reader) for about 15 minutes. After that, turned on battery saver with wifi on and left it for the night. (battery saver turned off when I wake up around 8am)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the morning , use it for news again, sync and read, and browsing with IE for about 30 minutes with 3g.</p>
<p>Then use it again for news and IE with wifi this time , for about an hour. There's a youtube video lasting 2+ minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Went for exam at 2pm, 3g on. Came out about 4.30pm , my phone battery is at 27%. Reached home wifi on, left it in the room. Battery critical notification came around 6.00pm. Turned on battery saver with wifi on. Phone dead when I check around 8pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In between there's 2-3 phone calls all lasting no more than 5 minutes. And whenever 3g is on, wifi is off and vice versa. Battery settings indicate around 19 hours since last charge, if i remember corrrectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this normal battery life for lumia 520? Oh, and every time I use wifi/3g for IE/nextgen reader, the back of the phone become warm very quickly. It's quite warm because i can feel it through my jeans/pants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should i send the phone for checkup, or it's normal for the lumia 520?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the long post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            It does sound about normal, especially when using it on 3G data as network conditions can greatly affect battery life.<br />
<br />
I suggest overnight that you put it in flight mode instead as this will save the most battery.

<p>Hi, thanks for your reply. It's actually my first smartphone, so not quite used to phone lasting less than a day.</p>
<p>3g seems to be pretty draining on the battery. But is background tasks very battery consuming as well?</p>

            Certain background tasks can be battery consuming mainly ones that require a constant connection (like chat apps) and ones that are just badly optimised.<br />

<p>Ok, my phone's battery was working fine for a couple of weeks then failed altogether. It was about 50% charged, so the battery wasn't empty. After hours of charging it still says it is charging and won't turn on. If I unplug it, my phone will turn off, and
 plugging it back in will just lead it to "charge" again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where this gets interesting. My previous phone was a Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, and has the same charger albeit an older, less powerful one. It is now 3 and a half years old, so the battery life is pretty low as expected. That battery works fine in
 my Lumia, so I'm ok with that but battery life is a pain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when I put the unchargeable Lumia battery into my 5800, my 5800 works perfectly, and shows up as fully charged. When I switch it back into ym Lumia it says it is empty and just "charges" without turning on properly, and back in my 5800 it works
 fine still, not empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I just get a new battery? As it works fine in my old phone but not my Lumia, it's strange to me and suggests it is not a charging issue, but rather a compatibility one, somehow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help,</p>
<p>Joe</p>

            hi mate, are you sure that you have the correct battery installed on your Lumia 520? it has the model number BL-5J. also check that you are up to date with the latest firmware for your device, and also that you are fully up to date with the latest Nokia
 system app updates from the Store. also try performing a soft reset. failing the above, a hard reset may be in order.

<p>Yes, both batteries have the model number BL-5J. My software on my phone is fully up to date, i.e Lumia Black. I reset my phone recently to factory settings due to a couple of buttons not working. The technical support suggested doing that to see if the
 buttons would work afterwards, which they didn't so I need to send ym phont in to Nokia Care as it is. At factory settings the battery still didn't work, and after using the software recovery tool to get Lumia Black back the battery still doesn't work with
 my Lumia, so it is being a pain in the **bleep**.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said I am using an alternative battery so it's not like I'm without a phone, so I'm fortunate that my previous phone was a Nokia. Although I'm waiting out on getting a new battery in case it does this again... It still works fine on my 5800, completely
 fine, just not with my Lumia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E: Sorry for such a late reply, didn't get a notification saying that there was a reply until today, but will keep an eye on this thread in case.</p>

    <title>Favorites and passwords deleted by a reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melampo_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Favorites and passwords deleted by a reset</h2>
                    <p>Since Internet Explorer was acting pretty crazy on one of my <strong>3 computers
</strong>I decided to <strong>reset </strong>it, which made me lose all of my bookmarks and passwords on that particular device. I was expecting to be able to sync all of my data back from the cloud once I was done tinkering with that laptop.<br />
<br />
<strong>The opposite happened</strong>: all of my passwords and bookmarks got <strong>
deleted </strong>on my <em>second </em>PC too, which was powered on and connected to the internet while I was resetting the laptop. 2 years of work lost in a a few minutes.<br />
<br />
My <em>third </em>computer, however, has not been powered on since yesterday, prior to the whole "resetting" thingy, so in theory it should still have all of my data, at least until I power it on and connect it to the internet.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to manually <strong>save the passwords and the bookmarks </strong>
stored on the third PC in order to be able to restore 'em and my other 2 computers?
</p>

Speaking about passwords, I already tried exporting/restoring them using the Credential Manager, but it let me transfer only 3 passwords, not so much compared to the hundreds I had before.<br />
I'm not copying one by one all of my passwords - all 450 of them - from the third machine - not connected to the internet, naturally - to the first and the second ones.<br />
It's a real pain having to do that manually, but I guess there's nothing else I can do...

<p>
</p><p>Yes, Credential Manager seems to not save all,&nbsp; or even most, website passwords. I don't know why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is that you will probably only have to login manually to a few sites each day and after doing that AutoComplete will have saved those passwords.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Favorites/bookmarks shouldn't have been deleted. A reset (RIES) doesn't do that. Something else must have happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest procedure might work. On the affected computers, go to ["C:\Users\your account name\Favorites"] Right-click Favorites&gt; Properties. Previous versions. Try to restore a previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the 3rd computer&nbsp;*not* connected to the internet, copy the Favorites folder at
</p>
<p>["C:\Users\your account name\Favorites"] to a Flash drive, USB hard drive, etc. and From Internet Explorer&gt; File&gt; Import and export&gt; export Favorites to a file.</p>
<p>(Old article, but the IE8 instructions will work on IE9, 10 or 11)<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/211089?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/211089?wa=wsignin1.0</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can import that HTM file into other computers or copy Favorites to the Favorites folder. Copy Favorites/Internet shortcuts, don't just copy the folder or sub-folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Passwords...</p>
<p>Some, but not all passwords will be in Credential Manager. On the unaffected computer, backup your credentials.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.7tutorials.com/how-backup-and-restore-windows-vault-passwords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.7tutorials.com/how-backup-and-restore-windows-vault-passwords</a>

</p>
<p>You can copy that file to the other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For passwords not in Credential Manager...</p>
<p>(This was easier in earlier versions of IE) If it's not installed, install Chrome.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/chrome/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Chrome click the 3 horizontal bars in the upper right&gt; Bookmarks&gt; Import bookmarks and settings&gt; &nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>After importing passwords, favorites, etc. into Chrome go back to 3 horizontal bars in the upper right&gt; Settings&gt; (at the bottom) Show advanced settings&gt; Passwords and forms&gt; Manage passwords.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You won't be able to import or copy those back into IE, but they will be listed so you can login to affected sites.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 hangs, only opens in safe mode, Windows 10 home premium</h2>
                    A while back all of a sudden outlook would not open. I would get the message to try opening in safe mode and it worked. Then followed all instructions to disable all add ins on Outlook but that did not solve. Went to program files as guided to run scanpst.exe
 but it cannot locate. Yes, I have the original install discs, but hate to lose all current .pst files such as contacts, deleted items, quick reference emails. Hope someone has an answer. Thanks

            When I open Outlook 2007 emails, under Trust one goes in with administrative privileges and can disable any or all of the add ins listed. I did so one by one, yet Outlook still failed to open normally. I had all listed add ins disabled to no avail. Once
 in a great while Outlook email will open normally, but then revert back to only working in Safe Mode. I have run malware scans and virus scans to no avail. Thanks

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to be able to help you with your concern, we would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>When did you first encounter this issue?</li><li>Are you receiving the error message only when opening Excel application? How about other Office programs?</li><li>Any changes that took place on your computer before this issue occurred? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you perform the troubleshooting steps below to isolate the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Excel in safe mode. Right-click the <strong>Start </strong>button (lower-left corner) in Windows, and click
<strong>Run.</strong> In the Run box, type <strong>excel /safe</strong>, and click
<strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><br />
2. Check if there is an available update for your Office. Here's the <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for detailed steps.</p>
<p><br />
Once done, please check if you are able to open your Excel application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result and please provide the required information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Josh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting the query here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the below related articles about FERPA and now understand the statutory requirements to protect students' educational rights and privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/brochures/parents.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Parents' Guide to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act: Rights Regarding Children’s Education Records</a></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's focus on the affected workbook here now. First of all, my questions are:</p>
<p>1. Is your Excel up-to-date? Excel &gt; About Microsoft Excel, the latest version is 16.21(19011500). Please make sure you have updated it to the latest version.</p>
<p>2. Where is it located?</p>
<p>If on local drive, can you copy it to Desktop and try opening it to check result?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If on cloud, can you open it via Excel Online on browser?</p>
<p>3. If you perform safe mode, does the error message still occur?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Reference:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use safe mode to isolate issues with your Mac</a><span>.</span></p>

<p>Hi Tina,</p>
<p>here are the replies to the above questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) excel is indeed up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) the file was under the “Recents” tab when opening excel. Since the initial problem the file has been removed from this list; however, other files are still in this list that are giving the same error. &nbsp;When searching for the main file I’m concerned about,
 nothing appears in the search of local disc. &nbsp;It was not ever stored on a cloud and attempting to copy to desktop does not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) the error is still occuring in safe mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Josh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, could you please confirm the location of the affected workbook? From your description "It was not ever stored on a cloud and attempting to copy to desktop does not work", it is stored on your local drive. Let me know if there is any misunderstanding
 on my side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, as the workbook involves FERPA and the error message occurs to other workbooks, could you please first upload non-sensitive workbook to cloud (e.g. OneDrive for Business or OneDrive) and try opening it via Excel Online?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If OK via Excel Online, then we can infer that your Excel may be corrupted. Here are the suggestions:</p>
<p><span>1. Perform the steps on your Excel</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. Clear&nbsp;Excel&nbsp;cache.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; a.&nbsp; &nbsp; First, make sure that&nbsp;Excel&nbsp;is not running</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; b.&nbsp; &nbsp; From Finder Go &gt; Go to Folder... (Shift+Cmd+G)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; c.&nbsp; &nbsp; Enter "~/Library/Containers" and press Go (Return key)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; d.&nbsp; &nbsp; Find the "com.microsoft.Excel" folder</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; e.&nbsp; &nbsp; Select and delete that folder using File/Move to Trash (Cmd+Delete)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Clear Office related KeyChain Access (Skip this step if your keychain is empty now):</span></p>

<p>I would expect to have that problem if the enclosing folder of your files was renamed or moved in Finder. See if you can locate your files using Spotlight</p>
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use Spotlight on your Mac - Apple Support</a>
<p>
</p><p>Performing a Safe Boot fixes problems with your file system, so if there were issues before, they should be fixed now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the name of your startup volume and any enclosing folders of your files. Be sure the names do not have any special characters such as slashes or mathematical operators.</p>
