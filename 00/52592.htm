                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install/update a software on my computer, but the system asked me to enter user name and password. After I enter the details, there was a window pop-up says "the requested operation requires elevation". I tried to use cmd (run as administrator),
 but the same window pop up again.</p>
<p>I am the only user for this computer, but it seems like I am not the admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate if any of you can assist to solve the problem.</p>

<h2>            XboX One Guide with SAT BOX</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i use my XBOX One since Day one :-) Now i wanted to use also the Xbox one Guide with a SAT Receiver. I have no cable only signal via Sat.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It is no problem to connect the receiver via HDMI to XboX and get the signal on the TV.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The issue is that it is not possible to remote the SAT Receiver via KINECT or XBOX One Guide.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tryed to different Models of SAT Receivers and also to get information about compatible products from Customer Service but also they had no list with compatibel models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone using XBOX One Guide with a SAT Receiver and could tell me about compatibel Products?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Sebastian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank for coming to the forums with your question. What I have been able to find is most are not compatible with the Xbox. There is a
<a href="https://pdp.com/shop/talon-media-remote-remote-control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
remote</a> that is for the Xbox itself that you can use since its all going through one guide.</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 Sulks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bernard46  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Sulks</h2>
                    <p>I've had a numver of situations on different Windows 10 installations where it seems to have gone into contemplative mode for long periods of time and I'm wondering if anyone else has seen this and has any ideas on what is going on. Typically the problem
 happens without any real warning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically it seems to happen at Windows startup when for no apparent reason the Windows 10 system seems to start up - one can logon normally, but then it responds to only a limited set of things. For instance right now I have a situation on a friends machine
 where it has started but it refuses to let me bring up control panel, Firefox etc but it will show task manager and Windows Explorer. According to task manager the system is hardly doing anything at all - looking at the hardware the disk light flashes once
 every second or two. However if I click on Control Panel nothing happens, and I mean nothing. If I click on Firefox I may see a screen flash and then go away, the same for the Edge browser. Equally if I try to Power Off - nothing happens!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had other Win 10 systems with this type of behaviour and in the end I've left the machine running for several hours and it seems to have sorted itself out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this behaviour ring a bell with anyone?</p>

            <p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10, although drivers should always be up to date given the way Windows now processes updates, this is a bit more difficult to establish since Windows itself attempts to provide many drivers which would previously have been provided by device
 manufacturers - it is an unfortunate fact that in a lot of cases these Windows provided drivers do not implement the full functionality of the devices (especially in the case of printers). In my latest experience (but only this latest experience) of this "sulk"
 Windows appeared to have implemented the wrong drivers for an HP printer and we had told the system to remove the printer, so that we could reboot and install a valid driver (based on our research it appeared the only option for this printer was a Windows
 10 provided driver - which made me even more concerned as to why Win 10 had got it wrong initially!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again in response to your question about all pending updates it is more difficult to avoid installing pending updates now, but in all cases as far as I am aware all pending updates have been applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in the post this is an issue that has occurred on a variety of systems over some months, so it is not a function of any one specific issue, and I do not believe there were any issue with drivers previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for changes, Windows 10 is continuously making changes to itslef so it is difficult to give a definitive answer to your question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole point of my post was to see if others were experiencing a situation which seems to be new with Windows 10 whereby Windows goes into a "sulk" from which it (so far) has always eventually seemed to come out of (it may take many hours even on a reasonable
 machine with adequate hardware resources). However whist it is in this "sulk" it is only partially responsive - i.e. it will allow the user to logon as normal, at the normal time, some actions like bringing up task manager and moving around task manager work
 fine, file explorer seems to work fine, but other requests like for example invoking control panel, Firefox and other apps are just ignored (or perhaps acted on for a millisecond - you do sometimes get a split second flash of a window). Its a very frustrating
 experience when it does happen because there appears to be nothing much one can do except wait patiently for it to come back to life. One other characteristic of this behaviour seems to be that Windows shut down goes on for ever - so long that I have never
 timed it, just left the machine overnight to sort itself out, which so far they seem to do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the problem right now on a friends machine and I have told him to leave switched on overnight in the hope that by the morning Windows 10 will have resolved whatever problem it thinks it has and we can continue with normal life. I am interested in
 whether this is "normal" behaviour for Windows 10 based on other folks experiences. Each version of Windows has had its own idiosyncrasies - is this "sulk" that I am seeing a characteristic of Windows 10 and perhaps its enhanced error recovery procedures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your info on safe mode - if the problem is not resolved by the morning I will try to do that - quite what I should do if that is successful I'm not sure.</p>

    <title>Windows Security Center not recognizing AVG is running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hluetkenhaus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Security Center not recognizing AVG is running</h2>
                    I run AVG antivirus on my computer. About 2 days ago, it found a "trojan small.bog" in iTunes, which I have since learned was a false positive, an error made by the program with one of the most recent updates to it (I have corrected that error manually
 by adding an exception to the software). Since then, however, my Windows Security Center (WSC) is telling me that AVG is turned off. The program itself appears to be up and running with no problems, and I have never encountered this problem between AVG and
 WSC prior to this. Are the two things related? Should I be concerned that WSC is not recognizing that AVG is running, when it appears to be to me?<br />
<br />
Please advise. Thank you!

<h2>            windows 10 black screen after update and after leaving PC to sleep&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a hp pavilion laptop which was running windows 8.1 before i updated to windows 10. The update itself went fine i left it at about 98% and when i came back the screen was black but my laptop was still on and would not respond to anything i left it
 like this for a few hours but it was just the same so i had to remove the battery and put it back in, which started up my laptop and i started setting up windows 10. BUT now whenever i turn my PC off it doesn't fully shut down it comes up with the same black
 unresponsive screen and i have to remove the battery and put it back in to be able to use i again, this is probably bad for my PC and i was wondering if anyone else was experiencing the same thing and if there's any solution other than uninstalling windows
 10?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any helps appreciated, thanks!</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Olivia,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Apologize for the inconvenience that you're going through regarding this issue. Do not worry. Let me guide you in the right
 direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The main causes observed so far regarding the black screen are driver issues, output to unexpected port, and possibly also
 issues with the Lock Screen app. Please use these steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you see the black screen
<strong>only</strong> <strong>after sign-in </strong>and you can see a mouse cursor:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">While at the black screen, try using CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to start Task Manager.
</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If it becomes visible, try finding LockAppHost.exe on the Details tab and ending the task.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If this does not work, use
<strong>File</strong>, Run new task in Task Manager to start an Administrator CMD window. Use this to create a new administrator user with the following commands (changing “&lt;password&gt;” to something of the customer’s choosing):</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<strong>net user test &lt;password&gt; /add</strong><br />
<strong>net localgroup Administrators test /add</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This will give you a test user to try, which will confirm if the issue is user or system-specific. Check the PC or display adapter
 manufacturer’s site for an updated driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you see the black screen or have a flickering screen
<strong><span>before sign-in</span></strong>:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</span></li><li>
<span>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.
</span></li></ul>
</li><li>
<span>Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video.
</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video
</span></li><li>
<span>Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters
</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)
</span></li><li>
<span>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</span></li></ul>

 on dual boot. </p>

            I have never had this problem until the major windows 10 update a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Now, as soon as my PC monitor display goes off (if I step away for a few minutes) when I come back I have a black screen with only a mouse visible.&nbsp; I have to do a Ctrl-Alt-Del
 to initiate task manager, then press cancel, to get my screen back.&nbsp; Extremely frustrating.&nbsp; Started happening immediately after that huge update.

<h3> owen640  say:</h3>
<h2>            My microphone doesn&#39;t work after re installing audio drivers &#40;WINDOWS 7&#41;</h2>
                    So I got a headset and it worked perfectly. (Trust me I dont know what it is so dont ask) I downloaded the game Just cause 2 from steam and had some audio problems with it. A solution was to reinstall audio drivers. So I did... And this worked. I was going
 to start live streaming when I realized oh hey they cant hear me. SO I looked all over the internet for solutions and none of them work. In device manger I saw that I have NVIDIA High Definition Audio AND Realtek High definition Audio. I looked to see if either
 one needed updates and nope. I have a windows 7 computer so if you can help me with this that would be great. My microphone is not broken because i pluged it into my ipod and did a test it works (I have a high quality mic and you can tell the difference between
 my mic and the build in ipod touch mic.) Please help me with this!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to find if out if the issue is with the hardware or not is to test the device on a different computer. This will help us identify if the issue is with the device or the drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, try the troubleshooting steps suggested in the following article if you haven't already tried them.</p>
<p>Run the Audio Recording troubleshooter and then check if can record audio using the 'Sound Recorder' program.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/recording-audio-in-sound-recorder-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recording audio in Sound Recorder: frequently asked questions</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information helps. Let us know the status of the issue.</p>

<h2>            How do I restart everything&#63;</h2>
                    Alright I'm sure you were thinking differently when reading the title, but my question is how do I reinstall or clean vista so that's it's back to the way it was when I bought the computer. I don't have a disk because vista came pre-installed on my computer,
 but I do have a serial number on the computer.

            <span>&nbsp;If the computer manufacturer did not include Vista disk/s, there should be a Recovery Partition on your Hard drive.<br />
<br />
That is the way they do it now, most of the time. We are supposed to make the Recovery Disks ourselves, with instructions included in the installed Manufacturer's&nbsp;Software in Start &gt; All Programs.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the splash Screen at startup/power on, there usually is a Key number, F10, or F11,&nbsp;to hit to start Recovery Process, to take it back to factory standards (out of the box).<br />
<br />
Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options&nbsp;, and start a factory standards recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair computer option.<br />
<br />
See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.<br />
<br />
Each manufacturer has their own way of doing a Recovery to factory standards.<br />
<br />
And save all your Data before you do it, as a reinstall wipes everything from your Hard Drive</span>

    <title>Windows 7 PC won&#39;t update. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 PC won&#39;t update.</h2>
                    <p>My friend's Windows 7 PC just keeps&nbsp;checking for updates but hasn't found any in over 45 days. If he tries to update manually it will start the search but then just continues checking. Normally, if there were no updates, it would eventually stop searching
 and say "Windows is up to date", but it doesn't even do that. It just keeps searching and searching for as long as the computer is on.</p>
<p>He is unable to upgrade to Windows 10 because&nbsp;several major programs that he is using are not compatible with 10. (He actually had it upgraded about 6 months ago to 10 and couldn't get the programs to work so he reverted to 7. Everything was working fine
 after he reverted.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a system restore for him&nbsp;to a time just before his last successful updates and now it still does the same thing, just keeps checking continuously.</p>
<p>One last thing, on the homepage of Windows Update, before I start updates manually, it says "Windows is up to date" and it shows the last time it was updated was May 2016. It is now July.&nbsp;He gets no error messages of any kind.</p>
<p>Anyone ever seen this before?</p>

<h2>            Desktop background image replaced with solid black, can reset but goes black after reboot</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 7 professional:</div>
<div>Last week, my desktop background image was gone and replaced with a black screen. I changed images, saved as background and it stayed until I rebooted. Each time, I try a different background image that seems to stay until I restart computer the next day.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, my Windows is activated and genuine, so there is no error saying otherwise. Although I've done numerous other searches for suggestions to fix this issue, such as to perhaps deleting my admin account, the only account, or changing registry values,
 I don't want to muck around and mess it up since this is the PC that I do my work on.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I looked in event viewer, but don't see anything that might be the cause although maybe I don't know what to look for.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's just a black background, so it's not the end of the world, but something is wrong to cause it and for the image not to stay. I'm not using any themes, just Windows 7, but that is gone and instead says "unsaved theme" showing the black background.
 Although I've changed it back to Windows 7, it keeps changing to black in the same way that the desktop image is replaced with a solid black background.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please advise and thank you ever so kindly for your time and wisdom on the matter.</div>
                </div>

<br />
2. Go to the Start menu search bar (top right corner);<br />
<br />
3. Click the 'magnifying glass logo' and enter the next word;<em> 'background';</em><br />
<br />
4. Click on the option that is shown; <em>'windows background image remove'</em><br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that Windows is unable to configure the drivers for the printer due to Administrator permission issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below suggested methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>As an initial recommendation, I would suggest you <span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">to open Advanced User Accounts Control Panel to check if the&nbsp;user account you&nbsp;are currently using&nbsp;has admin rights or not,&nbsp;if not then change the permission.&nbsp;Please
 follow the below steps.</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press the Windows key and R from the keyboard to open the Run Command Dialog Box.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Enter <strong>netplwiz</strong></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the User, and choose properties and go to the Group Membership tab and choose the option for Administrator Right.</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If it does not help, <span>I would suggest you to enable the built in administrator account and check with the results if you can install the requisite drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to run the command from an elevated command prompt. To do that you need to do the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press the Windows key + R from the keyboard to open the&nbsp;Run Command Dialog Box&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Enter <strong>cmd</strong> and right-click on the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> result that should appear.</span>
</li><li><span>This opens a list of options at the bottom. Select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> there.</span>
</li><li><span>Accept the UAC prompt</span> </li><li><span>Enter the following command to enable the hidden administrator account:
<strong><span>net user administrator /active:yes</span></strong></span></li></ul>
<p>Hope the above information was helpful. If you need further assistance, please do let us know and we would be happy to help you further.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Hi, I am using a 4K display with my Windows 10 PC. For Windows 10 and MS Office, the letters are sharp and clear. However, for some applications (especially the installers), the letters look very ugly and low resolutions. As you can see, sometimes even the
 graphics (circular shapes) are not smooth. Anybody knows what is wrong and how to fix this? Thanks</p>

            Hi  workstationuser 
<br />
<br />This is unfortunately a developer issue where the engineers have probably chosen not to optimize their app interfaces for such high resolutions. Reasons can include, additional engineering required to do it, likely uses more resources, ubiquity of 4k deployments is not there to justify the cost.
<br />
<br />In such cases, its best the user lowers their screen resolution to justify it. 
<br />
<br />What you can also do as a user is contact the developer and let them know about the deficiency in their app installers and interfaces. Microsoft of course being a first party developer will optimize many of their applications for such resolutions.       
        </p>

            Hi , I am Dexter, an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />A lot of apps were created years ago when 4k monitor is not popular at that time, so they don't fit the high resolution and will display blur due to the zoom in effect. Especially for the installer( installer is actually an app too ), though a lot of new apps are created, many of them still use old installer for packaging and delivery. That's why the letters look ugly and blur, they are scratched in fact. 
<br />
<br />In order to fix this, you could try these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Right click on the desktop - "Display settings"
<br />
<br />2. Below the text "Change the size of text, apps, and other items", set to "100%"
<br />This setting may cause the text in some apps to seem very small but will appear with a clear edge.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p><span>We operate a virtual business and Skype is our main communications tool so not receiving sound notification of incoming messages from our colleagues is exceptionally frustrating. &nbsp;</span></p>

            I just recently upgraded to the latest version of Skype and I have reinstalled it several times in hopes that this issue would be resolved. It did not. Can you post the instructions on what to do next?

            Hi Stuart, this Microsoft admit it is a known issue. &nbsp;Downgrading to Skype v7 is what Microsoft recommended to me, but I still had the same problem with Skype v7. &nbsp;They also recommend trying v8.25 and 8.26, to see if they worked. &nbsp;We are on v8.27 now and
 still have the same problem. &nbsp;I'm exploring "Slack" as an alternative for our business. &nbsp;

    <title>Unloading the Box problem on Flight Simulator X Standard Edition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amc1995  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unloading the Box problem on Flight Simulator X Standard Edition &#34;An error was encountered.&#34; &#34;Unspecified error&#34; &#34; on Windows XP SP3</h2>
                    
<p>original title:Unloading the Box problem on Flight Simulator X Standard Edition<br />
<br />
I bought and downloaded Flight Simulator X Standard Edition from the Microsoft Store on Google Chrome. It downloaded fine but they were all .box files so&nbsp;I&nbsp;tried different things like&nbsp;trying&nbsp;to open the&nbsp;files with Internet Explorer. It didn't work so I then
 searched on the&nbsp;internet for what the problem could be&nbsp;and then&nbsp;found out&nbsp;that it works on Internet Explorer and not on Google Chrome&nbsp;because of the Microsoft Download Manager. I downloaded all 10 parts&nbsp;(which were 9&nbsp;.box files and 1 .exe file) again on Internet
 Explorer which opened up the Microsoft Download Manager&nbsp;this time&nbsp;and after it had finished downloading all the parts (a few hours later), I launched the .exe file and it started the&nbsp;unloading the box window. After about 3 bars of it unloading the first .box
 file it comes up with a message saying "An error was encountered." "Unspecified error" I'm not sure if it's because I made all the previous files I downloaded open with&nbsp;Internet Explorer or anything else I may have done wrong. I also know that the system requirements
 for the game to run is Windows XP Service Pack 2 and I have a Service Pack 3, maybe it is because of this? Any ideas? Sorry if it's abit of a long explanation but I just wanted to make sure you guys/girls got what I was on about! :)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I don't know how long that URL will hold up.&nbsp; I just used my HP Support Assistant and clicked on Visit the HP Support Forums Forums, etc to get that.</p>
<p>And to get that I just pressed Win- and typed HP.&nbsp;&nbsp; More possibilities for self-help specific to your machine that way.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>BTW I don't have the same machine that you do so I'm just assuming that yours would have similar support possibilities built in it that I see in mine.</p>

            <p>Before you do ANYTHING it might be a good idea to save any critical data you might have.</p>
<p>See here on how to do that.</p>
<p><a href="http://gordonburgessparker.wordpress.com/2011/10/14/how-to-recover-critical-data-from-a-non-booting-windows-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to recover Critical data from a non-booting Windows machine</a></p>
<p>Then firstly try repairing the system.</p>
<p>From the User Manual for your machine:</p>
<p>Using Startup options to fix problems<br />
If the operating system fails to start properly, you may have to<br />
change your system’s configuration or verify the startup procedure<br />
to fix the problem. To do this, use the options in the Startup menu.<br />
To open the Startup menu:<br />
1 Restart your computer.<br />
2 Press F8 when your computer starts and before Windows® starts<br />
loading.<br />
The Windows® Advanced Boot Options menu displays these<br />
options:<br />
❖ Repair Your Computer<br />
❖ Safe Mode<br />
❖ Safe Mode with Networking<br />
❖ Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
❖ Enable Boot Logging<br />
❖ Enable low-resolution video (640 x 480)<br />
❖ Last Known Good Configuration (advanced)<br />
❖ Directory Services Restore Mode<br />
❖ Debugging Mode<br />
❖ Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
❖ Disable Driver Signature Enforcement<br />
❖ Start Windows® Normally</p>
<p>Select Last Known Good Configuration and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, return to that menu and choose Repair Your Computer.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then you need to use the Recovery Partition supplied by Toshiba.</p>
<p>Go here for the User Manual, and scroll down to page 53 which tells you how to do it.</p>

    <title>Version 1803&#58; Windows rearranged after unlocking the desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#91;josef&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Version 1803&#58; Windows rearranged after unlocking the desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two days ago my Windows 10 got upgraded from version 1709 to version 1803 and since then I keep solving issues. One that drives me crazy is the behavior of the desktop after I lock it, leave the computer be for some time and then unlock it: When that happens,
 positions and sizes of application windows get changed. It looks very much like Windows decided to change the resolution to something like the half of the actual display resolution, rearrange windows accordingly and then when I get back to the computer, switch
 back to the original resolution. That would be consistent with the observed behavior that if I simply lock the desktop and immediately unlock it, everything stays fine - my guess is that the window rearrangement happens if my display goes to sleep.*)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to force Windows to keep the resolution I use? It would be perfectly fine to even disable every other resolution. But I need some solution, I hate having to rearrange the windows every single time I need to leave my computer for
 a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system config: Windows 10 Pro, version 1803. The display is EIZO 2455 and I am using the video card built into Core i7-8400, with drivers supplied with Windows (I did not install any external drivers). Display resolution is 1920x1200x32, the lock screen
 image is a fixed image with this resolution as well. Sleep, hibernation and similar options are disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*) Now that I am thinking about it, I realize that I had another screen-sleep-related issue - originally, I had power settings configured so that the display would be turned off after 15 minutes of inactivity. That worked perfectly fine with 1709, but with
 1803, the display gets turned off but then never goes on again - I have to disconnect the DisplayPort cable and reconnect it to get my screen back. So I disabled turning off the display in Windows and only kept the turn-off in my monitor's menu.</p>

<p>Hello E for Excel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks. I will of course try it out, but I don't really see how any of the steps are relevant to my issue. I am not having any trouble with the Updates installing, the trouble is that after the successful installation the OS behaves in an undesired way.
 The Integrity Checklist is probably worth a try and I will go through it when I get to my computer, but without the computer here in front of me for a reference, I would say that most of the points are either fine or irrelevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is not that something is not working. The problem is that Windows keep rearranging my windows - presumebly as a result changing the screen&nbsp; resolution unnecessarily.</p>
<p>

            Interesting. It turns out that the update *really* did mess up a display driver ("Device DISPLAY\ENC2533\4&amp;34b6aea0&amp;0&amp;UID200195 was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match."). I am now searching for the meaning of this message and possible fixes
 in the hope that it will remove the desktop rearrangements that I hate.&nbsp; I will report back with the results.

            Well, turns out that driver didn't have anything to do with the resolution changes. So I still don't know what's causing them. :-(

<p>Well, after rather extensive research it turns out that this is a problem without real solution. It appears that it is a combination of issues between the hardware (a display), the video card and the operating system: If a display is connected using DisplayPort
 (and, according to some, using HDMI or even DVI-D), it reports its state using EDID. This may or may not be taken up by the video card driver and passed on to the operating system, which may or may not react in some way. In my case, and apparently in many
 others', it thinks that when I turn the display on, a new display was connected and for some unknown reason rearranges the windows. It is not clear why it does that. Apparently there is no real universal solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Some drivers can fake the EDID information, making the OS think th display has been connected all the time. It seems that AMD/ATI were the first to implement this, followed by Nvidia, and I am not sure about the current state of Intel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There are hardware devices which block the signal that the monitor was turned off. It seems their reliability leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of the solutions above only work for some users. If I were to make a guess from my tests, it's because they are focusing at the wrong place in the display shutdown process - as far as I am able to tell, the rearranging of the windows does not occur
 until the display is actually turned on again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What worked for me was a workaround - I used an utility which enumerates the visible windows' positions before the switch, then recovers them after. Specifically, I used RestoreWindows ( https://github.com/gurrhack/RestoreWindows ), but there are others.
 Not the solution I would like, but given the fact the reports of my issue date back to 2012 and Windows Vista, it seems that Microsoft won't be fixing the real cause any time soon.</p>
