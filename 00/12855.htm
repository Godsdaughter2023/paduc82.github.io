    <title>cursor skipping - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teadrinkerone  say:</h3>
<h2>            cursor skipping</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have word 2013. &nbsp;I find &nbsp;while typing the cursor skips all over either backwards or forwards. &nbsp;For example I was writing the word "beyond" in a middle of a sentence. &nbsp;The "b" was there but the rest of the word skipped over an entire paragraph and "eyond"
 started a new one. &nbsp;Sometimes the second half of the sentence will be before the first have of the sentence. &nbsp;It does the same thing jumping backwards. I use the undo key &nbsp;to find where the cursor went.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had this problem? &nbsp;It is most annoying and slows my writing down.</p>

<p>Thank you for responding, No I am not sure how to repair the installation. I have used all the help menus on the pc that have made attempts to repairThe only way I know is to reinstall Office Suite...I can not lose excel files either. I think my pst files
 are safe now. I'll keep checking as I reverted to using my ISP email which I do not care for. I want outlook back. Thank you. Mark</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just figured out how to repair outlook, after trying both options, neither repaired outlook. Word is fine, power point is fine, no viruses on pc. Now how do I delete office or more so make sure I save my files. I can figure out how to delete it and reinstall
 it. The files I'm worried about. Can you see my concern. :) Thank you</p>

                    Hi,<br />
<br />
A couple of months ago I sent a new post regarding N95 IMAP inbox unable to retrieve new messages.<br />
<br />
The problem remains but the strange I think is in order to get the account works again, I have to delete it and create it with a different name. If I create it with the same, failure continues.<br />
<br />
Has anyone experienced IMAP problems?

you can receive from an imap inbox, but you have to setup a new account for sending using pop3. Nokia needs to fix this problem. I have an N95-1 -Update v20+

            I don't understand... you can't send from IMAP account? In my case, I can... but, imap seems to be UNRELIABLE in term of messages showing.<br />
<br />
I switch to POP definitly and I also use the GMAL client.

</p><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Same problem here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can right click on ODFB, but I have no settings or other unlink options.</p>
<p>I need to log in with a different account to use it. And I don't want to reinstall my Windows again (!).</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

            <p>Hi CasparG74,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the screenshot, you are using the legacy OneDrive for Business sync client (groove.exe) rather than the new OneDrive sync client (OneDrive.exe), that's why you don't have the setting or unlink options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you need to sign in with different accounts to OneDrive client in your computer, we suggest you using the New OneDrive sync client to meet this requirement.
<span>Here is the <strong><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-syncing-SharePoint-sites-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-Preview-6de9ede8-5b6e-4503-80b2-6190f3354a88?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></span></strong>
 with detailed steps to install and configure the new sync client for your reference.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,<br />
Frank</span></p>

<h2>            An app that..</h2>
                    
<p>Allows to access a shared file/folder on a network and to buffer a video/song that you wish to watch/listen to instead of downloading it completely then being able to watch it?<br />
<br />
I have already purchased myExplorer and it is pretty useful, except it has to transfer the media file before being able to play it. But this fault may lay on the actual video player, and not the program.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why Nokia has not integrated this feature into their phones?</p>

<h3> barrysutton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling Visio Pro 2010 - invalid product key</h2>
                    <p>Just replaced my old W7 PC with a new W7 PC; re-installed MSOffice 2007.&nbsp; I then reinstalled Visio Pro 2010 - when trying to activate Visio I am told "product cannot be activated because the product key is not valid". Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling
 but still not activating. Have tried phone-activation, same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The product id I can see in the File&gt;Help pane is different to the one that I see if I run a 3rd party registry interrogator which purports to pull out the Product Key and the Product ID. Curiously the 3rd party software does display the correct product
 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions how to get Visio activated?</p>

<p>Use phone activation, do not respond to any prompts untill given the option to speak to a real person. - best done during normal business hours, where you will hopefully speak with a local person</p>
<p>Third party utilities would not usually be able to detect a Key, unless the Office product has been activated, the Key is not contained within the installation</p>
<p>I assume the purchase of Viso was from a verified seller</p>

            <p>Tried phoning the activation team - only able to speak to Asian call centre who have limited options available. After 3 goes I gave up. Eventually managed to get hold of someone in UK microsoft who put me through to customer services. There I was told that
 the product key was associated with a business volume licence and was not a stand-alone package. I bought this from a 3rd party retailer via Amazon in 2011 as a private user and used it (successfully activated) for 2.5yrs. There is no information on the CD
 box that indicates it is part of a business license package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only on replacing my PC have I had the problem. I have&nbsp;tried to reinstall it on my old PC which was re-formatted. It will install but will not activate - the interface says the Product Key is invalid. So why does it install? And why did it install and activate
 in 2011?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told that the position I am now in is to either pay for a buisness volume licence (which I do not need) or to buy another copy of Visio at over £200. Either way I feel I have been cheated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I am not clear about the disctinction between Product Key, Installation Id and Product Id. Can some one explain?</p>

            Hi Ryan,<br />
<br />
It’s not feasible to move task cards between different plans or boards. We can only move task cards between boards within a plan.<br />
<br />
In this case, I’d like to invite you submit this idea at our <a href="https://planner.uservoice.com/forums/330525-microsoft-planner-feedback-forum?query=move%20tasks%20between%20plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Column width in scheduling assistant - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lonomad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Column width in scheduling assistant</h2>
                    <p>so.. this relates to the automatic width of the columns in scheduling assistant where the first column(which holds the most information) is the smallest and the other two which contain 1 word are enormous!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now...im hoping I'm missing something and can change it but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>this has clearly been a known issue over a number of editions, at least back to 2013 ed. with lots of questions asked in here, with usually naff replies like - 'we listen to your feedback'
</p>
<p>
</p><p>well...CLEARLY YOU DONT if there is a (seemingly) simple yet enormously annoying problem with expanding the width of the first column - particularly when trying to book rooms and large meeting groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so please, and again, forgive me if ive missed something but otherwise, please fix this issue that has been reported FIVE YEARS ago.</p>

<p>Desiree,</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the steps I've taken so far...</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp; I uninstalled, and then re-installed Office 365;</p>
<p>
</p><p>b.&nbsp; I did a Quick Repair and a Full Repair ...it didn't work;</p>
<p>
</p><p>c.&nbsp; I went to You Tube and searched some vids with a common concern.&nbsp; One You Tuber suggested I try changing the Compatibility Mode...it also didn't work...still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>d.&nbsp; I called Microsoft Support and spoke to a guy in India who tired to help me with no avail.&nbsp; He referred me to Microsoft Advanced Technical Support;</p>
<p>
</p><p>e.&nbsp; I'm now waiting for Microsoft Advanced Technical Support to call me back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>f.&nbsp; I got frustrated, curled up in the corner, and cried while eating a big bowl of chocolate ice cream.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Okay....maybe (f) was a little too personal. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my computer Is also asking me to Activate Windows!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ishwar,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per description, I understand that you need to know how to play games in full screen on Windows 10, we will help you to resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> I suggest you to check the resolution of the game as well as the resolution with in the computer and see if you are able to play the games in full screen.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sometimes websites don't look like you expect them to–images might not appear, menus might be out of place, and text could be jumbled together. This might be caused by a compatibility problem between Internet Explorer
 and the site you're on. Sometimes this can be fixed by adding the site to your Compatibility View list.</span></span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the game in Compatibility mode and check:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix site display problems with Compatibility View</a></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Update/Install the Display Adapter driver.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, I suggest you to install/update the Display Adapter driver.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Steps to install the drivers for the Display Adapter:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click on the Start button from the desktop and select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the list of <strong>Hardware</strong> categories, double-click the category your device is in and then double-tap the device you want. For example, to see your video card, click
<strong>Display</strong> <strong>adapters</strong>, and then double-click the video card name.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click the <strong>Driver</strong> tab, click <strong>
Update Driver</strong>, and then follow the instructions. You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If it works fine otherwise try to search for the drivers with the help of model number of your computer from the Manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I hope this helps you. If you have any further query in future, feel free to contact us. We will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            As you have installed a BETA SOFTWARE and it will have glitches, bugs I suggest that you get the lastest Insiders build ISO and do a clean install as it has been posted many times that doing upgrades sometimes carries over bugs from early builds and just
 keeps getting worst. as I have 3 systems running on the 14361 build with no issues . now this is just my suggestion

            <p>Thank you for your suggestion for morons. We test Beta OSs for a living as I have posted many times over many builds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an upgrade from a clean install of 352. And I'm really pleased to hear that you and your cohort have had no issues with this build, it must make MSFT's little heart really glad. It is of course quite possible that your 3 systems are considerably
 dissimilar to this laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other 8 machines running this software seem OK, none get switched off though and 5 run only one program continuously. It seems to be the start up/restart that does it, and could be just one driver involved, but seeing the numerous network issues reported
 here, I rather suspect that the OS is involved. Certainly it seems recognised that there are issues with USB and wifi connectivity. This is the only machine that I have not connected by Ethernet. (However 3 different wifi NICs with different chipsets all have
 issues)</p>

<p>Don't know what to say.&nbsp; I have 2 daily drivers at 14361, 1 is Enterprise and 1 is Pro.&nbsp;&nbsp; These HP notebooks are not powerhouses but have 4GB RAM and good hard drive space and just perform flawlessly. &nbsp; I sort of prefer these to a few HP&nbsp; twins that are

</p><p>I recently came across a Toshiba laptop with a looping and useless W7.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to pull all data off of the hard drive with a little hard drive to USB harness.&nbsp; I then did a clean install to W10 Pro which wiped the drive and I was then able to return
 all personal files and data.&nbsp; The clean install dropped about 50 GB of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had 2 spare 120 GB hard drives sitting around from a dead HP.&nbsp; The drive that had W8 on it when it died was sitting with only about 14 GB open space so was in question as to whether it could upgrade to W10.&nbsp; Just for kicks, I swapped the drive into
 another HP and did a clean install to W10 Pro.&nbsp; The new W10 install dropped that drive down to having about 60 GB of open space and runs like a top.&nbsp;

</p><p>I think @joenamco offers up a great suggestion.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a clean install drops in the range of 50GB of data off of a hard drive, there has to a lot of useless stuff on there.</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>apologies to Joe for my rather ascerbic reply. I just see the same thing posted repeatedly by him to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As as stated in my original post I had exactly the same issue with 332. Then 342 fixed everything and I installed that build across all the Windows machines in my dept. (Which seemed to equally dismay Joe and ? Clayton). 352 installed patchily, due I think
 to a electric storm at the time, so I reinstalled from ISO. At that time everything seemed to work except my Alfa networks 2 W wifi NIC. I got by on the internal Intel NIC for the rest of the build. 361 installed fine, and my Alfa NIC installed fine ( even
 its dodgy profile software! - first time ever! ) - then the slow deterioration. Although once I get everything working, resets, reboots etc - everything is great, until I shut down and restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As said, this laptop is my radio/music streamer/ MCU burner/ library. It's too underpowered for anything else. I need the high power NIC as I live in a 400yo stone cottage in a conservation area so no drilling of walls for Cat5/6 and this Cotswold stone
 would make a great Faraday cage. It's my only laptop, I could buy another but I wonder if I would have the same issue? I'm not really a fan of them. Funny, none of my Apple equipment has an issue, perhaps because of the 5GHz connectivity. I bought a 5gig .AC
 USB NIC for this machine, but no joy in getting it work on W10. - never found what chipset that used.</p>

            Since you didn't post anything about being an expert in OS's &nbsp;in your original posting not knowing your level of&nbsp;knowledge I posted what I have found that has helped many people (you can check my stats to see how many), and since you now have&nbsp;supplied
 more info about 8 other systems that seem to run ok, my common sense and logic would tell me I have 8 systems that seem to be running ok and only one with problems that maybe the problem is within that system but that's just me. Now being a person who is involved
 with OS's I would think that it would be common knowledge&nbsp;to do a&nbsp;clean install as we all know that files can&nbsp;get corrupted and can carry over to updates/upgrades. have a great day.☺&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Asmodeous01, although I cannot claim to have your expertise in operating systems, I will allow that I am quite experienced and skilled with PC hardware, some server work as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must agree with a couple other posters, that the indicators would point to hardware issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please pardon my anecdotal account:&nbsp; My 7 year-old dual core, 4MB DRAM, budget laptop performs probably better now than with its three previous Windows versions (Vista, 7, and 8.1). Home wired LAN is perfect, absolutely reliable. It is on release build 10586.
 My Preview Build 14366 machine is a homebuilt, with mainly 5 year-old parts. There have been the occasional bugs, which I've reported; but it's typically rock solid reliable and a good performer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When was the last time you cleaned the dust out of the system? Overheating? Did the problems manifest as the summer temperatures increased?</p>

<p>We can see that you're very impressed with yourself, but we can't see why you are.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your post in which you seemed to be trying to blame your inability to repair/maintain your laptop on a preview build certainly doesn't reflect the computer knowledge that you have since claimed to have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your rude and hateful attack on Joe for responding to your post in a manner that seemed to fit, and for his not bothering to check to see how knowledgeable and important you claim to be, was very inappropriate and uncalled for.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can easily see why you say your degrees and fellowships are irrelevant if that's where you learned the hateful speech. When I taught engineering, my students weren't into learning hateful speech, but I guess things have changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you feel that the whole update system is rubbish, there is nothing requiring you to continue partaking of it.

<h2>            Cannot connect Outlook to Smartphone Outlook App</h2>
                    <p>I have Microsoft Outlook Professional Plus 2010 on my Dell Laptop.</p>
<p>3 years ago I successfully linked my Outlook Email and Calendar to my Samsung Galaxy 8 Tablet via exchange2010.livemail and it runs perfectly.</p>
<p>Now I cannot link the same Outlook Email and Calendar to my new Samsung Galaxy7 smartphone</p>
<p>I have installed the Microsoft Outlook App on my phone, but am unable to link to my Email.
</p>
<p>I have tried the same via the Samsung Email App and the Google Email App using the same settings as on my tablet but am unable to connect to the server.</p>
<p>I was in contact with Samsung support yesterday and they are also unable to link Outlook.</p>
<p>I cannot reset the account due to some kind of security issue with either my Email account, Microsoft Exchange /livemail account.</p>
<p>I cannot register this issue on Answers.Microsoft.com (via my Laptop) as there seems to be errors on your systems</p>
<p>Can you please advise? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>How do you chart count of events over time&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do you chart count of events over time&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a row of&nbsp;3 times each related to&nbsp;3 different events representing a single process and I would like to chart the count of these events using&nbsp;5 minute intervals.&nbsp; For example, take a bus trip and&nbsp;1 event&nbsp;for example.&nbsp; At 1pm a person is waiting for
 the bus, at 1:15pm the person is boarding the bus and at 1:20pm the bus departs.&nbsp; I want to chart how may people were waiting for the bus between 1pm and 1:05pm, then 1:05pm to 1:10pm, then 1:10 to 1:15pm and so on.&nbsp; Is there a chart method I can use to achieve
 the chart?&nbsp; My goal is to express&nbsp;a quantity of events&nbsp;&nbsp;over a period of time using a curved line.</p>

<h2>            Blank contacts &#35; No Name transfer to my phone every night</h2>
                    <p>Use Outlook.com to synchronise my contacts across Desktop, Surface Tablets and iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get every night blank contacts transferring into my iPhone every evening. Initially&nbsp;had over 300 all starting with #.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Bluetooth to sync contacts to my car. The Bluetooth transfers all 300 # No Name blank contacts to my car. So I have to scroll through 300 contacts to get to my address book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple says its an MS issue Jaguar also now say its an MS issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I turn off the personMetadata on my phone they disappear from my contacts on the phone but still transfer to the car. Every morning I now have to delete the blank contacts from my phone, it wastes so much time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has worked fine for years and started a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please tell me how to stop these empty contacts transferring to my phone.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the same issue, and to perhaps clarify what garyd03 noted quite well, the blank contacts show up in the "PersonMetadata" Group in the iPhone Contacts. You can edit the blank contacts, but there is simply no information there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, "PersonMetadata" is shown as a sub-group of my Hotmail contacts. Deselecting that sub-group prevents them from displaying in the Contacts list; however, they still show up in other apps that use the iPhone Contacts. The blank contacts are displayed
 at the bottom of my Contacts list after "A-Z" under the heading "#".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Word 2010 consecutive page numbering in a document where several - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guitar-picker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 consecutive page numbering in a document where several pages, midway through, must not to be included in page count...How&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We have a document with 5 sections, and it needs to be consecutively page numbered from 1 to 30. However, several pages must&nbsp;also be provided&nbsp;as 'attachments' &nbsp;at the end of Section 2, and those pages must NOT be page numbered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Complicating matters further, is the fact that as required&nbsp;text is entered into Section 2,&nbsp;Section 2 may&nbsp;grow unpredictably&nbsp;by a page or two,&nbsp;before the 'extra' pages need to appear.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We fully understand how to consecutively page number a document across multiple sections, but Word's built-in page numbering does not appear to be able to handle this kind of&nbsp;complex scenario.&nbsp; There seems to be no way to tell Word to not include certain
 pages in the overall page count, yet consecutively auto-number all the other pages from 1-30.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a way to accomplish this, other than the obvious (but impractical, for us)&nbsp;workaround of printing the document, then inserting the 'extra' pages?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to prevent lost draft messages when using Outlook Connector 14.0&#63;</h2>
                    <span>Ok I have been burnt badly by this bug MANY times now and am getting very frustrated with Microsoft Outlook 2010 and the Outlook Connector 14.0.</span>
                    <span>Ok I have been burnt badly by this bug MANY times now and am getting very frustrated with Microsoft Outlook 2010 and the Outlook Connector 14.0.</span>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Even though I have Outlook set to save a draft copy of my email every "1" minute, Outlook&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;crashes and&nbsp;restarts&nbsp;itself and that message is GONE! Does not matter if I have been writing it 10 minutes or 1 minute, there is no sign, no
 shred of that message found anywhere in any of my draft folders.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2199992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2199992</a>&nbsp;states:&nbsp;</div>
<div>9. "<b>Why are my messages not saved to the Hotmail Drafts folder?</b></div>
<span>When&nbsp;you use the Outlook Hotmail Connector 14.0 with Outlook 2010, draft messages are always saved to the Hotmail Drafts folder and synchronized to the Hotmail account, regardless of whether the Hotmail account is primary or secondary in Outlook.
<span>When&nbsp;you use the Outlook Hotmail Connector 14.0 with Outlook 2010, draft messages are always saved to the Hotmail Drafts folder and synchronized to the Hotmail account, regardless of whether the Hotmail account is primary or secondary in Outlook.
 However, if your Hotmail account is a secondary account in Outlook 2003 and 2007, a draft email message will be saved to the Drafts folder of the primary account. The email message will not be saved to the Drafts folder of the Hotmail account. Additionally,
 the draft will not synchronize to the Hotmail account.&nbsp;</span>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Well this software engineering simply is not working.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have just set the send and receive folder to check every one minute (probably part of the problem) under File&gt;Options&gt;Advanced&gt;Send/Receive (it was defaulted to 30 minutes).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So it seems to me the software is faulty in that you can tell Outlook/Outlook connector to save a draft every 1 minute, yet unless you have Outlook checked to send/receive every one minute, your draft messages are saved NOWHERE. That is a MAJOR
 problem to folks like me, and a tremendous oversight by the folks who put this software together, one that I fully believe is deserving of a real fix, not a work around.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It seems to me if I was using Outlook 2003 or 2007 I would be better off, as the draft message would be saved to the draft folder of the primary account (one not using Hotmail, and one whose data file is resident on my hard drive, not out there
 on the Hotmail cloud). Why is this not even an option to those of us running Outlook 2010?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I should not have to have my machine syncing with the web and sending and receiving every minute just so I don't lose these messages.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It takes me back to the days of typing up a Hotmail message in a web browser, only to find that there was a connection problem with Hotmail, and ditto, that long typed message is GONE GONE GONE. Typing in wordpad/notepad and pasting is a workaround,
 but this is the kind of thing that makes Apple/Mac people scoff at Windows people. This should just not be in a released software product! Please, please, please, fix this!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If there are known solutions to this problem (registry edits etc...) that would be most appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't want my messages to be lost when my internet connection goes down, I want the draft to be stored somewhere here on my hard drive the moment I begin typing it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
