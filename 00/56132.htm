<h2>            Cannot login after windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded my machine from windows 8.1 to windows 10 this morning.</p>
<p>I only have a local admin account for logging in.</p>
<p>However, after the upgrade, I can't login in.</p>
<p>I get a message indicating password is incorrect. &nbsp;Try Again.</p>
<p>I know the password is correct, but windows does not let me log-in.</p>
<p>I tried logging in safe mode as well with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            <p>FYI.</p>
<p>I figured out the issue in my case.</p>
<p>It is the laptop keyboard not functioning correctly. &nbsp;It appears that the driver is not working correctly.</p>
<p>There are some keys that don't work.</p>
<p>Password was not getting entered correctly due to this issue.</p>
<p>In my case it was the key for number 1, and I was able to work around that by using the number pad on the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lesson learnt: Don't be on the bleeding edge.</p>
<p>I will certainly wait for a few months to transition my other devices to Windows 10 until proper drivers for devices are available.</p>

    <title>Multiple File Rename using Alpha &#43; Sequential Number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tangolovers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple File Rename using Alpha &#43; Sequential Number</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am already familiar with how to do a multiple file rename by selecting all files and right-clicking the first one and Microsoft appends a numeric string in parenthesis (i.e. "Poland (1)" through&nbsp;"Poland (999)" ).&nbsp; Unfortunately, many programs do not sort
 these file names properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have previously been able to do a rename (but cannot recall how) which results in a file name such as "Poland_0001" through "Poland_9999" or "Poland 00001" through "Poland 09999".&nbsp; I am quite frustrated by the fact that I cannot easily find this information
 on Microsoft's website, yet I know there is a way to do such a rename.&nbsp; Can you please help me asap!!</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>SUsie</p>

<h2>            How to enter correct product key for Windows 10 when a previously used key was entered by mistake</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two computers, one at home and one at the office. My office bought Windows 10 Professional upgrade licenses for both. I upgraded my computer at home first using one of the product keys. Later, when I was back at the office, I started
 the process of using the second product key to upgrade my office computer. By mistake, I entered the first product key. Now it will not let me enter the second product key on to my office computer to complete the process. I use the same Microsoft Hotmail account
 for both computers if that makes a difference. Can you help me know how to enter the second product key.

            Hi John.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Enter the Generic version key for Pro version to change to Pro first:
<br /><a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />Then once it changes to Pro (unlocking the few extra features, otherwise it's the same exact OS), insert the unused Product Key.  
<br />
<br />If problems uninstall the Pro Upgrade key mistakenly added by opening Command Prompt to type slmgr -upk with the spacing exactly the same, press Enter.  
<br />
<br />Restart PC to try adding unused key again.
<br />
<br />If problems then contact Microsoft Support phone or chat options here:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>.

<h2>            Windows 10 Boot Error the required data was not read into memory because of I&#47;O error status of 0xc0000102</h2>
                    <p>Have a Dell 8700 with an I7 processor and 16 gig of ram. &nbsp;Yesterday the computer slowed down a lot so I shut all the applications down and it was still slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to reboot and now all I get is this message, this is only the end of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole message is: &nbsp;The instruction 0x00007FFE77C04 referenced memory at 0x00001BF41900C &nbsp;the required data was not read into memory because of I/O error status of 0xc0000102.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get in with my recovery disk and unhooked everything but the mouse and tried a restart. &nbsp;It said there was an error but gave no numbers. &nbsp;I got to like 16% before it gave me the error message. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the recovery drive I did not see the option for startup setting so I cant boot into safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering if this might be RAM, oh can get to setup menu and all Ram shows there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh tried the start up trouble shooter and system restore both did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Hi Billdog23,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Is this an issue only with floppy drive or have you noticed this with other removable discs as well?<br />
<br />
Let’s try to check for bad sectors on the floppy drive by running the switch chkdsk /r for the floppy drive. Open the command prompt in elevated mode below steps will help you do that.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the Start button.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the Search box, type command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the list of results, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>Now once you open command prompt type in chkdsk /r X: , where X is the drive name of your floppy drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Once done with this try to format the drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if this helps</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards<br />
Sreekanth.</span></p>

    <title>Xbox Scorpio New Specs Announced&#58; Your thoughts. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smileskybird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Scorpio New Specs Announced&#58; Your thoughts.</h2>
                    <p>Hey boys and girls. Microsoft and media released more info this week about the specs to Xbox Scorpio.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. 6 teraflop GPU</p>
<p>2. 12GB GDDR5 memory</p>
<p>3. 326GB/s bandwidth</p>
<p>4. Still uses ancient super slow HDD</p>
<p>5. 2.3Ghz 8 core AMD CPU/APU</p>
<p>6. GPU 40 compute units @ 1172Mhz. </p>
<p><b>W:11.6in <br />
L: 12.8in<br />
H: 2in</b></p>
<p><b><font><br />
</font></b></p>
<p><b><font><strong>It has better specs than the competition Sony. But.... I was expecting a faster clocked CPU. 2.3Ghz is NOT high end speeds, and CPU speed DOES matter since simulation games like The Sims 4, Planet Coaster, etc, tend to be more CPU demanding than GPU. And the console is going to be booting on a record player aka HDD? I would of thought they would be including at least say 128GB SSD for the OS and system. An HDD takes 2 minutes to boot a computer and another 2-3 minutes for all the programs on the desktop to be accessible and load. An SSD can boot to the desktop with everything ready, in 10 seconds!
</strong></font></b></p>
<p><b><font><strong><br />
</strong></font></b></p>
<p><b><font><strong>Regarding the size, it sounds like it will only be slightly bigger than a PS4 Pro and it shouldn't be any bigger than the original Xbox 1. As for the price, the hardware doesn't really have much of a serious performance jump from the specs with the competition. But it will have at least 8GB for games when the competition doesn't get that cause they need to portion some of that for the system. So from reading and comparing the specs, I can conclude that Microsoft will sell the Xbox Scorpio for around US$599 max! Since PS4 Pro has an RRP of NZ$649 in NZ. Expect it to be around AU$749 or NZ$799, at worse.
</strong></font></b></p>
<p><b><font><strong><br />
</strong></font></b></p>
<p><b><font><strong>I have a custom desktop with an Intel Core i7-6700k 4 core 8 thread which will own the AMD APU on Xbox Scorpio cause my i7 has better processing power. Since it has 8 threads I guess you can call it 8 cores figuratively, or as Windows 10 task manager puts it, 4 cores, 8 logical processors. My i7 also has a high base speed of 4.2Ghz, and that's without overclocking it. I've read that some have been able to overclock an i7-6700k to near 7Ghz with water cooling. Even Xbox 360's CPU has a clock speed of 3.2Ghz. </strong></font></b></p>
<p><b><font><strong><br />

<p><b><font><strong>My desktop also has an EVGA GTX 1070 SC overclocked to 1850Mhz and it has nearer to 7Teraflops than Xbox Scorpio will be. But Xbox is still doing a good job, since console gaming will never be equal to high end PC gaming.
And yes, my PC has a Samsung EV0 850 1TB SSD (primary) and HyperX 240GB SSD (backup/secondary/additional). </strong></font></b></p>

<p><b><font><strong>While people may not be interested in specs, the younger generation including mine, do at least somewhat, care about specs. But it's also about the overall Xbox experience too. In 2010 I chose Xbox over the competition, because Xbox is the only 7th gen console that has PARTY CHAT (chat in a large-ish party group and do different things. PS3 only has Game Chat LOL and you can't change your gamertag on PS3). Xbox also has no viruses, it has voice messaging, picture messaging (Xbox 360), Kinect, Microsoft owns Minecraft they acquired it, and they own Skype. And Minecraft came out a year earlier on Xbox 360 than it did on PS3. Though comparison threads are not encouraged on here, you can't learn without learning from others.

<p><b><font><strong><br />
</strong></font></b></p>
<p><b><font><strong>I only got PS4 Pro for World of Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy XV with high visual fidelity since Xbox is notorious for lower blurry resolution, even though it has a more comprehensive operating system is world class online service, more servers (300,000+) than PSN. Microsoft also has Windows/PC OS. As well as Xbox Play Anywhere. I am considering selling my PS4 PRO for NZ$400 and day 1 edition Xbox 1 (but I'll keep the Kinect) for NZ$250. Other NZ'rs are selling their day 1 Xbox 1 consoles on NZ sites. It's worth that amount because the Xbox 1 Day 1 edition console has more value since it's a limited edition, and since Microsoft autographed our controllers with "Day One 2013". And if you sell it with the box that it came with which I still have, you could add an extra $10 on top of that. Then I only have like about NZ$300 or US$200 left to pay for Xbox Scorpio.

            <p>Also here's an interesting video regarding Resolution. 720p to me is poor-ish. 721p-1079p is ok. 1080p is the standard expectation to Generation Y and younger peeps. And 4k, the Internet Infrastructure as it currently is, is struggling to cope with 4k demands. Which is why a lot of people still deem 1080p to be the standard. Even I do. And to those who say the human eye does not have 4k resolution, you're wrong. The human eye in conjunction with the human brain, can distinguish the difference between 4k and 8k. Here's some videos to learn from. </p><p><br /></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_o5h5SK_70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Is the current Internet Infrastructure ready for worldwide 4k?

</p><p>Okay, then lets compair it. But not in terms of processor or graphical power, but rather that which governs it as well as what shortcuts they will likely employ to save on manufacturing costs.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Governing: You buy a Pegi 18 game, which through humor, faul language, sexual content etc. Programs the user to think, act and behave like the charactures in the game... Children mostely, but inpressionable minds even in adults. Then when the playthrough of the main game is over. Gold account and online MP, where the indoctrination of bad behavor in the main game comes with stiff and harsh penalities. Not only from MS, but also said games creators and publishers. = Business model used to justify thief by unlawful taking. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Cutting corners: From the origional xbox to the Xbox One S, this IS the norm for MS. X1slim the savings came in using weak componets like HDMI ports. Did they not?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So yes, I am xbox negative. I, like some critics. Look past the hype often posted here or via MS Clickbait media. Is that a bad thing? If so then you have no comprehension of what constructive criticism actually is.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Back in 2002 - 2003, these forums was filled to overflowing with constructive criticisms, some of which MS actually took to heart. Fast forward to 2017 and all I see here now is. "MS can do no wrong.." Oh but they can and often do. Example of that is how they did me when I had a 2 year warranty and close to the end of it sent in my Origional Xbox 3 times for DDE (Dirty disc errors) and twice got it returned unrepaired, and on the 3rd go around they replaced it with one which shot sparks out the back and....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"Sorry, but your console is no longer under warranty. How would you like to cover repair, Visa or Master Charge?" - I'll never forget that!
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So again, yes. I am extremely critical of everything MS says and does, but in a constructive way with hopes that someday. "The quality ACTUALLY goes in before the name goes on." ....

I don't start thinking about what corners are going to be cut. That will only dampen my enthusiasm and I don't feel like doing that.

<p>If it were young people designing the UI&nbsp;we may never get it. As soon as a problem arose they wouldn't be able to handle it and would have to curl up in a ball and go to their safe space with weeks of therapy sessions.<br />

On a slightly more serious note, I'm sure the team is a good mixture of young and "old". Besides, haven't you heard? 60 is the new 30. I'm 42 and feel young and definitely act it lol. I play videogames, watch WWE, play Magic the Gathering, listen to deathmetal, I'm&nbsp;all tattooed up and I'm always cracking jokes on everyone and everything.

I know personally I felt a crushing loss when my beloved PlayStation Home avatar was decommissioned - her pixels turned to fairy dust - because for the longest time (nearly six years, in fact), we self-identified with each other. She wore the *best* clothes, had the best accessories, all the best 'Homewares' that money could buy, but now it's like she never existed!</p><p><br /></p><p>Kinda like dying a real death, then.

<h2>            Graphics card no longer recognized &#40;Code 43&#41;</h2>
                    <p>original title: (Code 43)</p>
<p>Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)<br />
<br />
<br />
So I am playing my computer game as usual, when suddenly it bugges out on me and I have to alt tab out to see wtf is going on. I restart my computer and come back to a bunch of dots across my screen before Vista starts up, and then I find the resolution has
 lowered.<br />
<br />
BOTH my NVIDIA Geforece 8800 GT cards suddenly will not be recognized because there was some error and it Windows doesn't feel like actually fixing it or telling me what the problem is. I have tried to uninstall, reinstall and have tried a couple of programs
 that claim to fix any problems but to no avail.<br />
<br />
I am now seriously pissed off, I am not a computer expert but I know it is rather strange for my graphic cards to suddenly ____ the bed for no reason. I simply want an explanation or an easy fix WITHOUT having to do something as severe as somehow getting two
 new graphics cards. I need a REALLY good reason as to why my computer (that is not even a year old) is suddenly malfunctioning!</p>

Nothing is working and all I get for information about the problem is this<br />
<br />
Device Type: Display adapters<br />
<br />
Manufacturer:&nbsp; NVIDIA<br />
<br />
Location:&nbsp; PCI bus 1, device 0, function 0<br />
<br />
Device Status:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)<br />
<br />
Click 'Check for solutions' to send data about this device to Microsoft and to see if there is a solution available.<br />
<br />
<br />
Clicking the check solutions button does nothing! And I can actually hear the fans on the drivers spinning yet the computer is telling me it will not recognize them working because "it has reported problems. (Code 43)" Which of course tells me nothing unless
 I waste hours trying to find out what the ____ a Code 43 is and how the heck I can fix it!<br />
<br />
I am fed up, Windows Vista, NVIDIA, Dell I dont know what is wrong and none of the websites of those companies will tell me anything about what the actual problem is!

 reason I can't access the advanced menus in my Award BIOS.&nbsp; So I'm stuffed essentially.&nbsp; And getting bored with people telling me to reinstall drivers when that's demonstrably not the solution.&nbsp; And I'm hacked off with one megacorp telling me to go talk to
 another megacorp and vice-versa.<br />
<br />
Various people are asserting the problem arose post installation of a windows update.&nbsp; I know mine arose shortly after an update.&nbsp; But then there a lot of updates.<br />
<br />
Would be good if microsoft people were actually helpful.

            I was running Windows 7 Ultimate&nbsp;64bit and my 8800 gt was running just fine for&nbsp;3 weeks. I loved windows 7 up until my 8800 was no longer recognized and I get code(43). I have loaded all kinds for drivers from nvida. No luck. I have read numerous forums
 and blogs. Several are reporting the exact same event. If I put my 8800 in my xp machine it works fine. I am not considering it a hardware problem. I am looking at Windows 7 and / or drivers. Right now I am running the defaut svga, and we all know that has
 no acceleration making any game usless including solitaire.

            <p>Hi JaneSelomulyo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the issue on the Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description I understand that you purchased an app through the Windows Store and would like to get a refund because you can't use the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can contact Microsoft support on this link <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=232425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=232425</a>&nbsp;to check if you're eligible to receive a refund. If you're eligible they'll credit the account associated with your payment method. Here is what's currently stated in the Windows Store
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-store-terms-of-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
terms and conditions</a>:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>What happens if I no longer want an app that I have already acquired?</strong></span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the Windows Store services begin immediately when you acquire an app, you do not have the right to cancel your purchase once you get the app. This means there is no withdrawal right or “cooling off” period for your use of the Windows Store, and all
 charges for apps are non-refundable, except as described in this section. Unless the law in your territory requires a “cooling off” period despite this agreement, you waive any right to a “cooling off” period. You may be entitled to a refund if you attempt
 to purchase an app from the Windows Store or make an in-app purchase processed by the Windows Store, but the app or purchased content fails to install on your device, or if you purchase an app that we later agree was erroneously described in the Windows Store
 product description page at the time of purchase. You must contact <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=232425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 your payment method.</p>

</p>
<p>In router is adress: 10. x x x and on your adress is 213. x x x, so it isnt same. I have set in xbox fixed ip 192.168.1.22 which is reserved in router for xbox.

            <p>[quote user="Mr Biftek"]<span>In router is adress: 10. x x x and on your adress is 213. x x x, so it isnt same.</span>[/quote]It looks as if your Xbox is behind more than one layer of NAT, The 10.x.x.x address is a private address and in your case, a NAT'd address. This is why your console is diagnosed with the more restrictive type of NAT (Strict).<br /><br />May I ask, do you live in an apartment?<br /><br />I would suggest that you contact your service provider and ask them about your WAN/Internet address being NAT'd (probably NAT'd within their realm). Ask them if it's possible for your household to obtain a public address, instead of the NAT'd one.<br /><br />But I take it as you don't have access to that specific networking device that is feeding your wireless router?<br /><br />Keep us posted!</p>

            <p>It's my belief that your issue has nothing to do with whether the proper network ports, that need to be forward for Xbox traffic, are opened (forwarding) or not (filtering). It's more of an issue with different address and port mapping behaviours, seen on different NAT devices.<br /><br />It would make sense if your ISP is using a large scale NAT infrastructure. Where they have a pool of public and routable addresses and multiplex these into many private addresses to be assigned to their customers.</p>
<p>The high-end enterprise routers that sits within the realm of your ISPs network add port mapping rules a bit differently than your SOHO router does. Where your router also use UPnP in conjunction with address and port mapping. Which can be relevant when the Xbox send and receive data through NAT.</p>
<p>Long story short; Ask your ISP if it's possible to assign you with a public IP address. Meaning, if you were to have a look at your router's WAN/Internet address, it would be a public address and not an address within the private space (e.g 10.x.x.x).</p>

            <span>Hi Tim and MichelleLeon,<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1</b><br />
When you receive a prompt “wait for current program to uninstall”<span>&nbsp; </span>means still the other program is getting uninstalled. You need to wait for the current program to get uninstalled.<br />
<br />
If you still have the problem in uninstalling, then<span>&nbsp; </span>run the fixit from the following link:<br />
<br />
<b>Diagnose and fix program installing and uninstalling problems automatically<br />
</b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall/</b></a><b><br />
<br />
<br />
Method 2<br />
</b><span>Try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
How to troubleshoot problems that may occur when you install, uninstall, or upgrade a program on a Windows-based computer<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2438651#reso3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2438651#reso3</b></span></a><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3<br />
</strong>You can also try uninstalling the program by putting the computer in selective startup.<br />
<br />
a. Click on start.<br />
b. Click on Run and type "msconfig"<br />
c. Once the windows is opened, then select selective startup.<br />

<h2>            How to change storage spaces properly&#63;</h2>
                    Hi everyone reading this, I'm having problem with my storage setting on my windows 10 computer. For some reason, all of my files save on the This PC storage, when I have 1TB of free space on my local disk, and my This PC space can only hold up to 50Gb.
 I went into settings and chose to change future save spots on my device to Local Disk, but it is still saving to the This PC. I've looked through all the settings and I just can't figure it out. Does anyone know how to solve this?

            Hi Acker.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Storage Spaces is a version or RAID you can set up to save files across multiple hard drives.  I have seen enough problems with RAID over ten years in forums that I would not do this.  
<br />
<br />You said you're not have the access you want to where you want your files stored in This PC, which is only a label that replaced My Computer and Computer in previous WIndows Editions.  If you have a secondary Storage drive then you can choose to move your User folders there, or just use it for storage by choosing it to save files and folders onto.  
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a screenshot of Disk Management and File Explorer to further demonstate the problem if I'm not understanding it fully, use this method to capture and post back a screenshot:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Gerald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Importing applications such as games and dictionaries to another computer require installation of the said application/s. There are files of the applications like
<strong>.</strong><strong>dll</strong>, <strong>.</strong><strong>sys</strong>, etc. that are also located on a different folders and in need to be registered in the system for the games and applications to run without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, would there be a chance that you still have a copy of your games and dictionary? If not, we recommend that you get a copy by visiting the website of the games and dictionary. Download and install it to your new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above information is applicable if your games and dictionary are desktop versions. If you're pertaining to the games and dictionary from
<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Store</strong> app (<em>as you've categorized this thread</em>), you just need to log in your
<strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>account</strong> (<em>which you've used from the old computer</em>) to the new computer's
<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Store</strong> app and follow the next steps below:</p>
<p>

<br />
</a></li><li>In <strong>My</strong> <strong>Library</strong> section of <strong>Windows</strong>
<strong>Store</strong> app, you will see all the applications and games that you've downloaded from the old computer using your Microsoft account and you will be able to install it to other Windows 10 devices. Click on the download button for the games and

<h3> gir55  say:</h3>
<h2>            CD&#47;DVD device door fail</h2>
                    <p>My cd/dvd device has never worked since purchase. I now have Windows 10 and the door will not open after reading through entire response thread for similar questions in the support group.</p>
<p>I do not have a pin hole to insert a paper clip per one response. Pushing on the device in the center or either end does not work. Opening the device folder and right clicking on "Eject" did not work. My computer gave me "PC not responding" then a window
 opens reading "An error occurred while ejecting 'DVD RW Drive (D:)'</p>
<p>I became so frustrated with trying to get the drive to work after purchasing my Gateway computer with Windows 7, I gave up. I reset the defaults for the drive today.</p>

<p>My question clearly stated that I read all the previous threads that commented on using a straight paper clip or point of a safety pin in a tiny "pin hole" of the DVD drive. Mine does not have a PIN HOLE.</p>
<p>Clicking on the "Windows DVD Player" and "About" tells me it is 2015 Microsoft Corp., the year I installed Windows 10.&nbsp; The Gateway Model SX2803 was purchased in 2011 with Windows 7. I believe the computer is outdated because I asked "Geek Squad" at the
 Best Buy Store about installing the Windows 10 software, they alluded to that fact and offered little help. I managed to get it done myself with my tech savvy brothers help. I suppose little brother will have to find some time for me again.</p>

            <p>You can try the following steps:<br />
1.Click "<strong>Start</strong>" button and type "<strong>services.msc</strong>" (without quotes).<br />
2.Now, stop "<strong>Windows Update</strong>" service.<br />
3.Now, go to "<strong>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution</strong>" folder and delete the content therein.<br />
4.Start the "<strong>Windows Update</strong>" service again and see if you can now download the updates properly.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 update&#58; How do I avoid EBS re-download&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> singhaxn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update&#58; How do I avoid EBS re-download&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 10 Home (build 10240). I have a dual boot setup with Ubuntu 16.04 (GRUB). My machine is an assembled Intel PC (Intel Core i5 2400, Intel DH67BL, 12GB RAM, 128 GB SSD + 2TB WD HDD + 500GB WD HDD, Gigabyte AMD Radeon 7750).<br />
<br />
A couple of days ago, "Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant" was downloaded and installed on my machine. I've tried to update thrice yesterday. However, each time, the update failed after getting to 93%. After reaching 93%, I get a "Restoring your previous version
 of Windows" message and the machine reboots to build 10240.<br />
<br />
My biggest problem with the whole process is that each time I run the Upgrade Assistant, it re-downloads the entire 3GB 10586.0.160426-1409.th2_refresh_CLIENTMULTI_RET_x64fre_en-us.esd file. I don't mind fixing this issue with trial and error. However, an unnecessary
 3GB download for each trial over a severely crippled, metered connection in India, is simply not feasible.<br />
<br />
Can someone help me figure out how to re-use the downloaded ebs file, please? Here's what I've tried so far:<br />
<br />
<strong>Attempt 1:</strong><br />
Apparently, the update process creates a new partition for some reason and as a result, GRUB gets messed up and greets me with a grub recovery prompt when the machine reboots during installation.<br />
For attempt 1, I re-installed GRUB to resume the update process (<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/83771/recovering-grub-after-installing-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://askubuntu.com/questions/83771/recovering-grub-after-installing-windows-7</a>)<br />
The machine rebooted a few times before finally failing at 93%<br />
<br />
<strong>Attempt 2:</strong><br />
I guessed it was possible that re-installing grub had interfered with the update process. So, in this case, instead of re-installing grub, I simply pointed grub to the correct root partition and grub directory (<a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/654316/windows-10-and-ubuntu-dual-boot/654994#654994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://askubuntu.com/questions/654316/windows-10-and-ubuntu-dual-boot/654994#654994</a>).<br />
The machine rebooted a few times (manual partition selection each time) before finally failing at 93%<br />
<br />
<strong>Attempt 3:</strong><br />
I overwrote grub entirely by booting into Windows recovery (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-update-restore-the-mbr/7c8db22e-3411-466d-b697-cfb2a1cf46f5">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-update-restore-the-mbr/7c8db22e-3411-466d-b697-cfb2a1cf46f5</a>).</p>

However, when I run the tool again, it tells me the same thing, which leads me to believe that the issue may not have been fixed yet.<br />

In either case, I certainly do not want to download the entire ebs file again to give it another shot. Any help in the matter will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            <p>Hi Sangeeta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I didn't want to spend any more bandwidth on this update, I ended up doing exactly what you've suggested. This single update has cost me 12GB of bandwidth (i.e. half my monthly quota) and a whole weekend in terms of time (trying to install the
 update, failing, performing a clean windows install and reinstalling all my software).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A humble suggestion - whenever a large download is involved in an update process, use a checksum of some sort to verify the integrity of the previously downloaded files and avoid re-download. The open source community has been doing this for years!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Akshay</p>

<h2>            Elite controller return&#47; Referb broken one returned - Help</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having quiet the experience with my Elite controller, and quiet frankly i find myself out of ideas.<br />
<br />
Summary: Bought an Elite controller in October, it had a defective/drifting badly left thumb stick. I called XBS and was given a ticket case number and mailing label at my own cost to ship it back for a replacement. This process took 3+ weeks. Once i received
 my replacement (referb) device, i noticed in Halo some really bad (even worse than last time) right thumb stick drive. &nbsp;I called Xbox support again and a very good agent recorded my issue and bumped it up to level 3 support. The response was ship it back again,
 cost/time on me.<br />
<br />
My issue here is not only did i buy a 150 dollar controller with hopes of improved durability, i also had to spend money and time without it due to defects and replacement quality control issues. I don't know where to go from here. Halo has compensating control
 options for drift, although not all games do. I am dealing with the defective device at the moment, however it needs replacement and I would like a device in hand before i ship this out....<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>for the kinect, there is a rapid replacement option in which they hold 150 on my card until the defective device is received. No shipping cost, no down time. The kinect as we know, costs ~110 bucks. Besides my frustration with the quality of the controller,
 my bigger gripe is the servicing of a device that is 160+ with tax marketed to the pro gamer. Im sure others have issue similar to this, as from what i have found this is occurring a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can anyone assist me here? does anyone know whom else to contact for assistance? Has any one been in the same situation with a replaced device that indeed was broken as well?</p>

<h2>            USB headset not detecting.</h2>
                    <p>I got headset for my PC today. It is both headphones and microphones. Although I can use the 3.5mm jack, full functionality is offered through the USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, upon plugging in the USB, the headset is not detected. Other devices work fine in all USB ports. I have tried cold-starting without it plugged in, with it plugged in, no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When device manager is open and I plug it in, nothing is detected. Nothing changes in the sound settings, nothing changes in the recording settings. No new device is ever detected. I have updated all USB drivers as well as sound drivers. It does not work.<br />

            Hi  grimed85 
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing. 
<br />

<p>"<span>What is the exact make and model?"<br />
<br />
- It is a self-built PC. The model (motherboard) is a Gigabyte G1.Sniper Z97</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The troubleshoot regarding playing audio does not result in anything being fixed.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span>In the device manager, I have 4 devices, that are there before I got the headset. Like I said, it is not detecting the headset, so it is not in there. The 4 devices are Intel Display Audio, NVIDIA High Definition Audio, NVIDIA Virtual Audio Device, and
 Sound Blaster Recon 3Di. None of these are related to my headset. Drivers are all up to date and none have a rollback option.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The last option regarding the playback tab does not work either because it is not detecting. I think you are assuming that the USB is detecting my headset when it is not.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Looking at the support page for your board, the last set of updates were from 2015. I think its a compatibility issue with your motherboard and the version of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />You might want to consider downgrading to an earlier release and see if that works. If you would like steps how to do that, I would be happy to provide them to you.

            Hi Grimed.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-headset-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-hea...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay to look for the device and change the default behavior in it's Dropdown Menu.
<br /> 
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sound Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected.
<br />
<br />If not choose Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page. While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it helps to unpair or disconnect all other Bluetooth devices from the PC in Bluetooth settings, then try again to connect the headset.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  
<br /><a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>...
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-</a>...

<p>Iv had the same problem with multiple devices (camera scandisk mp3 player Phone), iv hooked up through USB windows 10, and my pc wont recognize that hardware is plugged in! well after combing the web for hours, updated my drives, anything and everything
 possible and nothing worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fix to my problem was changing the usb cord. I have a draw full of them. Presto! after finding the correct cord my computer does what its supposed to do, recognizes/auto plays. Hope that helps someone!<br />

<br />
<br />I am trying to help you, but if you mark my replies as unhelpful, it makes it even more difficult to do so. Others will also be less willing to help you with your problem too.
<br />
<br />If this continues to happen, I will have to resort to re-routing your question where it will be placed at the very bottom of the list.

            Is this a recurring or single error? If the latter then ignore it. You can hours / days trying to solve a 4.8 second delay &lt;G&gt;.

            I get the same message after installing a 9 in 1 card reader. If I disconnect it, the message goes too. Best to ignore it or ensure that&nbsp;USB cards/flash drive are not present when coming out of sleep or hibernation..
