<h2>            Onenote 2016 &#34;Find Tags&#34; has issues</h2>
                    <p>"Find Tags" in Onenote 2016 is very erratic. &nbsp;I am trying to search for all "To do" tags in 'This Notebook". &nbsp;What happens is that sometimes the tags are found and sometimes they are not. &nbsp;It is very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched on forums and have done the things described by Microsoft such as:</p>
<p>1) Repaired Office 2016;</p>
<p>2) Removed the offending Notebook and re-opened it again (this temporarily fixes the problem but the issue comes back again so I disagree with questions posted that this problem is resolved, because it is NOT!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help or &nbsp;find a fix for Onenote 2016. &nbsp;Evernote did not have this problem and I am disappointed to have transferred all my notes into Onenote to see that this is not working like described. &nbsp;Furthermore, this should be a fundamental feature
 in Onenote 2016 that needs to work properly.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us make sure that we are using OneNote which is a part of Office suite not the OneNote app from Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>Try installing all the updates for Office and windows.</span></p>
<p><span>And make sure if your search is only looking for "standard tags" or "searching only a specific area"?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps you. Please let us know if you need additional information.</span></p>

 users of OneNote of every stripe; not to mention it's integration with Office Suites.&nbsp; But with the Find Tags function crippled like this, I am forced to go back to the other non-Microsoft program to capture information.&nbsp; When the issue is taken seriously
 and resolved, then I will eagerly return to Microsoft OneNote.<br />

            I am using the latest OneNote 2016 (Office 365) desktop app (not Windows 10 app).&nbsp; Prior to upgrading to OneNote 2016 (while in 2013) I set up extensive tag system.&nbsp; In OneNote 2013 if I selected Find Tags (search This Notebook) all tags in the notebook
 were found as expected and desired.&nbsp; Now, after upgrading to 2016, Find Tags (search This Notebook) only finds tags in the current tab/page.&nbsp; This is unacceptable and is ruining an extensive management process I had created and rely on&nbsp; There is no way now
 to find all the tags in the current open notebook!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Harsha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for looking into this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will confirm for you the following items:</p>
<p>1) I am using OneNote 2016 as part of Office Suite 2016;</p>
<p>2) I am only searching for "standard tags";</p>
<p>3) To simplify, I am searching in the area "This Notebook". &nbsp;Although this problem also occurs for "This Section" as well. However, I suppose let's fix one problem at a time;</p>
<p>4) I have installed all updates for Office 2016 and Windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, I would like to inform I did not experience this problem in OneNote 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ken</p>

            Loss of this functionality has a big impact on my use of OneNote. &nbsp;Search for "to do" items is working but I rely on several other tags as well. &nbsp;I need to search for all tags across multiple sections and notebooks. &nbsp;Please make this a priority to get
 fixed.

            <p>It is a work around, but if you uncheck "show only unchecked items", the tag search finds all tags. This isn't perfect because you have to delete the tags in order to show only undone tasks, but it helps some.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The only solution I have found is to actually CLOSE the notebook -- Not just exit the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on File and it will show you all your open notebooks</p>
<p>Click on the arrow labelled settings on the notebook you wish to update</p>
<p>Click on Close</p>
<p>Usually I exit the program but I'm not sure that is necessary</p>
<p>Open OneNote again</p>
<p>Click on Open</p>
<p>Choose your notebook from the list of notebooks under "Open from One Drive".</p>
<p>Then it has to rebuild your index and it may take a minute but then all your tags will be available.<br />
</p>
<p>Sometimes OneNote will list a tag I just entered even though I didn't go through this process but it is likely not listing the other 10 tags I just entered.</p>
<p>

            Has anyone found another way to do this? &nbsp;Unchecking the "show only unchecked items" has worked for me for now, but this really does put a damper on my ability to create a summary page with tags that will not show up otherwise. &nbsp;It is also very difficult
 and time consuming to remove the tags, rather than just checking them off when working within OneNote. &nbsp;Would really like to find a solution to this.

<h2>            How do I import custom tags into OneNote from my notebook&#63;</h2>
                    I have OneNote on two computers, and I do a lot of custom tagging. When I open my notebook on my second computer I've noticed that my custom tags are not available to pick from. They're available to search, but I don't want to maintain my custom tags between
 two machines.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way for OneNote to import custom tags in the current notebook? Should this be a feature request?</div>

<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For office 365 group integration with yammer you can find below points:-</p>
<ul>
<li><span>I would like to inform you that the
</span><span>With Office 365 connected Yammer groups, users will also be able to upload and store files in their group’s SharePoint document library.
</span></li></ul>
<p>
For easy, quick sharing of images and documents, or to stream videos in Yammer, we recommend continuing to use Yammer.
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>This means that group experiences in Yammer will get access to Office 365 services, such
 as SharePoint Online, OneNote and Planner. The rollout has already begun and is expected to complete by the end of March 2017.</span></li><li><span>Configuration Requirements to enable Yammer integration with Office 365 Groups in your tenant is listed below :</span>
<ol>
<li><span>The Yammer's integration with Office 365 Groups will be initially available only for 1:1
 network configurations. This means you have one Yammer network that is associated with one Office 365 tenant.</span></li></ol>
<ul>
<li><span>That we checked by logging</span><span> yammer home network</span><span>
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>as a verified admin &gt; settings &gt; network migration &gt;
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>That the domains which are associated with office 365<span>&nbsp;
</span>tenant and current yammer home network that will be listed in the "domain list of current yammer home network".</span></li><li><span>In the second list if there is any other or multiple home network will appear under "verified domain of office 365"</span></li><li><span>After clicking next in step 1of 3 it will give list of all the multiple yammer home network.</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>You must enforce Office 365 identity for Yammer users.</span></li></ol>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enforce-office-365-identity-for-Yammer-users-008f940b-6bec-47fc-bcc6-9c6133467562?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Enforce-office-365-identity-for-Yammer-users-008f940b-6bec-47fc-bcc6-9c6133467562?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</span></a></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Once the first two conditions are met, then you can create new groups that will include additional
 capabilities like a SharePoint Online Team Site and Doc Library. Admins and users will know if a group experience in Yammer is connected with Office 365 Groups when they see the Office 365 Resources section in the right navigation of the group in Yammer as
 shown in the following figure.</span></li></ol>

<p>Yes, it does. The Skype application is pre-installed so you can enjoy the video calling feature of the phone. As of now, no issues are encountered on my Nokia X2.&nbsp;</p>

                    I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and it has motion sensors. On the Microsoft Health App it asked if I want the motion sensors from my phone to be enabled. &nbsp;If I'm wearing my band and carrying my phone is that going to double up my results
 and give me inaccurate info? Thanks for your consideration.&nbsp;

            Hello JoeWaldera,<br />
<br />
Thank you for reaching out to the Microsoft Band community. From within the Microsoft Health App under My Phone you can view information about motion tracking. The app will use information collected from your phone to "fill in gaps" while you are not wearing
 your band. However, the information collected should sync between devices and give you accurate information.<br />

<h2>            LinkedIn contacts missing in &#34;People&#34; app</h2>
                    <p>I'm unable to get contacts from Linkedin in my People hub. It worked for a while on my Nokia 925, then i tested Windows Phone 10 on that (sync issues with errors messages).. then i dropped the phone. Unrepairable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bought a new nokia 930 and did not Join the Windows 10 beta... I really wanted my linkedin contact-sync working again. So i performed all kinds of solutions (removing Linkedin account, checked the security settings with Linkedin.com, reconnected and added
 Linkedin to the contact filter.. and still no contacts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone got a solution for this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps. My Surface RT 2 has no problem with this, works perfect, the same as my laptop... but i really need it on my phone.. :-(</p>

            <p>Sorry I duplicated Prof Julies' post. I had started to reply and before I posted the screen shot I had to reboot my PC. By the time I rebooted and got Bluetooth working correctly so I could transfer my screenshot she beat me by 9 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So from a previous thread I saw this:</p>
<p><em>Have you tried soft resetting your phone? To perform the Soft Reset, please press the Power button down, hold, than slide down the message on the screen. The phone will switch off. Next please turn on the phone back again.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>You can also try manually syncing your MS Account on the phone. On your Windows Phone go to Settings - Email + Account - Microsoft account. Tap and hold on Microsoft Account and then 'sync' option will appear, please tap on it.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Please let me know if that solves the issue.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I might try removing LinkedIn from your device. Navigate to Settings/email+accounts. Long press on LinkedIn and delete. Restart your device then add it back in to see if it grabs your contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, I would try a hard reset and add it back then ... that should work</p>

<h3> devyanigarg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not able to download apps from the app store .</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Nokia Lumia 625 last Sunday . All apps were getting downloaded fine for 2 days after which it stopped working . The error message was : "The microsoft account services are unavailable . Try again later." When I contacted the Nokia Consumer Support
 , I was told to factory reset the phone and change the password of the Microsoft account I was using . Since then , I have resetted my phone thrice and made four different Microsoft accounts each time after the factory reset in the hope that atleast one of
 them will work , but with no success . All the apps which had been previously downloaded were erased . The app store does show that updates are required for the already existing apps , but when I go to update the apps , the same error is shown .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone help me please ?</p>

    <title>BP-4L Battery swollen... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loverrrr  say:</h3>
<h2>            BP-4L Battery swollen...</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone. I bought a Nokia E61i back in 2007 and still use it to this day, I'm quite happy with it. I've noticed though that the back cover has been getting harder and harder to slide back on after removing the battery. I thought it was due to it being
 perhaps a bit bended or something of the sort but yesterday I found out after careful examination that the battery (BP-4L) is a bit thicker now and doesn't stay in place any longer if I -for instance- remove the back cover and flip the phone (screen up battery
 down). I remember distinctly being able to do this a couple of years ago. Anyway, the battery is the original that came with the device and perhaps it has reached the end of it's life span. I must say I use this phone a lot, I mean a lot and I am sorry but
 there is not a new model in the E series yet suitable for me to replace it with, since all new E Series have tiny screens in comparison. Bottom line is -sorry for the deviation there- am I or the phone in any sort of danger? Should I stop using the phone until
 I replace the battery? I'm going out to buy one right now but I just wonder... Has anyone experienced issues with a E Series device that carries a BP-4L battery? I haven't been able to find any swollen BP-4L battery references in this forum or anywhere online
 although there have been issues with other Nokia Batteries. Thanks in advance for your answers.</p>

<p>A bloated battery is usually due to overcharging. You should stop using the battery and get a replacement immediately.</p>

    <title>Groove Music on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jbaker100  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove Music on Windows 10</h2>
                    Microsoft upgraded me to Windows 10 about a month ago and am living with it. But just recently an app which is available in their store, Groove Music, attached itself to my third party software for my VOIP, which is Grasshopper. If a call comes into my
 business and I don't answer, it automatically goes to voice mail which is sent out to me via email as an mp3 file. Groove Music now wraps around that mp3 file which interferes with the Grasshopper software. I can't figure out how to get rid of it. HELP! &nbsp;

            <p>Well, since an .mp3 is the standard format for music this would be normal behavior of just about any music player, not just Groove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you really want Grasshopper to play .mp3 files, first check the settings of the app and see if there is an option to make Grasshopper your default player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, go to Settings &gt;&gt; System &gt;&gt; Default apps, scroll to bottom and click on "Choose default apps by file type".&nbsp; Scroll until you see .mp3 on the left side and then choose Grasshopper for the default application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And don't "live" with Windows 10, enjoy it.&nbsp; It is the best thing Microsoft has done in a long time.&nbsp; And it will continue to get better.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Using VPN Caused Insider Account Error Prior to and During Download of Release 16184</h2>
                    <p>An error occurred, just prior to the download of release 16184. I received a message indicating there was a problem with my insider account that could affect downloads. A "fix" button did not correct the problem.&nbsp; I disconnected from my VPN and the account
 problem was fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reconnected to my VPN and the download started for release 16184. Another error occurred during "preparing to download" phase. I disconnected again from my VPN and restarted the download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No further errors occurred and the update was successful. I've since reconnected to my VPN without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had an insider account or update issue while using a VPN?</p>

<h2>            Cannot proceed with repair process</h2>
                    <p>I have a dual OS system that is not functioning in the traditional "dual boot" way, they are completely separate installs with each operating on separate hard drives.&nbsp;Today Windows 8.1 decided that it would examine and repair the Windows 10 hard drive.&nbsp;
 How very thoughtful of it, however it did more harm&nbsp;than good in it's effort.&nbsp;*And just a quick note regarding that,&nbsp;by default Windows 8.1 allows only 1 second to stop disk checks, where as Windows 10 allows more (10 I believe) I think 8&nbsp;is a tad impatient.</p>

</p><p>Upon returning to Win10 I discovered that&nbsp;that my MS Account linked profile could not load, but luckily I had a local (only)&nbsp;account that was able to load.&nbsp; However, when it presented the desktop I received an error stating that I did not have access to
 the desktop folder.&nbsp; Clicking OK on that error was followed by the basic desktop appearing, including the Recycle bin icon.&nbsp; The Windows menu key is clickable, as is every other section on the bar, but nothing opens from there. Keyboard shortcuts also seem
 to be none functional.&nbsp; The only way I could get anywhere was by opening the Recycle Bin and typing my destination into the address bar. I was able to get to the Control Panel, and on to the User Accounts.&nbsp; My plan was to create a new user account and if successful
 link it to my MS Account.&nbsp; But I could not open PC Settings from the link and I actually cannot get to any Metro styled area's of the PC. When trying to open a web link (to come here) it&nbsp;launching IE but it cannot load a webpage and I receivs an error, that
 results in it's closure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I cannot get to them I cannot initiate a repair from within Windows. I tried to force a repair during start up.&nbsp; Forcing it worked only in starting the sequence but once it moves beyond the boot style Diagnosing your system screen I am greeted with
 a Select your keyboard input style message, in which cannot do anything.&nbsp; The system does not initiate the keyboard nor does it seem to recognize the mouse (have tried a wireless and corded mouse) or it simply stalls, since there is no movement apparent on
 the screen I cannot be certain of the systems status. Note, I do not have a touch screen so that could not be tested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Beta Team, any input would be helpful.&nbsp;And since I&nbsp;am not certain of how to reach any of you, like I could back in the Whistler/Server-Longhorn/Server days, so I am reaching our here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply max green,</p>
<p>
</p><p>However,&nbsp;this is a resolution to the problem in the form of regaining use of the system and not an attempt to identify the cause (fairly straightforward) and an attempt to create a safeguard or countermeasure to prevent or correct the problem in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is more of my intent behind posting, I guess saying "any input would be helpful" could have been a little misleading.&nbsp; I am actually offering up the situation as an opportunity to improve the product or at least try too.&nbsp; Perhaps this is the wrong place
 for that, or perhaps those actions in co-operation with the beta testers went way with the closed beta programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, I do appreciate your quick response, but I am in no hurry to take the easy road out, not when an opportunity to improve, or at least learn from, has presented itself.</p>
<p>

                    So I was under the impression that the windows mobile marketplace was set to publish 22,000 apps upon opening.&nbsp; Now I realize that must have been mis-information provided from an unreliable source but when can we expect a large quantity of apps comparable
 to competitor app sites?

<p>Hi Scb_1000,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given you description, it seems OneDrive doesn't sync on your Mac (you cannot see it in the top bar). Meanwhile, you cannot find it in Applications.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To move forward on this thread, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1.Could you share with us more details about "When installing it, OneDrive was installed on my computer and has hijacked my my ability to save docs anywhere else"? Do you mean install the Office suite and it also install OneDrive? Have you signed into OneDrive
 to set up the sync?</p>
<p>2.Capture some screenshots for "hijacked my my ability to save docs anywhere".
</p>
<p>3. Can you find the synced folder under Macintosh HD&gt;Users&gt;Username? If yes, move a file into it, and then check your cloud OneDrive for Business library. Check if the file is uploaded to cloud. It lets us know if OneDrive is working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<h3> steve e &#40;steve&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook is off-line only and won&#39;t permit a sign in.</h2>
                    <p>After a re-start of a lap-top the Outlook app won't go on-line. Starting with an irritating ; "Hm, looks like you are offline..." the signing in process goes through activating but ends up by suggesting only using another account and remaining very firmly

<p>My &nbsp;office 365 accounts are all set up and all work well on my desktop but I need the lap-top running the Outlook as before. The web version isn't an option.</p>

<p>The old MSN and&nbsp;Hotmail yes, but Outage look, no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For chat rooms and junk mail, no problem because when&nbsp;Outage look&nbsp;quits, you just make a new account and continue on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you are using it for business or other important work, you can be locked out and find that it is very difficult or even impossible to get back in.</p>

            <p>I would suggest that you back everything that you want to keep just in case you are not so lucky next time.</p>
<p>Even the moderators here will tell you that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, Outlook is NOT the old MSN and Hotmail we used to know and trust.</p>
<p>Outlook AKA Outage look&nbsp;can fail at any time and has failed for many here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just read these posts, some real sad stories here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also just in case you don't know.</p>
<p>If you go changing your security settings, you can become locked out and find it very difficult or even impossible to get back in.</p>
<p>This has happened to a LOT of people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be safe not sorry is all I am saying.</p>

    <title>Outlook VBA&#58; ActiveInspector compile error &#91;SOLVED&#93; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook VBA&#58; ActiveInspector compile error &#91;SOLVED&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all-</p>
<p>
</p><p>our team all has a sub tied to a command on the meeting ribbon. Anytime a meeting is open, the user can click the ribbon command to generate an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been working for most users, but I've got one user who gets an error. Note that a meeting has to be open for her to click the command, so there should be a valid activeinspector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim oInspector As Inspector</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Set oInspector = Application.ActiveInspector&nbsp; 'this line errors out</p>
<p>
</p><p>This looks more like an office config issue (especially since it works for everyone else) but I'm honestly not sure how to troubleshoot this, and am hoping those with Outlook VBA experience might have some ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have the same references checked. Using o365 pro. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31e3c79c-8260-4fa2-a14f-21cc817ee597?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31e3c79c-8260-4fa2-a14f-21cc817ee597?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: since it is a compile error, I don't think it is a problem with whether the inspector finds the active window - that would come after it compiles? This seems to be specific to the object model/ library, but again I don't know where to start :(</p>
<p>

</p><p>It appears that the module was corrupt; we deleted it then added back a clean copy, now it is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If only I could figure out what might corrupt an Outlook VBA module... this is actually the second time where an error is resolved by removing/replacing the module.</p>

    <title>Office 365 Groups permission and security defaults - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tombsi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Groups permission and security defaults</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I searched through TechNet/Support articles and was not able to find my answer. I also scanned through forums postings and failed to find the answer.</p>
<p>I hope this is the right forum - should be as it relates to collaboration and document sharing.</p>

<p>In Office 365, you are able to specify the default "Read" permission for new users' OneDrive for Business setup. Namely, this is typically "Everyone except external users".</p>
<p>When it comes to <strong>Office 365 Groups</strong>, a public group's files automatically grants "Everyone except external users" read access. As there are ties between OneDrive for Business (My Site) and Office 365 Groups, I started to explore to see if
 the default "Read" permissions from OneDrive for Business is related to Office 365
<em>public</em> groups. I made a change to the default "Read" permission, created a new public Office 365 group and examine the Share With. It is still showing "Everyone except external users".</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>1) We tenant admins have control on the default "Read" in Office 365 Groups (Public) like we do in newly provisioned OneDrive for Business accounts?</p>
<p>2) If the answer to question 1 is yes, please indicate where this is managed in the portal.</p>
<p>3) If the answer to question 1 is no, is the intention to allow everyone to be able to run a global search and find files inside public Office 365 Groups even though I am not a member of that group? Is it a practical resolution / recommended approach to
 add search queries to the Enterprise Search to limit the search so Office 365 Groups are excluded unless you are a member (if the query is that flexible to manage all Office 365 groups).</p>
<p>4) Lastly, if there are Microsoft blogs/TechNet articles that discusses the permission management of Office 365 Groups, please let me know. I found a lot of "How To" for using, creating, setting up groups but none speak to permission management or specially
 how "Everyone" / "Everyone except external users" are configured.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any assistance and guidance!</p>

<p>Hi Tombsi,</p>
<p>The answer to your first question is no. A public group in Office 365 is open to everyone. All the content and conversations in it are easy to view.</p>
<p>In addition, a private group is exclusive and only open to its members. The content and conversations are secure and not viewable by everyone. Choose a private group when you are concerned about security and privacy, such as trade secrets or confidential
 information.</p>
<p>For more information, please refer to the article below:<br />

<h2>            I found my Skype used ID as&#58; live&#58;&#40;XXXXXX&#41;, but nobody can find me</h2>
                    <p>According to what I have read online, my Skyke ID is supposed to be: live:(XXXXXX), but nobody can find me when I give this to them. Could it be something different, or should I just tell them to look me up using my phone number?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when I look up a way to find my Skype ID, the instructions say to click on my icon at the bottom left, but my Skype screen &nbsp;doesn't look at all like the one shown on the instructions, and there is nothing to click on; and I've looked through many instructions.
 For starters, their screen looks black and mine is white. I've also seen it referred to as Skype for "client" (Windows 10). Is the 'client'version a different one? I'm confused, all I want is to have an ID that is not my email or my phone number. Can I please
 get some help.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First of all, creating a customized Skype name is no longer available. You can either use an email address or phone number to sign up for Skype and the system will create a pre-define name for you. Technically, you do not have a Skype account but rather
 a&nbsp;Microsoft account which you can use on Skype and all other Microsoft products.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>About searching your account, have you asked a friend to search you using the email address used to create the Skype account? Also, have you tried enabling "Discoverability" on your account? Enabling this will</span>&nbsp;allow people to search you on Skype.
 To do this, please follow the steps here:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://secure.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">Sign in to your account online</span></a>.</li><li>Locate and click <strong>Edit Profile</strong>.</li><li>On the Edit Profile page, scroll down and look for <strong>Profile Settings</strong>.</li><li>Next to <strong>Discoverability</strong>, make sure that the checkbox is marked.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>And lastly, in Windows </span>you can download three Skype applications:
