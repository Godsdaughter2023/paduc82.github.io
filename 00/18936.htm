<h2>            Autocorrect and language in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default language in my Word 2010 is English UK but when I open a new Word file the autocorrect language shown is Australia! and yet I don't have English Australia in my Word language list at all!&nbsp; Also the spelling check language shown is New Zealand
 English!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I have lost my autocorrect entries which had been saved in English UK! Can anyone help please?</p>
<p>

            The AutoCorrect feature makes use of the <strong>current</strong> language (= the one applied to the character at the insertion point). For more on language formatting in Word, see

<p>Thanks for the follow-up. In recent versions of Word, setting the <strong>default proofing language in Word</strong> seems to be more reliable if the&nbsp;<strong>Windows display language</strong> matches the selected proofing language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since AutoCorrect entries are language-specific, what you describe is to be expected. As you create AutoCorrect entries, Word saves them by language. There is an *.acl file for each supported language and Word reads the one that matches the language at the
 insertion point.</p>

            <p>In general it is your chose to use McAfee or use Microsoft Security Essentials, but note that McAfee might be trial software and with limit time period and you might need to renew subscription. If you want to use Microsoft Security Essentials , you should
 remove McAfee from your system first for instruction take a look at:</p>

            It can't be done in Outlook, but there might be a calendar utility that can do it. See<a href="http://slipstick.me/calprint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://slipstick.me/calprint</a>&nbsp;for a list of calendar utilities.

    <title>Why can&#39;t I format just one line&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob is interested  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I format just one line&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I wonder who the brain dead person was that implemented this utterly stupid "feature"? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I highlight one line. &nbsp;I do something to it. &nbsp;(Centering it). &nbsp;But it formats several lines below it as well. &nbsp;I didn't highlight those lines. &nbsp;Why are they affected? &nbsp;To think the software maker actually got paid to do something like this is just beyond
 comprehension. &nbsp;Why does Microsoft try to think for its customers? &nbsp;Are their customers really so incapable of making decisions themselves? &nbsp;Please: &nbsp;NO Microsoft links. &nbsp;They are utterly useless, written by people devoid of English communication skills. &nbsp;There's
 got to be an easy solution to this. &nbsp;Under Options I disabled whatever I could find that could be connected to this. &nbsp;I am not very knowledgeable in Word I admit. &nbsp;I just expect logic from software though.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I should mention that I always use Shift_Enter when working with text like this. &nbsp;</p>

            You need to understand that certain formatting settings in Word are associated with individual characters, while others are associated only with entire paragraphs. The alignment (left, center, right) formatting is a paragraph format, so it cannot be applied
 to less than an entire paragraph -- regardless of what you have selected.<br />
<br />
A <b>paragraph </b>is defined as the sequence of characters ending with a paragraph mark (Enter, seen as ¶ when nonprinting characters are displayed). A
<b>line break </b>(Shift+Enter) is not a paragraph mark -- so everything from the line break to the next paragraph mark is part of the same paragraph as the text before the line break.<br />
<br />
If you want a specific line to be centered, and not the text above it or below it, then that line and the line before it must end with a paragraph mark (Enter) and not a line break (Shift+Enter).<br />
<br />
lines before -- not centered¶<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selected line -- centered¶<br />
lines after -- not centered<br />

            is this in the favorites pane in mail module? Do you have an imap account? That is a known issue - right click on any folder and choose open in new window to get your folder order back.

<br />Is Sort A-Z highlighted on the Folder tab? If it's grat, like in the screenshot, you can drag the folders. Click it to force A-Z order. The option is also on the right click menu of any folder with subfolders.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38c514a9-2a6e-4452-b212-5f444faf3c61?upload=true" />

            Is this an imap account? They won't stay sorted on the folder list. I didn't do a lot of investigating so I don't know if outlook isn't saving the sort order or if it resyncs the folder list from the server. I also didn't try the new window trick to see
 if the sort order corrected itself like the favorites list does. (Just tried opening a new window - it didn't help. :( )&nbsp;

            Yes IMAP. Now setup the favorites in the « right » order so using that solution. &nbsp;Still weird behavior of outlook. What good does it do to be able to rearrange when it never remembers?!

            This kind of formatting can be made automatic in Excel (using cell formatting). In Word, unless a number is the result of a field (to which a "numeric picture" formatting switch can be added), there is no way short of a macro such as Doug describes.

            Right click on the section tab at the top for the misplaced section, and choose Delete. Misplaced sections are created when you close a notebook that has changes that hasn't synced yet. It is a measure to prevent losing that unsynced changes. If you don't
 need them, you can delete them this way.

    <title>Microsoft Band Support is Terrible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> visit af  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Band Support is Terrible</h2>
                    <p>So how are other people finding Microsoft Support for their Band2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Band2 is suffering the broken wire problem, where it shuts down intermittently and needs to be connected to the charger for a moment to reboot. It then reports "Battery went flat". I can reproduce the fault by just twisting the rubber wrist band lightly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I've been trying for a week now to arrange a return. The Microsoft support website keeps crashing, and I've been waiting 4 business days (so far) for my "shipping label" to arrive in my inbox, so I can send the Band for replacement. The Microsoft
 Band support team in the Phillipines are unable to help. Today they "escalated" the issue and I have been told to expect a call in the next 4 business days.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worst service experience I have seen in a long time. Am I just unlucky, or are others experiencing similar problems?<br />

            <p>Same issue. Microsoft Band 1, battery discharging fast. I sent the band back to them. &nbsp;I sent it back on 22nd Jan, it arrived in their service centre (Germany) 26th. I was told it was an 8 to 10 working day turnaround. Day 8 came, I contacted them and they
 told me a replacement would be shipped within 48 hours. 48 hours came and went, nothing! I contacted them again and was told that the Band did not pass inspection and my original band was being returned!! Two weeks! Two weeks it took them to tell me this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then asked for the case to be escalated and was told I would get a call within the next 2 working days. &nbsp;No call! I was told to email in a complaint, which will be fed back, fed back to whom I do not know. They told me they do not have a Complaints dept.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The band came back today, with additional damage! Thanks Microsoft! Cheers Bill!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just spent another hour on the phone to them and now I have to send pictures of the device that was in their possession for over 2 weeks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Serious, it's a farce, for a company so big to be so inept, damn.</p>

            <p>I hope you all keep this issue&nbsp;going and post the outcome. I am very interested in how Microsoft treats these customer problems.&nbsp; I had to contact them today about a Fitbit Charge HR Tracker they sold to me in December, because it turned out to be a nightmare.&nbsp;
 They told me I only had a 30 day warranty and it was up.&nbsp; I was told to contact Fitbit.&nbsp; Well, I have contacted Fitbit and now I'M fed up and just want a refund.&nbsp; Anyway, while I was talking with my Microsoft agent I asked him about the Microsoft Band they
 were advertising, since I was so upset with the Fitbit tracker, I thought theirs might be better.&nbsp; He told me it was a very nice device and the Microsoft Band&nbsp;2 was even better.&nbsp; Soooooo this is why I'M here, trying to learn about the Microsoft Band 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;So
 far I'M hearing that the customer support is pretty bad. That is very disappointing even if the product is good.&nbsp; This is why I hope you post a follow up and let us all know the final&nbsp;outcome of your issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Patricia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft store in Sydney (interstate store) ended up replacing my Band free of charge. I just needed to ship them my Band (I had to pay postage) and they shipped me a new one the same day they received mine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Band Support (the Call Centre) continued to be hopeless and I never received the Shipping Label from them. Even if I had, it would have taken up to 10 business days to get a replacement, IF they determined it was a hardware issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Band was working, I really liked it. The only issues I experienced were Bluetooth disconnects (fixed by rebooting the Band) and some inaccuracy in Heart Rate/Steps (which is to be expected I guess). It's a hybrid Smartwatch/Fitness Watch. Hybrids
 sometimes become a flop because they try to perform multiple functions, but don't excel at any of them. But Microsoft's Band is actually quite smart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not the best smartwatch (Apple, Samsung Gear are better) and it's not the best fitness watch (Garmin, Polar are better). But it's the only device that can do both reasonably well, and I found that to be a very good compromise and a good match for what
 I needed from the watch. MUCH better than the Fitbits. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine lasted 4 months before it experienced a hardware issue, and (until I got in contact with the Microsoft store), support was terrible. It's hard to say if the people on this forum are representative of the quality of the Band - it might be that 99% of
 people have had no issue. But there are many people here reporting failures with their replacements, so I suspect the problem is significant.

<p>Visit AF, </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your reply.&nbsp; It was very helpful.&nbsp; I hope your replacement operates like it's suppose to and doesn't give you any more issues.&nbsp; It was good that where you purchased it from was so nice to make it right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, I purchased
 mine from Microsoft and did not get a good warranty.&nbsp; I did not even think about that at the time.&nbsp; I won't be so negligent next time.&nbsp; I use to think very highly of Microsoft but, it seems, that is changing, after what I have been learning about the customer
 support.&nbsp; I wonder if the right person, over there knows what's really going on in customer relations?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have not heard back from Fitbit yet, about&nbsp;a refund, and&nbsp;I'm not going to hold my breath &nbsp;either.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is another company that has hung out their customers to dry.&nbsp;&nbsp; So many of us that have faulty devices were willing to hold out for a fix and give them
 the benefit of the doubt but, Fitbit won't acknowledge where their problems are and keep making us jump through the same useless instructions for a so called fix, that most are fed up.&nbsp; This is where&nbsp; "honesty is the best policy" but, Fitbit doesn't seem to
 care about that.&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, I'M done, off the band wagon.&nbsp; No pun intended. :)&nbsp; </p>
<p>I'M going to do more research before I make up my mind on another fitness tracker.&nbsp; I won't be in any hurry this time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks again for your reply.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>All the best to you from,</p>

            <p>I need to get my band repaired but it is out of warranty. &nbsp;I live in Ireland and the nearest Fed Ex place is 200 km away. It says I have to drop it off.</p>
<p>I thought I could get the address and send it using a different courier, but I cannot discover where to send it back to unless I put my credit card details in order to see the Fed Ex label.</p>
<p>I have spent over an hour going from pillar to post on this one, and I am just annoyed. &nbsp;The person on the chat line told me to use UPS and to contact the MS Europe office, but getting through to anyone is just impossible.</p>
<p>Why does Microsoft make things so complicated?</p>

<p>I have a HP 3010 cumputer with Windows 7 Professional. I am using Internet Explorer 8 and McAfee Total Protection. My browser has added all mcafee.com related sites to the trusted sites, so there run in protected mode. I do not see this domain inside&nbsp; browser

<p>My question is: where is the list of the the current trusted site/domain (mcafee.com) on the Windows 7 system?</p>

<p><span><span>Hey Zotya62,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The websites that are included in the Trusted Sites list can be viewed by:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click

</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Sites</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Here you will see all of the websites that are in Internet Explorer’s list of Trusted Sites. It’s possible that McAfee has a set of trusted sites of its own, but on
 the part of Internet Explorer only the sites listed in Trusted sites will be in the Trusted sites zone.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Also a website that has been put into the Trusted sites zone will run with Protected Mode Off as far as Internet Explorer is concerned, but it’s possible that the
 list of Trusted sites referred to by McAfee is a separate function specific to McAfee.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If this is a feature of your McAfee software you’ll need to contact McAfee support for further assistance to finding the where/how the McAfee sites are added.

            As noted in other threads reporting this same issue, since we've seen numerous reports on this and others have confirmed it no longer occurs it suggestes the problem is on Microsoft's end. Do you still encounter the error today?

    <title>Office upload after last update gets Excel to crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brainzina  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office upload after last update gets Excel to crash</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a power user of MS Excel, Word and Outlook. I also use several OneDrive accounts and sync folders with Sharepoint document libraries. I also have some advanced VBA scripts running, exporting parts of my files (actually special filters of my data tables)
 and sending them via mail to partners and customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately these scripts do not run anymore after the last Office update from a few days ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, Excel tries to upload all of my files directly to a Sharepoint site (assuming that because of the URL it shows) which causes my exporting scripts and Excel to crash. I assume they create the new file, and during the save process the automatic upload
 interferes with the script that just wants to "save as" and close the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a first step I removed and blocked the Office Upload Center which brought me one step closer - now it can export one or two files, but then it is also the whole Excel crashes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my current setup is Office 2016 with an Office 365 account - Version 1710 build 8625.2139 Klick-und-los (sorry, I don't know the Englich name for that). I just use the regular OneDrive to sync OneDrives and Sharepoint libraries. I disabled the "Upload
 directly to Office" in the OneDrive settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want Excel to save a file. OneDrive can do the upload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody tell me how to turn that off or switch back to how it already worked so well? Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>Hi Brainzina,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First thing I’ll suggest you update your Office to the latest version i.e. <strong>
Version 1711 (Build 8730.2122</strong><span>), see if this fixes the Excel crash issue.<strong>

<p>Hi Neha!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply! I updated Office to the version you said. The error still is there. Now also the Office Upload Center is back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> OneDrive Version: Version 2017 (Build 17.3.7131.1115)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong> In the OneDrive settings I unticked the box with the Office Upload.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c25e9354-f6da-4297-a390-39f8fc9fba3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c25e9354-f6da-4297-a390-39f8fc9fba3d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.</strong> I open the workbook from the Windows Explorer. It is in a local folder that is synced by OneDrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4.</strong> So here are two scenarios:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>I create a new Excel workbook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fill in some sample content.</p>
<p>I click "save as" and choose a folder that is synced to OneDrive as well.</p>
<p>After clicking OK in the save as dialog it takes about 5 seconds to do something. I assume uploading but if the dialog appears it is there for so short (ot even a second) that I was unable to take a screenshot. After that, the title bar of Excel looks like
 this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/946481de-013d-4b4f-b920-a242741bc956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/946481de-013d-4b4f-b920-a242741bc956" /></a></p>
<p>So it tells me the name and then that it is saved on OneDrive. It also activates the automatic saving option. If I change something it automaticly saves and shows that in the title bar. It is not supposed to do this, right?</p>
<p>(If I save a new workbook to a folder outside of my OneDrive it saves the file just regularly)</p>
<p>b.</p>
<p>I save it with my VBA script. For your understanding what the script does:</p>
<p>I have a table full of staff working hours. The staff comes from different companies. The goal is to export a sheet for each company with only their staff in it (and then send it but that's not the issue with our problem here). So I take the full list (which
 is a ListObject), copy it to a new workbook, delete all rows that are not the current company with the auto filter function, save it in a sub folder to the main document close it, open it again because of some security issues, close it again.
</p>
<p>And that is the process that crashes. During the saving of the new workbook it showed me this message for a very short periode of time:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebfbd761-c0e1-4a96-a4cb-fa40e44e1432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebfbd761-c0e1-4a96-a4cb-fa40e44e1432" /></a></p>
<p>This is why I was assuming that it does a direct upload to OneDrive/ Sharepoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5. </strong>After I see this dialog Excel crashes and I have to reboot it. It tells me no response or the window gets completely grey etc. Here are some scrrenshots.</p>

<p>Hi Brainzina,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After clicking on <strong>Save as</strong>, you must have received the following message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70edf3f3-4f10-4f3a-9e9c-9cac15b97544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70edf3f3-4f10-4f3a-9e9c-9cac15b97544" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once clicked on Ok to save the workbook, the workbook gets saved to the cloud location and the title bar changes, the AutoSave button is also turned ON. The is now the default behavior when saved to cloud location. AutoSave is a new feature, it saves your
 file for you so that you don't have to. AutoSave will save every few seconds. Although the time can vary depending on what you are working on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b7614dd-d415-48a4-b69e-9d8c7641b5c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b7614dd-d415-48a4-b69e-9d8c7641b5c9" /></a></p>
<p>The documents when saved on your local drive will save normally. For these files AutoSave button will not enable neither the title bar will change because these files are not saved on cloud location, they are saved on your hard drive instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test, you can turn off AutoSave button for the affected workbook, check if turning off AutoSave resolves the issue. Then, when you’re ready, click
<strong>Save</strong> Or, you can also turn the <strong>AutoSave</strong> switch back on to save your changes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neha</p>

<p>Hi Neha!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your explanations!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I assumed all your explanations but this behvaiour causes all my export VBA scripts to crash. So basically it makes 80% of the work in my company impossible (in case you do not want to export each file yourself). So what is your solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I don't know why but it seems to also create ramdon conflict files for files I never opened. Colleagues tell me that for many files they now have conflict files from my computer name. And all this files I never used. I was not even in the folder. What
 is you solution for that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i turn off AutoSave the problem still is there. It also shows my that it is saved to OneDrive in the title bar. It just does not do it automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you want to giv better options to you users and I would love to see this working but it does not. In my case this is a real issue because it really hurts my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how can I turn that all off? OneDrive does its job (slowly but ok) in uploading all the files. If I do not want to work together with parnters in a file, I do not need the direct upload. Even without my VBA script it would slow down everything. Pleas
 give me a way to turn all of this new behaviour off!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
        </p>

<p>Any solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a solution for the BA scripts myself. The now take much longer than before but they do not crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what is really annoying, is the fact that it generates conflict files very often. I just save my work and then I get a conflict file. It also generates conflict files on files that I did not open.</p>
<p>And it tells me about upload errors that, as soon as I click on the Upload Center, are not even there (or solved already).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again: Is there any way to turn these new features off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Further, please check:</span></p>
<p>

<li><span>Please check if normal Excel files crashes stored in OneDrive which do not contain any VBA.</span></li><li><span>Does all the Excel VBA workbook show the same behavior?</span></li><li><span>Open a new workbook containing VBA in Excel client directly from OneDrive (make sure this workbook is not synced to your local drive).

<p>I can show you a screenshot with the conflicting file but it would just be a screenshots of two files in the file browser one with my computer name at the end of the filename. Both files would have the same change date.</p>
<p>I guess that happens because Excel saves a file and uploads it and I do the same - I automatically press Ctrl+S all the time. So if the second upload starts before the first one has finished a conflictfile is created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same happens when my VBA scripts save the file before they change it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have any Add-Ons enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The crashes of the Excel files while executing a VB script has stopped because I rewrote the VBA scripts. They now wait for the upload to finish and files do not get opened again. So this issue is solved. Eventhough it would be great to turn the direct upload
 off so everything would be fast again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I assuming right that at the moment there is no way to turn the new upload feature off?</p>

<p>Hi Brainzina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to stop the auto upload, then you may turn off the AutoSave option from the extreme left corner of your Excel workbook and then click save icon or press Ctrl+S from your keyboard to save the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, <strong>AutoSave is ON</strong> for every workbook which is stored in cloud location, if you want to disable it, you must turn it off manually from every workbook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Just another funny issue that comes up with these new "features".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have a link to another Excel workbook (different file) Excel now tries to rename my link in the formula. So for example the link is 'File1'!Table1[#Data] and the file is not open, Excel automatically changes the link to the URL of this file in Sharepoint.
 Even if I open the file it won't change it back, so it stays the URL and not just the local file in the same folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, there must be switch to turn these things off. It slows down the speed of almost every step in my company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neha, I am thankful for your support but I guess I have to wait for the next update that hopefully brings some sort of off switch.</p>

    <title>Bug report&#58; Horrible performance slowdown when you include just - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bug report&#58; Horrible performance slowdown when you include just one comment, note, or drop down menu in a spreadsheet, even an empty one</h2>
                    <p>For the past couple years, I've been trying to get Microsoft to fix this bug that has plagued every windows 10 machine, not just my own. I have tested this in countless Microsoft stores on many of the demo machines such as Surface Pro 6s, Surface Book 2s,
 even desktops. The bug is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>software: office 365 excel 2016 running on windows 10 (as ridiculous as this sounds, this bug does not exist on Macs)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reproduce the bug:</p>
<p>1. open a new blank spreadsheet.</p>
<p>2. use your keyboard arrow keys and move across cells left right, up down, notice how fast and responsive it is.</p>
<p>3. pick any cell and drop a comment, note, or drop down menu in there. fastest thing to do is just drop a note with shift+f2. dont bother typing anything in the note, just exit the note, and see that that red flag is there indicating there is a note there.</p>
<p>4. try using your keyboard arrow keys and move across cells left right up down, notice how horribly laggy it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it looks like anything that overlays a tiny little tag on any cell in the sheet will cause the performance to lag considerably, even if it is just a blank sheet (but also if it is filled with other stuff).</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is a horrible bug because anyone who uses excel for work almost certainly uses notes and comments on cells all the time, and they almost certainly have to navigate throughout the spreadsheet all the time. please fix this or offer some solution (other
 than not using any notes, comments, dropdowns, etc). Is anyone at microsoft willing to even acknowledge this problem?</p>
<p>

            To clarify with regards to reproducing the bug, for steps 2 and 4, press the arrow keys on the keyboard rapidly back and forth to see the extreme difference in performance. this happens even on super-fast desktop pcs with the latest intel i7 chips and
 tons of ram.

<p>If you don't find a fix for the problem here you should submit this bug report to MS using the Feedback process.&nbsp; That way MS developement and management staff will for sure see the report. You could include a link to this question to provide more background.
 And it would probably help if you created sample file demonstrating the problem, upload it to OneDrive and give them a Share Edit link to it here and in the feedback.</p>

    <title>Wait for solver to finish - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobjordan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wait for solver to finish</h2>
                    I gather there is an issue with Solver on Mac Office 2011 under vba that when Solver is called multiple times inside a loop, it issues the command to a separate application and then continues with the vba without waiting for the result.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anybody found a work around to wait for solver to complete its task so that results can be captured and the next call to solver can be started.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It sounds simple but none of my feeble attempts at waiting using MsgBox or looping until time has advanced seem to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There are snippets posted on the web recognising the problem, and even Frontline talk briefly about it - but no solutions seem to be posted.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would be interested in any help from the forum</div>

            <p>DoEvents will not work to detect when Solver finishes, since the VBA loop that contains the DoEvents must keep running, and Solver won't start until the VBA routine is finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've posted an approach that uses a Calculation event to detect Solver's returning a result and to allow looping with a minimum of waiting, elsewhere in the Microsoft Answers forum:</p>

            I have posted a 'send feedback to Excel' report on this bug. In essence this is my summary:<br />
<br />
There is a serious problem using&nbsp; Solver for Excel in Office 2011 when it is called from vba. Because Solver is a separate application, control must be transferred from Excel to Solver, and this control does not occur until after vba has terminated. This means
 that any processing that occurs in the vba program after the call to SolverSolve will be completed before Solver has done its task.<br />
<br />
Thus a vba program to call solver and then capture or process the results _cannot_ work. It also precludes calling Solver from vba in a loop even though the documentation suggests this is possible<br />
<br />
Code that adheres to the published rules for using Solver from vba will work perfectly on a PC but does not work on a Mac.<br />
<br />
I have tried many work-arounds using delays of various sorts but none work - one must actually exit vba before Solver will run.<br />
<br />
This means that any post processing of solver results must be completed using events which are very complicated to use for multiple calls to Solver.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Bob J.<br />

            What is the exact error message text you are getting?&nbsp; "...Invalid Product Key..."?<br />
<br />
Exactly how did you buy Office? That has an impact on installation transfer. If you bought it factory installed and activated, an OEM license, or a "Medialess" kit, MLK, they cannot be transferred to new computers.<br />
<br />
Without the error message all we can do is guess. If it is an Invalid key here are some possibilities:<br />

<span><b>How to fix Access Rights problem</b></span>
<p>Sometimes the problem has been that Windows has had problems granting the right access to files, folders and the registry. The following tips provide some workarounds.</p>
<p>As you go from XP to Vista to Win7 certain operations require higher access rights to perform. These access rights are “higher” than even those granted to the Administrator ID by default. These “elevated” rights are accessed by way of
 the UAC confirmation dialog which is invoked when you select to “Run As Administrator”.</p>
<p>In theory, any one of the following tips should work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The process is: run one of the fixes, run each affected Office app, reboot TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo” at play here. We do it because it works!) TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo”

                    <p>Apps takes much time to load comparing with the same apps in Android Like Messenger and Facebook, the performance and optimization in apps must be considered, the second thing the old style of phone design,the design of the phone is much formal not modern
 like new versions of ios and android the opacity and transparency in drop down menu and all of the phone must be considered the design of UI not attractive.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 2520 AC-300 Charger Not Working</h2>
                    
<p>The charger that came with my 2520 was working fine (there is a green light at the tip of the plug - the part that goes into the tablet - indicating that it is working and ready to charge). Now, the light doesn't turn on no matter where I plug in the charger,
 the tablet does not recognize the charger. I didn't do anything to it. I have had this device for less than a week and used the charger twice. I called AT&amp;T and they attempted to send me a completely incompatible charger. Any advice?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubleshooting or replacement advice please.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I bought the Lumia 2520 about 2 months ago and my girlfriend sat on it while it was plugged in.&nbsp; Anyhow, the charger broke and I haven't been able to find one ANYWHERE.&nbsp; I've tried ATT and Nokia and they both tell me they aren't available and don't know
 when they will be.&nbsp; So, I now have a $500 paper weight.&nbsp; Have you had any luck finding a replacement charger?&nbsp; If so, where did you find it?&nbsp; I've ordered several from Amazon, but none have worked yet.</p>

<h3> mt_968  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account compromised &#124; Can&#39;t get through to Support</h2>
                    <p>I received an email to my recovery address last night to say that an additional email address had been added to my account (not by me it wasn't!), followed by a further email to say that my recovery email address had now been deleted from the account (not
 by me it wasn't!).</p>
<p>When I try to reset the password, it gives me only the rogue email address - if I say "I don't have any of these", it takes me to a Microsoft form for investigation. &nbsp;I've filled this in 3x (with the correct details) but on each occasion it has told me they
 do not have enough info to guarantee it is me and try again. &nbsp;After the 3rd attempt it told me I couldn't try any more today, try again tomorrow.</p>
<p>Very, very, very frustrated. &nbsp;Now just want rid of my Skype account but I can't get into it to delete it!</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Reinstalling Build 10049</h2>
                    When TP Build 10049 rolled out, I updated from 10041 and found it to be difficult to complete the install. I rolled it back to 10041. Now I would like to re-install Build 10049, but Update will not allow me to. Any suggestions? I want to work with Spartan.
