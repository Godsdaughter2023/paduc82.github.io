    <title>Album &#34;Saved pictures&#34; is Empty, but &#34;Collection&#34; is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xke68  say:</h3>
<h2>            Album &#34;Saved pictures&#34; is Empty, but &#34;Collection&#34; is full</h2>
                    <p>The narrative on the "Saved pictures" says pictures should appear here upon taking them, however its empty, they do appear in "Collection", which appears to be on One Drive.&nbsp; No pictures appear in File Explorer, either for the phone or the SD card.</p>
<p>I have tried to organize the One Drive w/ Albums that I name, however I'm not sure where these albums are.&nbsp; One seems to say it's on the cloud, another says "This Device". Can anyone explain where the various Folders, Albums, Favorites, Camera Roll, "Saved
 Pictures", "files, etc. are.</p>
<p>I have a Win 10 Lumia 650 &amp; a Win 10 Laptop.&nbsp; I have put all the Pics on my Laptop in neat albums, however I would assume one should put some on the SD card. Is Down load the only way to get on phone itself?</p>
<p>Thanx, Frank</p>

<p><strong>All = All.</strong></p>
<p>All images however acquired appear in &nbsp;<strong>All.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Images therefore "<em>appear twice</em>",&nbsp;once in
<strong>ALL </strong>plus any folder default or your named folder being a subset of ALL (Even&nbsp;thrice if you tap the heart icon to add it to
<strong>FAVOURITES)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick digression: As you have organised OneDrive accessing this from PC or Phone (OneDrive) is in the order you have assigned, which may be different to phone. OneDrive being multi file type save all backed up images in PHOTOS&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Camera Roll = All images taken by camera / Video</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saved images are any other images on the phone, these can be downloaded from the Internet or screen shots</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Albums</strong>: These are images found in NAMED folders on the SD card e.g my images from previous phone are stored separately in 'Folder X' as they would default into Saved (copied to SD via USB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>E.g album art was stripped from my ripped MP3 music. I downloaded the artwork then tag edited it, so it plays with artwork</p>
<p>Images appear in a folder ALBUM named e.g. <strong><em>Tubular Bells</em></strong> just the one image is included with the MP3 music files included in a named MP3 folder, so for each music album I have saved on SD card as there is the artwork also, I have
 an Album in ALL, with just one image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone is Windows 8, there seems to be some minor name changes, but nothing major seems to have changed between the&nbsp;W8 &amp; W10&nbsp; ALL = Collection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connect my phone to PC via USB so on't rely on any phone app or have ever used one to manage folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your camera images as they appear in OneDrive have been backed up so apparently saved to SD card therefore in
<strong>Camera Roll&nbsp; </strong>(not the "Saved " album folder)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully you followed the above,.</p>
<p>Cconnecting to PC via USB you will locate images, create folders to organise images in folders much easier than any 3rd party App</p>
<p>Like your organisation of OneDrive you have to 'manage' phone also</p>

    <title>Legacy Public Folder in Hybrid mode Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xsimonloiselle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Legacy Public Folder in Hybrid mode Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>I just followed the steps in <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn249373%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this Technet article</a> to setup the legacy public folders for Hybid mode. A few things were wrong or unspecified but I managed to get through it. Now I have some pilot users that can access the Public Folders, but some cannot and get an error. The error message
 says "The set of folders cannot be opened. Network problems are preventing connection to Microsoft Exchange."</p>
<p>Screenshot of the error:&nbsp;<a href="http://puu.sh/kSqN4/ff27a16930.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://puu.sh/kSqN4/ff27a16930.jpg</a></p>
<p>I followed this guy's suggestion and created a new Windows user profile without success, the error still happens. Can anyone help me fix this?</p>

<p>OWA cannot see Legacy Public folders in an Hybrid environment so no way to test that. The problem was local to 2 computers. When those users logged in to other computers, the Public Folders were showing up. On one of the 2 computers, we installed updates
 for Office 2013 and that fixed the issue. The other one with Office 2016, nothing worked. We installed Office 2013 and it works now.</p>
<p>So it seems Outlook 2016 is not compatible with Legacy Public Folders hosted in an Exchange 2007 through an Exchange 2010 Hybrid host.</p>
<p>As for the technet article, there are 2 main things. First, the article says to use Powershell v2. You actually need Powershell v3 for the last command, not v2. Second, when it says to create the new Mailbox Database in Step1.2, it doesn't specify anywhere
 to then mount the database (which is created unmounted).</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Grow Shrink basically magnifies pixel. Pixellation <span style="font-weight: bold">
IS</span> inevitable.<br />
<br />
Smooth start / end doesn't do anything to help<br />
<br />
Often you can start with a large shape add animations to disappear/ shrink very quickly / appear so it reduces in size faster than you can see it. Now when you zoom back to the original it won't pixellat
<br />
I would manually create larger copies of each element and add a zoom entrance followed by a zoom exit to each. This will look messy in edit view but should be fine in a show. If print is important you can create a duplicate normal slide for printing.<br />

    <title>Light version for Outlook Mail does no longer work in Mozilla - It - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pascalsweden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Light version for Outlook Mail does no longer work in Mozilla - It always opens Outlook Mail &#40;Preview&#41;</h2>
                    <p>As I really hate the Outlook Mail (Preview), I changed the Outlook version to "Light version" in the options menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked really nicely. A simple user interface which is extremely fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However since today, when I login on my Outlook Mail, I always get the slow interface, Outlook Mail (Preview). This does not make sense as I have configured Outlook to use the "Light version" in the options menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to log in on Outlook with Internet Explorer 8, and there it opens up in the "Light version" as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I log in on Outlook with Firefox 43.0.2, it always opens up Outlook in Outlook Mail (Preview).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess Microsoft has decided that users can not choose themselves any longer whether they use the Light version or not, when you use a more recent browser. Microsoft can check the Browser when you login, and when it is a new version, they will open up in
 the heavy version, even if you have configured Outlook to use the "Light version".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that I should have the right to choose myself when I want to use the "Light version",</p>
<p>as I have configured it to use the "Light version", and that's what I want to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have other users experienced the same?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only use the "Light version", as the Outlook Mail (Preview) is just way too slow.</p>
<p>How is this even possible that Microsoft tolerates such a product. It is just complete ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that's another discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am trying to solve here is, that I want to use the "Light version" on all my browsers.</p>
<p>Even on more recent browsers. I have configured "Light version" in the option settings.</p>
<p>And it works perfectly in IE8. So why did it stop working in Mozilla?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I am not changing the options settings. It is "Light version".</p>
<p>And that's why it should work in "Light version", on ALL the browsers that I am using.</p>
<p>The configuration setting is linked to my account.... and NOT to my browser!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that you understand my point, and I don't want to give more specific information about my environment, as I believe that you have all the information that you need, to understand the annoying problem which I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't tell me to start getting used to Outlook Mail (Preview). I won't. It is just way too slow, and full of bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just tell me how I can use the "Light version" on ALL my browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I have configured "Light version" in the option settings of my Outlook account.</p>
<p>That's not the problem at all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this! It used to work on ALL my browsers. And just out of the blue from today, for some reason, Microsoft does not want me to use "Light version" any longer, when I login with a Mozilla browser. This is ridicolous, because the option was not invented
 only for people with an older browser, but is was also invented for people with a slow internet connection. And that is exactly the reason why end users should be able to decide THEMSELVES if they want to use the "Light version" or not.</p>

            <p>Hi Pascal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience occurred to you and would try to help you fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly reply:</p>
<p>1. Could you delete all the cache from your Firefox browser and try signing in again?</p>
<p>2. Could you uncheck the settings, sign&nbsp;out and then recheck the option, verify if the issue gets resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Awaiting your response.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario</p>

            <p>I have the same problem, but it is not browser specific. &nbsp;The reason it works for IE8 is because IE8 is not a supported browser for the standard preview version and thus is forces it to the light version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done all the troubleshooting. &nbsp;I've cleared all internet data, I've tested it on multiple PCs, on all browsers including IE11, Chrome, Firefox and I get the same behavior on all of them. &nbsp;I have the light version selected in my options but all of
 a sudden as of last night it no longer opens up into the light version even though I have it properly set in my options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason outlook.com is no longer looking at the checkbox selection for the light version and it is instead opening up into the standard preview version whwnever someone is using a compatible browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This needs to be fixed. &nbsp;On my older computer, as Pascal's, the standard preview version is just way too slow and it takes forever to do everything, even jsut opening and closing e-mails. &nbsp;I have been using the light version for 6+ months with no issues
 and all of a sudden it stopped working last night just like Pascal. &nbsp;This has nothing to do with the user's PC or browser setup as I have done extensive troubleshooting as I have worked in IT for 20 years and I spoke other Microsoft support personnel today
 over the phone. &nbsp;They were going to try and get word over to the outlook.com side of the house so a developer could look into this issue but had no way to open a ticket or support issue directly as outlook.com is supposed to be supported through these online
 channels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please do whatever needs to occur to get this listed as a support issue where it gets corrected on the outlook.com server as soon as possible. &nbsp;It has nothing to do with individual users and is somehow linked to the outlook.com service where it no longer
 opens in the light version even when the option is selected if you are using a browser that the standard preview version supports. &nbsp;Even if it means you effectively can't use the service because it is so slow and troublesome. &nbsp;We need the light version back
 so we can use our e-mail. &nbsp;All my browsers are up to date, so unlike Pascal I have no browser to fall back on that will still get the light version. &nbsp;Please get this escalated to the right central developers as soon as possible so it can be fixed as no amount
 of user related testing will fix the issue as it is not user related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>The Light version simply does not work, as confirmed by the other user that replied on my posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not state this in my original posting, but of course I already cleared all the cache and other history settings in my Mozilla Firefox browser, to make sure that my new browser does not remember the non-Light version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, just like the other user reported, it just stopped working. So it could not be related to my cache actually, as I never went in manually to switch between the modes. I have only used the Light version all the time, as this is the only mode that
 actually works on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something must have gone wrong at Microsoft's end.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with my computer. I have more than 30 years of IT experience, and am an advanced Windows user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this! You managed to make the normal mode extremely slow and unusable. Which I could get away with by using the Light version. But now you also managed to take out the Light version. This is not funny! The Light version was my only hope for now,
 to keep on using rhe Hotmail service. Please make the Light version work again.You need to use the option from the configuration settings! Right now Microsoft does not use that option at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I want to thank the other user in this forum, for the good explanation from his side, and for supporting my observations. We are both experts in this field, and we both have a valid point, that the Light version has stopped working, because of a
 mistake at Microsoft's end, and it has nothing to do with our computer setup, with the browsers that we are using, or with the cache in our browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look forward to a quick fix from Microsoft! I am sure many other "Light version" users will start to complain, as it happened just over night, while it has been working perfectly fine for many months.</p>

<p>No help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have all done this basic step - the 'light version' box is ticked (but faintly) but full preview version still loads. Like others I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* unticked, saved, logged out /back in</p>
<p>* ticked, saved, logged out /back in</p>
<p>* deleted history, cache etc , logged out /back in</p>
<p>
</p><p>Light version vanished just before christmas. I blame Santa.</p>

    <title>Drop down list problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garryburgess  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drop down list problem</h2>
                    <p>Using Excel 2016 on a Mac, I have a drop down list as a Data Validation that no longer works. The small arrow on the bottom right is there, but if I click on it, the selected cell just moves to the right instead of opening the drop down list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a column to the left of this whereby the drop down list usually works, but sometimes the drop down list appears about an inch to the right of that cell, strangely enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled Excel on this machine but there is no improvement. I checked all the preferences to see if I could see if anything was amiss, and I check the data validation settings. They are all correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I right click on the cell and choose "pick from Drop down list..." it brings up the correct list, but the list is not in the correct place but a couple of inches to the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, now after looking at this problem for several hours, I notice that if I scroll the worksheet so that this column is to the left of center of the screen, then the drop down list reappears. It seems that it has something to do with the position of the
 cell with respect to the screen, which would explain why I don't see the same problem on my 24" iMac, but only on my Macbook Air. The problem is though that it's a pain to always have to scroll this column to the left of center. It is some sort of bug with
 Excel 2016, version 15.18&nbsp; (160109)</p>

<h3> giordano checchi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Office 2016 and installed it on a brand new computer running Windows 10. &nbsp; I have used MS Word since the night of times, when computers were running in DOS.&nbsp; While Excel, PowerPoint, and the other applications work perfectly, Word 2016 has given
 me the blues from day one.&nbsp; Windows popping up when opening the application, when closing it, when trying to save files, telling me that I cannot do something because of something else, or because Word does not find a template, or cannot save a file because
 it is a read-only even when using the "save-as" command.&nbsp; My Word 2016 does not even work in safe mode!&nbsp; I requested support, the assistant on the chat tried a couple of things that did not resolve the issues, then swiftly offered me to purchase service at
 a price, assuring me that that would fix my problems.&nbsp; WHAT!&nbsp; I need to pay to fix a brand new product that does not work?</p>
<p>I am addressing all those Word 2016 users that have encountered these or similar issues, to join me in asking Microsoft to do what is right:&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">please fix Word 2016 without offering paid service to fix something that it is clearly not working</span>.&nbsp; Just reply to this note, stating that you do have the same issues, if you indeed do have them.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Thank you Taffy for your nice words.&nbsp; When I posted my comment I had already tried the light repair, the online repair, and none did work.&nbsp; Then I proceeded with manually uninstalling Office 2016.&nbsp; Restarted the computer and re-installed Office.&nbsp; I went
 from bad to worse.&nbsp; Besides having lost my calendar and contacts in&nbsp; Outlook, because I forgot to back them up (luckily I made a back-up not long ago), Word still shows the same issues, and on top of that Outlook now is acting up.&nbsp; Composing a reply to an
 e-mail, and when trying to send it, a message pops-up stating that the operation cannot be performed because the message has been modified (really?, no doubt it has).&nbsp; Followed instructions from MS how to eliminate the issue, which calls for restarting Outlook.&nbsp;
 Trying to close Outlook a new message asked if I wanted to save the message.&nbsp; Clicked YES, another message popped up: "This item is no longer valid because it has been closed".&nbsp; And the message is there to look at it.&nbsp; Laughable, if it wasn't that I need to
 run my business and I am wasting hours after hours trying to fix a seemingly non-fixable product of Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, I could purchase technical service from Microsoft, their agents swear that all my problems will disappear, but I am asking Microsoft if this
 is ethically correct.&nbsp; I spent 400 dollars for a Click-to-Run copy of Office 2016 Professional that doesn't run at all.&nbsp; It shall be up to Microsoft to fix it, not to my own pocket.&nbsp; All of this on a brand new desktop computer running Window 10.<br />

    <title>How to change Inverted Commas &#47; Smart Quotes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caesars ghost  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change Inverted Commas &#47; Smart Quotes</h2>
                    <p>I am using MS Word 10 on a Windows 10 desktop and laptop.&nbsp; For years I have used Word and put up with the inverted commas quote marks going in the wrong direction at the beginning of the word but a Word document arrived by email yesterday, which I am working
 on and the quote marks were vertical and much more aesthetically pleasing,&nbsp;proving my computer has the capacity to use these quote marks.&nbsp; My problem is&nbsp;HOW to use them.&nbsp; The example is below and so is my 'AutoCorrect' options where I was told that ticking
 the straight quotes with smart quotes option would work, clearly it hasn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of the two sentences below, the first is from my computer and the second is from an imported document opened on my computer, what am I missing/not doing to enable my Word to match someone else's?</p>

    <title>CANNOT ACCESS OUTLOOK.COM SERVERS ON MY IPHONE 5 &#40;IOS 7&#41; MAIL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harmonyman  say:</h3>
<h2>            CANNOT ACCESS OUTLOOK.COM SERVERS ON MY IPHONE 5 &#40;IOS 7&#41; MAIL APPLICATION &#40;CREATED OUTLOOK.COM ACCOUNT ON PHONE&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since November 30, 2013, I have been completely unable to sync any emails from the Outlook.com servers to my Apple iPhone 5 (using iOS 7). I can create a work-around by creating an MSN account using the "OTHER" choice in my iPhone's Mail setup settings area.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have successfully used HOTMAIL (with my 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** email account), since at least 2008 on my iPhones, with no major issues. I have hard reset my device, spoken at length with Apple upper-level technical support, and we have determined that there are no issues with my iPhone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I set up an Outlook.com account with my Apple iPhone 5's mail setting area, I get (3) checkmarks next to my email address and password, indicating that the verification process of setting up my email account has been successful.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I try to go in to the Outlook.com email account Inbox, it just says "NO MAIL." Since 2008, I have used different iPhones to access and sync to my iPhone over 30,000 emails successfully.&nbsp; Now, I can sync NO EMAILS to my newly created choice of "Outlook.com"
 instead of the "Hotmail" account setting that used to be used in iPhones.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please assist ASAP!!!&nbsp; I have been without any email since November 30, 2013.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your assistance. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't get a lot of emails through my outlook.com.&nbsp; I had "Mail Days to Sync" set to 1 week on the iPhone, which of course resulted in "No Mail" because i had not received any mail in the past week!&nbsp; Changed to "No Limit" and all my old emails showed up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Your phone's proximity sensor seems to be faulty. The entire screen switches off. I've been using a Nokia touch phone for the past year and no suck problems.

<p>I have had the same issue with my phone. &nbsp;I notice that the proximity sensor is located on the far&nbsp;right hand side of the top of the phone.&nbsp; Because of the location of the sensorI have discovered that when I hold the phone to my right ear I have far fewer
 problems than when I hold the phone to my left ear (which is how I would usually hold the phone).&nbsp; When I hold the phone to my left ear the proximity sensor is often tilted away from my head while I am talking, particularly if I am moving around.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very frustrating!&nbsp;
 Besides being embarrassing at times it is also costly when you have to pay for additional calls because you continually hang up on people, or annoying, when you have to back track through your converstation because you have had somebody on hold without realising
 it!&nbsp; Judging by the number of other complaints about the same issue it would seem to be yet another design fault with Nokia products!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do you backup your Maps 3 license&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Before attempting to hard reset my phone, that it will destroy any data in the phone I was wondering how to recover the Maps 3 license after the reset...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The license cannot be backed up as it is stored on a server somewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you do after reinstalling is run maps 3, go to the options and update your licenses.&nbsp; This will restore it to the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may even prompt you automatically to do it on first use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I dropped back to maps 2 as maps 3 has too many issue at the moment making it worse than the beta in my opinion.</p>

<p>Psycho, your words sounds like music to my ears!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't believe the software wouldn't work to such an extent, although somebody here was minimizing the fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still stuck with no chance to use it, because the search address function makes to phone crash.. neither it works under carmenu cntrol.... commands are ignored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- what problems are you facing (on what phone?)</p>
<p>- my current maps 3 license would work with Maps 2?</p>

<p>The main problems I had on the N97 are that the maps delete themselves regularly from the mass memory, maps 2 didn't do this.&nbsp; It gets annoying having no maps and having to use data!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other issues were slow/poor overall performance compared to the maps 3 final beta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My license did roll back to maps 2 without any issues (or intervention) at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've decided to stick with maps 2 until a fixed maps 3 is released.</p>

            Hi blutarsky - you will probably not be able to use your Ovi maps license with 2.0 as the license will have been converted to work with Ovi maps. If you want to continue with your downgrade to 2.0 you will need to contact Nokia care to get a replacement
 license to work with 2.0...

            No need to backup the license. Its all stored in the instrument's internal memory.. Better u take backup of mobile and datacard using Nokia PC Suite

<p>Hi ragetek,</p>
<p>Online licenses (those that are purchased via the store and the free license that come with your phone when running Maps 1.x or 2.0) are stored both on the nokia servers and on the devices using the IMEI and the IMSI(sim ID).</p>
<p>What this means is that if you format your device and delete the rights object (RO) from the device, you can connect to the servers to redownload the licenses (done through My Licenses &gt; Update)</p>

<p>hmm thx i can now hard reset it. i bought my 5800 in jan 2009, it came with 3 months free navigation, but i never activated it. i had recently installed ovi maps 3 and then it automatically activated my license. so i was wondering, i desperately need to
 hard-reset my phone and if i do,whether my license will expire or stay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for the answer. :)</p>

<h2>            pdf files not available in hyperlink setup</h2>
                    <p>We have numerous Excel spreadsheets that have hyperlinks. When creating a new hyperlink, all we have listed in the browse windows is .xls and .xlsx files. No PDF files are showing. If we click the "Browse for Files" button, we get another window with the
 option to select what type of files to browse. By default, it's set to "Office Files". If we change it to "All Files (*.*)", PDF files are now listed. But, on the initial Hyperlink setup page, there is no option to change the type of file to list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to change the default from "Office Files" to "All Files"? Or is there a way to add PDF files to "Office Files"?</p>
<p>

<p>I have a problem with installing or uninstalling apps on 808. When i try to install an application through Nokia suite or when trying to run the application file from the phone's memory the screen freezes and becomes unresponsive but the 3 phone buttons
 work just fine. I have to shut down the phone and the screen becomes responsive again. Anything available to help me wiith this situations as I cannot use any of the apps I have. Any help much appreciated.</p>

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
have you checked via Nokia Suite on your PC if there are any firmware updates available for your device? if there are any, please update to the latest version offered. if that doesn't work, then try re-installing your current firmware thru Nokia suite. failing
 that, may need to perform a three-finger hard reset (make backup of all data first, as this reset wipes all data).<br />
<br />
Failing the above, will need to take your phone to local Nokia Care for inspection:

<p>hi Adrian and thanks for your time,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have performed a soft reset, reinstalled all the software from the beginning (from Nokia suite) and have checked for the latest firmware ( version : 113.010.1507 if I am not mistaken). I have whatsup installed. Tried to uninstall it to see if that is causing
 the overall install issues and then i realized I have uninstall issues as well :)&nbsp;<br />
Sadly the same thing happens whether i try to install an app or uninstall it...<br />
Anyone else before I waste another day with this (and possibly more time) to take it to a Nokia store?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

 tired to restore any backup yet? It might be the setting on when you restore that affect it. The feezing should be shorten on FP2 but it will still remain there depending on the type of apps from what I experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope they will provide&nbsp;multiple function to&nbsp;uninstall apps since it will go through a long process to uninstall apps 1 by 1.</p>
<p>Reason is because some apps will go through process like preparing install, process install, finalising install which take away your control for that few seconds or a minute&nbsp;instead runnning in background mode. Its not convenient to uninstall more apps.</p>

            hi Alex,<br />
<br />
as it appears you have tried all the troubleshooting options, then unfortunately your only option now is to take your phone to local Nokia Care for inspection.

<h2>            Scripting Word&#58; can one suppress the comment warning on Save&#40;&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a couple of documents that are&nbsp;interlinked (i.e. cross-referencing each other).</p>
<p>To get all of them into a consistent state I need to open each of&nbsp;them, select the entire content, execute an "Update" and then save them. And I need to do that twice.</p>
<p>Since this is a rather tedious exercise I have written me a powershell script to do that (being able to handle applications as COM objects is really cool!)</p>
<p>That works all very nice except, that some documents contain comments and - when saving - Word each time the warns and asks:</p>
<p>"The document being saved contains comments. Continue with save?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, while the script executes, I have to repeatedly click OK onto the above alerts to keep it going. I haven't yet found an option or method to silence this. Is there a way to suppress these warnings on Save()?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

            Thanks, &nbsp;but meanwhile I found the magic incantation one has to mumble:
<div><br />
<div>---</div>
<div>...</div>
<div>$word = New-Object -ComObject "Word.Application"</div>
<div>...</div>
<div>
<div># do not warn about comments when saving:</div>
<div>$wordOptions = $word.Options</div>
<div>$wordOptions.WarnBeforeSavingPrintingSendingMarkup = $false</div>
<div># then save and close it:</div>
<div>$ignore = $wdDoc.Save()</div>
<div>$ignore = $wdDoc.Close()</div>
<div>...</div>
<div>---</div>

<h2>            importing dates from SQL Server into MS Access</h2>
                    <p>Im importing a table from SQL SErver into MS Access via a stored procedure. All the code is working fine, but I can't seem to import dates properly from SQL Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my code in VBA:</p>
Dim db As Database<br />
Dim myTable As TableDef<br />
Dim myField As Field<br />
Dim myProp As Property<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set db = CurrentDb<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set myTable = db.CreateTableDef("tblPaxGraphData")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; With myTable<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Fields.Append .CreateField("year_ending", dbDate)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Fields.Append .CreateField("pax", dbInteger)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Fields.Append .CreateField("transactions", dbInteger)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .Fields.Append .CreateField("time_band", dbText)<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; db.TableDefs.Append myTable<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set myField = myTable.Fields("year_ending")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set myProp = myField.CreateProperty("Format", dbText, "Short Date")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; myField.Properties.Append myProp<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Application.RefreshDatabaseWindow

</p><p>In SQL Server I have a column which is of type Date.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Solved it.</p>
<p>Just incase anyone has a similar issue, you need to look at the INSERT INTO statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When inserting data, you need to pretend it is a text, and use the following format:</p>
<p>
</p><p>' " &amp; DataSet!FieldName &amp; " '.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>This code should do the trick.</p>
<p>Private Sub Document_Open()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.EndKey Unit:=wdStory<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code needs to be added to the Code Page for ThisDocument (right click View Code), under Microsoft Word Objects in the Project Pane.&nbsp; Unfortunately I cannot verify it works 100% as I don't have access to the XP version anymore, but I cannot see why it
 wouldn't.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To determine whether a performance issue or an error message is caused by corruption in the temporary Internet files or in other cached information that is used by Internet Explorer, you must clear cached data. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Open Internet Explorer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>Click <strong>
Safety</strong>, and then click <strong>Delete Browsing History</strong>. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>In <strong>
Delete Browsing History</strong> area, click <strong>Delete Files, cookies, history and form one at a time
</strong>(do not delete password as that will delete all saved passwords).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A progress bar is displayed to indicate that the browsing history is being cleared. After this process is complete, test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you have cleared cache try logging on to the site and check ‘Remember Password’ check box and see if it remembers your password for the next time.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
