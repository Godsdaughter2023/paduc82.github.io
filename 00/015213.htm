<h2>            Excel being used to track inventory</h2>
                    <p>I am using excel to track our inventory.</p>
<p>I have an item name</p>
<p>I scan the serial #'s in under this category</p>
<p>What I want to do, is to scan items out of this original list on a separate sheet....
</p>
<p>for example:</p>
<p>sheet A = In Stock Inventory with two columns: Item Name, Serial #</p>
<p>sheet B = Tech ID - he needs to be able to scan item off sheet a and have it go to his sheet b</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you are using a bar code scanner, then generally this is simulating type in the value.&nbsp; Thus the input will go into the active cell.&nbsp; You just need to select the activecell and perform the scan.

            <p>formulas don't remove data.&nbsp; Formulas return a value to the cell in which they are located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can have a cell on another sheet reference the cell where you scanned the data, but the formula references that cell.&nbsp; If you change the data in that cell, then the formula will change likewise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I could see using formulas on another sheet if you are going to keep the values scanned in in the original sheet.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, it sounds like you want to see a value that is always associated with one of the scanned in values.&nbsp; For example, an employee ID and the employee's name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could have a table somewhere in the workbook that has that data = ID and Name.&nbsp; Then you could use a lookup type function in the second sheet that references the Employee ID scanned in and retrieve the corresponding employee name or other information
 if&nbsp; it is in the table based on the employee ID. </p>

            <p>Sherry, </p>
<p>A couple of questions and we might be able to help by way of some VBA (macro) code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much of this depends on the cell you are scanning into.&nbsp; Is it always the same cell on one particular sheet?&nbsp; I get the feeling that it is not ... but if it is then a macro might be able to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some things depend on the timeline involved:&nbsp; how long after scanning into the first sheet do you need to wait until it is copied to other worksheets?&nbsp; Right then or could there be lots of other things being done before you get around to copying/moving it
 to the second sheet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, when you say "scan" are you talking about some type of scanning device like a bar code scanner or something similar?&nbsp; If not some other device please explain exactly what you mean by "scan".</p>

            <p>That may work,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we are looking to do is...</p>
<p>Scan item into inventory under proper headings &nbsp;ex: Model #, then scan in serial # on sheet one.</p>
<p>On second sheet have employee name and let them scan what they are taking....once the product is installed, I'd go in and manually remove item from original list on sheet one (I would want that to delete it from the second sheet as well)</p>
<p>However, I'm not sure how to put the formula in so that it would actually do that for me</p>

            <p>I am talking about a bar code scanner.....</p>
<p>there would be multiple items being scanned in under each headings....need to track the actual barcodes from each item, not just the quantity of them.</p>
<p>Sheet one would have the entire inventory list with Column one: model type, Column two: serial # scanned in</p>
<p>Sheet two would be the employees page where he would scan in each item as he takes it, He would be taking multiple items, so it would be great if once an item scanned the cursor would automatically move to the next row....once it is installed, I want to
 be able to manually go in and remove the item from sheet one, clearing it also from sheet two.</p>
<p>Is there a formula I could use to do that?</p>

<h2>            Bullet Point text won&#39;t obey margins on bottom of page</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to create a document with bullet points, however, when I press the "Enter" key to get a line of text on the second page, three other lines of text follow with it. I know that text can fit within the margins on the bottom of the page, but when
 I try to move the one line of text to the next page, it creates a large gap on the first page. Below I took screenshots of what is happening with the document. Basically, all I want is the "Univesity of Miami, Department of Economics" line to be on the second
 page. I don't have advanced skills in Word, so I'm not sure if there is a really simple solution but hopefully someone can help! Thanks in advance!</p>

            Look at the paragraph formatting for the paragraphs concerned.&nbsp; It is likely that they are formatted to be kept with the next paragraph.

<br />Try putting the cursor at the end of the line that ends with "respective folder." and hit enter key right there and see if only "Univesity of Miami, Department of Economics"  goes to the second page. Let me know if this work for you for me to provide you some other tips if needed.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I agree with Doug Robbins that it is likely keep with next formatting, perhaps combined with keep lines together.
<br />
<br />Further, you are likely to be in a table, which complicates things.
<br />
<br />Press Shift+F1 to reveal formatting and see what it says for paragraph formatting. If when you are in a problem paragraph, your Table Layout and Design tabs appear, you are in a table. Turn on display of table gridlines.
<br />
<br />If you want, save a sample document with the problem on OneDrive or Dropbox and paste a link here. Remove any confidential or sensitive information first. I can take a look at it. I may be able to fix it for you and explain what I did. 
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards       
        </p>

            I believe Charles has hit the nail on the head. Most <span>
résumé </span>templates for Word are set up as tables. I was wondering why a paragraph would be formatted as "Keep with next" but have "Widow/orphan control" disabled (allowing a two-line paragraph to be split), but a table would explain this: "Keep with next"
 is ineffective within a table cell but works between rows; if the row (or any paragraph within it) was set to "Keep with next"
<strong>and</strong> "Allow rows to break across pages" was enabled, you could get the result you're seeing.

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp; I used to be able to access Nationwide.co.uk banking online in Internet Explorer, but since last week I have not been able to do this.I also tried Google but again, I could not access. &nbsp; I phoned Nationwide who suggested that I use another Browser
 - which I did.&nbsp; I chose Firefox and since then I&nbsp;hav been&nbsp;&nbsp;able to accesss Nationwide.couk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is fine at the moment, but I would like to use Internet Explorer to access Nationwide, as before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a solution to this problem please?</p>

<p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription </em>(if any)<em>&nbsp;expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><u>when</u> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. <em>Again assuming Win7 (64-bit) SP1 =&gt; </em>Are ALL of the following updates listed in

            <p>Hello Mr Robear Dyer (PA Bear)&nbsp; I've been up all night to get your questions answered (ha ha!)&nbsp; It reminded me of the exams&nbsp;I had to sit&nbsp;to&nbsp;become a Clerical Officer in the Civil Service&nbsp;- many years ago..</p>
<p>So here we go:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a&nbsp;&nbsp; 5th September, 2012</p>
<p>1b&nbsp;&nbsp; Came pre-installed when I bought it.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NORTON 360. It expires on 13th December, 2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None that I can see</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, NORTON - no other.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;am not sure, but IF it was&nbsp;&nbsp;McAfee which came pre-installed on my laptop.&nbsp; I would have it deleted</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from my laptop because I chose to have NORTON.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the letters and numbers you gave to me to check in the 'Installed Updates' were&nbsp;found -
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I quite enjoyed the task!</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No.</p>
<p>7a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>7b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, Firefox, only to access Nationwide Bank, but, if I can get IE9 to to access Nationwide then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firefox will be deleted.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, on this Laptop which I bought in September 2012, IU made a promise to myself that I would
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not use&nbsp;<u>any</u> Registry Cleaner.&nbsp; I did on my last Laptop&nbsp;but &nbsp;thought it wasn't worth the money.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; No, never.&nbsp; What is Trusteer Rapport anyway?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's me finished for the present&nbsp; No doubt you will find some other "work" for me to do!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully 100%.......</p>

<p>A few more questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. Assuming you purchased your first Norton 360 subscription on or around 13 December
<em>2012</em>, what, if any, anti-virus application was installed between 05 September &amp; ~13 December 2012?</p>
<ul>
<li>Could it be that a three-month (or so) <em>Norton</em> free-trial came preinstalled on the computer when you bought it?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Has any <em>other</em> Norton application (e.g., Norton AntiVirus; Norton Internet Security; Norton Security Suite) EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Did you recently <em>upgrade</em> Norton 360 v6.0x to Norton 360 v20.x, by any chance?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. One more: When (exact date) was <strong>Security Update for Windows 7 (KB2817183)</strong> installed according to
<strong>Installed Updates</strong>, Jessie?</p>

<p>Hello Robear,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a&nbsp;&nbsp; I purchased NORTON 360 on or around 7th October 2012.&nbsp; I tried to find our from Norton the exact date, and all I was given - 147 days left before renewal!&nbsp; By
<u>my</u> calculations that comes to (on, or around!!) 6/7th October, 2013.....&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also found that it was McAfee who pre-installed 'Security' for three moths.&nbsp; However, when I bought NORTON360 approx. 6/7th October, 2012 - that would be when I&nbsp;deleted McAfee. Hope that helps..&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Yes, I bought NORTON on-line Back-up on 12th December, 2012</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I haven't upgraded NORTON.&nbsp; I am not sure what version I have - all I know is, it is very good at dealing with any 'nasty' things!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>exact date for</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Security Update for Windows 7 (KB2817183) was installed on the 10th April, 2013.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is one thing I remember, Robear, about Java Version 7 v Update 21.&nbsp; It wasn't long after I&nbsp;downloaded it, that&nbsp; I could not access Nationwide.&nbsp; Do you think that could have a bearing on my inability to access Nationwide?- Just a thought!</p>

<p><br />
Yes, that's an <em>immense</em> help &amp; the clue I was looking for!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fact: McAfee (and Norton!) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not uninstalling or upgrading cleanly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you (a) uninstall theMcAfee free-trialware AND THEN (b) download/run the <strong>
McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong> &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE you installed Norton 360 last October?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Yes, it could, if Nationwide's online banking page is dependent on an older Java version. The problem is, their site should be kept compatible with the newest/latest Java version for
<em>your security! </em>[Did you read about the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22470299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
$45 million USD bank heists</a> this morning? Well, those banking websites were (and are still) full of such security flaws!]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then again, the McAfee "leftovers" may have something to do with it.</p>
<p>Until the bank gets its act together, you can use Firefox for your online banking needs - but be
<em>very, VERY CAREFUL!! </em>And don't forget to sign-out when you're done then close the browser windows.</p>

            <p>Hello Robear,&nbsp; I am sorry for not getting in touch with you sooner, but I have had a bad chest infection, which has not properly cleared up and &nbsp;I now have a second course of a different antibiotic.&nbsp;I am not sure if you had asked me to reply to your last
 message.&nbsp; Would you like me to get in touch with Nationwide and let them know that I cannot access my accounts wth Internet Explorer but
<u>can</u> with Fireforx,and see what they say?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry&nbsp; am not quite myself today and I really dont feel like doing much but I should be better within the next weekr so!!</p>

            <p>If you wish, you could ask their Tech Support department if the online banking page is supported with only Java Version 7 Update 21&nbsp;(JRE v1.7.0_21) installed but you could spend

            How did you determine the USB receiver is still working? That is important because then we do not have to look into Windows » Control Panel » (Hardware and Sound ») Device Manager. Actually, if the receiver is still working, a hardware issue with the mouse
 itself is very likely. Hardware breaks over time. What does the one who sold that mouse to you (your retailer) say about this?

<h2>            520 hard to open</h2>
                    
<p>I just the other day bought the Lumia 520 and spent an hour this evening messing around bending and manhandling it the way the little book that came in the box said and got nowhere except for a little hiss that came out of it which I didn't like much and
 then went online and d/l the PDF at Nokia for the 520 and they had a completely different method for opening the case which worked much better without all of the muscle. The little book that comes with the phone will bust your phone before you open the cover
 so go straight to <a href="http://download.support.nokia.com/ncss/PUBLIC/en_SG/webpdf/100000313146/Nokia_Lumia_520_UG_en_GB.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.support.nokia.com/ncss/PUBLIC/en_SG/webpdf/100000313146/Nokia_Lumia_520_UG_en_GB.pdf</a> and do it the way they say. Cheers.</p>

    <title>Way to highlight cross-reference fields&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericeskam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Way to highlight cross-reference fields&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm converting a bunch of manual citations to cross-references in a technical document.&nbsp; Is there a way to highlight the cross reference citation fields?&nbsp; So far the only way I have found to highlight them is to have the cursor in front of them or behind
 them and then use the arrow keys to arrow over them, and THEN they highlight.&nbsp; It's making it extremly time consuming to ensure all my citations are indeed automated as they should be and no longer manual.&nbsp; I could have sworn Word did this, but I recently
 changed organizations and had to go backwards from Word 2010 to Word 2007 (ouch!) so it could have been something either specific to 2010, or just easier to find in 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate greatly any insite that anyone may have.&nbsp; I have found out about the ALT-F9 to show field formatting, but it's still the same color as the body text - it is easier to spot the code notation for the fields, but still far from ideal since
 this is long document with literally hundreds of citations (hence why I am cleaning it up before we spend any more time on it!).</p>
<p><br />
Thanks!</p>

            Hi. Allow us to help you with it. What will happen when you tap the email under contacts? Is there any error message? On the Outlook app, when creating a new message you can't search for their names, is that correct? BTW, make sure you set up the email
 correctly, check it here: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-email-calendar-mobile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            the "gmail" under the contact means that you've saved the contact in an account called
<strong>gmail</strong>.&nbsp;this doesn't mean that you have an email address for that person.

<p>Go to "<strong>Applications</strong> &gt; <strong>Microsoft Office 2011</strong> &gt;
<strong>Office</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup</strong>" then trash all folders in this folder to stop or prevent Microsoft Office from launching on Startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BUT, I'm still waiting for it to hit my Lumia 925 and its the same thing for the latest DENIM update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I've spoken to Lumia Help on twitter, I am being told that the DENIM update and Cortana for the 925 is with O2 (my network provider). Apparently they are guilty of not releasing it back to Microsoft for distribution, BUT when I go back to O2 and ask
 them what's the hold up, they come back to me and say Microsoft haven't given it to them yet. They are also able to supply me with a world network list as to who has what update currently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess this means that Microsoft is not giving me the true picture, and this is a real shame because I've had Windows Phone for years now and even stuck with it after the Windows Phone 7 to Windows Phone 8 fiasco.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Call me a snob if you like but I can't believe that a Lumia 925 is being put to the side so that the likes of a budget Lumia can be given top priority!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I please be given some idea of when I can get hold of Cortana AND also the DENIM update???</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>What you do not consider at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"&nbsp;One of the main reasons for the slow rollout for Cortana is to ensure a good user experience both in terms of voice recognition (including accents) and localized results for search."</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Cortana is different for every country</span>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you wanted Cortana on your phone this bad you could have listened to the US version in April of last year with the Developers Preview.</p>
<p>The Denim update did not even start rolling our until mid December and that was to lower end phones that had very little to update.</p>

<h2>            PC Build 16226&#58;  Install Fails Due to .NET 3.5 Migration</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>PC Build 16226:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Install Fails Due to .NET 3.5 Migration</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello Insiders!<br />

</span>As part of this release, there’s a known issue that will affect some users during installation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please read below for additional details:<br />
</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Issue Details</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Who:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Insiders installing build 16226 to their PC</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in">Issue:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Your PC may fail the install during the SafeOS phase of the install (“Working on Updates” between 0% and 30%) and roll back to your currently installed build</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in">Why:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

There are no lasting effects from this issue.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please see the workaround steps below to bypass and re-try the update</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in">&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Workaround Steps</span></strong></p>
<p>Before attempting to install build 16226, or if you have .NET 3.5 installed and OS build 16226 install fails, complete the following steps:<br />
<br />
(If you have not yet attempted to install 16226, skip to step 3)<br />
</p>

<p>Thank you! When I got to Safe Mode (with networking) my USB mouse was dead and my USB keyboard was very weird. I was unable to do anything, windows key didn't function, etc.&nbsp; I was able, tho, (prior to entering safe mode) to download .net 3.5 from MS's website
 and manipulate windows explorer with the tab key to get to the file and install it, which did work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it took some unusual manipulating, but ultimately worked.&nbsp; Thanks again.</p>

<p>Dot Net 3.5 was not installed but Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 and Dot Net 4.7 Services are I unchecked Dot Net 4.7 Services to see if that works. Will let you know. This is on a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 with 500GB SSD and 8GB&nbsp;Ram.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: on my Wife's Surface
 Pro 1 without Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 or Dot Net 3.5&nbsp;build 16226 took awhile did not look like it was installing but then did. I usually do not have issues on the Surface Pro 1 just always on my development machine Surface Pro 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said how
 long do we have to wait on an updated SD card driver to fix the Windows&nbsp;Build install issue on Surface Pro&nbsp;3, I would like to have a SD card that I do not have to take out each and every week to install&nbsp;new Insider Build.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still did not work but new error 0x80070241 and this is on a clean boot after windows update troubleshoot fixed, and no errors running sfc /scannow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>uninstalled the DisplayLink driver and tried again and almost from the start It get 0x80242006 now.&nbsp;Running troubleshooter again.&nbsp;troubleshooter fixed things but still get same error. will reboot.&nbsp;Stuck on error 0x802242006 no matter how much I run troubleshooter
 and reboot before update.&nbsp; Will try different ISO setup install again instead of the one I created using UUPtoISO.&nbsp;Even with this ISO get to 19% and terminates with Failure message no error number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to install 16226 on my Surface Pro 3 I had to blow it away delete the drives and install from boot USB 1703 then upgrade to 16226.&nbsp; That worked but took some time.&nbsp; The issue is Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 on the box.&nbsp; After the upgrade to 16226
 I installed Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 and it completed with errors. VS2017 runs but not all the features (Total feature install requested) installed including Office Development.&nbsp; Please Microsoft I love all that you do but for an OS not to work on Microsoft
 Hardware (Surface Pro 3&nbsp;with Microsoft Development software installed) please validate this, I have entered Feedback but since it is not mention in the OS Issues section of the release I do not believe it was looked at.&nbsp; To reproduce on Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>Disable Secure Boot</p>
<p>Change boot order to USB-SSD</p>
<p>Boot to USB 1703 Flash Drive</p>
<p>Install windows and delete all partitions (install will recreate them.</p>
<p>Once Windows is configured</p>
<p>Change to Fast Mode on Insider Builds and check for updates.</p>
<p>Upgrade to 16226</p>
<p>Install OneDrive Files-On-Demand and let finish</p>
<p>Install Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 with all options selected on main screen to include Dot Net 4.6 and 4.7.</p>
<p>VS will take hours to install and return errors and then request a restart.</p>
<p>During restart got GSOD and it rebooted again.</p>
<p>Windows 16226 comes up.</p>
<p>Launch Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 and see that it runs but without all the features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: to Get 16215 to install I did not blow away the Surface Pro 3 but installed from ISO and keep nothing and Visual Studio Enterprise 2017 installed except for Office Development (Note: This install I had not selected everything like I did for 16226.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further extensions being added to VS2017 found issue with Microsoft R Client package was the VS2017 package that could not install without issue under 16226.&nbsp; I had to modify VS2017 and remove Microsoft R Client and then the Sandcastle Help File build extension
 would install successfully. After remove Microsoft R Client the Visual Studio Installer does not report any issues on the main page as it did when the Microsoft R Client was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy now since I can continue to develop WPF and UWP applications, I was not currently using Microsoft R Client anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just pasted this into the Feedback Hub for Windows Insider.</p>

<h2>            Cannot get outlook today to show as in default.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, being over zealous with the folder view settings, I somehow changed the outlook today view on my one 365 account and now I can't seem to get it back to the way it was. I've been clicking and going over a few articles here and on google but haven't
 stumbled upon one that works. I've removed the account and brought it back but it retained the views. I have not gone to the extreme of doing a clean install, yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first image is the account that has the view I would like. Date on the top row followed by Calendar in the first column, Tasks in the second, Messages in the third followed by the modules. Both accounts are running in the same Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second is how it looks now. This view doesn't have the Customize Outlook Today in the upper right to help me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version I'm running is Outlook 365 1806 Build 10228.20134</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

<p>I tried that but no luck. After trying some other options I changed the default account under "File &gt; Account Settings &gt; Account Settings &gt; Email [Tab] to the one I primarily use with no luck. Then, just for the sake of trying, I went to the Data Files tab
 and changed the default account to the one I use primarily and that did the trick. It moved the Outlook Today from my secondary email account to my primary one and lo and behold, the Calendar List, Tasks &amp; Messages columns appeared with the data I was looking
 for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, I made the account I wanted to show as default under the data files tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is good now.</p>

    <title>Earned Value Management - how to integrate customer resources, and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pug mcthug  say:</h3>
<h2>            Earned Value Management - how to integrate customer resources, and what date to you provide to your customer&#63;</h2>
                    Hi folks,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I 'm mulling over two questions regarding EVM:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Let me set the stage for my questions... Our company has been contracted to deploy new equipment at a customer's offices. While calculating the quote for this job, we determined that we will expend 30 man days of effort, and our internal daily wage rate
 is $500. The account manager sold the project for 40 man days at $750 per day. So while the total project value is&nbsp;$30,000, my budget remains $15,000.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Several tasks in the project will be assigned to and completed by the customer - like "prepare comms room for new servers - 3 man days of work". I have to plan, schedule, and control their work, and If I want to generate meaningful and valid EVM data,
 I need to assign a wage rate to these resources. How would you deal with this? Would you, for example, assign these external resources a wage rate as if they were your own employees?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. I will provide my customer status and progress reports, yet at the same time I don't want to expose our internal wage rate, and the fact that we actually budgeted 30 days rather than 40 days. Providing the customer with standard EVM reports would expose
 exactly this information. I'm considering editing the reports so that only percent values are shown. What are your thoughts on this?</div>
<div><br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Pug,
<div>Hopefully you will get more than one reply/viewpoint but here is mine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>First, why did your account manager "pad" the proposal? Was it simply the difference between cost and price? In other words, does the extra $15,000 represent cost + overhead + benefits + general and accounting + profit? Or perhaps part of the $15,000 is
 for those items and part is reserve to address unknown unknowns, although this doesn't sound like a development program where there will be any unknowns.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Second, don't try to do your financial accounting in Project. If the program was sold at $30,000 then that's what should be represented in the Project plan. Your actual costs, (i.e. the real actual costs, not those used for EV in Project), should be handled
 by your accounting application, totally private and not exposed to the customer. This is normal and accepted business practice.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Third, I think its pretty unusual for you to plan, schedule and try to control effort to be performed by the customer. Since your effort is somewhat dependent on the work they do, you should track the effort, but in my opinion, their effort should not
 be in your plan as any kind of earned effort. I mean, is your company going to pay your customer back for their effort? No.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you set up the plan to reflect the negotiated contract price and keep customer effort out of the plan, except for effort duration with $0, then the earned value metrics and reporting are all easy and open for disclosure to your customer. Keep in mind
 that it is perfectly acceptable to take out a reserve (e.g. 10%) for contingency, (i.e. the total plan budget is $27,000 with $3,000) in reserve), as long as your customer understands what you are doing and why.</div>

            John,
<div>thanks for the response.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The padding is indeed the difference between cost and price, We could discuss whether a proposal should/can be quoted as cost+overhead+profit, or if the price quoted should be calculated based on the value that the project represents to the customer. If
 a project will save the customer a million in a year, and our implementation costs are 50,000, then I think that we would be ill-advised to quote our work as our cost plus a "standard mark-up", but that's just my opinion. In any case, the amount of work units
 quoted is higher than we actually calculated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I agree with you concerning the cost of the customer efforts - I'm going to plan them in, but their wage rate will be set to $0.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think I'm still going to have to do my EVM calculations using our internal wage rates. The wage rates for individual resources are centrally administered (Project Server 2010), and I would otherwise have to apply different wage rates to almost every
 project, depending on how offers are quoted to customers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>At the moment, showing percentages rather than costs expressed in monetary units appears to be the most viable option for showing project cost performance to the customer.</div>
<div><br />

            Pug,
<div>I would think you have a corporate policy with regard to bid proposals and pricing. Often a corporate bid rate will be established for various labor categories and those bid rates include cost+overhead+fringe+G&amp;A+profit. Although there may be somewhat
 different bid rates established depending on the customer, all proposals for a given customer type should be consistent.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Personally I think you're headed down the wrong path if you plan on using internal cost for EVM. First, I think you are trying to use Project as an accounting tool, which it isn't. Second, setting up your plan with earned value based on internal costs
 will force your to do extra effort to prepare reports for your customer.</div>

            <p>You're using Project Server, so that constrains what resource rates you can use. MVPs have long requested rates in Project Server unique for each project. We're still waiting.
</p>
<p>A schedule is a communication tool and you have two communications: one to the customer and one to your management. You have to provide management with what they need. So the question is what to provide the customer?</p>
<p>As far as earned value is concerned, the rates used should be for the contract price of $30,000 as that is what you will earn. the Internal rate simply drives your internal cost. So I agree with John.</p>
<p>I think your simplest path is just to allocate tasks to your customer, no cost. As you can't directly control their work, I would state your finish date as a number of working days after your contract start or their completion of prep work, whichever is
 later.</p>
<p>I wouldn't even provide earned value reports to the client, not many would understand them anyway, but merely provide % complete and accurate actual dates and projected completion.</p>

            Hi John, hi Rod,
<div><br />
<div>thanks for your comments. As far as proposal pricing here at our small/medium sized company is concerned, I think I could frugally say that its "creative". This means that I can never assume that the quoted wage rate will have anything to do with previous
 quotes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I certainly hope that I'm not trying to &nbsp;use Project as an accounting tool! My reasoning behind using the internal wage rate rather than the quoted price is that I basically receive a contract/order to perform "x" services with "y" budget - the budget
 being expressed in man hours. The quoted price can vary widely (sometimes wildly) - but that doesn't change the fact that I have to decombobulate 100 widgets, that I have 20 man days to do it, and a man day costs two Italian Florins. &nbsp;EVM doesn't mandate using
 quoted rates (?), and I want to be able to answer the standard EVM questions (what should be completed; how much should it cost; what has been completed; how much should it cost; how much did it cost...). It's all about cost, and not generated profit - that's
 grist for the accounting mill.</div>

<div>It sounds like proposal and accounting system is as we call it, loosy goosy. A strange way to run a business.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Rod and I have both suggested setting up the plan to reflect the contract price. And no, EVM doesn't mandate using quoted rates, it's just normal practice, at least in my world.</div>

<div>You asked for our thoughts and we gave them to you. You can wait for additional input but I think we've said our piece. Run with it or ignore it, it's up to you.</div>

            Hi Pug,
<div>As a CONTRACTOR, you are doing earned value EXACTLY the way it should be done.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You have quoted the client your SELLING price and when you submit your earned value report, along with your monthly billing, it should reflect the physical % complete X your selling price. (your BCWP and the clients ACWP) Unless it is a cost plus contract,
 you are under no obligation to them to show them your (contractors) actual cost of work performed. (ACWP) &nbsp;Under a firm fixed price or even LoE contract that is none of their business.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now, when you calculate your own INTERNAL ACWP, then you will find out if you are over budget against YOUR plan (as the contractor) or not, but unless it is cost plus, you are under no legal or moral obligation to disclose that to your client.</div>

<div>When calculating the BCWP for owner/client tasks, you can assign an arbitrary but "reasonable" value for that work. &nbsp;I am coming from a background in construction, so I use the cost information published resources, such as RS Means or Richardsons whenever
 including owner activities on my schedule. &nbsp;Just be sure that when you do your own internal reporting that you deduct or otherwise account for work you are not responsible for, or your analysis will surely be wrong.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The fact that you think you can finish it in 30 and not 40 days means nothing, EXCEPT that it may mess up the plans for the owner activities. &nbsp;So as you get "ahead of schedule" you need to be sure to communicate to the client that the work is proceeding
 FASTER than planned so they are able to plan their activities accordingly. &nbsp;One way to so this VERY effectively is to show BOTH the early and late date curves. &nbsp;This is a "best practice" and while it is a little bit more work (for small project like this I
 don't bother with MSP or P6, I only use Excel) it will say a lot about your professionalism.</div>

    <title>Win10 crash 10mins after login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> purupurupuru  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 crash 10mins after login</h2>
                    <p>I'm completely stumped with this issue, have tried many things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Windows 10 Home Insider Preview, Build 17074.rs_prerelease_flt.180116-1539</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started this morning when I booted my computer, it was working perfectly fine last night but now after login everything will freeze after 10mins - as in, moving the mouse does nothing and no response to keyboard input (caps key not flashing on). Shortly
 after the freeze the computer will reboot and repeat the same process 10mins after login.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's 10mins is because I checked the event viewer, each crash after reboot is roughly 12 mins apart, I assume the extra 2mins is how long it takes to get to desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very odd to me how the crash always happens after roughly the same uptime and it only crashing after login on a normal boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I wait in bios or on the login screen, there is no crash and I also tested safe mode which also had no crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After testing safe mode I disabled installed services as instructed to perform a clean boot but then after restart the crash would then happen on login screen after account credentials were submitted. I could still get into safe mode with no crash but now
 safe mode with networking wouldn't work - it would disable network related services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also note that I tried doing the sfc scan and dism commands which both found no corruption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to do a Windows reinstall which (with option not to wipe user files), this ended up crashing on 96% and then rebooting into my profile but with a broken desktop - could not open start menu or explorer windows etc, could only access task manager
 and my desktop bg was black and no network connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to get some functionality by doing a command to register dll files in sys32 and creating a new user profile - this got explorer working again but still no access to start menu or settings or network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to again do a Windows reset, this time with wiping user profile and this time it did finish successfully and gave me the welcome introduction and such and got me to desktop - but now my original problem was back, crash after 10 - 12 mins. I was
 baffled because surely this was a fresh install with nothing that could cause any issues.</p>
<p>(it should be noted at with this reset, I chose to use my Windows Live credentials as login and also connected to my WiFi network, these are important differences to below)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last time I decided to do the same windows reset again But this time I chose to use a local account instead of windows live and did not connect to my WiFi network and this time there is no crash, current uptime is 28mins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, with these differences in mind, what could be causing my issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either some form of data/setting that is being restored when using my Windows Live account is causing the crash</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or when I'm connected to the Internet, my network card could be causing issues or downloaded drivers are causing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think at one point I was able to get networking safe mode to work without crash so I don't think it's relevant to my network card and I think I can rule out the possibility of it being a hardware fault in general.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts? Sorry this post is so long, wanted to be clear as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just in case this is necessary, my specs are:</p>
<p>250gb SSD</p>
<p>AMD FX8120 CPU</p>
<p>16gb DDR3 Ram</p>
<p>GTX 1060 GPU</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unplugged pretty much everything else other than my mouse, keyboard and WiFi adapter early on during my testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mobo, ram, cpu are fairly old while the gpu is only a few months old and I have not experienced any problems with it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried turning my WiFi back on and the issue with crashing every 10min came back, it took around 25mins for the initial crash after turning my WiFi on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time with the crash is a green screen of death (not blue) saying SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (Wdfilter.sys)</p>

<p>Update2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned on WiFi and I tried manually updating Windows Defender virus definitions - this caused the same green screen of death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess I have an issue with windows defender. I tried disabling protection but the problem still happens so I guess there is an event being triggered every 10min that is trying to update the definitions even if windef is disabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where should I go from here? I'd rather find a proper solution to this than prevent windows defender from working.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible, you should update to Insider Build 17134.1 since build 17074 is too outdated. I may be wrong but I see no point in trying to deal with issues in an outdated Insider build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The newer insider build may also cause you the same issue or introduce new issues along with the old one but that's the way to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if this doesn't help you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So if you can get to save mode and you do not want to Update to 17134.1 you could go to the Insider Advanced Download site and Get the 17127 ISO to use it as an Update by Opening or mounting the ISO with File Explorer and run the &nbsp; &nbsp; setup.exe</p>

    <title>HOW DO YOU MOVE STORAGE FOLDERS TO OUTLOOK - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardkendell  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOW DO YOU MOVE STORAGE FOLDERS TO OUTLOOK</h2>
                    I have my old emails sorted by subject in storage files in Windows Live. I cannot understand how to move the storage folder from Windows Live to Outlook. I had assumed there would be an import function or drag and drop but I have failed to find either.
 Is import of the folder possible? If so how?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our apologies for the delayed response on your inquiry about moving your storage files from Windows Live Mail to Outlook. If I may ask, are you referring to Outlook.com or the email client which is Microsoft Office Outlook?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are&nbsp;referring to Outlook.com, please be informed that you will need to manually drag and drop the messages that you have on your storage folder on your Outlook.com account. You just have to choose the folder which you want to use to save the messages.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you are referring to Microsoft Office Outlook, I recommend that you visit this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/outlook">forum</a> as they have the proper tools and resouces to help you with your concern.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have other questions, do not hesitate to respond to this post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div><br />
<div>The emails I have are are in Windows Live Mail. If I go into Outlook.com I can pick up my current Emails and I can move "new" emails into a storage folder but I cannot see how I move an existing storage folder from Live Mail so I can see it in Outlook.com.
 I can export emails/files from Live mail but I cannot see how to import them to Outlook.</div>
<div>Is it possible?</div>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply as well. I understand that you want the sorted emails on your Windows Live Mail to be exported to Outlook.com. I'll do my best to assist you in this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please verify, is the email address&nbsp;configured on your Windows Live Mail the same in your email at Outlook.com? If yes, there's no need for you to transfer them because the emails should be readily available in the Outlook.com page.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, if the account synched in the mail client is different from your Outlook.com email, I apologize but we currently do not have the feature to transfer emails from your mail client to Outlok.com. On the other hand, you can use
<span><a href="https://secure5.trueswitch.com/hotmail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0000ff"><strong>TrueSwitch</strong></font></span></a>&nbsp;</span>to transfer those emails to outlook.com. This tool will access the emails from the web interface of your
 provider and facilitate the transfer to Outlook.com.&nbsp; To know more about it, please refer to this

 function from outlook.com does not import the storage folders,sent folders, etc, only the inbox.&nbsp;

            <p>The thread was about getting the mail moved into Outlook.com, from WLM. &nbsp;There is no way to "copy" the folders to Outlook.com as far as I can tell, that is why I said the statement was not an answer. &nbsp;Just thought there would be an easier way to move towards
 the mail microsoft seems to want people to use from their WLM. &nbsp;The point is the import functions only do half the job by importing inbox contents, but no other folders. &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps this is the way it was meant to be. &nbsp;I was trying to move to Outlook.com due
 to the instability of WLM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I really would like to do is stop WLM 2012 from crashing everytime I try to send a mail, but support wants me to pay to get them to see the bug.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Forum support and we apologized for the delay in responding to your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand the concern, you want to move the folders that you have in Windows Live Mail to Outlook.com. Please be informed that once you have configured your email account in Windows Live Mail, you should be able to see the same folders that you created
 once you access the same account to Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't work on your end, may I know what are the folders that you can't see on Outlook.com. Does the same issue persists when using other browser?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing, since you've mentioned that your WLM 2012 crashes when sending an email, did you get any error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<div>1. &nbsp;The error message I get when trying to reply to a mail in WLM is-"windows encountered an error and has to shut down". &nbsp;WLM then restarts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;After doing the import to set up Outlook.com, &nbsp;any storage folders(these are any folders I previously created in the section called "storage Folders" where I save and organize previous mail. &nbsp;As I recall
 "storage Folders" is an area for folders that WLM comes with on the left side for organizing mail. &nbsp; Also,I previously incorrectly thought the sent mails did not get imported but that was wrong. &nbsp;</div>

            If you have folders in Windows Live Mail, adding your Outlook.com account to Windows Live Mail will give you a second set of folders that match your Outlook.com folders and are synched with your Outlook.com mailbox.&nbsp; You should now be able to move the
 original folders or their contents to the Outlook.com account folders or create new folders within the Outlook.com account folder set and move the old messages to those folders.

            Hi Mick, sometimes, that 'Repair Now' function does not solve this, follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Quick Repair and if that does not resolve this, go for the full Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .       
        </p>

<h2>            Outlook 2011 for Mac Won&#39;t Sync with Exchange Server</h2>
                    <p>I installed Outlook 2011 a couple of weeks ago. &nbsp;It worked fine until the last couple of days. &nbsp;Now when I first open Outlook it syncs but after a short while quits syncing and just shows "sync pending for this folder" but nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled and reinstalled and instead of using auto discover manually entered the server information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to happen when the Junk Mail folder selected. &nbsp;Sync hangs up and blocks and sending &amp; receiving. &nbsp; Usually if I quit Outlook and reopen it resets and begins to work for a short while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please see my answers below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <em>Where do I choose the language for the application?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This specific version of Skype doesn't have an option to change the language for the application.&nbsp; It is dependent to&nbsp;your Windows 10 settings and language hence it should follow the language set on&nbsp;the&nbsp;system.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you
 initially set up Skype in English then you can reset the Skype app by going to <strong>
Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Apps </strong>&gt; <strong>Click on Skype
</strong>&gt; <strong>Advance Options </strong>&gt; <strong>Reset</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. <em>Where do I change the language for Skype chats?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - You will need to use Skype Translator to change the language (<span style="color: rgba(43, 43, 48, 1)"><strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34542/how-do-i-set-up-and-use-skype-translator?q=tranlsator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How
 do I set up and use Skype Translator?</span></a></strong>)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. <em>Where do I switch off the auto-correction in Skype chats?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - As mentioned above, autocorrect option is dependent in Windows 10. I suggest you reset the Skype app first and check if this will acquire the settings from Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will wait for the outcome.</p>

<p>1/ I have Windows settings in POlish, I don't want to reinstall it again. the Skype application is in Polish, too. I reset it according to your instructions, but it didn't help or change anything for me. The Skype is still in Polish, the autocorrection is
 still on. Although I had disabled the autocorrection in Windows the previous day. No influence on Skype.</p>
<p>The Skype application language is Polish, the chat lang. is probably Polish as I get underlined each word that is not Polish, with the additional autocorrection, which is a nuissance.</p>
<p>2/ Translation is no good for me. Skype machine translation of English and Polish is just funny. I'm not in a mood to laugh each time I start a converstation.</p>
<p>3/ I reset Skype after changing the autocorrection in Windows - no influence. Windows has the autocorrection switched off, Skype keeps corrcting the words which Skype considers similar to the Polish words automatically.</p>
<p>Thanks for trying, but I think the problem is with the Windows and Skype.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6b43db45-7949-4639-8f3c-f7496c7ca597" title="MarzenaLubaszewska">
<p>
</p><p>The translator is the only option available as of the moment for Skype. There is no option aside form the translator which will allow a user to change&nbsp;the chat language. I will take note of this and forward it to our developers for them to review this function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the auto correct, we recommend that you contact our live chat support as they can thoroughly check your system and perform advance troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent you a private message on how to proceed.</p>
<p>Please check your community inbox which you can access via this link: <strong>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>It is not only about the possibiliyt to change the Skype chat language, as about choosing the Skype chat language to begin with. Right now there is no such option.</p>
<p>The Translation option cannot be used in lieu of the language choosing option. The machine translation does not really work well and I would rather communicate using the languages I know myself.</p>
<p>I would not like the Support team to mess with my system. So thank you for your time.</p>
<p>If you may, please let the Sofware developers know that the autocorrection switch ON/OFF should be allowed for the users.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
