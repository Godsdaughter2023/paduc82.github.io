<h2>            Mute a person in a multi call</h2>
                    I would like to know if it is possible to silence a specific person in a Skype conversation. So that I can talk to that person but he can not talk to me (being silenced).&nbsp;I think that it's impossible, it would be good if they implement it, what do you
 say?

    <title>Edit Environment Variables of Standard User Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ustulo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edit Environment Variables of Standard User Account</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10, how can I set user-level (not system wide) environment variables for a standard user account? To clarify: I'm not talking about editing system environment variables. Also, just running the System app in Control Panel as admin won't work because
 that would set the environment variables for that admin user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Control Panel -&gt; User Accounts, then click the "Change my environment variables" link in the left-hand action pane, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to the search box on the task bar and type "environment", then click "Edit environment variables for your account", nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I have JAVA_HOME set to an incorrect value in my user account, which is a standard user not an admin. If I edit environment variables as admin, it does not show up in the system environment variables nor in the user environment variables (since
 the Administrator account is a different user).</p>

            <p>Hi ustulo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bug in Windows 10. This command-line is supposed to be run when you click
<p>
</p><p>rundll32 sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it has no effect whether you run it as Standard user or Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look at the other options (Command Prompt / PowerShell) mentioned in these links:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>The screen dump will have to wait as I have to catch Devices And Printers whilst the little black&nbsp;clock icon appears. The icon is sometimes visible for a few seconds then disappears. I need to "catch it in the act".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst your link to the snipit tool is useful I'll just use Alt+PrtSc to capture the Devices And Printers window. Got more chance of capturing the image that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it's anything to do with print jobs, as although I have an all-in-one&nbsp;printer/scanner installed I wasn't printing anything at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also it's not just the Printer Device which is affected. I also have a flatbed scanner which I wasn't using at the time and I just happened to be in Devices and Printers when I saw the little clock icon being displayed beside that before it disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also seen the clock icon being displayed beside the icon for my main machine in Devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of that&nbsp;I have a number of "virtual" printers installed&nbsp;- Fax/PDF Printer etc.. and I've seen the clock icon being displayed beside those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post back here when I have a screen dump to post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Ok. Please find attached screen dump of Devices And Printers as requested.</p>
<p>Please note, other than displaying these icons the operation of the PC doesn't seem to be affected.</p>
<p>I'm just curious why they appear in the first place.</p>

            <p>Hello Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though not sure completely, we believe that as you had these clock icons in the devices, it meant that some driver components/files for that particular device&nbsp;were in installation or being updated and hence they were not available or the complete features
 of the device wasn't available completely until the installation/update was done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as you said that the problem has fixed itself, we believe that the components for that device had installed/updated hence the issue is resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we wanted to know, do you see a tick besides the devices now that had a clock icon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to us with the necessary details so that we can resolve your issue at the earliest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a good day!</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed the Anniversary Update last week and since then none of the Devices/Printers have a tick beside them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to set the Printer as the Default Printer after installing the Anniversary |Update and Windows displayed the following message.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80ac49a9-fa0e-4272-aaea-42aef8158fad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80ac49a9-fa0e-4272-aaea-42aef8158fad" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I therefore abandoned setting the Default Printer as I'll let Windows manage it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing more to add at the moment. Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, Gary</p>

            The reason this is happening is because your using Windows 10 and it is a&nbsp;steaming pile of&nbsp;horse hockey!

<h2>            Xbox One Elite Controller &#40;V1 and sadly V2&#41; stick drift</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi there,</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">over the years I bought 2 first generation Xbox One Elite Controllers. At both old ones the shoulder bridge for LB and RB broke after some usage. This is known issue can be fixed with spare parts - but it should not happen at the
 pricing - and the title "Elite".&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Besides that, both V1 ones had sooner or later analog (left) stick drift.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I did tons of research, but opening it was no solution for me - software attempts failed.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">So I bought some razor controller.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Now the new V2 Elite came into my fingers. I tought: They might have fixed the (known) issues.</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">After 40 hours of usage I got stick drift again. I m so sad and disappointed, that Microsoft is unable in 2018 to learn from the feedback of thousands of users and fix the issues for a kinda expensive controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I don`t see any chance this can be fixed with drivers/software - so I`ll just surrender and give up my hope.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" />

            Both my Elites have lasted forever. My first one died of old age. I know loads of people who have had the same experience. I think that issue comes down to the user and game play. Some people just play harder, more aggressively or just hold the controller
 in a unique way. It's also important to keep in mind that general wear and tear affects all electronics differently. You can still get the controller serviced/replaced since it's under warranty. I would start there and hope the fixed/new one works as you would
 like.&nbsp;

<p>You know google? Well its a microsoft discussion - you might only know bing. Anyways - It`s not only me. But I feel calm and happy now - since an Ambassador has not one single problem at all.&nbsp;<br />
Actually I`m even impressed, how kind and polite you wrote, that I`m using the controller too hard and/or false.&nbsp;<br />

Anyhow. Since you might want to ignore that most users dont poste here - here is the result only from this platform:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            I'm in the same boat - left joystick drift.&nbsp; speaking with chat, my only recourse is to buy another since the controller is out of warranty.&nbsp; Funny ... since I see on other forums that Microsoft has informally recognized the problem with the elite and
 have provided one time replacement out of warranty.&nbsp; Not my case though.&nbsp; I'm not a tough player - no tossing or dropping either.&nbsp; If I'm going to buy another, might just go for a Scuf or other make - as much as it feels nice when new, the elite is pretty
 much a waste of money long term.

    <title>Windows 8.1 not Available in Store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jason khor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 not Available in Store</h2>
                    After I downloaded the Windows 8.1 Preview update, it prompted me to restart my computer. By default, it should prompt me to the Store to get the download for Windows 8.1 Preview. What happened to me was a little bit of tragedy. I did get the dialog box
 to prompt me into the Store but, at the time... My internet connection was lost, so my computer couldn't load me into the Store. So, I went back into the desktop to reconnect my internet. After I did that, I went for the Store immediately but the page to download
 Windows 8.1 Preview was not there. Instead, the Store showed me the usual page to download all of the other apps. I went back to the Windows 8.1 Preview page to redownload and reinstall the update. During the process of reinstallation, it showed me another
 dialog box telling me that the update was already installed in my computer. So, any help will be very much appreciated. Thank you!

    <title>Windows installer can&#39;t install or uninstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grantgibbons  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows installer can&#39;t install or uninstall</h2>
                    I have Windows 8 installed on my Machine, and it is having some issues, particularlly with installing and uninstalling features when using the windows installer.&nbsp; When I try to uninstall an program with the Windows installer, it will open, and say XXX
 is currently being installed, and the progress bar will just sit, and not move.&nbsp; After about 30 minutes, a pop up will come up and say "Windows Installer is no longer Responding".<br />
<br />
30 minutes is a long time to wait for 0 progress, if you try to abort out of the installer after it has started, you will not be able to.&nbsp; Clicking on the "cancel" button, or trying to click the X in the upper right corner will not close the installer.&nbsp; Eventually
 the install/uninstall will fail and you will get a message that says that the install/uninstall has been interrupted, and to try again later.&nbsp; (Trying again later will not help)<br />
<br />
Not all programs have the issue, but the following programs all have the same issue on my computer (Jing, Google Drive, Amazon Cloud)<br />
<br />
I have tried to re-install the windows downloader, but the windows downloder has the same issue as well (cannot install it, o progression)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have tried to run a restore point, but the System restore button is greyed out and just says "system restore...".&nbsp; Under protection settings it says "Searching..." under available drives, and never says anything else.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have the 64 bit OS.&nbsp; But have noticed that many of my programs say 32 bit.

<p>Unregister Windows Installer, and then reregister Windows Installer. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R</p>
<p>2. In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /unreg", and then press ENTER.</p>

<br />For example:
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Are all icons missing from your Desktop, if so, right click your Desktop, choose View - Show Desktop Icons
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Are you seeing Square tiles instead of icons on your Desktop, if so, you are in Tablet Mode:
<br />
<br />Press the Windows Key + A to open the Notification Bar 
<br />If you cannot see the Tablet Mode button, click 'Expand' 
<br />Then click the Tablet Mode button

<p>If you are using an old computer, there are some things you should take into account if you are upgrading to Windows 7 – System Requirements. Doing a house cleaning in the operating system might not necessarily be enough to speed up that old computer. Instead
 a hardware upgrade of components might just be what you need to achieve better performance. The first three things that come to mind are Memory, Processor and Storage. These three components can add a dramatic improvement to your computers performance. One
 of the great things about running Windows 7 is the memory foot print is about the same as Windows Vista and its more efficient because of a lot of complex low level changes the Windows Team made to the operating system with how it loads programs, services
 and devices. Anyway, if you do upgrade to Windows 7, here are few things you can do to speed things up even more.</p>

<p><em>Preparing Disk cleanup </em></p>
<p><strong>Disk Cleanup – </strong>This is always a favorite place to start, because it list many of the common locations where old unused files that are often not needed any more are stored. To find Disk Cleanup, click Start, type: Disk Cleanup. Alternatively,
 you can find it under Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools. When Disk Cleanup is started, you are prompted to select the drive on which you would like to do the cleanup. In this case, its the operating system drive where Windows 7 is installed,
 usually C:\. If you are running Windows 7 in a dual boot configuration with another operating system, click in the list box and select the drive on which it is installed. Click OK.</p>

</p>
<p><em>Disk Cleanup dialog</em></p>
<p>An initialization wizard will scan you hard disk to check for areas of the system you will be able to run the clean up on. After the scanning is complete, the Disk Cleanup dialog appears. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up
 safely. The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures
 Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong><em>Location/Type</em></strong></td>
<td><strong><em>Description</em></strong></td>
<td><strong><em>Safe to Delete</em></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Downloaded Program Files</strong></td>
<td>Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk.
</td>
<td><strong>YES</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Temporary Internet Files</strong></td>
<td>The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact.
<em>Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster.
</em></td>
<td><strong>Keep It</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Offline Webpages</strong></td>
<td>Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your
 personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. <em>I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content.
</em></td>
<td><strong>Keep It</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Recycle Bin</strong></td>
<td>The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin.
<em>Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before.
</em></td>
<td><strong>YES</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Temporary files</strong></td>
<td>Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week.
<em>You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the
<strong>Run Command </strong>(Windows key + R), type in <strong>%temp% </strong>&gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every
 time. </em></td>
<td><strong>YES</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Thumbnails</strong></td>
<td>Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed.
<em>I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos.
</em></td>
<td><strong>YES</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Debug Dump Files</strong></td>
<td>When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as
<em>System error memory dump files</em> to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review.
</td>
<td><strong>Keep It</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>System error memory dump files</strong></td>
<td>Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur
 in Windows. </td>
<td><strong>Keep It</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from Windows Vista
 or clean install, Windows 7 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
</p>
<p>A folder you might be familiar with is the Windows.old, in a future article I will be taking a closer look at this directory. Its basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reinstall Windows</a> if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings.
 The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space and reduce the systems performance. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 7 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories
 and ensure that everything migrated successfully to Windows 7. </p>
<p><strong>System Restore</strong> – The Windows Team has added some nice enhancements to Windows 7’s System Restore feature, allowing you to keep a larger collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your

System Images of Windows 7</a>. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 7 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that
 System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of&nbsp; disk space to keep System Restore Points.</p>
<p><a href="http://byfiles.storage.msn.com/y1p6JHqHI0p1hl2oiYyFdJc3MWSKFyRZxBapTmFd4hj5pLd6lucVC1xtKxj_iZKl_68Ptl1P42RQhY?PARTNER=WRITER" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fbyfiles.storage.msn.com%2fy1psz-4ZwIYzsH8_TMcQILM-Vl-piR0hZnA-cAbvXqXECfIa8EnHQ6MUuijFIh2OAFxDRySj9ToBdU%3fPARTNER%3dWRITER" /></a>
</p>
<p><em>Configuring System Protection settings</em></p>
<p>To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the
<strong>Configure </strong>button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the
 amount allocated. Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System
 Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance,
 if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Performance Information and Tools</strong></p>
<p>Introduced in Windows Vista, it provides a lists of your computer’s Windows Experience Index base score, which indicates the performance and overall capability of your computer’s hardware. If you look under the Task pane in Performance Information and Tools,
 you will see Tasks where you can make further adjustments to improve the performance of your computer.

<p><strong>Visual Effects – </strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/11/10/making-windows-7-your-own-personalize-and-themes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Back in November</a> I discussed some of the theming capabilities built into Windows 7. Some of these themes
 are designed for PC’s with limited capabilities. Microsoft calls these Basic and High Contrast themes. To access them, right click your desktop, click Personalize.</p>
<p><em>Windows Aero Basic</em> – For computers that cannot support the minimum graphics requirements of Windows Aero Glass. Aero Basic features the standard elements of the Windows 7 interface except for the translucent effects and animations. Instead, areas
 such as the Taskbar, window borders display a blue/grayish color scheme. Other unavailable features include the inability to choose a Window Color, see and interact with thumbnail previews, Alt-Tab Preview, Flip 3D and Aero Peek.
</p>
<p><em>Windows Classic</em><strong> </strong>- First introduced with Windows 95, this experience was the flagship theme for Windows for many years and was replaced by Windows XP’s Luna in 2001 but is still included in Windows for persons who are not quite ready
 for the changes in Windows 7. Microsoft has made some changes to Windows Classic in Windows 7 where menus are concerned. The standard look and feel still exist, but Microsoft has decided to remove the Standard Classic Menu that was available as an option in
 both Windows XP and Vista. Personally, I agree with this, since the new Start menu offers so many benefits such as Instant Search, easier access to programs, better control (no cascading/off screen sub menus), ability to search HomeGroups, Public directories
 and detailed results when presented. The new Start menu also introduces support for features unique to Windows 7 such as Jump List providing access to task and recently accessed files associated with a program.
</p>
<p><em>High Contrast themes</em><strong> </strong>- If you have difficulty reading or viewing your screen, Windows has for years included high-contrast color schemes that heightens the color contrast of some text and images on your computer, making those items
 more distinct and easier to identify. </p>

</p>
<p><em>Indexing Options</em> </p>
<p><strong>Indexing Options – </strong>Instant Search makes it quick and easy to find personal files and folders you commonly use. To improve the performance of your search experience, make sure the Index is not set to search the entire computer, searching
 areas such as System and Program Files directory can greatly slow down the performance of your searches and provide less reliable results. You can instead add folders you often search or store files.
</p>
<p><strong>Power Settings – </strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/12/02/environmentally-friendly-decisions-for-todays-pc-user/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">In December</a>, we talked about some of the energy efficiency improvements built into Windows 7 that allow
 you be more productive on the go and also provide better performance in certain scenarios.
</p>
<p><em>Windows 7 extends battery life for your mobile PC, helping you be productive longer while still getting great performance. Power-saving enhancements include increasing the idle time for the processor, automatically dimming the display, and more power-efficient
 playback for DVDs. With Windows 7, you’re also kept better-informed about battery status.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Get Idle and Stay Idle Longer.</em></strong> An idle processor reduces battery life. Windows 7 reduces background activities and supports the trigger-starting of system services, so your computer’s processor can be in an idle state more often.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Adaptive Display Brightness.</em></strong> The display on a typical mobile PC consumes more battery power than any other part of the computer. Windows 7 automatically reduces display brightness after a period of inactivity, much like cell phones
 do today. And Windows 7 intelligently adapts to your activity. For example, if the screen dims after 30 seconds and you immediately move the mouse to brighten<br />
the display, Windows 7 will wait 60 seconds before dimming the display again. <strong>

<p><strong>Startup Performance</strong></p>
<p>We install a lot of applications on our computers. Sometimes, those applications will place special files in areas of the operating system such as the Startup Folder to make launching the application faster. Sometimes a program might even create a special
 Service that prepares itself when Windows is starting up. If you have a lot of these types of programs installed, some of them can have a adverse effect on your systems performance. To resolve this, you can simply launch the Microsoft Configuration Utility
 (msconfig). MSCONFIG provides a host of options for managing how your computer starts up and also for diagnostic purposes when your system might not start properly. To launch MSCONFIG, click
<strong>Start</strong>, type: <strong>msconfig.exe</strong>, hit <strong>Enter </strong>
on your keyboard, or click <strong>msconfig.exe </strong>result in the Start menu.

<p>When msconfig is displayed on your screen, you will see the main interface, General (tab), which manages how your computer starts. The main tab we need to go to is
<strong>Startup. </strong>At this tab, we will see a list of items that startup with the system when Windows is loading. Now, there are some programs in here that are essential, but some might not be needed when the computer starts, check out the following
 table of some of the applications I have that load programs during start up and the ones I have unchecked:</p>

<p>There is my list, of course yours will vary because of the hundreds of millions of configurations that exist and the millions of applications available for Windows. If you are unsure about a program, do a search on the Internet about it before unchecking.
 Keep a small inventory of the programs you are using, look in the notification area of the Windows Taskbar to see what is displayed. Hover the mouse pointer over the icon, which will display a balloon about that program. Also,
<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
do a backup</a> before unchecking anything. If you do get confused, the Startup tab displays a button near the bottom of the window called
<em>Restore Startup Programs…,</em> which will restore the startup items to their default configuration.

<p>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, click
<strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click <strong>
Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click

<h2>            SYSTEM RESTORE&#58; Automatic Restore Points are not created in Windows 8.</h2>
                    <p>Automatic Restore Points never being created. I could do it manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer is a HP Notebook g6-2237us, which I received from Hewlett-Packard on March 19, 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this time I have performed 5 "resets or reinstalls" with the help of HP technicians by telephone, one free-house-call from HP, one time sent to La Vergne, Tennessee to the HP repair facilities, which it was returned to me on July 24th, 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this had been done with different problems with the Notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had ran sfc /scannow a few times. No errors found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Track Scheduler does not show AUTOMATIC RESTORE POINTS IN SYSTEM RESTORE.</p>

            <p><span><font color="#000000">Hi Roberto,
</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">1. Which security software is installed on the computer?</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">2. Have you installed any third party registry optimization software?</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Let us follow these methods:</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Method 1.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Press Windows key + R, type “services.msc” to open the Services window.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Navigate and locate the “Volume shadow copy” service from the list.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Double click the service to change the status to started and set startup type to Automatic.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Method 2.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">I would first suggest you to check if the “show more restore points” option is selected in the system
 restore options. If this option is not selected, it will show only the recent restore point created. Refer these steps:</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">a) Press Windows key + F, type “Recovery” in the search box.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">b) Click on the settings tile below the search box.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">c) Click on the recovery tile and click “configure system restore”.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">d) Click on the system restore button and click next.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">e) By default, only the recent restore point will be displayed, click on the box against “show more
 restore points” below.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">f) Now check.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If the above step didn’t show the restore points, then I would suggest you to check the disk space
 allotted to restore points. If very less space is allotted to store restore points, then it will automatically delete the old restore points. Refer these steps to check:</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">a) Press Windows key + F, type “Recovery” in the search box.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">b) Click on the settings tile below the search box.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">c) Click on the recovery tile and click “configure system restore”.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">d) Click on “Configure” button and check the disk space allotted.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Method 3.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">The check box to display more restore points will not appear if there are no other restore point available.
 Also older restore points will be deleted if the maximum disk space allocated for System Restore has been reached.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Press the
<font><b>WinKey+X</b> to display the system menu and click
<b>System</b></font>.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">On the<font><b> left side</b> menu, select
<b>System Protection</b></font>.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Select the
<font><b>System Drive</b> (usually <b>C :</b>) and click the
<b>Configure</b></font> button.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Look at the
<font><b>Max Usage</b> slider and make sure that you have it set to a large number (Usually at least<b>15%</b></font> of the total hard drive space).</font></span></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You had mentioned that you are using AVAST Security program and CCleaner program installed on the computer. So, I would like to ask, if you have checked
 if they are causing this issue. If not, then I would suggest you to do that as the next step. This is because, there are instances where the security program might interfere with the windows features like System Restore.
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>So, you may get in touch with the AVAST Support and temporarily disable the AVAST program and check if that is causing this issue. You may contact the

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You may also check if this issue is caused by the automatic cleanup of the CCleaner program on the computer. There are some temporary files which are
 required to keep the System Restore Points on the computer. So, if you have any registry cleaner program (like CCleaner) installed on the computer, there are chances where this program may remove these temporary files as a part of its normal cleanup activity.
 Thus, you may not be able to find the restore points on the computer.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>So, I would also suggest you to uninstall the CCleaner program for the time being and check if that resolves the issue.</font></font></font></p>

<h2>            Cellular&#47;SIM connection not available&#47;disappearing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've deployed several Lenovo laptops with Windows 10 out to users and several users have reported issues losing their cellular connection. Recently, it has only affected one user consistently. When I set up these laptops, I installed a Verizon SIM card
 into each. They all activated and worked. I could get out to the internet using the SIM/cellular connection. However, the users will report the "cellular" option is missing from the connections list like it doesn't see the SIM card. Restarting the laptop sometimes
 work, as does re-seating the SIM card. However, many times none of those options work or if they do work, the problem eventually comes back. For two users in particular, I replaced the SIM card but the problem re-surfaced. It seems to resolve itself sporadically,
 maybe after a few restarts. The drivers for the cellular adapter are up-to-date. I've tried disabling Blutooth, unchecking "let windows manage this connection" for Cellular, and I even contacted Lenovo to see if they are aware of any issues. They say there
 have been no reports of this specific issue with this model laptop. This leads me to believe it's an issue with the OS, cellular adapter, SIM cards, SIM card in combination with the OS, all of the above, or maybe a setting I'm just missing. This has affected
 more than one of these laptops and we've only received and deployed them 5 or 6 months ago. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
A faulty cellular adapter is one of the possible reasons why the cellular connection is disappearing from the laptop. A disabled adapter in the Network Connections Settings can also be the cause of this issue. We suggest you to enable the cellular connection
 in the Network Connections settings. You can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>key.</li><li>Type <strong>View Network Connections.</strong></li><li>Press the <strong>Enter </strong>key. </li><li>Right-click on the cellular adapter and click <strong>Enable</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>

<p>Hello Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has appeared again and I tried this but the cellular adapter was already enabled. The system still indicated there was no connection. This is the third Verizon SIM card we've sent to this user and I confirmed the card is active and there's nothing
 wrong with our Verizon account. Also, it was working for a while the other day and then recently stopped again. It appears as if the laptop randomly stops detecting the card. This has happened to at least two other users over the past month as well. But for
 this one user in particular, it seems to be an ongoing problem.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that the network connection settings is properly configured and there's no problem with your internet service provider, it seems that the network adapter itself is having an issue. In this case, we suggest contacting the device manufacturer for a hardware

    <title>Windows 10 Static Screen, Can&#39;t Interact - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sabrinamayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Static Screen, Can&#39;t Interact</h2>
                    <p>Since the update every time my laptop goes to sleep or I close the screen without shutting it down, when I awaken it the screen becomes a static grey and I can't interact with anything. The only solution I've found so far is to just force shut the computer
 down and reboot it, but that's not ideal so any other solution that could prevent this from happening again would be much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is an MSI GL62 6QF, I've not added any new drivers, have not used my laptop any differently than before the update, and never had this issue before. I'm running Windows 10 version 1709.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Sabrina.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this is Fall Creators Update Version 1709, which you can check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About, you can  roll it back at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery, then hide it using the Hide Updates Tool until it matures.  
<br />
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />Next check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer Chipset and other drivers to Update.  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters. 
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

            Hi Sabrina,  your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If the rollback option is greyed out:
<br />
<br />Right click on your display adapter, click 'Uninstall device' 
<br />Choose 'Delete the driver software for this device' then click 'Uninstall'
<br />Restart the computer (myst be a restart, not a shut down) 
<br />Windows will then download the correct driver       
        </p>

    <title>Vertical lines upon waking laptop from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aceraspirerproblems  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vertical lines upon waking laptop from sleep</h2>
                    <p>I am currently experiencing a problem with my Acer Aspire R5-471T, x64 where every time I open my laptop from having closed it, the screen looks like the below image with lots of vertical lines and the cursor showing as a darker square of coloured lines.
 I can move the cursor around and see different colours as it moves over different areas of my page, but the only way to make the lines go away is to hard restart my computer by holding down the power button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've gone into Intel Graphics Setting and made sure my driver is up to date. Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This could be due to integrated graphics or memory issue. To properly isolate this issue, kindly answer the queries below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Any recent changes made on the computer prior to the problem?</li><li>Have you tried reinstalling the graphics device driver?</li><li>Have you tried running the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool?<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
We hope to hear from you soon.</p>

            I'm having this same issue on a brand new Dell Inspiron 15 7000 gaming. twice in a row when waking from sleep (asleep for at least 1 hour). My screen looks just like the image given by OP. I also have the latest updates installed for all drivers, though
 I have not run the windows memory diagnostic yet.

            I've just confirmed that very time I close my laptop lid the vertical lines appear upon reopening. Also(related or not?) when I disable applications from the "Startup" tab in the task manager, they are always re-enabled when I turn on the laptop.

            Do you hvae any software installed from 3Dconnexion or Dassault Systèmes (like Catia) for CAD, Drawing, etc.?<br />
<br />
If so, your issue is most likely with their software and you should pursue your issue using their Support resources.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Usually an error 0xc00000005 has something to do with permissions and access denied kinds of things.<br />
<br />
Since we don't know anything else about your system if it was ever working before, what led up to this problem, what you are trying to do when you get the message, etc. that is probably the best advice you can expect at the moment.<br />

<p>The micro soft site only has word viewer 2003.</p>
<p>

            <p>The Word Viewer link I posted earlier lists the following details:</p>
<p>
View, print and copy Word documents, even if you don't have Word installed. This download is a replacement for Word Viewer 2003 and all previous Word Viewer versions.
<br />
<br />
The Word Viewer, together with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p><ul>
<li>Word Document (.docx)</li><li>Word Macro-Enabled Document (.docm)</li><li>Rich Text Format (.rtf)</li><li>Text (.txt)</li><li>Web Page formats (.htm, .html, .mht, .mhtml)</li><li>WordPerfect 5.x (.wpd)</li><li>WordPerfect 6.x (.doc, .wpd)</li><li>Works 6.0 (.wps)</li><li>Works 7.0 (.wps)</li><li>XML (.xml)</li></ul>
<br />
With Word Viewer and the Compatibility Pack, you can view, print, and copy document contents to another program. However, you cannot edit an open document, save a document, or create a new document. This download is a replacement for Word Viewer 2003 and all
 previous Word Viewer versions. <br />
<br />
NOTE: If you comply with the other license terms for the Word Viewer, you may distribute this viewer without a document created in Microsoft Office.
<br />
<br />
If the document you want to view is stored on OneDrive, you don’t need to download a viewer. OneDrive includes Word Online, which enables you to open the document in your web browser. If you have permission, you can even edit the document in your browser. For
 more information about Word Online, see <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/web-apps-help/introduction-to-word-web-app-HA010378341.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
<strong>Compatibility Pack for the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint File Formats</strong>
<br />
<br />
To reduce file size, improve reliability, and enhance integration with external sources, Microsoft has added new file formats to Microsoft Office 2007 and later versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. To help ensure that you can open files in these new formats,
 Microsoft has developed a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 formats:
<ul>
<li>Word Document (.docx)</li><li>Word Macro-Enabled Document (.docm)</li></ul>
<br />
Note: When you use the Word Viewer to view files that are saved in these formats, you will see a Word version of the file. The following Word 2007 and Word 2010 items will be affected:
<ul>
<li>Features that do not exist in Word 2003</li><li>Layout that uses properties that do not exist in Word 2003</li></ul>
<br />
For more information on specific changes, see the following:

            <p>The limitation on working with Web Credentials in Win-10 / Edge is, to say the least, annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I frequently visit a website which has a private log-on section which is not a secure (https:) site.&nbsp; Edge asks for the logon info but does not offer the option to remember it, therefore I am forced to type it in each time I visit.</p>
