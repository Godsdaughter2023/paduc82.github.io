<h2>            Sound is muffled after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from 8.1 to Windows 10 and now my sound is horrible. It is muffled and muddy and totally unintelligible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to update my drivers and that did not do anything. They were up to date.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3efa5de0-c37b-438a-95bc-a2119a01e2ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3efa5de0-c37b-438a-95bc-a2119a01e2ba" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>If it is a driver problem, how do I get the correct driver if it is already up to date, and how do I install a different driver if I can get one? And how do I make sure the correct driver doesn't get overridden later on when the current driver gets updated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing some other drivers through exe files:</p>
<p>0006-64bit_Win7_Win8_Win81_Win10_R279.exe</p>
<p>Audio_Driver_GHVD4_WN_6.0.1.7054_A01.EXE</p>
<p>MEDIA-Creative-Technology-Ltd-SB-Recon3D-PCIe.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>They did nothing for me and this still says the same driver as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, headphones still sound OK. I just can't use headphones for watching a DVD with friends, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have windows 10 pro installed on my computer. The version I am running at the moment is 10.0.10240</p>
<p>I think this is not the latest version of windows. If i search for updates it says that there are no updates.</p>
<p>I would love to update to the newest version of windows.</p>

            <p>None of this helps. I have a brand new Surface Book and when I was setting it up today it wouldn't allow me to sign into my account. It simply says "something went wrong" and suggests I try again later. So I try again after 5 or 6 hours and get the same
 result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other anomalies, too. My time is 30-odd days and&nbsp;90 minutes out of sync, despite me having set up the correct time zone&nbsp;and DST settings and allowing it to auto set the time. Edge also warns me that the security certificate for this site is not
 valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is that manually setting the correct time and date fixes everything.</p>

    <title>Installing Windows 8 on old windows vista computer with upgraded - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing Windows 8 on old windows vista computer with upgraded harddrive problem</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;I recently moved my old 128 gb solid state drive from my desktop and replaced it in my laptop. &nbsp;I purchased an upgrade version of windows 8 that will upgrade over windows 7, or windows vista.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My laptop is over 3 years old, I put a lot of money into it, unforunately, I purchased it a few weeks before the intel i7 came out. &nbsp;Anyways, Dual core with 6 gb of ram. &nbsp;It came stock with Vista Home Premium 64 bit, and a free upgrade to Windows 7 when
 it was released which I received and upgraded too.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Last year I received a free copy of Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit version, I saw on other posts that you could interchange between the two versions with teh same product key. &nbsp;My plan first was to install Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit ( I own a version of this
 for my desktop) and use the 32 bit key, however it gave me an error say the key was for OEM products only i believe (this was a few days ago) so I gave up on using that plan and tried to install the old windows vista home premium system recovery disk I purchased
 extra when I bought the laptop and it got through everything and gave me an error at the end say: &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>

ERRORS__[17:57:02.62] ChkErrBB.CMD : Detect some error during PININST_BBV.__[17:57:02.62] ChkErrBB.CMD
</div>
<div>The error told me that I had to redo the installation, I have now redone the installation about 4 times always with the same error, I was able to actually end task that into the desktop. &nbsp;However, I went into the Harddrive and noticed that my c drive was
 only 58 gb and a second partition had been created of 400 mb in size and the other 60 gb was unallocated. &nbsp;I removed the drive and reformatted and tried again and had the same problem. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So does anyone have any suggestions for me? &nbsp;I just want to end up with my laptop running Windows 8 Pro 64 Bit</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To reiterate I have:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit disk - key is used by my desktop</div>
<div>A Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit disk - unused product key</div>
<div>A Windows Vista Home Premium 64 Bit - system recovery and a Windows 7 upgrade installation disk with Product Key</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone explain why the harddrive is getting the weird size partition on it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Laptop is a HP HDX16t, Solid State is Crucial - 2.5 years old. &nbsp;</div>

<p>I had that problem with my pen.&nbsp;&nbsp; My workaround was to start the Magnifier in Lens mode (Win-+ Ctrl-Alt-L if necessary), drag it over the button and then I could right-click on it.&nbsp; That is the only (necessary) use I have for that button.&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative
 is: starting the OSK and tapping Win-X.&nbsp; Either way was ridiculous but both worked.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't use that machine any more so no more trouble like that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting the OSK and double-tapping the Win- key would be a workaround for you.&nbsp; I used to use that one too before the Start button was always visible&nbsp;(and when the Charms bar was impossible to dig out.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that while these are all being described as workarounds for Touch and Pen issues they are equally applicable for Mouse issues.&nbsp; FWIW I have never had the same type of issues with my mouse as I had with Touch and Pen.</p>

            <p>Perhaps you have an afflicted Explorer Shell Extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several recent incident involving Acer systems and MyWinLocker from EgisTec (which is already known to include some suspicious Explorer shell extensions) which may have come preinstalled on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in your Installed Programs and find MyWinLocker or anything from EgisTec and you don't know what it is or why it is there consider just uninstalling it, rebooting and then see how things work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find out follow the instructions below and when you are able to see all the Explorer shell extensions and start to disable them go ahead and start with the ones from EgisTec, PSD Security Software, eDataSecurity, DragDropProtect (they will be some of
 the pink extensions when you see them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when XP feels threatened
 by a program and Windows will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; Windows should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft (it may be way out on the right side of the screen) to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" and be marked
 in pink since they are not Microsoft extensions, something like this: </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55a7130c-6d23-47e6-b452-9cb3bee4db8f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and&nbsp; letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; windows explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your (right click) failure
 condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.</p>
<p><br />
One user reported that there was a need to restart Explorer after each adjustment so to do that press Ctrl-E from within ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!

<h2>            Windows 10 Event Viewer Reports Errors&#59; What To Do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Today and also previous days, I have seen the following errors at startup, as reported in my Event Viewer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp; My PC seems to be running normally and I am not experiencing symptoms. &nbsp;<br />

<p>It really depends how the room is set up and viewing distance. I used to have a 720p 32" Samsung, but recently when some tech retailers had post-christmas sales, I bought a full HD 40" TV. For our living room the 32" was a tad small. For example when I was
 on the couch playing GTA V on 360, I couldn't read the subtitles even with glasses on (I don't usually use them except when watching TV to be able to read subtitles, but GTA V had too small subtitles even for glasses). And also with Xbox One in mind (that
 I don't have yet), I wanted to upgrade to a 1080p TV to get the most out of it.</p>
<p>42" probably would've fit here just fine, but I feel for my living room that starts to be the max. The TV "stand" can't really have much bigger one, but the 40" was on a big discount, so that was good enough. If investing in a new TV now, I would consider
 trying to find a full HD one, otherwise you end up upgrading probably too soon :P</p>

<p>Make sure it supports 1080p (1080i only you dont want).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Bigger the TV, longer the optimal viewing distance. 55" full HD wont look as good at 1,5m distance as 32" full HD. This is due to pixel density. At 3m thw 32" might feel too small then again. So you need to pick based on your own setup.</p>

<p>32" is more than enough especially as it's going to be used as a monitor. &nbsp;You'll need a 'crossover' VGA cable for the computer and the HDMI port will do X360 / X1. &nbsp;Just make sure the TV / Monitor has a VGA PORT for your PC.

<p>Thank you guys for your answer.</p>
<p>I do not have space unfortunatelly...i am not able to get a bigger TV than a 32' and the most bad thing is that the distance between me and the tv can be maximum 80 cm - 1 meter that's why i do not want to buy something bigger.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestion about the TV? think about that i was going to buy a 24' monitor untill Yesterday:</p>

<p>Whatever size it is, you get used to it. &nbsp;I play games on both a ginormous tv and a 24" monitor and it really makes no difference for me once I get focused on the game. &nbsp;You sit closer to the monitor so it seems bigger. &nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It seems that the mail app closes after deleting several emails.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I will certainly help you with this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Are you able use the mail app again?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Were there any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s follow these methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Update your app</span> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Keeping your app up to date is one way to make sure that it keeps working. You’ll see a notification in the Store whenever an update is available for your app.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To update the app, you can either tap or click the notification or follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a. </span></span><span><span>On the Start screen, tap or click </span>
</span><span><span>Store</span></span><span><span> to open the </span></span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span><span> Store.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b. </span></span><span><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
</span></span><span><span>Settings</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><br />
<span>(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
</span><span>Settings</span><span>.)</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c. </span></span><span>Tap or click <span>App updates</span>. <span>
If you haven't signed in to the </span><span>Windows</span><span> Store, sign in using your
</span><span>Microsoft</span><span> account.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d. </span></span><span>Tap or click <span>Check for updates</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>e. </span></span><span>If updates are available, swipe down on or right-click the app updates you want, and then tap or click
<span>Install</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Sync the app license</span> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If a license for an app is out of sync with the license installed on your PC, the app might stop working.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To sync your app licenses, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a. </span></span><span><span>On the Start screen, tap or click </span>
</span><span><span>Store</span></span><span><span> to open the </span></span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span><span> Store.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b. </span></span><span><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
</span></span><span><span>Settings</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><br />
<span>(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
</span><span>Settings</span><span>.)</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c. </span></span><span>Tap or click <span>App updates</span>. <span>
If you haven't signed in to the </span><span>Windows</span><span> Store, sign in using your
</span><span>Microsoft</span><span> account.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d. </span></span><span>Tap or click <span>Sync licenses</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to let us know. We will be glad to help you further.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

Read the different replies to your question&nbsp;in the above link.<br />
<br />
It would appear to be an AOL problem with their Software.<br />
<br />
Try this:<br />
<br />
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Restore Point:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc<br />
<br />

<h2>            Error - 1603 while trying to uninstall&#47;reinstall Windows Live Messenger, after accidently deleting the live folder.</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: 1603 error.</p>
<p>I somehow deleted windows live messenger by deleting all folders in my c drive without deleting or removing from add/remove programs.&nbsp; Now my msn messenger doesn't work.&nbsp; If I download Live Essentials and install it, it says your computer already has the
 program installed.&nbsp; If I use the msn messenger the prior version, it says your computer already has a higher version and gives 1603 error.&nbsp; I tried finding wlarp.exe to uninstall it properly, but my computer does not have this particular exe file.&nbsp; I tried
 deleting from registry key, just under software, microsoft and messenger and restart it, still shows the same status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My web msn works, but i want to work it in my desktop.&nbsp; what solutions you have; I think of booting it from cd and have a repair wizard, but F8 key does not give me the option of booting it from cd.&nbsp; Can anyone help?</p>

<br />
Someone in the forum asked me to do a system restore and below are the follow up:<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried restoring it to a previous date.&nbsp; This error happened 4 weeks ago, I have been trying to fix since then, so my computer won't restore it back to a month's date.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway that I can restore, Windows Live Essentials?&nbsp; I tried Installing Live Essentials from the web, and it says, I have all 5 Live Essentials program installed in my computer.&nbsp; I tried starting Windows Live Mail from the exe in my program files folder,
 it gives me another error: 0x80040154, 126<br />
<br />
Any help would help, as i am desperately trying to use MSN messenger.<br />
<br />
Also please note that I tried to find wlarp.exe which can be used to uninstall live messenger properly but could not find it.<br />
<br />
Please help!!

<p>Hey there Olga, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into these problems. Did you change the password on the Console or on a different Device? Also are you seeing any error messages when attempting to login or is it simply stating the password is incorrect?
</p>
<p>Go ahead and take a look at the following support article for help in accessing your account.

            Make sure you are typing all the letters on your password and numbers if you have them combined in a certain way do it one at a time dont rush sometimes that hapoens to me too for being too fast typing it.

            <p>We understand that, Anand. What about trying the suggestions by Arul_D on this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/windows-10-cannot-connect-to-internet-dns-error/014f70fc-0e23-4a42-99af-6c6acd25f54b">
<strong>link </strong></a>&nbsp; and see if it makes any difference? By the way, were you now able to pair your Bluetooth device?
</p>
<p>We look forward to your reply. </p>

<h3> jman0268  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movie maker Licensing</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering does the licensing allow&nbsp;Movie Maker be installed in a lab environment (multiple PC's at the same time)? My faculty here at the school where I work love the program and want to use it in the labs with their students. I read the license agreement
 but it does not say I can or can't for that matter unless I am misunderstanding the legal mumbo jumbo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Game error&#58; Connection problem and will auto disconnect in 30 seconds</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Lenovo gaming laptop recently and it was fine the first week I was using it. It ran games fast and had really good connection to servers. However on the second week I had it, a bug will occur every 30 seconds when playing my favorite games Team
 Fortress 2 and Counter Strike Global Offensive in which the connection will go out and I get an ingame error saying that I have a connection problem and that it will auto disconnect in 30 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check my wifi and I have full bars and I can browse the internet at high speeds. I'm not sure if this is a game problem or software problem, but I didn't have this problem on my old Mac and I might have to resort back to it.</p>

    <title>My Windows 8.1 Is Stuck In Aptio Setup Utility... Help&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> imaginaryrice  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Windows 8.1 Is Stuck In Aptio Setup Utility... Help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got a Windows 8 about 2 years ago, and it has been working fine until now. Recently, my computer gave me a pop up saying something about Google not working, and I that it wasn't with my new update. (I had updated it to a Window 8.1) I clicked no, due to
 a virus issue in the past, and I tried to get rid of it, but this pop up kept coming back, so I had no choice but to click 'Yes'. It got rid of the Google Icon on my desktop, so I asked my daughter to get it back for me. She did, but in order to, she needed
 to use Internet Explorer, which I dislike very much to it's slow mobility, and it's known cause for viruses. When she was finished, there was thing in the corner of my desktop, underneath my Google Icon, that was called "Optimizer" or "Super Optimizer." I
 attempted in getting rid of it, but instead I acquired more Malware some how, and some thing called Trojan Installer? I spent HOURS trying to get rid of those, and discovered 18+ other Malwares. I found something called "Spy-Hunt" or close to that, and it
 had a picture of a red spider as a logo. It gave me a free run, and it showed me TON of bad things lurking in my computer. The full version was $30, and like a fool, I bought. My daughter, who got me my Google Icon back, told me not to, but I still did. The
 findings it showed me on my computer had too many bad things on it for me NOT to buy it... When I bought it, it reset my computer, and showed me this black and white screen. I was unable to get a picture, but it had a lot of text, and a lot of numbers. After
 a while, it stopped, but instantly showed me ANOTHER screen that was similar, but half of it was with with white background, and black text; while the other was with black background, and white text. It gave me an error screen that read:&nbsp;Your PC ran into a
 problem and needs to restarts. were just collecting some error info, and then well restart for you (???% Complete.)</p>
<p>After multiple sets of reaching 100%, then re-doing it all, it brought me to the Aptio Setup Utility screen, and it will not let me exit it, or switch to Safe mode, or anything like that. Keyboard keys are NOT working, and it won't let me reset to defaults
 either.</p>
<p>What do I do? I very much need help.</p>

<h2>            Flickering Rise of Nations graphics issue</h2>
                    I just installed Rise of Nations on my Samsung Windows 8 laptop. The game runs fine up until the point where I go to options and everything flickers in and out and distorted colors run diagonally from the top left to the bottom right. The same thing happens
 when I try to play it. I've done all the possible solutions to this problems that others have had with Windows 8 following the same instructions, and yet it still doesn't work. Please help!!

            The issue is that when I go to the options screen or start a game, all these random colors just flicker on and off and it makes the game unplayable because I can't read any of the texts in the the game or even see the play map. It makes the game virtually
 unplayable. I have done everything from the troubleshooting steps on here, to program compatibility program, to manually installing updates which don't update because it can't read the language (I don't why know), to updating all graphics and video drivers,
 and to uninstalling and reinstalling several times. These steps do seem to work for other people, just not me. It's becoming very frustrating. :( I've also previously used those steps on that thread and none worked.<br />

            Ciao MaryamRahmani, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a Microsoft Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, did you try deleting both files in safe mode (WITHOUT NETWORKING) and see if someting changes?
<br />
<br />RESTART IN SAFE MODE WINDOWS 10
<br />Power on and off your computer three times. On the third time, your computer will boot into WinRE. Then Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Enable safe mode with networking
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped somehow. 
<br />
<br />Ciao

    <title>Windows 10 Update messes with Linux partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> masaruhayashi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update messes with Linux partition</h2>
                    <p>Update installation errors in the past have caused me much grief, such as my 'lovely' encounter 1 year ago found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-blue-screen-infinite-reboot-loop/e8173a18-f7b2-46d5-a71e-065466bbce16">Windows
 10 Blue Screen Infinite Reboot Loop</a>&nbsp;(mfw my old thread is labeled "answered" on search }:| ). Last month I got tired of dealing with constant registry errors and BS, so I configured my laptop to dual boot Windows 10 and Linux. My logic was that if Windows
 corrupted itself like it usually does, I could boot into Linux and recover my personal data (which I store on the Linux partition). Seemed like a great plan, until today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short: installed updates and have found my Linux installation ruined (infinite lag upon login; UI elements like taskbar completely missing). I checked the Linux partition via a third party program in Windows 10, worried that my data was lost;
 fortunately it was still there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However I have found 1 folder to inaccessible, displaying this message: data error (cyclic redundancy check). I can easily fix the Linux installation, but the corrupted folder is a big issue. CHKDSK via Command Prompt does not work on the Linux partition
 as the file system is considered RAW (strange as it's EXT4 according to properties), and file recovery programs are not working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of #$#@$ operating system is this?! Now I can't store data in my internal HDD and expect it to be intact anymore?! The spyware constantly spying on you and sending data back to Microsoft, the malware-like tendency for this system to just install
 itself (and "recommended" programs) WITHOUT PERMISSION, the updates that are supposed to fix existing issues causing other and often worse issues, all of this I could deal with for the sole purpose of using programs incompatible with other operating systems.
 But this..............my gallon of patience now finds itself running empty after all these years. Getting real close to jumping ship from everything Windows-related and using free open-source operating systems and software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, this is the 4th time an update has screwed me over. A smart man would've said adieu to Windows years ago after the 2nd time an update bricked his computer. I didn't, as I needed it for high school (no patience to learn how to use Linux those days).
 Well that and my former internet speeds were African-tier so couldn't download Linux ISO (Polynesian island infrastructure I swear). I still need it for certain programs, so it's baggage I'll be carrying until I can learn to make my own programs for Linux.
 Until then, I need this machine in good shape. And that means ensuring Windows 10 works properly and doesn't end up corrupting my hard drive for the 3rd time.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why is a Windows 10 update tampering with a hard drive partition it has no business tampering with? And why is it corrupting data stored there? This doesn't seem to be the work of a virus, as my System Mechanic Pro antivirus software hasn't detected anything.
 That and the timing of this issue makes the Windows update suspect. Does Microsoft not like/consider users dual booting their PCs? Are the updates really that messy that they spill crud all over one's HDD? Or is this because I blocked and disabled as much
 of the spyware and telemetry that I could }:[ ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And is there any way of recovering data in an EXT4 hard drive partition using my Windows partition? I cannot recover the data using my Linux OS as it is basically dead, and I don't want to reduce the likelihood of successful data recovery by tampering with
 the data stored on the partition (may accidentally overwrite the lost data or something if I try to reinstall/fix Linux).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really need some help here, as I need to use this machine for work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. : Request that you don't refer me to bots, if this community uses them. Sometimes they give retarded feedback.</p>
<p>P.S.S. : Edits due to formatting errors; had to fix<br />

<p>I know I'll have to reinstall Windows 10 again (for the 5th time or so now). I never asked for help on that. What I do need help with is my lost data. Any advice on how to get it back?</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><strong><em>"In addition, you can retain the other operating system in a separate hard drive instead of a partition. Partitions are still part of your original hard drive with the&nbsp;</em></strong></span><em><strong><span>Windows

<p>
</p><p><span>So you're telling me that Windows 10 does not take kindly to sharing hard drive space with other operating systems?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/818bb38d-31f4-4cf7-b1d5-0cc1c9a18731?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/818bb38d-31f4-4cf7-b1d5-0cc1c9a18731?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>That's another thing to add to the list of things I hate about Windows 10 then. Can't even dual boot for the sake of protecting my data from Windows updates screwing things up, as they will screw with the other OS too. And that to me does not make any sense.
 Why are updates touching my other hard drive partitions and corrupting the data in them? Regardless of if I run another OS on the same storage device Windows updates have no business touching the data in those partitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And speaking of corruption, it looks like I'll have to purchase an external storage device to safeguard my personal data. I can't even rely on the internal HDD in my laptop anymore. 1 terabyte's worth of internal storage effectively wasted all because Windows
 10 is installed on it.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6acacfdd-b093-4a64-a0be-dd83b5c8bfef?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6acacfdd-b093-4a64-a0be-dd83b5c8bfef?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel bitter. I really do. The internal storage of this laptop is one of the reasons why I purchased it in the first place, and it wasn't cheap too. Did this operating system advertise that whatever it is installed on gets the hardware equivalent of cancer?
 I didn't read all of the fine print in the ToS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly I'd love to run Windows 10 on a USB, so as to spare my 1 TB internal storage. But unfortunately that's illegal, so my laptop's hard drive is gonna take one for the team. For now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 1/25/18 : Not mad at you in particular. I'm mostly frustrated with how many times this stuff happens to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 1/30/18 : Bump so that this thread doesn't get locked.</p>
