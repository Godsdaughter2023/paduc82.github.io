            I got this and clicked to upgrade and now I get "Bitdefender Agent has encountered a critical error" try to submit the error and then it says bitdefender wizard has stopped working. Tried removing Bitdefender but the error continues to pop up continuously.
 Also error box pops up with yeloow triangle ! MuteSync.exe - oriential writing that I do not understand, the other box ! CAPOSD utility window not find! Energy Management.exe - more oriental writing. I get the nice fancy boxes but nothing happens when I click
 on them. the only thing that works is chrome and morzilla. <br />

            <p>You have a Lenovo, it looks like MuteSync has been mutated by a trojan, plus your computer is most likely infected elseware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disconnect from the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove MuteSync program.</p>
<p>Remove all Lenovo bloatware and programs you do not need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Window + i and let Windows defender check your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connect to the internet and go to http://www.bitdefender.co.uk/scanner/online/free.html to run an online scan, or other reputable scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be able to uninstall and reinstall Bitdefender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have problems send your computer off to an IT support company.</p>

            Hi Peter, hmm&nbsp;some serious problem to install it for w10. I had faced same problem with it, Go to 'This PC&gt; Uninstall or change&nbsp;a program&gt; repair Bitdefender. You may have to repair it&nbsp;more then 1 times. After 1st repair the 'blue&nbsp;screen of death'&nbsp;has
 been fixed and starts/restarts normally without any problem.&nbsp;The problem with social site&nbsp;like Facebook, MSN and disability of Bitdefender's update option&nbsp;has been fixed&nbsp;after repaired it 2nd time.<br />
And now&nbsp;it's running&nbsp;smoothly....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Ahmed,<br />
Indeed, I installed Win 10 on a Win 7 laptop yesterday and I had to download bitdefender from their website then I chose repair, it did not work, the second time I chose uninstall the old version. All then worked great.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you say it might need to attempts!</p>

            <p>Yes I struggled with this too. This is what you need to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log-in to your bitdefender account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the package you have purchased from the home page (not your account area, it's at the bottom of the page under "Trial Downloads").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the "Windows 10 Compatible Package" (not multi-device) enter your email address, it will then download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the downloaded bitdefender and ensure you uninstall the old installation - do not repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forget about the upgrade method as shown in the image above as it does not work properly anyway. I had real problems with Visual Studio and Hyper-V.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When bitdefender is installed ensure you do not have 2 firewalls running. I use the Windows Firewall and disable the bitdefender one. Also ensure that Windows Defender is not running,if it is then disable it. (Windows Key + i)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps everyone.</p>

    <title>How to remove dual sign in for Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sheecalma  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove dual sign in for Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I have issues with my laptop in Sign In. I have notice I have a dual user, which is I never create another account. When I first set up my laptop, it let me sign in using my hotmail account. Which is I did it, then I went back to Settings and change the
 Sign In options to local sign in and went to remove the password so its will be easier. Then when I restart my laptop, suddenly.. dual user account appear states my name and it has Sign In options, I tried researching is so many forums and instruction sites
 how to get rid of the other user. My last hope is factory settings and it's tiring of all the set up I've done and arranged. Kindly help, do you have another alternative ways to get rid of the "dummy" account.

            Hi Shee.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If I understand correctly you have two User accounts when  you only want one.  
<br />
<br />So sign into the User account you want to keep, go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; Other People and find the other account to Delete it.  
<br />
<br />If not there type netplwiz in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, tick the box to require password and then highlight the unwanted account, choose Remove.  
<br />
<br />If these do not work then report back exactly what happened along with the full error message if one is given.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Update: So I read dozens of posts about this sign in code error&nbsp;0x87dd005 with no resolve. I tried uninstalling xbox and Microsoft Ultimate Word Games, as well as resetting or clearing game data, and I even tried Windows PowerShell with inserting commands that was posted about xPackage bla bla bla, very technical but i tried it anyway. NOTHING&nbsp;WORKED&nbsp;EXCEPT, resetting my computer to factory install. I dreaded doing this as a last resort, but it worked and now I can use my game again.&nbsp; Be sure to save all your files, photos, music, etc, before doing this as this option erases everything on your PC. I usually do not post to these forums, but I just wanted to offer whatever help that I could.</p>

<h2>            Precision Touchpad - How to change pointer speed</h2>
                    <p>I just received a new Dell XPS 13 laptop. Everything is great, except for the windows touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop comes with MS's new Precision Touchpad, where apparently MS has taken over touchpad settings from Synaptic, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to increase the speed of the pointer. I have always set this very high on every laptop I have owned. This is basic touchpad functionality, but after 3 hours looking into it can not find how to increase the pointer speed on MS's new touchpad.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I increase the pointer speed on Microsoft's new Precision Touchpad?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Do you still have the Mouse option under Control Panel? If so, in there you will find the Pointer Options tab and on there is a means to set the pointer speed.

    <title>Windows 8.1 touch screen problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul_450  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1  touch screen problem</h2>
                    First, I'm using Windows 8.1 on an Asus q501La. The problem I'm facing is that my touch screen is only partially working. I can scroll back and forth using touch and open a few apps using touch. However, some apps won't launch when I touch them. For example,
 the first group on my start screen won't open when I touch them, but they will respond to my touch pad and mouse. Once I open them using my mouse, the touch works fine. I can scroll through the apps and they respond well. Moreover, the other groups of apps
 don't seem to be affected by this problem. I tried running a touch and pen calibration but the calibration isn't recognizing my touch. Is this a common problem and what can I do to fix it? Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the driver for the touch screen is corrupt. Outdated version of BIOS or chipset driver could also cause such scenarios.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the methods listed below and check if it fixes the issue: </p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the link to know how to run the hardware and device troubleshooter to troubleshootsuch issues:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong>”
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if it fixes the issue. If not, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s try uninstalling and reinstalling the touch screen drivers and check if it fixes the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+X</strong> keys and select <strong>Device Manager.</strong></li><li>Locate <strong>Human Interface devices</strong> icon and expand the driver icon.
</li><li>Right Click on each driver and choose <strong>Uninstall</strong>. Click on<strong> Scan for hardware changes
</strong>icon on the top of the window. Check if it fixes the issue. If not, restart the laptop and the device drivers will be reinstalled automatically.
</li></ul>
<p>If the issue still persists, download and install the latest chipset driver and update the version of BIOS from Asus’s website:</p>

<p>Tap the screen to see if it responds. If it does not, continue.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click on Calibrate option in Tablet PC settings window. Follow the onscreen instructions. Click
<strong>Yes</strong> when prompted to save calibration.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one X-Buzzing sound, Possible Coil whine&#63;</h2>
                    Hello&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My one x is manifesting a weird issue.When i play some games i hear a weird buzzing sound.<br />
Sometimes is changing the intensity depending on the game i play.<br />
For example in Witcher 3 is a high intensity buzzing sound, in For Honor or warframe is a bit higher pitched.<br />
It can only be heard from aprox 50cm away from the console.<br />
As soon as i quit to the dashboard the buzzing stops.<br />
Should i be worried and send it to warranty or its a common problem with the one x?<br />
Thank you!

<h2>            Thumbnails not showing after uploading files to OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a 3D modelling software called Revit, which creates a preview thumbnail of the current view when you save, which can then be viewed from Windows Explorer so that you have a preview of the model file before opening it:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7a2e097-c0a8-4c1b-aa3c-763e5b44f1b7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7a2e097-c0a8-4c1b-aa3c-763e5b44f1b7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, when I save these files to my OneDrive, they lose their preview and appear as below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/93dbb3e3-b363-455c-b928-a32e3bdcc686?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/93dbb3e3-b363-455c-b928-a32e3bdcc686?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I resave, the thumbnails stay there temporarily but within a short period they are cleared. I imagine it has something to do with the synchronisation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise as to how I could resolve this. The previews are important for visually distinguishing between types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

 a mirrored drive and thought that would be cool. But after doing this, was not happy so deleted it. In doing so deleted both my H and G drives. I did everything I could think of to get them to be seen by my computer to no avail. I have Win10 so by right clicking
 on the window in the left lower corner of the screen, it was easy to get into my Disk management and Device manager. But no matter what I did could not get Disk management to see my other 2 Hard Drives. I went out to my BIOS, CMOS and there they both were.
 In my device manager they also showed up as healthy disks. So no matter what I did, my hard drives showed up in device manager and bios but not in disk management with windows 10.
</p>
<p>Well after several hours and several prayers, I got the idea to go to Western Digital who makes my hard drives and down loaded 3 programs. The one that fixed my problem was, Data Lifeguard Diagnostics for Windows.
</p>
<p>Do check your SATA wires and power cords first of course. </p>
<p>The Fix</p>
<p>After checking your SATA wires and power cords.</p>
<p>Go to the, Western Digital&nbsp; web site.</p>
<p>Down load, Data Lifeguard Diagnostics for Windows.</p>
<p>It is going to ask permissions and you will have to agree.</p>
<p>Then it will find all the drives on your PC.</p>
<p>Go to the Drives your Disk management does not see. </p>
<p>Highlight one of them and do a complete simple quick format.</p>
<p>Then restart your PC, at least that's what I did, maybe you don't need too.</p>
<p>Right click on your Start Window.</p>
<p>Double click on disk management and your should see your drive there. </p>
<p>Do a simple format.</p>
<p>Assign a drive letter.</p>
<p>And your all set.</p>

<p><strong><em>Problem 1 is with my mouse pointer. It is being hidden on my desktop when I login</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Depending on the type of screen,&nbsp;and whether a mouse is trying to provide touch screen features&nbsp;that can be normal.&nbsp; If you have a&nbsp;real Numeric keypad you could use it for Mousekeys.&nbsp; E.g. I can make the pointer appear on my Tablet that way when I only tap
 it to change focus.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Problem 2 is with IE 11. The pages don't scroll up or down, with the up &amp; down keys or with the mouse wheel.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That can happen.&nbsp; It depends on where keyboard focus is in the page.&nbsp; Click first somewhere neutral in the scrollable region.&nbsp; Something that tends to work well as a substitute for all of the above is using Middle-click for wheel click (usually you need
 to override some other silly default) and then using AutoScroll with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a publicly accessible page you&nbsp;would like to cite as an example of your problem?</p>

<h2>            Wireless adapter not working in Windows 10 computer after several attemps to fix it.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Wireless adapters don't like my PC D: </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before i start i would like to say i have looked through numerous questions, threads and websites that offer temporary solutions to my problem which to this point have all failed or made the issue worse. Im posting this before i go for the decision to reset
 my PC for good because i would prefer for that not to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*My PC was custom built, so there are no manufacturer drivers or software i can revert to*</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem: I bought a new wifi adapter because my previous one seemed to stop working, all was good until a point when it just kept on stopping and starting (not the physical device as it works for days even weeks on other PCs) which is very strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i have tried (here we go, i will try remember everything i have tried):</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- Using a different USB port (10 different ones, the first one turning out to be a low power USB port)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Re installing drivers</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Uninsstalling drivers</p>
<p>&nbsp;- updating drivers</p>
<p>&nbsp;- downgrading drivers (tried 3 versions of the driver from 2013, 2014, 2015)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Troubleshooting the device</p>
<p>&nbsp;- unplugging and plugging it back in (used to provide a 1-2 hour fix)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- trying the adapter on another windows PC (worked fine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now i built this PC myself, when i was 12... almost 6 years ago, and most of the hardware is still the same, excluding the GPU which has nothing to do with it just thought i would add it. I know for a fact i didn't correctly install the CPU so it overheats
 consistently. i plan on upgrading. All this information was supplied just incase someone had a question about it and to eliminate any possible problems. *There is no in built wifi*</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous wireless adapters i used to use was a PCI-e one (two actually) then after they both had a power failure due to reasons that don't relate to anything other than my mistakes. i switched to USB, got a b/g/n one which worked fine up until a point (i
 feel when i upgraded to windows 10). But then i got an AC adapter for my new wifi which now just drives me crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that the backstory is out of the way (sorry but i prefer to go into more detail than have questions asked) lets get into technical details (of what i know so far, I'm not the best).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The devices events contain an unknown "device not migrated" but not sure if that matters or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have un installed all VPN or network sharing software. Which did intact fix the problem for a week (i then checked for other software)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I update the windows software frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have anti virus software running a scan every day and the results are 'excellent' saying nothing has been found of is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I CANNOT test the ethernet (although i have successfully shared my wifi to a device near to the PC once) because the PC is heavy and far away from the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have turned off turning the device off when in power saving mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and for what actually happens when the wifi 'stops working', well it usually starts with the yellow warning, then goes to a red X, and then to a state when its 'faking you' when it says its not connected to a network but it can't find any networks. In any
 of these states all i can say is that the actual light on the device starts to flash slowly (most likely indicating that the wifi is not connected) and other times the light just turns off (although the light turning off has now been fixed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>two days ago, the wifi turned to a red X for good, troubleshooting, resetting, re installing drivers, re plugging it in NOTHING helped the situation. The devices lights are still on and recognising networks on other PC's but its only when something is plugged
 into my PC that it seems to break .-.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The sort of solution i am looking for is somewhere i can download new drivers, things i can do to reset drivers maybe windows repair? i am still yet to test my old wifi adapter (my friend should be giving it to me to test tomorrow) but until then I'm stuck
 with no wifi on my PC at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would highly prefer not to have to reset my PC (although i feel through all my use i may have done something over the years) i used to be a heavy software user (i really ruined the software to the point that i had to reset) but i have since reset 2 times
 and upgraded to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for all the reading and i want to thank anyone in advance for even replying to this monstrosity of a wall of text xD. If there is any other information needed (i have probably forgotten something important) i would be happy to test and report.</p>

<p>Well it seems my computer just hates me, the internet is working fine now (im using it to post this message).</p>
<p>
</p><p>the devices trouble shooter said maybe i should restart to install updates, i might see if that provides a longer fix for this issue, in my eyes, this PC wont be with me for long im planning on re building it from the ground up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but yeah my internet just switched back on right before i clicked troubleshoot wifi... ill try the methods listed if the thing stops working again but for the time being your answer seems to have solved the problem. Thank you :D</p>

<p>So that fixing of the adapter was in fact temporary. and yet again i am only getting 5-10 minutes of internet after a restart, i have now uninstalled most of the programs that even use the wifi although the rest are programs that i need and only use the
 internet when i have actually opened them (so not at startup)</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am still yet to download a repair for my PC... going to be a bit awkward without internet on my PC but should be doable. i hope there is some explanation to why my PC is doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>on another note i did the trouble shooting tests, the devices just said for me to restart my PC to install updates. And the other trouble shooters just return the same result as the ones that i did before (un plug and plug the device back in to see if it
 changes anything)<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Driver problem for JVC Everio hard drive Camcorder</h2>
                    I have a JVC Everio GZ-MG365BU with Dock CU-VC4U. It works fine under XP and firewire. I can capture, but the computer is old and slow. In any case I purchased a new HP with win 7 64bit PRO and when I plug in the firewire it does show the device in the
 control panel but not as a camcorder and none of the software I have can see it to capture video. I can connect with USB but their are several reasons I need to capture using the conventional method. One reason to preserve the date stamp. JVC is no help at
 all. They say its Windows 7 and they provide drivers originally and their will be no more for old units (2 years is old to them). Does anyone have an idea how to get this recognized in windows 7?

            OK I fixed it. Here is what I had to do. I went to device manager and the IEEE 1394 Bus Host Controllers and selected update driver and asked to see all device drivers for that device in a list. Their were two drivers and one had the word "Legacy" after
 it so I selected that one. I plugged in the hard drive camcorder and it worked perfectly.

<h3> mg_457  say:</h3>
<h2>            Snapped windows reopening in wrong size, half off screen - Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have notice a problem recently that when I snap windows to half the screen, they will next time open in a very small (&lt;quarter size) and half off the screen. I have found several threads on how to fix the default size to something sensible again, but every
 time I use snap again (which is always, its a great feature) the problem returns. Its really irritating to have to go fishing for a tiny piece of the header bar in order to drag it back into position. Any help appreciated!</p>

            Thank you for the response, however as I said I find snap a great feature, indeed having to manually resize side-by-side windows would be every bit as annoying as the problem I'm describing. Disabling Snap all together would not be a solution.

<h2>            32 bit apps loading 64 bit wininet.dll&#63; - random crashes of IE8, Excel etc. in Wininet.dll</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm pretty new into Windows 7 (Using 64bit home prem) and found that win32 apps are randomly crashing, all in the same module.<br />
Faulting application name: iexplore.exe, version: 8.0.7600.16385, time stamp: 0x4a5bc69e<br />
Faulting module name: WININET.dll, version: 8.0.7600.16490, time stamp: 0x4b2c9616<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000005<br />
Fault offset: 0x00062759<br />
Faulting process id: 0xe88<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01caa913dd8d4200<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe<br />
Faulting module path: C:\Windows\syswow64\WININET.dll<br />
Report Id: 1cefca1a-1507-11df-a9f5-00269e7cd958<br />
<br />
Is this that the 32bit app is trying to load the 64bit wininet.dll and therefore going nuts ? The 64bit versions run ok, but if even Excel crashes with this same issue, that makes it weird.<br />
<br />
Any suggenstions on first of all redirect the 32bit app to the proper wininet.dll ?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Albert<br />

            Hi Shekhar,<br />
<br />
The file was there in the syswow64 directory and I copied several versions from windows update files to check. The one working was the one found in win/xp, so that's strange.<br />
The excel and later on also outlook issues were also resolved by this. Excel and outlook occasionally use wininet to connect to some functions or so and in the eventvwr it would show the crash in wininet.dll.<br />
<br />
Do you happen to know a file on microsoft downloads where the latest wininet.dll for windows 7 is ? Would be nice to check if it's a problem in the file or perhaps as you mention a corrupted file.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Albert

<h2>            Movie Maker - Publish without displaying file name in movie</h2>
                    I saved&nbsp;my Movie Maker project as both an mp4 and a wmv.&nbsp; And both movies display the name of the file at the bottom of the movie (e.g., ABC_Movie.mp4) for a 3-4 seconds.&nbsp; Unfortunately the file name appears over the top of my Title/Captions that I included
 in my movie.&nbsp; How can I turn off this display?

            <p>This isn't Movie Maker that is showing the title of your movie, it is your media player. &nbsp;You are probably using Windows Media Player and it shows the name of the file at the top when it first starts playing. &nbsp;I'm not sure if this can be disabled in WMP
 or not; I've been trying to find a setting for it and haven't yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep looking, but in summary it's not Movie Maker that is the issue, it is Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: &nbsp;You mentioned that the name shows at the bottom... so you must be using a different media player. &nbsp;Do you know which one?</p>
