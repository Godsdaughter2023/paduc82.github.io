    <title>The Xbox Enforcement Website UI does not update to reflect the one-day - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darknight0024  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Xbox Enforcement Website UI does not update to reflect the one-day ban I have been given, nor have I been sent an email detailing information about the ban.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I have been given a one-day ban. I chatted with Xbox Support about the issue that I had regarding feedback about the ban and the agent I spoke with felt that the issue I had would be better reflected in a forum post. So I am going to explain my
 situation&nbsp;in detail along with the changes he thought were worth forwarding to his manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I played a game of Smite in which my one teammate fed his brains out because I lagged on the character select screen and chose the wrong character as a result, forcing a bad team composition to ensue. Instead of trying, he harassed me all game using the
 in-game&nbsp;communication system. I was angry at the end and sent him a message, which did have unsportsmanlike&nbsp;language in it. I do not deny sending this message and understand that I should have just ignored the teammate, or used better language, but I admit
 that I did send him a message that contained profanity in it. He reported it, and I deservedly got a 'notice of enforcement action' in the form of a message through Xbox&nbsp;live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this message, it says, "For more information, check the email associated with your Xbox&nbsp;live account or visit enforcement.xbox.com."&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1f90f88-6618-4343-aa15-d325a79ebdf2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f1f90f88-6618-4343-aa15-d325a79ebdf2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Knowing nothing about the terms of the action taken against me, I tried to check the email associated with my Xbox&nbsp;live account, only to find that there had been no email sent to me to describe the terms of action taken against my profile. Understandably,
 I then went to check the second option through the website enforcement.xbox.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was met with a screen that looked like this as per part of a screenshot of the home page of my account:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a3f1f2e-1b36-4b0f-b85b-8ccf6f2f34d1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a3f1f2e-1b36-4b0f-b85b-8ccf6f2f34d1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I realized after searching under the reputation overview tab, that my account had,&nbsp;in fact, been given a privilege ban, in which I was unable to message others or engage in party chat for the duration of the ban. Yet, the home page of my account was still
 displaying that I had a perfect record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, I went to talk to the support member about the display issues, along with the fact that my account had not automatically received an email regarding information about the ban. Before chatting with a live member, the virtual agent confirmed
 my suspicions&nbsp;in that I did, in fact, have a ban on my account.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e1e8110-741d-4ad4-a466-53684815b346?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e1e8110-741d-4ad4-a466-53684815b346?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was grateful to find out that my account did have a ban so that I could stop worrying about it, but I realized that I only figured out this information by contacting support. This was not a suggestion in the message that provided me ways to find "more
 information" about my case, especially when considering that the picture above notes that support can not assist with details relevant to ban information/case reviews.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the problem with my specific case though, in the agent's own words:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">"..the 1 day suspension is the least
 suspension enforcement can provide, and there is no option for the case review option for one day suspension that is the reason why you cannot see it."</span></p>
<p>So, because my account has
 a one-day suspension, and that suspension does not provide the option of opting for a case review for the one-day bans, it does not show up on my home page for my enforcement.xbox.com page at all.</p>
<p>Because the information did not show up there, I am assuming that the automated email that would be sent to my account was stopped in the realization that my account had "perfect standing".</p>
<p>
</p><p>These inconsistencies altogether made it difficult for me to initially find out the duration of my ban, and when I did find it out, it was through support instead of the official channel that displays information about actions taken against your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notice of enforcement action does not entail what kind of ban I had received, and the agent noted that the site should give this kind of information to the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this post is being made to highlight the issue with the UI and the automated responses that come with it. In the case of having a one-day suspension, you are unable to see on your account that you have a suspension, and as a result, you do not know the
 effect that something as vague as a 'notice of enforcement' has on your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally, would like to see Xbox modify the automated message to better describe the type of ban your account has received, along with which privleges have been rescinded has a result of receiving the ban, and finally the length of the ban, rather than
 my looking at the types of bans on the enforcement.xbox.com website to try and guess which type of ban I have received.</p>

<p>Hiya Dark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Forum support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, Enforcement does not post or review on the forums, and to see more information&nbsp;about the type of suspensions can be found here:

<p>Thank you for responding, and I will copy and paste this post and subsequent&nbsp;response over to UserVoice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However (just for response's sake), the lack of clarity that the UI bug had presented along with the vague wording of the enforcement message is completely unnecessary.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Ideally, if they refuse to update the UI (which they ultimately should,&nbsp;to fix even a niche bug like this) then they should make the descriptor message more informative to users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been on the Xbox Live Suspensions page, and through it, I was able to deduce what type of ban I had received, but that is not something that I should have needed to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a perfect world, I should have received a message that looked something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Dear<em> xxx*,</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>After careful review, we have found you to be guilty of an infraction against <em>
yyy*</em>&nbsp;of the Xbox Code of Conduct. As a result, you shall receive a&nbsp;<em>zzz</em>* ban, which restricts you from
<em>nnn* </em>and <em>mmm*&nbsp;</em>until <em>date*</em>.</p>

            There is no way that they would state who reported you. There is a reason why the system is set as it is, it stops retaliation.

<h2>            Windows XP Pro - Security Certificate - invalid or name doesn&#39;t match &#38; Iphone</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, sorry if this is the wrong forum for XP questions.&nbsp; However, hoping someone can help.&nbsp; When connecting to outlook, I am prompted with a security alert message.&nbsp;
<br />
It says...<br />
autodiscover."mydomain".com.au<br />
Information you excahange with this site cannot be viewed or changed by others.&nbsp; However, there is a problem with the sites security certificate.<br />
tick - The security certificate is from a trusted certifying authority.<br />
tick - the security certificate date is valid<br />
cross - the name on the security certificate is invalid of does not match the name of the site.<br />
Do you want to proceed? <br />
Yes No View Certificate<br />
<br />
Whilst I can click Yes to proceed and outlook seems to run ok, I am concerned about any security issues this may cause.&nbsp; I also think this may be causing a problem with connecting to my exchange account from my iphone.&nbsp; I am getting a similar error msg when
 trying to setup the acct on the iphone... the error msg I get is<br />
Unable to verify certificate.&nbsp; While automatically discovering account settings, the certificate from "platinumfinancial.com.au" could not be verified.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. JD</p>

    <title>Add&#47;Remove program&#58; Loads but cannot find the program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidmsft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add&#47;Remove program&#58; Loads but cannot find the program</h2>
                    The add/remove program comes up, but the system must have recorded the presence of additional program copies on my external hard drive backup system, so now it's looking at those and preventing me from re-uploading the same program after uninstalling it
 (was told to uninstall and reinstall iTunes by an Apple tech).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
iTunes now won't reinstall, because the add/remove programs system thinks there is an old copy of Bonjour (needed to run iTunes) on my computer, which there is not.&nbsp; Hooking up my external drive is also not working.&nbsp; I would have thought that would solve it,
 but the Add/Remove program does not think that the correct copy is on that drive.<br />
<br />
Can I/do I have to go into the system files and delete the folders somehow so they don't show up under Add/Remove Programs?&nbsp; In other words, how do I wipe the memory of these other programs off of the Add/Remove software list, so iTunes will then reload?&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

<br />
</blockquote>
I don't know what to make of that statement, but here's how to remove/reinstall iTunes:<br />
<br />
<p>Microsoft used to have a tool just for this, called the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility.&nbsp; Apparently, however, when this tool was used (I think with MS Office), it sometimes removed more than it was supposed to, and therefore Microsoft
 removed the tool from its download servers.<br />
<br />
The Windows Installer Cleanup Utility is still available from <a href="http://majorgeeks.com/Windows_Installer_CleanUp_Utility_d4459.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://majorgeeks.com/Windows_Installer_CleanUp_Utility_d4459.html</a>&nbsp; Or you can use free
<a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Revo Uninstaller</a>.&nbsp; Before you use either of these tools, create a System Restore point, backup the registry using
<a href="http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ERUNT</a>, or (if you have the means) create a full disk image or clone -- just in case.<br />
<br />
Here are the usual directions to perform a "clean installation" of iTunes, based on Apple Support article HT1926.<br />
<br />
Go into Control Panel &gt; Add/Remove Programs<br />
Remove these applications:<br />
1. Apple Software Update<br />
2. Apple Mobile Device Support<br />
3. Bonjour<br />
4. iPod for Windows (this may or may not exist, either way, it's not needed so we can remove it)<br />
5. iTunes<br />
6. QuickTime<br />
<br />
Open My Computer &gt; C: &gt; Program Files<br />
Delete this folders (if present)<br />
1. iPod<br />
2. iTunes<br />
3. QuickTime<br />
<br />
Empty your temp directory:<br />
Open My Computer &gt; C: &gt; Documents &amp; Settings &gt; your user name &gt; Local Settings and delete the contents of the folder called "Temp"<br />
<br />
If you can't see Local Settings, turn on hidden files:<br />
Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; View tab<br />
Select Show Hidden Files &amp; Folder and click OK<br />
<br />
After that folder is emptied, restart the computer<br />

            Thanks for your input!<br />
<br />
Apple provides a set of instructions here that are a bit different: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1925?viewlocale=en_US<br />
<br />
My real issue is simply getting rid of the reference to the "programs" that don't exist on my computer that were found on the external drive.&nbsp; Apple's software won't install over that.&nbsp; Is there any way around that?&nbsp; Using the utility you mentioned would only
 work if the programs were actually on the PC which they are not.&nbsp; I am betting that if reference to the external drive can be deleted from the Add/Remove Programs list, iTunes would re-install fine. Thanks.<br />

No, that's not quite correct.&nbsp; Both the Microsoft Windows Installer Cleanup Utility and Revo Uninstaller remove traces of partially-uninstalled programs.&nbsp; They are precisely for situations similar to yours where something has gone wrong with Add/Remove Programs.&nbsp;
 At the very least, you should give one or both of them a try rather than pre-deciding that they won't work.<br />
<br />
If neither of those tools work, you'll have to manually go through the registry looking for traces of Bonjour.&nbsp; Editing the registry without really understanding what you're doing is fraught with peril.&nbsp; If you decide that this procedure is necessary, please
 create a System Restore point, backup the registry using <a href="http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ERUNT</a>, or (if you have the means) create a full disk image or clone (these are in reverse order of potential usefulness).<br />

            Hi LemP<br />
<br />
Link to the solution is below.<br />
<br />
You were right.&nbsp; The issue is with bad info on the PC despite the absence of any program info on the PC.&nbsp; It was enough to prevent a re-install though.<br />
<br />
Your post led me to the direct link to the current MSFT approved program for uninstall errors called "Fix It";<br />
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall/<br />
<br />
You have to run the diagnostic and it does work on 32 bit systems according to my experience.&nbsp; It took off all the add/remove program entries that were an issue for reinstalling iTunes.&nbsp; I also went back into the Add/Remove program and clicked remove for each
 of the programs which were eliminated by the MSFT "Fix It" program.&nbsp; An error message came back, but the "dead program" listed on the Add/Rem list was gone, so it worked.&nbsp; Have to run it over and over for each program you want to correct, but I was happy to
 have a solution.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thanks again for your insight and help with this!&nbsp; Much appreciated!<br />
<br />

            Congratulations, and thanks for the feedback.<br />
<br />
I generally stay away from Microsoft "FixIt" routines because the documentation for these things is essentially non-existent.&nbsp; Microsoft won't tell you what they do ... and I like to know what changes are being made to my computer before I make them.&nbsp; Microsoft
 also usually doesn't tell you what version of Windows the FixIt is designed for; "click it and find out what happens" seems to be Microsoft's position.<br />
<br />
But I'll put the link to this install cleaner in my notes.<br />
<br />
You describe accurately the behavior of Add/Remove Programs when you manually uninstall something: the link stays there until you try to use it -- when you do, you get an error message and the link is deleted.&nbsp; See the description of this for a similar situation

<h2>            Add new hardware wizard is not responding.</h2>
                    My old keyboard stopped working, so I was trying to install a new one. Its an USB keyboard, so I just plugged it in and the Add New Hardware Wizard window pops up and freezes. I open the Task Manager and it says its not responding. I've tried restarting
 the computer, but it does the same thing. The computer itself doesn't freeze,just the Wizard. I'm running a 2002 service pack 3. Any suggestions?&nbsp; I'm using an on-screen keyboard to type this.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Go to device manager serch for your keyboard if you see exclamation mark or whatever you see ,delete it and restart your computer and let the wizard begin again . if it is a normale keyboard (not wireless....) you do not need the wizard either it should
 work normally .</p>
<p>Hope this will help.</p>
<p>Goodluck</p>

<h2>            fix low warbled audio on youtube</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
My youtube audio was working perfectly fine until a virus shut down my Dell Windows 7 computer, which is 2 years old.&nbsp; I paid $275 (and 1 year unlimited technical assistant) for software for the Dell tech to help me get it up and running again, and a further
 $129? for 2 years of software support.&nbsp; Now my audio is low and warbled when I'm listening to songs on youtube.&nbsp; The musical instruments come out loud and clear most of the time, but the voice of the singer is either nonexistent, low, and warbled -- that is,
 unintelligible.&nbsp; I called Dell for technical support but they told me that my hardware warranty has expired after one year.&nbsp; They want another $59 just to check the hardware, and then suggest what I can buy from them to install myself.&nbsp; What I already paid
 upfront is already more than half of what I paid for my computer and I'm reluctant to buy anymore service(s) from Dell or anyone else.&nbsp; I received two answers from another website suggesting I buy a new sound card for as little as $10.&nbsp; I don't know how it's
 a sound card problem since sounds from musical instruments are loud and clear.&nbsp; I've tried fixing it myself, Dell has tried to help, even losing all my stored info on hard drive.&nbsp; I'm getting frustrated.&nbsp; Do I really need to spend more money, or should I just
 wait until this computer breaks down totally and buy another one?&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; <br />

<div>Re post giving Dell model name and exact reference number, or go to their support website and find the drvers download page for your particular unit. Download and install the W7 specific audio drivers.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Should there be none, try installing the Vista drivers in compatibility mode.</div>

<p><span><br />
<span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>We are sorry for the inconvenience caused.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>"</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">audiodg.exe</span></strong><span>" is a part of Windows 10. System services like audio drivers run in different and isolated login session from the locally logged-in
 user in Windows 10. This ensures that content and plug-ins cannot be modified by other applications (e.g. by spyware).
</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span><strong>Note: </strong>The audiodg.exe file is located in the folder C:\Windows\System32. In other cases, audiodg.exe is a virus, spyware, or worm!
</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>Please follow the below methods to fix the issue:</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong><span> I would suggest you to scan your computer with
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware,
 and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></p>

</span><span><span>Note: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data
 loss.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2:</span></strong><span> In Windows 10, when running audio or video player software, CPU usage will reach above 80% instantly. This phenomenon is caused
 by “audiodg.exe " process. Sometimes, high CPU usage by this process might lead to fake crash. Follow these steps to fix the issue:
<br />
1. Right-click "<strong>Speakers</strong>" icon in the taskbar and then select "<strong>Playback devices</strong>"<br />
2. Under "<strong>Playback</strong>" tab, right-click "<strong>Speakers</strong>", and select "<strong>Properties</strong>".
<br />
3. Click on “<strong>Enhancements"</strong> tab under "<strong>Speakers Properties</strong>". Check "<strong>Disable all enhancements</strong>” check-box.<br />
By the above steps, you could resolve the problem that "<strong>audiodg .exe</strong>" process hosts high CPU usage and prevent your machine from slow running and fake crash.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 3:

                    <p>As stated in subject, &nbsp;I have a number of Privacy settings "managed by your organisation".&nbsp; An explanation of this would be helpful as I'm not an organisation just an individual user.&nbsp; Read some of forum responses but not sure if they pertain to my issue.

            I note what you say but................&nbsp; I have a dual boot system; 10 Home and 10 Pro.&nbsp; I signed up as an Insider on 10 Pro , not on my day to day working system.&nbsp; I can accept it on 10 Pro but not 10 Home.&nbsp; I didn't sign up as an Insider on this machine.&nbsp;
 Further, I no longer update with Insider previews having turned off so would of expected privacy settings to be returned to my control ???&nbsp; Also I don't recollect using Group Policies and certainly not the registry to manage my home user system(s).&nbsp; How do
 I get back to status quo ?

            <p>You can check Group Policies and revert any entries you find. You can&nbsp;do an in-place upgrade. You can do a clean install of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will want to check the Insider Program Agreement and the main Insider web site for the prescribed way to leave the Insider Program and ensure a device is no longer registered in the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will want to ensure that the device is not joined to any AD domain or Azure AD domain in any way.</p>

            <p>In the initial post of this thread, you indicate that you think some things have been changed on your system(s) without your knowledge. To ease your mind, you are going to need to check everything. Be sure you are not registered with or connected to anything,
 in any way, that can effect your system(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unsure about these things, a clean install of Windows should be the first step.</p>

            <p>As noted, this is being controlled via telemetry Group Policy settings on your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are welcome to try finding and adjusting these settings, but your lack of knowledge in how these setting got changed would seem to indicate that a clean install using the latest build available from the Insider web site would be the most prudent course
 of action.</p>

<p>I am sorry to hear that you are having an issue with the new terms. There is a service alert on support.xbox.com stating that there is an issue with accepting the new terms of service.
</p>
<p>It is stating to try and accept the terms on the console it self. Also if you do not remember the password it says to go to xbox.com/forgot.
</p>
<p>If that does not work, keep an eye on support.xbox.com to see if that problem is fixed.

    <title>LED Flash on my Asus Vivotab RT Camera not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annatimms  say:</h3>
<h2>            LED Flash on my Asus Vivotab RT Camera not working</h2>
                    I updated to Windows 8.1 half a year ago, and that update simplified the Asus Camera app. There are no special options like the filters or flash options. It's just real simple, and there is no more flash. I've reinstalled the camera app twice, and still
 no change, I've been like this for half a year, please help someone on how to fix this? I really liked the flash and it bugs me that there is an important feature on my tablet being unused. Thanks a lot.

            <p>Hello Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get Windows 10 onto a Usb drive and plugged into the laptop. Still unable to access anything in the computer to even access the file within the Usb to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC starts with a flash of a red screen them immediately directs me to normal log in. Once pin is entered I am again still greeted by the red window stating Windows ran into a problem and needs to restart. Unable to access settings, unable to maneuver
 through anything and the PC proceeds to restart. Again, I have held down F1, F2 &amp; F8 during the booting process in hopes of gaining a different menu to access the USB. More details would be preferable in breaking down steps to access Windows 10 on the USB.</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to restore my firefox tabs after refreshing windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded Windows 8 onto my HP G62 laptop. However not all of the apps were working properly and was told to refresh. After doing so I found most of my programs gone (as expected) however I hadn't considered Mozilla firefox being removed. Reinstalling
 firefox isn't an issue. I want to recover the tabs from my old session. Could someone please explain in detail how I could do this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Michelle.M, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the information, you need to <span>restore the Firefox tabs after refreshing windows 8.</span></p>
<p>When you perform ‘Refresh your PC’, it will not delete <span>any of your personal files or changing your settings.</span></p>
<p>However the apps that came with your PC or you installed from <span>Windows</span> Store will be reinstalled, but any apps you installed from other websites and DVDs will be removed. You'll find a list of the removed apps on your desktop after refreshing
 your PC. You will need to reinstall the desktop and modern UI apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have tried reinstalling Firefox, there are chances that the settings in the browser can be lost.</p>
<p>Since the issue is related with recovering Firefox tabs, you may check with Firefox support for further assistance.</p>
<p>For further assistance, refer the Firefox support articles:</p>

 it took several minutes for google chrome to load, the same for IE. Clicking on the windows start up in the lower left corner only produced the waiting circle.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though you say your Windows is updated to the latest version, if you're getting the error&nbsp;<span>0x80131509 then it's highly likely you aren't running the latest Windows 10 build.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The latest build is version 1903 (OS Build&nbsp;</span>18362.175).&nbsp; Are you running this?&nbsp; To check, you can either type
<strong>winver</strong> into the Windows search box or, hold down the <strong>Windows key</strong> and tap
<strong>R</strong> on your keyboard.&nbsp; In the Run box, type <strong>winver </strong>
and press enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're not running Windows version 1903 try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running Windows update from <strong>Windows Settings &gt; Update and Security.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, you can update via the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10?irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AID681541_aff_7593_159229&amp;tduid=(ir__w3kavb9m6gkfryxbkk0sohz30n2xj16v2dh2ram900)(7593)(159229)()(UUwpUdUnU35689YYwYg)&amp;irclickid=_w3kavb9m6gkfryxbkk0sohz30n2xj16v2dh2ram900" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Media Creation Tool.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the Tool and save it somewhere like your Windows Desktop.&nbsp; Double click on program to run it. Choose

<p>To clarify, does it give you an error trying to start it up or on install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the things to check is if you have this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-identity-provider/9wzdncrd1hkw?SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
app installed from the store.</a>&nbsp; I've seen a few issues where users have not had that installed and it's caused a few issues.&nbsp; It doesn't show up when you search the store, and should be installed as a system app during the update, but is missed sometime.&nbsp;
 Check if that helps your situation.&nbsp; If not, let us know and we can provide some troubleshooting steps to further investigate the issue.</p>

<p>Ok, the first thing I'd check is the Microsoft Store, and check that you have no issues signing in there.&nbsp; Then in the store click the three dots in the top right and select "Downloads and Updates". See if there are any updates pending there by clicking
 "Get updates".&nbsp; That should populate with any apps that need updating.&nbsp; Let us know if any were pending or needed an update.&nbsp; If so, when they're done check if you can log into the app again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd also recommend testing the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJBD8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Console Companion App</a>&nbsp;and see if you can log in there, without issues and then if so, in that app, click Settings on the left menu (Looks like a settings cog) and click on the network tab at the top.&nbsp; Let us know what it says there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't clear anything, please let us know and we can check the next steps.</p>

<h2>            why is my surface pro making a perpetual whooshing sound&#63;</h2>
                    I've tried stopping the CPU hog "Spooler subsystem app" but it starts right up again when I restart the computer.&nbsp; Perhaps it's not the problem anyway.&nbsp; Suggestions?
