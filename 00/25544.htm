<h2>            Cortana search does not respond to keyboard input</h2>
                    Since 14931, 14933, 14936 and 14942, Cortana does not respond to keyboard input.&nbsp; It doesn't do a search, it does nothing!&nbsp; Please advise.

            <p>It is working for me, so I would suggest to try to Reset Cortana using PowerShell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your Start menu find Windows PowerShell. &nbsp;Right-click the icon and run as Administrator. &nbsp;In PowerShell enter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 PowerShell commands while logged back in as your normal user account.</p>

            You could do a Reset or create a Recovery Drive USB to do a clean install of 14942, if those options work for you, as a means to clear this issue up.

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For possible resolution with regard to Cortana, we highly recommend that you run
<strong>SFC </strong>(<strong>System File Checker)</strong> and/or <strong>DISM </strong>
<strong>(</strong><strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management)</strong>, for possible resolution. Make sure that you're connected to internet when you do those.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>To do so, check this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">

            I ran SFC and there are corrupt files that it couldn't fix.&nbsp; Since there is no ISO available now for 14942,&nbsp; DISM can't find a source to work with!

            That's alright you can get the same message 1. by choosing Data, Edit Links or 2. by click the security bar's Options button choosing&nbsp;and Enable this content.&nbsp; (notice the Security Alert - says Links)

            1. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
2. Review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54<br />

3. Zorvek (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/windows-10-and-microsoft-excel-2013/f886877d-b486-4d57-bd61-73e30b7ded81) has given following solution which you can try -<br />
Windows 10 is causing some issues with Office/Excel. Some of the issues are resolved by disabling a new function of the .net installation that comes with Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015. This feature can be disabled with a registry entry.<br />
To create the entry, run PowerShell with administrator privileges (open the Start menu, enter PowerShell in find box, right-click on PowerShell and select ""Run as administrator"". Enter the following command to add the registry entry:<br />
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework -Name useLegacyJit -Type DWord -Value 1<br />
You can copy the above line and paste it into PowerShell by clicking on the top left part of the PowerShell window title bar and selecting Edit-&gt;Paste. Press ENTER to run the command.<br />
<br />
4. Read the response of Try*3 &nbsp;(http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/windows-10-excel-files-changed-to-read-only/cba3c358-21b5-472d-b5e2-f690f1b0a49b). He has provided a link which also has solutions for problems.<br />
<br />
5. If above don't, re-installation of office may solve your problem. Make sure that you have license keys ready before you attempt re-installation.<br />

<h2>            Live ID migration from WindowsLive to Outlook.com on Nokia Lumia 800</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Couple of days ago, when using live.com services, I was proposed to rename my e-mail account
 from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***. When doing so, you informed me that: “</span><span>Top of Form</span></p>
<p><span>We're unable to retrieve information for this section at this time. We're sorry for the inconvenience,
 please try again later.</span></p>
<p><span>Why rename your address? When you rename your email address, your new ID works just like your
 old one. Your new emails will go to your inbox, and you can choose to keep your old emails in a separate folder. All of your other Microsoft account info – like contacts, photos and Office docs on SkyDrive – will also switch to your new address within a few
 days. </span></p>
<p><span>When you rename your Microsoft account, your new ID works just like your old one. All of your
 account information and contacts will automatically transfer to your new ID within 48 hours.”</span></p>
<p><span>The new Id is recognised in Zune, but not on my Lumia 800 phone. I can’t buy/update apps from
 my phone, as it has the old windowslive.com Id. What should I do? Please do not recommend me to reset my phone! I have paid you enough money to provide basic services like this without spending half day on phone re-installation, in addition losing some content.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks<br />

    <title>Phishing on my hotmail - effective prevention - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff leese  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phishing on my hotmail - effective prevention</h2>
                    <p>I just got a phishing email on my hotmail account after I emailed my bank. It got me thinking about how the fraudster got my email, knew I had dealt with my bank, and then crafted a fraud email in the bank's name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email has been listed on some websites that were hacked, so now I'm suspicious that it is being monitored and tested for vulnerability. Am I just getting used to world where criminals are exploiting some new and vile technical exploit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning to government or police seems like I would be brushed off. I need to get rid of this group, and I've come to the conclusion I have to stop using this email. Like, create a new email and contact all my associates to edit my profile on their systems.
 A big chunk of work, so I want to ask advice here, if there are any alternatives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get free of this email use on someone's phishing email list? What are phishing systems capable of and can you get out of their grasp?</p>

            <p>While you can't prevent anyone from emailing you, in this case it sounds like you credentials have been compromised or it is a very high coincidence that you got a phishing&nbsp;email back directly after you've contacted your bank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change your password and turn on Two-Step Verification for your Microsoft Account. Also, use unique passwords for separate services. When you use the same password for sites that require you to logon with your email address, when one of those sites get hacked,
 they can also logon to other services you signed up for.</p>

            <p>Got it. Clear answer is, I can do nothing about this phishing harassment. (Re the other suggestions, yes, all ok.) It seems that once one's email address has been included on lists from (35203.nmo.net) this phishing organization, they can just keep sending
 their spam. </p>

            <p>Yes, my email was listed as a result of three hacks (Adobe and others).<br />
So, once my email is found in a hack, it becomes less valuable - even dispensable.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Based on your previous posts, we understand that you have done a thorough investigation about the phishing emails that you are receiving on your
<strong>Hotmail</strong> account. We cannot deny that there are risks in putting your credentials on the Internet and doing so can leave your personal information vulnerable to these kinds of attacks. However, we suggest that you follow the suggestions previously
 given by <strong>Roady [MVP]</strong> and <strong>Palcouk</strong> on <strong>February 9, 2017</strong>. Additionally, here is a

            <p>Thanks for replying. Now I'm getting even more discouraged by the internet. I had no way of knowing if your link would be a malicious site, but I took the risk and was relieved to find it was a microsoft support article. While helpful in managing spam and
 phishing, that article seems to accept the flood of unwanted email as normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I've realized is that email is no longer fit for the purpose it was created for, since it cannot defend against being used this way. The only solution I can see is to use anonymous sounding email, avoid posting, and recreate new email accounts frequently.
 This is obviously a poor solution. Managed communication (as for example only within Facebook, gives some protection, but doesn't give public access.</p>

    <title>Worksheet_BeforeDoubleClick, avoid within-cell selection on exit&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kergga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Worksheet_BeforeDoubleClick, avoid within-cell selection on exit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Worksheet_BeforeDoubleClick event that identifies which cell is being clicked, and if it is within a target range of cells, it brings up a userform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When exiting from that userform, I'd like to have that same cell 'selected', but as the equivalent of a single click (whole cell selected, dark border, cursor is not active in the cell). Due to the DoubleClick functionality, I end up with the cursor in the
 cell itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did ending the Worksheet_BeforeDoubleClick event by selecting another cell, then reselecting the target cell, but (presumably because this all happens&nbsp; "_Before", I'm still ending up with the cursor in the cell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the appropriate syntax to force the single-click selection of that same target cell, and perhaps more importantly, where is the appropriate place to put that code- at the end of the UserForm code (and all cancellation options)? Or does the Userform
 functionality also occur before the last bit of the DoubleClick is fired?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Keith</p>

<h2>            microsoft word saving documents with a&#126;&#36;</h2>
                    Sometimes when I go to save a document, I find that it has been saved with a ~$ replacing the first 2 letters of what i named the document. it then will not open the document when i try to, stating that there is a problem with the contents. But it saved
 fine when i did it, or seemed to anyway. Then when I click on the Details button of that error it says the file is corrupt and cannot open. Help! And thank you.&nbsp;

            <p>Files that start with ~$ are the lock files that Word creates when a file is opened.&nbsp; If the file is saved and closed in the normal fashion, those files should be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files will all be only 1 KB in size and cannot be opened in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure that there is not another file with the full filename for the file that you are saving?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are you saving the files?&nbsp; Do not save directly from Word to any form of removable media (USB Drive, Flash Drive, etc.)&nbsp; Always save to the local hard drive and then, after closing the document, copy to any other media on which you want a copy.&nbsp; Also,
 do not open a file from any form of removable media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I the Word application shuts down in an abnormal manner, the lock files may be left behind, and can result in your only being able to open documents in read-only manner.</p>

    <title>Mail Merge process to run in batch mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerryball_800  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Merge process to run in batch mode</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I( have approx. 20+ mail merge programs that I needs to run each month.&nbsp; Instead of starting Word and then selecting the file to use, does anyone have a recommendation for how I can run this process in Batch.&nbsp; I would like to start/submit a job and then
 have it execute the Mail Merge process and save the files as a PDF.&nbsp; Would also like to consider being able to have several of them run in a functional manner,&nbsp; I.E. all the mail merge jobs which have to do with east coast hospitals could be in 1 group that
 I submit and then west coast hospitals would be in another group.&nbsp; There would have to be error checking and messages of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp; If anyone has done anything like this before, I would be glad to hear your input from doing this.&nbsp; Or should someone be willing to share ideas and how to point me, that would be great also. I thank you in advance.</p>

<br /> I would be glad to hear your input from doing this.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />To be honest - doing a mail-merge via the command line is not something I've done but the following (old) article may provide you with the starting point you're looking for to accomplish what you want to do

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>As a starting point, see the following page of Graham Mayor's website:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.gmayor.com/document_batch_processes.htm</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, to create individual pdf files for each record in the data source, you are going to need something like the Merge to Individual Documents facility on
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">my Merge Tools Add-in that is contained in the MERGE TOOLS ADD-IN.zip file that you can download from the following page of my One Drive:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://bit.ly/1hduSCB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://bit.ly/1hduSCB</span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>Extract the files from the archive and read the:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“READ ME –
</span></span><span><span>Setting up and using the Merge Tools Add-in</span></span><span><span>.docx
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>to see how to install and use the various tools.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, there would be a bit of work involved in integrating that utility into a completely automated batch process as at the moment, it displays a dialog to
 allow the user to select various options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Using my Merge Tools, it is possible to perform the following types of merge that cannot be done with Mail Merge “out-of-the-box”:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to e-mail messages either with or without attachments, with the documents created by the merge being sent as either Word or PDF attachments or as the body of the e-mail message.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to individual documents in either Word or PDF format with the filenames being supplied by the data in one of the fields in the data source</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Many to One type merges, which can be used for creating documents such as invoices where there are multiple records in the data source that have common data in one of the fields</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a document that will include a chart that is unique to each record in the data source</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document with Content Controls</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document that contains Legacy FormFields</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Duplex Merges</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a printer that will collate and staple the output created from each record in the data source.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letters type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message where relevant.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an
 Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook. If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For the Chart Merge utility, see the Mail Merging with Charts document that is included in the Merge Tools Add-in Zip file for additional requirements for the data source for use with that utility</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row
 that are within the range of columns that contain the data.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character
 (0-9). <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The&nbsp;number of characters in the field names, including spaces, must not be more than 40</span></span></span></p>
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></span>

                    <p>How to skip to the end of a large word document. Using QWERTY keyboard on galaxy Tab4. Using Word for Android.</p>
<p>I'm writing a book and I'd like to just skip to the last page I typed, so I can start from there.&nbsp; But all I seem to be able to do is scroll with my finger endlessly, until I get to the last page. I want to push Ctrl + or something easy like that.&nbsp; But my
 Android tablet's keyboard is a Samsung keyboard and there is no "END" button.&nbsp; I just want to start at the last place I edited or wrote, so I can continue; without having to swipe with my finger for an hour. (There is no little slide button in view to where
 I could just press and slide to the end either.)</p>
<p>Please help ASAP, before I give up this tablet (and writing) all together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***Yes, I could just use a laptop or PC, but I don't want to.&nbsp; I want to use my tablet, because I take it with me everywhere.</p>

</p><p>Using a Bluetooth keyboard that does have a CTRL and an END key with Word (Version 1.0.1 (16.0.4201.1008) on an Android tablet (Google Nexus 7), the CTRL+END, CTRL+HOME&nbsp;keys do have the same functionality as on a PC.</p>

    <title>How to restore default bullet formatting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to restore default bullet formatting</h2>
                    In the midst of a document I've been creating in an outline format, the bullet sequencing (tabs, type of bullets, etc.) changed. I currently have to move the tabs, etc., manually in order to retain the default bullet formatting that automatically managed
 the first part of the document. I'd like to restore the original formatting when continuing the outline. Is there a way to do this? Grateful for any advice.

            <p>I found recently that this long solution was not necessary. For me, the problem is that I was working a document that had previously been created in Google Docs and saved as a Word doc from there. The bullets became all fouled up as I added more and rearranged
 and indented list items. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution was to create a new blank document in Word, insert a bullet list, add one character of text in each level of an indented/nested bullet list with 5 levels, paste that bullet list into the flawed document, and cut and paste each line item from
 the flawed bullet list into the new, correctly formatted bullet list. It worked great, was simple, and didn't force me to mess with styles or anything on the back end of Word.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            BSOD IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL &#40;NETIO.sys&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>After upgrading to build 14279 I have been struggling with BSOD.</p>
<p>The latest I got is an "irql not less or Equal (netio.sys)" BSOD.</p>
<p>I have uploaded my dmp file here:</p>
<p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=2B258DF26D8D87DE!19807&amp;authkey=!AKkDaK9tp_23YI4&amp;ithint=folder%2cdmp</p>
<p>It seems like its the ntoskrnl.exe file that causes this and I have tried to find the solution for this problem, but I cant find any.</p>
<p>There are a lot of articles about this file causing BSOD, but I cant find any solution.</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>

<p>I was getting 2-3 BSOD/day related to ntoskrnl.exe or netsio.sys but after uninstalling Avast antivirus and stopped using chatty(a java based software) I stopped getting BSOD's.

            <p>First I used Trend Micro as antivirus, but I preformed a clean install of Windows 10 and didn`t install Trend Micro after&nbsp;that install.</p>
<p>But the BSOD happens often when my son uses Minecraft and that is very java based....</p>
<p>This BSOD haven`t started to happen before the build 14279, but I got a couple of other BSOD`s on the two earlyer builds so it seems like there is something that have happend these last builds.</p>
<p>Mabye it will be fixed in the next build...But I guess Microsoft need to know of the problem so they can check it out.</p>
<p>I have reported back through the feedback system in Windows 10 about the problem with Trend Micro so I guess I must report this problem as well.</p>

            Hi Vegar,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
I completely understand your concern with error message "irql not less or Equal (netio.sys)" BSOD on your system and we will assist you to fix the issue.</div>
<div><br />
Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you install any third party security software on your system?<br />
2. Are you able to boot to normal mode on your system?</div>
<div><br />
When your computer crashes with a Blue Screen of Death (or BSOD) the events leading up to the crash are held in memory until you restart your computer, when they are written to a file (called a DMP file).&nbsp; This file is critical in our diagnosis.</div>
<div><br />
This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high. This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>By default, the fault of the crashes is NETIO.sys which is the Network I/O Subsystem. This is not the true cause of the crash, and usually when we have network related crashes like this, it's caused by one of two things:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Network drivers themselves need to be updated.&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. 3rd party antivirus or firewall software causing NETBIOS conflicts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>If you are able to boot to normal mode on your system, follow these steps below:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1:&nbsp; </strong></span><br />
<br />
You may update the Network adaptor driver from Device Manager manually and check, if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press (Windows key + X key) and click on “Device Manager”.</p>
<p>2. Expand “Network adaptor”.</p>
<p>3. Right click on the Network adaptor driver and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer and check, if it works.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, follow the Method 2. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:&nbsp; </span></strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disable third party security or antivirus software.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let’s try to disable any third party security or antivirus software temporarily and check, if it helps.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Disclaimer: </strong>Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Also, refer to the article, created by ZigZag3143 (Windows IT Pro), replied on July 26, 2013, to fix your issue with BSOD.</p>

            I think you are onto something there, I find I get the ntoskrnl BSOD on system shutdown right after closing a java jnlp sandbox app..... aka my stock-trader. It is related to tcpip sys in which the java and system used 2 different security rules and both
 accessing the same mem page

            Did this occur during shutdown and were you using any program that requires java just prior to shutdown? I can re-create any of 3 common BSOD's every time I close a java sandbox and then system shutdown. They all point to a ntoskrnl driver of which I am
 never able to load a symbol for it during debug. Something with a timestamp mismatch. I mentioned this in TechNet but all the self-proclaimed pro's seem to shy away from answering.....

            <p>Now I have made a clean install of Windows 10 and haven`t joined the insider ring. And no BSOD....</p>
<p>It happend all the time with Insider Preview 14269 and up to 14279.</p>
<p>It seems to be related to java-based programs as Mojang Minecraft (not the beta in Windows 10).</p>
<p>But since it have worked fine in the Insider Preview 14261 and earlyer it must have been something that have been done with these newest builds.</p>

            <p>This BSOD occured to my computer when my son was playing Minecraft. It happend when he was playing multiplayer games, but not when he played single player game. So it seems very related to the networkcard.</p>
<p>And it worked fine with build 14261 and earlyer so it must have been something that Microsoft has done in the newest builds.</p>
<p>So then we just has to wait for the next build and see what they have fixed in that.</p>

 insider release and it worked. Tested different minecraft installer versions, with and without java pre-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No crashes at other times, just when playing Minecraft so far. Playing CS:GO for hours.</p>

<h2>            Windows Threat Notification Sample Display</h2>
                    <p>I just received a TROJAN threat warning while surfing. (Bright red. PC started beeping.)</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing if this was a valid notification or not. I did not click or act on it.</p>
<p>Went to Windows Defender to see if I could learn more.</p>
<p>Would it be wise to have an illustration of what a valid Defender notification would look like on the Settings page or does that just provide fodder to the bad guys?</p>

<p>Rick,</p>
<p>The problem with displaying an example of the Defender notification is that it varies slightly on each version of Windows in which Defender operates, while the GUI portion of the program is basically the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The methods used to perform notifications are actually determined by Windows itself, since it's the "Toast" or similar notification pop-outs that are most often used, while even these have evolved slightly over time to, for example, slide out from the side
 panel rather than the lower-right notification area where they used to display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to be aware of the current method of display is to perform a "test" of your Defender or other Antivirus application by using the EICAR provided eicar.com test file(s) that were designed and supported by most major AV programs for this purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download ° EICAR - European Expert Group for IT-Security</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eicar.org/85-0-Download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eicar.org/85-0-Download.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the warning on that page is referring to how your AV program interacts with the eicar.com file and not the file itself, since that's actually nothing more than a well known
<a href="http://www.eicar.org/86-0-Intended-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Anti-Malwaare Testfile</a>&nbsp;text string.&nbsp; This is easy for AV developers to create a signature to detect and generate&nbsp;a [false] warning for a severe threat in order to perform an otherwise completely&nbsp;safe test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the&nbsp;clearly false Trojan warning you received,&nbsp;the notable difference for all of these fakes is that they typically fill as much of the entire page as possible and often include loud obnoxious sounds in order to attempt to get you to call the fake
 number displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The entire point of these fake notifications is to make people panic and not take a moment to&nbsp;think about what they're seeing, since if they do most would stop and realize that they're simply being conned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other recognizable&nbsp;item is that these fake notifications are always some form of a browser popup, since that's how they're getting into the PC in the first place and also why few are ever detected by most AV products, since they aren't actually malware
 and simply a web page (e.g. browser hijack).</p>

<h2>            Feedback&#58; Messaging history folder</h2>
                    <p>One month ago, I've chatted with my Messenger buddies in <strong>Messaging</strong> app on my Windows Phone. Thus, Outlook.com automatically creates a "<strong>Messaging history</strong>" folder. (I remember there is a "Messaging history" option in settings
 page, but the option has been gone.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Windows Phone, I turned Chat backup off. I also emptied the "<strong>Messaging history</strong>" folder on Outlook.com. However, I cannot remove the folder(<em>Right-click the folder, there is no option to delete</em>). Yes, I no longer need it.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/41fe45d4-d818-48ed-96b8-df50cae16b8d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I expect Outlook.com team could add a command for removing the "<strong>Messaging history</strong>" folder in future updates.</p>

    <title>How do I complain to Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackiemccoy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I complain to Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Is there an address/phone number I can complain to Microsoft? I have three different hotmail accounts for friends and bills and two separate work ones for the different types of work I do. Over the past two months I have started to notice a patter. microsoft
 has started locking me out of one account or another saying there is suspicious activity. One of my account is not locked and I can't get back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The alternative email address code doesn't reach the email account I put in. I've changed cellphone numbers and no longer have access to the old cellphone so they can't send a code there. Their only "fix" is filling out a stupid form which asks you to remember
 email headlines. I use the account I'm locked out of for work. I'm also freelance. Microsoft want me to be emailing work contacts, from a different email address that I don't use, saying hey could you tell me an email headline I sent to you?!?!?!!? When I
 contacted the online "helpers" I was blamed and told microsoft would never lock me out for no reason. I'm sorry I didn't tell you there was a problem so why on earth are you creating one. Microsoft also don't accept drivers licenses or passports as another
 form of validation. I'm potentially losing work because I can't get back into the account, and the "online helpers" couldn't give a damn. This is incredibly frustrating, and upsetting as my livelyhood depends on it. Also because this is a Microsoft created
 problem.</p>

<p>Hello, I am having the same problem &amp; hope that you can help me. I am getting the message "The UID of a message changed unexpectedly. This typically indicates a server bug. Your program may not function properly after this." All of my sub-folders under inbox
 ( there were quite a few) have disappeared from my seeing them, but if I go to create new ones I am told that I can not make new due to there already are folders with that name. I hope I'm not sounding as confused as I seem. I also have seen some people have
 been told to remove the program and re-install. Won't that lose all of my sub folders and everything that's in them? I will lose my mind if that happens. Please help.</p>

            Hi Pamela ive been told there is nothing Microsoft can do. They wont accept Passport ir drivers licenses as a form of ID. They dont care, that this is an account that i use as a freelancer for work. They dont care that this will hurt me financially. They
 have only told me that ut is my fault that the alternate email address no konger works, and that thw nimber has changed. Microsoft are not interested in helping me find a solution and have told me ti close my account ans open another one. I have contacts tax
 information invoices all sorts of things on that account and they just donr care.&nbsp;

    <title>Why Does Museo Sans 100 Weight Not Work on Latest Version of Word for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benjerg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Does Museo Sans 100 Weight Not Work on Latest Version of Word for Mac&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After the most recent update of Word for Mac 2016, a font I frequently use is not appearing correctly. The font in question is Museo Sans, 100 weight. I seems to look more like the 500 weight whenever I select the 100 or 300 weights. However, 700 and 900
 weights appear correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested the font in other applications, and it appears correctly. To be clear, the 100 weight does appear as an option, it just doesn't make the text appear on the page as 100 weight. I tried to use the 100 weight on a new document as well as opening
 existing documents that have the font with the same result. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough, I also tested the font in PowerPoint and Excel, and the font at 100 weight appears normally there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had the same issue?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I tried in both 2011 and 2016 and both react the same over a certain point size. Below a certain point size their weight is different. Above that Break over point, all look the same Weight. Others will be along to to make suggestions.</p>

</p><p>The short answer to any question beginning with "Why" in here is "Because that's the way they made it". &nbsp;Which is not at all helpful :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of fonts, Word 2016 does have some issues (some don't work at all!). TrueType fonts and OpenType fonts provided that they contain TrueType outlines should be relatively reliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word 2016 has the new rendering engine out of Word 2013, so some weights and justifications will change a little.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try printing it to see what you get. And try turning off Font Smoothing in System Preferences to see what effect that has.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also keep the updates up-to-date, fixes are coming constantly at the moment.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here's the thing, though: The same exact font and weight appeared as expected when I was using Office 2016&nbsp;<em>before</em> the 15.4.2 update. And it prints at the heavier weight, too, it's not just how it appears on the screen. I had a draft of the document
 I printed before the update, and sure enough, it's a very noticeable difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As best as I can remember (my Mac with the font is at my office and I'm at home right now), Museo Sans is an&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">OpenType font. I will try your suggestion to turn off font smoothing next time I'm in my office.</span></p>

            <p>Other than a feature to Compress pictures, I am not aware of a general compression feature for documents that is contained within Word or Office. Zipping a file does compress the file a bit and then I suppose there might be some third party products that
 you can search for on the Web.</p>
<p>If you need to reduce the file size of a document from within Word, then try the Compress feature on for Picture images. You can learn about it from Word &gt; Help and you access it from the Format Pictures tab on the Ribbon.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

            As Rich indicated, that is the only option in Word. The  Compress feature is available from the Format Picture contextual tab of the Ribbon which appears when you select an image or you can select File Reduce File Size. However, there are at least 3 considerations to take into account:  

	There are only 3 choices of resolution (pixels per inch), neither of which is optimal for quality printing  may reduce the appearance quality to an unacceptable level for viewing on screen as well, and

	The most commonly used picture file format is  JPEG (.jpg) which is a compressed format to begin with. Stripping out pixels usually will reduce the file size by no more than 20%, if that, but may reduce the image quality by as much as 50%.

    <title>why does the background of email turn black when sending an excel 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yok33  say:</h3>
<h2>            why does the background of email turn black when sending an excel 2010 spreadsheet through microsoft outlook 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been creating a specific type of memo in Excel 2010 for a couple of years now.&nbsp; Then I send the spreadsheet by choosing the Send to Mail Recipient at the top.&nbsp; when the person receives the email, the entire background is either all BLACK or ALL another
 type of color.&nbsp; Despite the fact that the spreadsheet in Excel has all of the cells set to NO FILL.&nbsp; Can someone please help me ASAP!&nbsp;&nbsp; This is getting VERY frustrating!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for asking.
</span></p>
<p><span>As I understand the background color changes when send as Mail recipient.</span></p>
<p><span>Couple of questions for you, how are you sending the Excel file?</span></p>
<p><span>Is the file sent as an attachment or as the body of the email?</span></p>
<p><span>Do you use the ‘</span><span>Send to Mail Recipient’ from the quick access tool bar or
 by right clicking on the Excel File?</span></p>
<p><span>Do you use any macro or VBA code on the file?</span></p>
<p><span>Open the Excel attachment from your sent items and check if you find the same issue.</span></p>
<p><span>You may upload the sample file to check and help you better.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below to upload the sample file to the sky drive:</span></p>

            <p>I am creating the Excel spreadsheet and then sending just the one sheet using the "Send To Mail Recipient" method.&nbsp; I then send it in the "BODY" of the mail and NOT as an attachment.&nbsp; I have been using this method for about four years now without a problem.&nbsp;
 Now just in the lasst month or so does the background come out as black or one color.</p>

            Has anyone found a solution for this problem? &nbsp;Our office sends spreadsheets to other business offices by choosing the Send to Mail Recipient option from a workbook with a worksheet as the body of the e-mail. &nbsp;The email is sometimes sent with a black background,
 or some other color at random. Sometimes it does send it with a white background. &nbsp; We sometimes send over 100 emails to outside entities using this method, so it's becoming very annoying and very unprofessional...... &nbsp;&nbsp;

                    <p>I bough a subscription to ad-free Outlook.com for my account today. However, I still see ads. Before you help me out, here are few things I have already done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logged out and logged back in</li><li>Cleared my cache</li><li>Tried a different browser</li><li>Called billing support &amp; verified that the subscription is active (it is). They tried helping me but say that the only way this can get resolved is on this forum.</li></ul>
<p>I've purchase a similar subscription for a different ID before and had no issues. Now however, I still see those ads. Someone please help me resolve this.</p>
