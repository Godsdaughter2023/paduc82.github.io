                    Is there a tutorial for fresh paint? I can't get it to get back to painting, All I can do is blend colors. At least something to tell me what each of the icons represents.

    <title>Use voice to search in internet explorer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tacroy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use voice to search in internet explorer&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not finding how to search for something on the web using voice on the xbox one. So say I am playing Dead Rising and I want to look up the location of a item on the internet. How would I do that?</p>

<p>When I "Bing" it doesn't appear to have the option to "Search on internet" like the 360 did.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
A program or scheduled task might&nbsp;wakeup your computer. By default, Power Option settings do not allow scheduled tasks to wake the computer from sleep or hibernate. However, some programs might awaken the computer if these settings have been changed.</p>
<p>For more information about enabling or disabling this feature, refer the below article.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Sleep-and-hibernation-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Sleep-and-hibernation-frequently-asked-questions</a></p>
<p>After completing the task it might not shut down your PC (personal computer). But, it might put your computer to sleep after some specific time, which is set by you.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule a task<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Schedule-a-task" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Schedule-a-task</a></p>

<p>Hello Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you're going to change the hard disk drive, the Windows 7 backup/restore option may not be applicable. We suggest that you create a system image, or back up your files to the external hard disk drive. Please be informed that even if you did a backup,
 you may still need to reinstall the apps, however, your files will be saved. For additional help, you may read the guidelines in this article, see
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17127/windows-back-up-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Back up and restore your PC</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query. Let us know if you'll need additional assistance.</p>

<p>You should make an image of your hard drive and restore the image to the new hard drive. This will be straightforward for you if you are familiar with making and restoring backup images. If not, have no fear:</p>
<p>
</p><p>New retail hard drives typically come with image software and full instructions on how to use it. In addition, HDD manufacturers' technical support staffs should be well-acquainted with the procedure and will help you. You can probably find a complete description
 of the procedure on the HDD manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this procedure you want to use the HDD manufacturer's include image software or another third-party image application. Windows has its own imaging utility built in, but it's a pain to use because first you have to do a clean install of Windows and then
 you restore the image. With a third-party program you restore the image in one step. Making and restoring the image should take less than a half hour.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the question... Do I create a system image or do a back up under Windows 7 backup/restore option ?....&nbsp;&nbsp; They are the same thing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with using this feature is that you are going to a different size drive...</p>
<p>This tool will not resize your partitions, and if it did, maybe not to your liking...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also the possibility that you will end up with a EFI or Recovery Partition after your OS partition that will make it difficult to expand your C:\ into the unused space...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also run into some of these same issues with a free 3rd party imaging program... Some of the "Free" programs will not allow the rearranging of partitions when restoring an image...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the programs that are available with the purchase of a HDD will not even create an image, but will only "Clone"... Which will end up with possibly the same problem as using the Windows Imaging feature...</p>
<p>
</p><p>These programs will also require that they are installed, which leaves you with a program on your machine that you really don't want...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing to do would be to search for a free disk management program that downloads as a bootable ISO that can be the put on a CD or Flash Drive... Make sure it will allow you to relocate partitions and\or resize them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally use Acronis TrueImage which comes on a bootable CD, or you can download a bootable ISO for versions older than 2017...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same program that may be furnished by a HDD manufacturer, but without the restrictions, and not requiring installation...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most imaging programs require bootable media to reload the image anyway... You can create the image from within windows, but not reload it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply "Cloning" may not accomplish what you want, but since you will still have the original drive, you can experiment as needed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't planning on posting all this stuff, but once I started I felt obligated to warn you of some of the shortcomings of some of your options...</p>

<h2>            Snipping Tool messed up by default font change in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I changed Windows 10 (Fall Creator update) default font to Arial bold (using Registry) recently. Everything seemed to be OK until I tried to use Snipping Tool. It opened as a minimized toolbar and did not offer any other choices than "close". I could use
 "workaround" by going to Task manager, right click on Snipping Tool and click on Maximize, which would bring forth the Snipping screen (with the Task Manager window in front, of course). Not really a work around. I tried many different things and Googled wide
 and far, but no answers. And yes, I tried to reboot, Safe Mode, copying another version of Snipping Tool and ran SFC as well.</p>
<p>Well, I changed back to original default font and lo and behold, the Snipping tool came back to full functionality.<br />
</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that such a simple thing would break the Snipping tool, but it did on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody has any suggestions short of going to Linux?</p>

<p>The "Going to Linux" was meant as abandoning Windows and using Linux instead.........</p>
<p>Well, maybe using"minimized" was not entirely correct. The Snipping Tool would open with Title Bar only. So it would open on the current screen, just not usable for anything. I included a picture for clarity. That is all I would get. The usual menu etc.
 would be missing.</p>

<p>Change of default font is well documented registry change and hardly "fiddling". If Microsoft provided simpler default font change I (and anybody else) would use it.</p>
<p>In my post I did not ask how to fix the font change, after all I reverted to the original, but why would such a change affect snipping tool.</p>

<h2>            Want to remove&#47;hide &#39;other user&#39; login in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10. Recently,I was installing windows 10 update when ,due to some reasons, my os got corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to do a fresh installation. Installation is done and I am able to use my system. However now I am facing one issue which is bit irritating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time i switch on my system or restart my system, windows uses 'other user' account for login with some random credentials, even though I haven't configured any other account users on the system. (I am the only user using the system with admin access.
 )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that login fails, i am able to select my user account and give password and login. (Till that time system freezes)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens every time and its bit annoying. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help me on getting rid of this and suggest me how to disable/remove/hide 'other user' account on login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have been searching internet since last couple of days but haven't got anything significant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Windows Username problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thejollyduck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Username problem.</h2>
                    <p>I have this problem regarding Usernames and the the change I made to them. So basically I had the username "A" (not telling the name) and it was a microsoft account. But there was a read error whenever I tried accessing my account so it would give me a temp
 account to use. I wasn't satisfied with this so I thought using a local account would help. So I changed the Microsoft account to a local one with a name "B" but it didn't help with anything. I fixed the issue of going into the account by checking and fixing
 of errors on the drive but since I had a local account there was problems with some programs that relied on username "A". I then tried to change back to a microsoft account which it let me but the problems still remain. the account name is "A" again but the
 programs still recognize the account name as "B" which meant that the settings I configured for the programs reset. It even shows in the processes in task manager to be "B". I need help. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hello TheJollyDuck,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows may create a temporary profile when there's a corrupted system file with the current user account signed in. To help you user account issue, I suggest enabling the built-in administrator account and then run the
<strong>SFC</strong> tool. This tool is designed to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. Follow the steps provided by

            If you are using/relying on the built in NT Backup to backup your system, that is primitive technology (obviously - since it will ask you for a floppy when it is done).&nbsp; If you have a disaster (even a minor one), you are going to have a big problem trying
 to recover your stuff if you don't have a floppy drive - and maybe even if you do have a floppy drive you are very likely still to a big problem if you need to restore your stuff.<br />
<br />
If you want to make a backup, an image or some kind of clone of your system, it makes sense to use modern technology - and that technology is not built in to XP.<br />
<br />
There are lots of popular options for third party XP backup and imaging software(s).<br />
<br />
A popular one folks seem to like is from Acronis.<br />
<br />
With that (free 30 day trial) you backup, you can make a bootable CD or bootable USB (that's modern, huh?) and use that in the event of a disaster.<br />
If/when you like it, at the time of this writing the cost for the full version was a mere $49.95<br />
<br />
They used to have a totally free version - maybe not anymore - just the 30 day trial, then you have to buy it, but it is well respected.<br />
<br />
It is so much more robust than the XP backup, it is laughable.<br />
<br />
There are many other options if you do a little Googling...<br />
<br />
Here are some products that other forum users suggest might be appealing.&nbsp; Use Google to find them and read about their features, and capabilities.&nbsp; Some have free versions or you can purchase them to get more features:<br />
<br />
If you have a Western Digital drive, you can get a version of Acronis True Image free from WD:<br />
<br />
http://support.wdc.com/product/downloaddetail.asp?swid=119<br />
<br />
Or you can obtain backup and cloning software separately (this is not a comprehensive list and is no particular order; some are free, others not):<br />
<br />
Acronis True Image Home<br />
Easeus ToDo Backup Free<br />
Paragon Drive Copy&nbsp; or Partition Manager Personal<br />
Casper<br />
Norton Ghost<br />
<br />
Some disk cloning software ideas for you to Google:<br />
<br />
XXClone<br />
Marcium Reflect Free<br />
DriveImageXML<br />
Acronis True Image Home 11<br />
Easeus ToDo Backup<br />
Paragon Drive Copy&nbsp; or Partition Manager Personal<br />
Casper<br />
Norton Ghost<br />
<br />
Whatever method you choose, it is prudent to test your method from end to end to be sure it works.<br />
<br />
You can create a temporary folder somewhere on your system and copy a bunch of files into it, perform your backup, then delete the temporary folder and be sure that you can recover it from your backup.<br />
<br />
The day you need your backup/restore process to work is not the day to find out it doesn't work.<br />

    <title>Problem with Email Width Very Narrow on Windows 10 Regardles of Email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dougb1963  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Email Width Very Narrow on Windows 10 Regardles of Email Client</h2>
                    <p><span>With Windows 10 --&nbsp;apparently regardless of the email client being used --&nbsp;the width of many emails when they are viewed is extremely narrow (around 2-1/4" to 3" on my screen.)&nbsp; There are&nbsp;posts
 about this problem in other categories (some threads about 1-1/2 years old) with no resolution by Microsoft.&nbsp; This problem&nbsp;has now cost me over $250 and is still unresolved.&nbsp; I had no such problem with&nbsp;emails on my former laptop that had Windows 8.1 and Outlook
 2010.&nbsp; But when I upgraded to an Asus high res&nbsp;Zenbook with Windows 10 and Outlook 2016 (on Office 365),&nbsp;the problem first appeared.&nbsp; It doesn't make a difference whether the email is viewed on the laptop's screen or an older external monitor.&nbsp; Because of
 this problem,&nbsp;I bought a $200 OEM version of Office 2010 to replace Office 2016, thinking at first that it was the newer versions of Outlook causing the problem.&nbsp; Yesterday, I installed the 2010 version&nbsp;but&nbsp;that didn't solve the problem.&nbsp; From the other threads,
 this problem also exists with Outlook 2013 (as well as 2016).&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I downloaded eM Client as my email client, to see how the emails would look in it.&nbsp; No difference -- still extremely narrow width.&nbsp; This is a problem not just with "marketing" emails but
 with many other types, including some from companies that probably send hundreds of thousands out (like USA Today, for example).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a mystery to me why Microsoft apparently continues to&nbsp;ignore this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to hear from someone representing Microsoft whether there's&nbsp;a fix to this problem, and
 if not, why not since it's been a problem now for&nbsp;probably close to two years. &nbsp;

            <p>Thank you for replying. &nbsp;While I appreciate your interest in helping to resolve this matter, I haven't attached a screen shot as you requested because this issue has been the subject of probably at least a half-dozen threads with well over 100 comments and
 replies (probably closer now to 200-300) going back, to my recollection, to the year 2012 and certainly 2013. &nbsp;After creating this thread with my initial post 4 days ago, I've done further online research. &nbsp;I also replaced my Asus Zenbook that had Windows
 10 and QHD resolution (3200 X 1800) with a Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 that has Windows 8.1 and Full HD (1920 x 1080). &nbsp;Additionally, I'm still using my older HP Pavillion that has Windows 8.1 and 1366 x 768 native resolution. &nbsp;I've now viewed the identical emails
 ON ALL THREE COMPUTERS (with different Windows and Outlook versions), all connected to the same external monitor. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've found is that the email width -- whether one is using Windows 8.1 or 10, or using Outlook 2010, 2013 or 2016 -- is being affected (actually, determined) by the computer's native resolution. &nbsp;When opened up, the same emails are the
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">widest</span></em> on my older HP with the&nbsp;1366 x 768 native resolution; then somewhat narrower on my new Dell with 1920 x 1080 resolution; then extremely narrow (around 2.5") on the Asus Zenbook with 3200 x 1800
 resolution. &nbsp;In other words, the size of the emails when viewed in Outlook (whatever version) is not auto-adjusting for the higher resolutions on newer computers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What seems to be obvious from all this is that although computer manufacturers have consistently been developing higher and higher resolutions over the last 4-5 years (and before that), Microsoft has not bothered to update whatever it is in Outlook (or Windows)
 that adjusts the email's size when viewed to be consistent with the higher resolutions in the newer computers. &nbsp;One could understand if Microsoft was behind by six months or maybe even a year in making the adjustment to a higher resolution computer. &nbsp;But 3-4
 years! &nbsp;C'mon, all that shows is Microsoft's complete indifference to customer service. &nbsp;It should be ashamed of itself -- and, frankly, those who work for it should be ashamed of working for a company that from all appearances could care less about putting
 out a high quality product. &nbsp;I'm sorry, I know you're a Microsoft Support Engineer, but let's be real -- Microsoft has been aware of this issue (and numerous posts which speculated that it's a resolution issue) for a long time and hasn't bothered to even acknowledge
 it, let alone fix it or let its customers know that it's trying to fix it. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Looks like you are expecting an original message to somehow be reformatted or zoomed and rescaled?&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens to it if you start a Reply with it embedded?&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, you probably can Zoom it or at least use the Magnifier on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just found something that you could do using Ink Workspace (Win-w).&nbsp; Use Screen Sketch on your document and use its Clipping tool to capture just the portion you want to see.&nbsp; Then Copy the clipping.&nbsp; Then Share it with Mail.&nbsp; Then open the attachment.&nbsp;
 The attachment opens in Photo Viewer Fullscreen which also has a Zoom if you need it.</p>

<h2>            Constant &#38;quot&#59;We&#38;&#35;39&#59;ve lost your TV signal&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a comcast RNG100N Cable set-top box from Comcast. When I hook it up to the Xbox One for HDMI pass-thru it does not work and constantly shows "We've lost your TV signal". When I first had the console and tried to hook it up, it was mostly a black screen
 with this message on and off, however now its constant.</p>
<p>I have tried several HDMI cords to go from the cablebox to the Xbox One including the cable from the Xbox One with no luck. However, if I hook up my old Xbox 360 to the Xbox One's HDMI pass thru, it displays a signal perfectly fine, infact I playedf GTA
 5 for over ab hour like that with barley noticable lag,</p>
<p>I have tried to enable Power Saving as some users have said and plugging the TV's HDMI cable into the Xbox One's passthru with the Xbox One off and still have no luck. With time I learned how to change the channels source from 1080i to 720p and i still have
 yet to get it to work, or even show a picture of some sort.</p>
<p>I have also tried to boot the cable box from a cold boot to ensure it wasnt something small and simple, however, still no luck.</p>

<p>Has anyone else had this same issue and got it to work?</p>

<p>Getting the "We've lost your TV signal" message along with video hangs with some throughput on new Xbox One. Using the Comcast Explorer 8300HD with HDMI pass-thru.
</p>
<p>Throughput to cable box is excellent (5) and absolutely no issues when not hooked up to Xbox One.
</p>
<p>Appears this is a Comcast/Xbox One problem?</p>

<p>I have a Scientific Atlanta 8300HD cable/dvr box that runs my live tv. The first night I used the XB1 I had the freezing screen/black screen issue so I searched this forum and found the following suggestions helped:</p>
<p>Settings:</p>
<p>1) TV &amp; OneGuide settings; Power settings; leave all the choices unchecked for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Troubleshooting; leave Surround sound (BETA) unchecked for now.</p>
<p>2) DIsplay &amp; sound; Digital Audio; HDMI audio; Stereo uncompressed for now</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Optical audio; Stereo uncompressed for now</p>
<p>3) Power &amp; startup; Turn Xbox off (if you're having the freezing/black screen issue)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Turn off after; Don't turn off automatically</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Power Options; Power mode; Energy-saving for now.</p>
<p>4) Kinect; Troubleshooting; KInect doesn't hear me (I go into this if the Kinect has trouble hearing me with voice commands and start the audio check. If you have a receiver hooked up to the XB1 as I do I have the Optical audio set to DTS Digital Surround
 and you can hear the difference on your speakers while doing this test. Some say to leave this setting at Stereo uncompressed if you're having problems with the fast forward/rewind function on your dvr.)</p>
<p>In my opinion the XB1 goes into a sleep/hibernation mode and can't connect with the live tv again when you want the XB1 to wake up when you try to make everything work. Whenever I've had the freeze/black screen issue I've gone to the Power &amp; startup section
 and turned the XBox off completely. When it starts again I've seen the green Xbox screen just like the initial startup. So, I'm keeping the instant on off for now and keeping it in energy mode which kills a lot of the features, but also keeps my live tv on
 until MS can figure it out.</p>

<p>I was having the same issue after the XB1 and my Cable box working fine since launch day. My solution was to power down the Xbox and then unplug the power cord. Simply powering the system down does not fully reset the hardware, it just goes into a sleep
 mode. Unplugging the power cord for 20 seconds and then re-powering the Xbox seemed to fix this issue.</p>

<p>Same issue here. When it first happened, I called MSFT for support and was first advised to change cables. When that didn't work, they told me to downgrade to 720P &amp; 2 channel stereo. When that didn't work, they had me factory reset my XB1, losing nearly
 a month's worth of game play progress and all of my downloaded content. When that didn't work, they passed the buck and told me that the issue was "obviously" my Dish Hopper, that they couldn't do anything else, and that I should call Dish for support. They
 won the pass the buck award with that one. </p>

<p>I just recent began to have the same problem. On Thursday night I was able to watch DirectTv through my XB1 and today I can't. Absolulty nothing has changed in the set up. I've tried a hard reboot twice, I've reset my DTV system twice and I've even turned
 the power to everything for a hour. Everything boots up fine until I try to watch tv. all I get is the We've lost your tv signal message. &nbsp;What can I do aside from taking the xb1 pass through down?</p>

            <p>I get that message with every start up since new &amp; I don't even have cable. The only things connected are a 3TB usb3 external hdd &amp; the TV "of course" which is connected to&nbsp;the console with the supplied HDMI cable.</p>
<p>How do you shut the "We've lost your TV signal" message off? Because it is never going to be used for that......<br />

    <title>Windows 10 cannot be installed to this disk. This computer&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dishounghwhite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 cannot be installed to this disk. This computer&#39;s hardware may not support booting to this disk. Ensure that the disk&#39;s controller is enabled in the computer&#39;s BIOS menu.</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I've built my new second PC and I'm giving my older first PC with an older 3TB Western Digital BLACK hard drive in it to my dad. It's the only drive in it. I'll provide some screenshots to show you guys. I'm trying to install Windows 10 on it and it
 keeps giving me the error message that you see in the subject line. And for some reason, the system thinks the hard drive in question is 5TB but it's 3TB. It could be because I used to partition it on the old one as a secondary storage drive. The primary one
 that used to be on the first PC is on my new one now. So, I theorize that maybe that partitioning thing is still on the hard drive even though I cleaned it. I don't know why it's acting like it's 5TB when it's 3. Maybe because that's how I partitioned it on
 the old one. Anyway, anybody got any solutions of how to fix this? Yes, I went into the BIOS and changed the SATA Mode. I did a lot of things. Now, if this doesn't work, then I'll just simply buy a cheap 1TB hard drive or SSD depending on the price if it's
 cheap enough and use that as the primary boot drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is kinda a lot of photos to show, so I'll just like to Imgur.com instead where the photos are. If you want to see them, here is the link:</p>
<p>https://imgur.com/a/CorY48i</p>
<p>
</p><p>The interesting part out of all of this is that I figure out how to get past this error message and out of the partition screen but when it says it's finished downloading Windows, it sets me back to the installation from the beginning. I think it's explained
 in the image captions but anyway, the only way for me to get passed this message is for me to disable the Compatibility Support Module. But when I do that, my boot options disappear except for one. So, I guess when Windows 10 finish "installing", it fails
 to actually store to the actual partition I told it to. So, any suggestions? If not, then I'll just pull my final contingency which is to buy another drive that's cheaper to use to install instead and use the 3TB as a secondary drive again later. Because I
 think that earlier partition is what's screwing it up.&nbsp;</p>

            Yeah, I tried tinkering with it for the past few hours. Nothing is working. I can't get it to do right. I'll try to buy a clean new drive that was never partitioned. Again, I think it's the fault of the hard drive.....and me because of how I partitioned
 it from earlier use. Seriously, something is f***ed up on this thing. But, I'm not throwing it away though. Unless you guys got some crazy, insane Doctor-Strange-type magic trick to fix this, I'll just assume a new drive will fix this.&nbsp;

            Also, I can't find a "Reset BIOS to default settings" option in the BIOS. It's probably in there hiding somewhere but I couldn't find it while tinkering to get this to work. Anyway, I'm pretty sure this will get solved. It's just that I'm scared because
 I don't want to give my dad an empty piece of metal that he can't use.&nbsp;

<h2>            Display on Surface Pro 3 is very messed up</h2>
                    <p>I was using my Surface Pro 3 last night and everything was working just fine. When i went to turn it on today, half of the screen was normal and the other half was gray/black with vertical gray/white lines. A little while later soon after restarting it,
 the entire screen was black/gray with gray lines running vertically through the whole screen. After restarting it multiple times, I have not been able to fix the display. When half of the screen was normal, the touch screen worked fine in the normal part of
 the screen but was not working fine on the messed up part of the screen. I know for a fact I didnt drop it, so i must have stepped on it by accident but I do not know for sure what happened to cause this issue. Right now I cant do anything in my device so
 any help on how to fix the display would be greatly appreciated.<a href="http://imgur.com/bHy0cYI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Screen</a></p>
<p>Also, the screen itself isnt damaged , the damage appears to be internal.</p>

<h2>            Microphone not working in programs</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, I decided to update Windows 10 to the latest version (Version 1803). I have this Logitech USB&nbsp;webcam/microphone that I was currently using. Before this update, the microphone worked perfectly fine. After the update, it stopped working. I have
 tried using the troubleshooter for audio and microphone. Tried using the mic setup which didn't work. Said something about the wizard unable to start and to check the microphone. There is no mute button on this microphone. The sound card is connected to the
 motherboard and has not been touched. I've basically tried all the methods I could find about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that when I checked "Listen to this device" then applied it, I could hear what the microphone was picking up. I knew that the microphone was clearly not broken but the computer or something was. Picture below</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try this fix next:  <a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 10 Clean Install - Cannot Remove US English Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> owenashcroft2912  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Clean Install - Cannot Remove US English Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>So I had this issue with 8.1, that after a clean install I'm stuck using the US Keyboard, which is a nuisance, because my keyboard is UK, and it's really making touch typing hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I followed the usual list</p>
<p>- Make sure region is uk</p>
<p>- Make sure location is uk</p>
<p>- Make sure uk language is installed</p>
<p>- Make sure uk is above us</p>
<p>- Override Windows Display Language to UK English (Ignores me and keeps returning to Use language list...)</p>
<p>- Override for default input method (English UK, this sticks!)</p>
<p>- Make sure each "Let me set a different input method for each app window" is unchecked</p>
<p>
</p><p>All done, now with 8.1 this was enough to allow me to use a uk keyboard, in windows 10, nope, still us, and it's really bloody annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird thing is it's UK at the log in prompt, and switches to US after a log in, and I don't seem to be able to force the keyboard to UK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>The only thing installed is IIS and Visual Studio, as this is a development install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up having to create a new account, as it was impossible to change the account creating when windows was installed to a British keyboard. I could temporarily set it per session by removing the us keyboard from the us regional settings (which couldn't
 be removed, and even though they weren't the default would always apply their settings) and adding a uk keyboard, but this would be reset on reboot back to us keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appears there's a fairly large bug here, as any newly created accounts work properly, just the original account is permanently stuck in us mode.</p>

            <p>I did manage to (kind of) resolve it, more like a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That Windows 10 PC seems to always re-add the "English - (US) Language Pack" + "English (US) Keyboard", so I added "English (Ireland)" Language and removed "English - (US) Language Pack (&amp; US Keyboard), and it no longer adds the US stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I have "English (United Kingdom)" &amp; "English (Ireland)" on the PC, so it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- PC seems to want 2 languages, so I gave it 2...</p>
<p>&nbsp;- doesn't really explain why it happens</p>

    <title>un-span spanned drives in Vista x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcobaratto  say:</h3>
<h2>            un-span spanned drives in Vista x64</h2>
                    I have 4 x 500GB hard drives and I had the BRILLIANT idea to span them all together in a new X: volume. Bad move. And I've only realised recently that it's a dangerous set up to have.<br />
<br />
My OS is installed on a 2-drive physical (not software) RAID array, so that is safe and is not worrying me.<br />
<br />
I want to reverse the spanning of my data drives. I understand that I might lose everything but even so, the disk management is not giving me any option to separate the drives or even to format them.<br />
<br />
I'm stuck.<br />
what can I do?<br />
<br />
thanks

            Marcobaratto, thank you for posting to the Microsoft forums.<br />
<br />
Two programs you may want to try are:<br />
<br />
Paragon Partition Manager<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
GParted<br />
<br />
Gparted is completely free and comes on a "Live CD" all you have to do is burn it to disc using your favorite buring program.<br />
Paragon Partition Manager 10 has many, many, many features, and can convert Dynamic Disks but will cost you.<br />
<br />
Paragon: http://www.paragon-software.com/home/pm-personal/features.html<br />
<br />
GParted: <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gparted.sourceforge.net/index.php</a><br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps.<br />
regards,<br />
Aaron Barth

    <title>sony vaio windows 7 freezes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matteoferra  say:</h3>
<h2>            sony vaio windows 7 freezes</h2>
                    I always try to resolve by already posted discussions, but this time I couldn't find a similar situation.
<div>We are talking about a sony vayo VPCEE3E1R, win7 64, http://www.sony.ru/product/vaio-serii-e/vpcee3e1r-wi&nbsp; .</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As in the title, it freezes after 2-3 minutes whether you log in or not, safe mode works (except&nbsp;once when it freezed after long time), diagnostic mode of msconfig works for a little while more then normal, but anyway freezes.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to disable many drivers, for instance:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ati radeon hd 4200 that I've seen freezes are often due to (once I tried also to delete its drivers).</div>
<div>ati hdmi audio</div>
<div>realtek high definition audio</div>
<div>all the USB</div>
<div>atheros ar9285 wireless network adapter</div>
<div>realtek PCIe GBE family controller</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>despite this it's still freezing</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>during booting in safe mode it happens that it takes an unusual long time while&nbsp;displaying atipcie.sys&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>By&nbsp;cleaner I've already clean the registry and brought disable most of the start up programs.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really don't know where to look for. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<p>You are doing things which will not help resolve your problems and in&nbsp;many cases will make the situation far worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"tried to disable many drivers". Don't do it! You will stop devices working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Ati radeon hd 4200 that I've seen freezes are often due to (once I tried also to delete its drivers)." You should not delete drivers, especially those relating to graphics. If you succeed you will not see anything on your monitor and as a result not be
 able fix anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"clean the registry" Totally unnecessary and&nbsp;capable of creating insoluble &nbsp;system errors that can only be fixed by reinstalling Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"disable most of the start up programs".&nbsp;Not a smart idea if you want a working computer. You need a good reason to disable a start up item.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will now try to help you undo the damage and solve your original problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Click on the Start button and select Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Services. Locate Windows&nbsp;Management Instrumentation in the list. Check that it has started and that the StartUp type is Automatic. If it is not set to Automatic
 right click and select Properties, General tab. There is a box after StartUp type. The options are available on a drop down by clicking on the arrow down to the right of the box. Make the change and click on Apply and OK. Restart the computer and check whether
 it has started.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Please let me know when you have completed this task.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font>The next time you encounter&nbsp; a freeze select Ctrl+Shift+Esc to bring up Task Manager and click on the Applications tab. Place the cursor on a running application to select it and click on the End Task button. As the application is removed
 from the list repeat the procedure on the next application in the list until all are gone from the list.&nbsp;You may need to be patient as a freezes in this situation means that your computer is trying to carry out too many tasks at one time and it takes time
 for Task Manager to be able to intervenue and end the task causing the freeze. Pressing the Power button can seriously damage files on your computer as the files can corrupt and cease to be usable.</font></font></span></p>

            Funny how many wrong things are possible to be done.
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, when I said that it freezes means completely, no any combination of keys works. They only solution it's to force it by keeping the off button pushed.&nbsp;</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most situations that is not true. Desktop computers often have a reset button, which is less likely to damage the system if used instead of the Power On / Off button. I have not noticed this option on a laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you changed the setting for the <font color="#000000">Windows Management Instrumentation as I suggested? If so please upload your System Information file and fresh copies of your Event Viewer logs.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type System Information in the Search Box above the start Button and press the ENTER key. Select File, Export and give the file a name noting where it is
 located. Please upload to your Sky Drive, share with everyone and post a link here.
</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font>Please upload and share with everyone copies of your System and Application logs from your Event Viewer to your Sky Drive
 and post a link here.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font>To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of
 the window select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, select Action from the Menu and Save All Events as and give the file a name. Do the same for the Applications log.</font></span></p>

<div>I don't have any key for restarting, just off-on and assist. Unfortunately "assist" is not that useful as the person who named it, though it would have been.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All these wrong things I have done were find on forums like this, I'm sorry to know that I can't trust every&nbsp;unknown&nbsp;person on the internet.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you so much for your help, I really hope Microsoft pays you more then the web designer who design sky drive grafic.</div>
