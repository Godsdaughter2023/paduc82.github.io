<p>Hi Gabriel - It sounds like in addition to using Outlook on your HTC HD2 that you're also using Outlook on your personal computer. Do you have your subfolders set up under your server-side Mailbox (such that they appear below your Inbox and Outbook at the
 same folder level (same hierarchical level) or as personal subfolders (saved at the root level of our Mailbox, as the same hierachical level as your Archive Folders)? If you have your subfolders setup on the server-side Mailbox subfolder level they should
 appear on your device too. If you subfolder is at the root level then you only are able to access these on your personal computer.&nbsp; Here are some additional Outlook tips:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/help/v6-5/Sync-Microsoft-Outlook-touch.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/help/v6-5/Sync-Microsoft-Outlook-touch.aspx</a>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Onenote for Mac will not display certain PDF&#39;s embedded in pages</h2>
                    <p>I have multiple notebooks setup on Onedrive. I access them through Onenote for Mac v15.35.1 and through Onenote for iPad (latest version). Certain pages have PDF files inserted in them. They display fine on the iPad and the web version of Onenote but on
 the Mac version I get a " X We couldn't open this page" message. Happens across multiple notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I closed the affected notebooks on Mac, cleared the contents of com.microsoft.onenote.mac in ~\Library\Containers. And then reloaded the notebooks but the problem persists.&nbsp; I tried moving those pages to new sections too but had no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Onenote on Mac is saying it is unable to sync those sections within those notebooks with an error 0xE00012CF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this problem for around 15 pages across three notebooks and am looking for a fix. Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Hi Garry,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To investigate your problem, we’d like to confirm some information with you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. How did you insert the PDF file? If you insert the PDF files from OneNote for Windows, will the PDF files able to display in OneNote for Mac?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Please provide the screenshot of the “We couldn't open this page” error message.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile, you can try clearing OneNote cache then check whether you can open the notebook.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. </span></span><span><span><span>Find and delete the folder in <strong>
~/Library/Group\ Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Open “<strong>Keychain Access</strong>” app on your mac, and search for “<strong>MicrosoftOffice</strong>”. If OneNote recognize that you signed in, you will have an entry with a long name. Delete it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Restart your Mac.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Try launching OneNote and signing in again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards,</span></span></p>

<h2>            Some help required for billing problems </h2>
                    
<p>First of I appreciate this may not be the correct place for this post but I've wasted hours trying to find the right place and Microsoft isn't making it easy for me.</p>
<p>Secondly I'll give you a little bit of background which gives you the necessary context to understand my problem; I'm originally from Scotland but have been living in Germany for about 3 years now. My Live ID was originally created when I was in the UK but
 when I moved here I moved here I updated my location to Germany. While I was in the UK I paid for services such as OneCare and XBox live so I have UK based billing information associated with my ID.</p>
<p>Last month when WP7 was launched in Germany I purchased a HD7 and linked my Live ID to it and things were fine "purchasing" free applications. However when I purchased a non free app I started encountering problems. Although the purchase went through no
 problem I received an email informing me that my credit card had expired and the were not able to process the payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is were I hit the wall; when I try to add a new credit card it only lets me add a credit card with a UK address. I have a UK credit
 card in GBP and a German credit card in Euros, however both of them have my address in Germany as my billing address.</p>
<p>It has been painful trying to resolve this as I just get bounced from one site to another. You would think a company as big as Microsoft would make it a bit easier for you to give them money.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Would this suggestion be a possible solution to your challenge? , create a new Windows Live ID with the appropriate region and then create a new Zune account. Changing the region of your existing Windows Live ID will not correct the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create a new Windows Live ID and Zune account at&nbsp; <a href="https://live.zune.net/account/accountmgmthome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Looking into that, it really is a disaster. Can you imagine any shop that would stay in&nbsp;business&nbsp;if they made it so difficult for a customer to pay by credit card?

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>it has actually little to do with Microsoft and a lot with European Law and regulations regarding the distribution of media content. Especially in Germany where GEMA wants a part of the pie. I have a similar problem as you. I am an American and work currently
 in Ireland and I am fighting similar condition, but it is not Microsoft but the regulations put in place by the EU countries. It is not business men who make the decissions but lawyers.</p>

<p>I appreciate that lawyers are VERY good at making themselves wealthy whilst making our lives more difficult, and that these laws are largely to blame for the problem, however the two of us are not alone, people move countries and live in countries where
 they would prefer to get content different from the primary language of that country. Microsoft is a global company and as a .NET architect I'm well aware that it understands globalisation and localisation as .NET provides good support for this, its VERY sad
 when they don't support this through their websites though. In my case its really not that complicated I live in Germany but want my content and interfaces in English. I have UK &amp; German credit cards but both have a billing address in Germany. The billing
 site lets me change address but not country. That is a flaw in the billing site, I can appreciate the root of the problem but it doesn't stop it from being a deficiency in the site. If the site cannot handle this automatically then I should be able to speak
 to someone to rectify the problem. I'm attempting to pay for goods that I have already received and have the ability to purchase other items Microsoft should be making this easy for me especially when WP7 is so under so much&nbsp;scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its also worth remembering that if someone as computer literate as I am is struggling here think about other potential Microsoft customers who aren't so literate.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Firstly forget trying to resolve it yourself. Microsoft like to do things regarding billing on the telephone, for security reasons. Call 0800 587 1102 (uk number)</p>
<p>I had problems purchasing apps when I first got my phone, but for other reasons (my Credit card had been previously cancelled). I couldn't reolve it through my account, so I phoned XBOX Live support (as the credit card details are stored in my Live account).</p>
<p>They sorted it all out in 5 mins, so try ringing them up if you are having billing problems. My account was blocked, so the only way to get it re-instated was to call them.</p>
<p>It's pretty painless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried doing as you suggested and called the UK support line (+44 20 7365 9792 for those outside the UK) and I was informed that the system would not let them add a credit card with a billing address outside of the UK be added to the system. They told me
 my only option was to create a zune tag with a German locale and add a credit card there.</p>
<p>Despite my instincts to just walk away, I have done that so now I have two separate zune tag's and each linked to their own Live ID. I have added the second account to my WP7. What next????? Do I have to now link my two Live IDs? Spend another 20 minutes
 calling support in Ireland? Speak secret incantations while standing on one leg????? &nbsp;Even if I do link my accounts how do I get the marketplace to bill me on my German Zune Tag but associate my achievements and everything else against my primary Live ID.
 Really guys this is a suck-fest!!!! Do I loose all my achievements and history just because you guys didn't consider the possibility that people might want to move from one country to another and remain a customer. Everything tells me as a customer and a software
 architect that it should be you guys that fix this and not asking me to jump through another hoop for you. WP7 is a high profile platform for MS you need to get these things sorted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still no help from Microsoft on here for my problem so I thought I'd see if I could buy an app on my new German Zune Tag. First off when I tried to sign into Zune with my German tag it complained that my locale was set to being the UK so I&nbsp;dutifully&nbsp;changed
 it to Germany then tried to purchase my app it told me that I couldn't because my ID associated with my phone is from a different local.</p>
<p>Nice REALLY nice!</p>
<p>Come on guys how difficult is it for you guys to let me switch the local for my original ID to being in Germany. And for gods sake learn to separate local, from language. This is REALLY&nbsp;embarrassing!</p>

I had a similar problem with my shiny new WP7 device.  I study in the UK but my home address and hence CC details are linked to Denmark.  My first live account is screwed, but since the common way to fix this is to create a new live ID. I did but since I was in the UK when I created it, it automatically used UK as my billing country even though in my live account I chose Denmark! 


I thought, maybe I can use XBOX Live points to buy games for WP7, so I found somewhere online and bought Live points but I figured out you cannot use these points for WP7 marketplace.  It is really incredibly how much time I have wasted trying to figure out how to give Microsoft my money to pay for games/apps I want for my phone.  WP7 is a brand new platform and Microsoft really should be doing everything they can to make it easy for customers to support this platform.  ****, let us use paypal, sure they'll take a cut but at least Microsoft will still gain revenue.

<h2>            Citations manager and footnotes do not display correctly.</h2>
                    
<p>I have entered all information regarding an author in the Citations manager.&nbsp; When I want to use that information as a footnote or an end note it will not display properly as a foot or end note.&nbsp; Only a portion of the bibliographic information is displayed
 but I have selected Turabian as the style to display.&nbsp; There should be more information in the footnote but the way it actually displays is like; (Lewis 1942),</p>
<p>It does not display page numbers not any other information.&nbsp; Is there something that I need to change in my Word settings to correct this.</p>

<p>The citation and bibliography tool in Word 2007 and Word 2010 does not do footnote citations, it only does in-text citations. Only
<em>Word 2008 for Mac</em> supports footnote citations for some mysterious reason. And even those are limited in functionality (no ibid for example).</p>
<p>If you have xslt knowledge, you could write the style from scratch, but the process is long and complicated. In theory, you could hunt down the Word 2008 version of the style and adapt that one to speed up the process. If you feel up to the task, leave a
 follow-up message and I'll provide you with some pointers.</p>

<h2>            Query users without pictures in Exchange</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need to query all users that do not have pictures in exchange. We want to upload the badge pictures only to those that haven't put a picture up yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Powershell or export would be the best solution for us as we have thousands of users.</p>

<p>Hi Heloisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your request, I have done many researches and tested on my side, there is a script you can use to achieve your need, please check below for detailed information:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a>.(Right-click PowerShell to <strong>Run as administrator</strong>)</p>
<p>2. Type following script in PowerShell.</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; $Result=@()</p>
<p>$allUsers = Get-Mailbox -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox -ResultSize Unlimited</p>
<p>$totalusers = $allUsers.Count</p>
<p>$i = 1&nbsp;</p>
<p>$allUsers | ForEach-Object {</p>
<p>$user = $_</p>
<p>Write-Progress -activity "Processing $user" -status "$i out of $totalusers completed"</p>
<p>$photoObj = Get-Userphoto -identity $user.UserPrincipalName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue</p>
<p>If($photoObj.PictureData -eq $null)&nbsp;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>$Result += New-Object PSObject -property @{&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Sync of Tasks and iCal reminders is incomplete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a-d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync of Tasks and iCal reminders is incomplete</h2>
                    Due to the problems with calendar syncing I tend to use iCal as my primary calendar which syncs well with Google calendar which in turn syncs with Outlook at work.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However Outlook tasks is great so I prefer to use that for tasks on my home Mac. It does appear to sync with iCal via sync services (and therefore potentially with iCloud). However there are often errors concerning the due dates of tasks and incomplete
 syncing of tasks each way. For example if I update a due date in Outlook it does not update the iCal Reminder. Any ideas why? I am not using an Exchange server at home.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Syncing issues are a pain with all services but in general Google has done well with Calendars. I wish MS would prioritise these issues with Outlook.</div>

    <title>Build 10159 - not going so well - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordontwatts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 10159 - not going so well</h2>
                    <p>This is just a short summary... we are getting close to release, but this feels like it has a long way to go before it "sings"... I should note that all my machines are upgrades, I've never done a clean install, so I might be paying for that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a surface pro 2, used only as a desktop machine:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Edge crashes quite often - this is probably the least stable build of it I've encountered (I'd say a crash every 20 minutes with an average of 10 tabs open).</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Bringing up the settings app requires an extra click or to - as if it doesn't grab focus as fast as it should</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Getting the insider app installed from apps &amp; features - it is buried. This just feels like quick and dirty UI work, which, I'm afraid, I get a general impression of for Win 10... it is as if all the basics are there, but there is a lot of polish required.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - I can't set background images for my desktop. I can set colors. No error, just when I click on a possible image nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - The action center isn't very useful because it gets overwhelmed with email arrival messages. On facebook, if someone is posting too much there is a drop down that will let you "block" them. It would be nice if that was right there in the action center.
 Also, for emails, I want back my list of favorites (as it is with MS Band and also Win 8.1 email) so I can only be notified when one of them sends me something. Or perhaps an option to only show the 10 most recent from an email account.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - The @*#&amp;@^^@! 5/14/2015 firmware update keeps showing up. Trying to install it causes, of course, a reboot, and when you have 4 desktops full of windows... so now I just leave it there, and ignore the "couldn't install updates" message, which is, of
 course, a security risk because I'm effectively ignoring the auto-update part of the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a Dell Venue Pro 8:</p>
<p>&nbsp; - I removed the old Skype and installed the new one. On a machine with no keyboard or mouse the experience was pretty awful... the firewall dialog comes up&nbsp;- imagine trying to press that with your finger - it was like a spot out of a comedy show. During
 the setup it tried to show my image from the dell camera which caused a BSOD (the camera doesn't work yet in win10 on the dell as far as I can tell). Reboot, took almost 8 minutes from password till start menu came up.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Start menu doesn't have a nice "download" icon on it the way it does for Win8.1 letting you know what hasn't downloaded yet... or marching ants to let you know it is queued up. Now it takes you to the store. When you click on an uninstalled app, nothing
 happens for about 15 seconds, then the store starts up. That 15 second wait made me press the app icon more than once... which caused something funny to happen and the store crashed.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - I do have a bad internet connection, but not so bad... the store was stuck downloading about 10 apps. Just hung (looking at the download page). Reboot caused them to start downloading again.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - After reboot, one app showed that it was partially downloaded (looking at the progress bar), but it claimed that it was 0.0 of 11.8 MB downloaded. The progress bar was correct, and the number updated to the proper number as soon as some data trickled
 in. This is another example of a small bit of UI x-checking.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - After Kindle installed, when I started it I got an app error, and it led me to the store and said "please reinstall". Clicking "reinstall" caused the store to crash.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - One of the apps still queued to install was the "get started" app... I would have thought that should be (artificially) prioritized.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - The first time I tapped the button on the full start screen to show all apps, it took almost 5 seconds. I don't have that many installed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I've not had a chance to play with this much (as you can tell). But this is a worse experience in general that previous builds. And considering we have about a month to go makes me nervous. Given how hard this has been pushed, a lot of people are going
 to install it on day 1, and while I use Windows heavily, I don't explore many of its edge cases, so I can only imagine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Cheers, Gordon.</p>

    <title>Outlook rule running on a folder doesn&#39;t forward all emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simon smethurst-mcintyre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook rule running on a folder doesn&#39;t forward all emails</h2>
                    <p>We have a rule setup that we run on the contents of a folder. This rule forwards the email to an external address then moves it to another folder inside the inbox, then marks it as read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're increasingly seeing that the rule works for the first 10 to 20 emails (the number is seemingly random), and successfully forwards the email (the outgoing email going into the sent items), moves it to the folder and marks it as read. For the remaining
 emails it moves them to the folder and marks it as read but doesn't actually forward them. They aren't received into the external account and the sent email doesn't appear in the sent items, ie it doesn't carry out all of the actions in the rule (particularly
 the most important one of forwarding the email).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all on Outlook 2013 on windows 8.1, &nbsp;running on Office 365 and is beginning to drive us a bit mad, any help would be much appreciated.</p>

If you are using Word XP or later, the “Add-in to Merge Letters to Separate Files” that I have written and that can be downloaded from that site will allow you to create each letter as a separate file with a filename taken from a field in the data source with
 a minimum of fuss.</p>

            There is nothing wrong with the add-in on my web site as thousands of satisfied users will confirm. Symantec flags the download because it contains macros - which is rather the point of the add-in. The AV product has no way to establish whether a macro
 is benign or harmful.<br />
<br />
Also the macro examples will work with later Word versions - see <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Hi,<br />
<br />
I can attest that the Add-Ins on Graham Mayor's site are both useful and not dangerous. They do contain macros. If Symantec will not allow downloads from Graham's site, they won't allow Doug's tools either.<br />
<br />
Here are two more links for you in your search for a solution without downloading documents or templates containing code. (I do not know how to do what you want other than by using the tools offered by Graham and Doug, though, because I have not given this
 the attention they have.)<br />

            The addition of the banner&nbsp;was an intentional action of our IT.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can not believe this is a best practice so I asking the community if they have seen this implemented this way before. &nbsp;PS: If you pass your cursor over the text it will change color so
 you can read it.

<h2>            Displaying contents of cells which contain multiple lines of text separated by &#39;Alt-Enter&#39;</h2>
                    <p>I have a text-only worksheet which includes cells with lists of text items separated by 'alt-enter'.&nbsp; The example below is a list of filenames, but there are other lists of academic references, and such-like:</p>
<p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>If there are no more than four items, they display correctly (provided, of course, that the cell height and width are adequate).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if there are more than four, Excel insists on displaying the list as '#############################'.&nbsp; Attempting to print the cell, or copy and paste into WORD or Notepad also appear as '#########'. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>How can I get Excel to display (and print, copy, etc) the full list?</p>

<h2>            Zoom problem in Edge Build 10547</h2>
                    I'm suffering from a weird problem in Microsoft Edge... The page zoom is automatically set to 135% by default...&nbsp; When I reduce the zoom to 100%, it works for a certain time... But if I open a new tab, go to a new webpage, reload my page, it is set again
 to 135%... It's very irritating while banking, reading etc. Please give&nbsp;a solution for this problem ASAP... FYI, I'm using Build 10547...

            Are you using mouse or touch panel? I had the&nbsp;&nbsp;same problem being unable to fix the required zoom value for new tabs. But then I stopped the touch panel and now I use only mouse.

<h2>            Nokia N8 - Code error with lock code</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a lock code on my phone but for some reason when turning it on the other day it doesn't accept my code anymore. It comes up with "Code Error". I am definitely putting it in correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no way I changed it / forgot it.</p>
<p>There is no way that anyone else could have changed my code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried a master reset (holding down on button for 8 seconds) but it still doesn't work. I'm feeling the only other option would be the hard reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else had this problem? Also will a hard reset mean that I lose all my contacts, music, photos, apps etc...?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many Thanks,</p>

<p>If nothing works.. the ONLY solution that remains is to visit Nokia Care along with the proof of ownership (Bill / Invoice) and get the code reset to the default 12345..</p>
<p>In absense of back-up..you tend to lose your important data...</p>

    <title>SHA1 weak security configuration when logging in to sharepoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curtchapman- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            SHA1 weak security configuration when logging in to sharepoint</h2>
                    
<p>Recently users in my organization have started noticing that when accessing sharepoint using Google Chrome that they are getting a warning as follows:</p>
<p>"<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">The identity of this website has been verified... No Certificate Transparency information was supplied by server... The certificate for this site expires in 2017 or later, and the certificate chain contains a certificate
 signed using SHA-1</span></strong>"</p>
<p>if they try to log in using Mozilla Firefox they get the following:</p>
<p>"<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">You have asked Firefox to connect securely to sharepoint.com but we can't confirm that your connection is secure.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">"</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We have also seen apple IOS devices throwing an alert that the site is not trusted</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Internet Explorer (V11) does not error at all and allows users to go right in to sharepoint. Since the certificate in question is apparently the *.sharepoint.com certificate which we do not control and could not replace I'm wondering
 what we do about this? It appears the certificate was renewed recently on 11/19/2015 and expires same day in 2017. Why would Microsoft obtain a certificate in SHA1 knowing that this algorithm is being deprecated and has weak encryption? Is Microsoft in the
 process of replacing these certificates any time soon?<br />
</span></p>

<p>Hi, my company have 1 enterprise network and want to merge the other basic network used by our staffs in other areas who use other email domain. I searched for it and find that we do the network migration, but we cannot find that option in our "network setting".
 Could you please help us to do the network migration? Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Cannot change system language in version 10547</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I was able to change the system language into English UK in version 10523. However, once I updated to 10547, although I changed the location and format into UK, it still displays Chinese. The Windows Display Language says it cannot use any language package
 or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do to change the system language to UK English?</p>

<h2>            Nokia N8 text message problem</h2>
                    Hi guys... Hope this is the right section for this post.<br />
<br />
Im having a problem with my text messaging... Sometimes when i receive a new text message and then read it, the unread message icon still shows in my conversations list. (the list of conversations from various contacts). I cannot get the icon to disappear unless
 i delete the text message thats marked as unread in the conversation it is in. I have tried rebooting the phone with the "long press" method and also reading the same message over and over and still wont go unless i delete the message. Some of the more recent
 messages will mark as read but the odd one stays as unread until i delete it. Can anyone help at all? Has anyone else experienced this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks Nick.

<p>This had happened to me, but not in the same manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading the message the Unread icon is still visible.</p>
<p>So i read that message again after closing.</p>
<p>that solved my problem.</p>
<p>Deleting the message also works (but we can't delete all the msg we receive)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens only sometimes, not always.</p>
<p>You can Try backuping you data &amp; try a hard reset.</p>
<p>that might help.</p>

            thanks for your reply... i have tried reading the messages several times over but still not had any luck. Ive also tried a hard reset and re-installed the firmware but still no difference. If anyone has any suggestions i would be grateful. :)

<p>Hi Munki84,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have re-installed the firmware and performed a hard reset and the problem is still occurring, it seems you have exhausted your options. Did you restore a backup made in Nokia Suite to the phone again? Because there may have been some applications
 contained within the backup, that were causing the messaging conflict in the first place, and restoring the backup to the phone also would restore this conflict. I would suggest a clean restore if you have not already done so. If you have done all of this,
 it is advised to visit your local Nokia Care centre to notify them of the problems you have been having and they will be able to further assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
