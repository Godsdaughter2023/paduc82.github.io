<h2>            Microsoft camera codec pack not working</h2>
                    Built a new computer and I'm running W7 sp 1 64bit Swedish version&nbsp;on it. But the camera codec pack isn't working. It worked fine on my old computer. First I installed the Sony raw pack but it din't work and after that I installed the 64 bit version of
 the Micrsosft pack but it didn't work either. Don't know what to do.

<h2>            Windows 10 Very Unstable</h2>
                    <p>Every since I upgraded to 10 from 7 my Dell Inspiron has been completely unstable nothing works correctly I restart will work for a few minutes then everything starts freezing or stops working. I had a reliability score of 10 and now in the last few days
 I am less then 1! I take excellent care of my PC it is a few years old however up until I installed windows 10 its run better then it did when I got it and also run better then any newer PC I have tried this is very disappointing since I loved it with 7 the
 only reason I even upgraded was so I could keep up with the time since 10 is supposed to be last one I should ever need. I&nbsp;according to&nbsp;the windows upgrade&nbsp;all my software was compatible with 10 but my Norton 360 will not work even though I upgraded&nbsp;it before
 I upgraded 10 don't give my&nbsp;stuff about Microsoft's security because I've used Norton since the beginning and will until the end no Norton is a deal breaker for me also all browsers freeze apps from 10 that I don't even use freeze everything freezes when it&nbsp;does
 work its slower then a 30 year&nbsp;old computer.&nbsp;So far I hate no despise 10 and will probably go back to 7 with a clean wipe and install which I'm very upset about because of all the lies&nbsp;I've heard about 10 and the trouble&nbsp;its caused me. I really want to like
 it but its been impossible I hate the fact that I probably will not be able to use it so I am giving Microsoft one chance to fix&nbsp;it and that's it if no success it gone with all of the privacy issues stripped away they should have at least made&nbsp;sure it was
 worth it honestly if&nbsp;I cant get it fixed&nbsp;next pc&nbsp;of anything I buy will have nothing to do with Microsoft&nbsp;that's for sure.&nbsp;</p>

            Can't download the file or get an error when it tries to install?<br />
<br />
The solution is there at the bottom of the page that Bill Smithers gave you. It involves using the .NET Framework Cleanup Tool.
<br />
<br />
Here, I will give it to you in an easy step by step procedure...<br />
<br />
First try this...<br />
Download and run <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=246062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft .NET Framework Repair Tool</a> then visit Windows Update and let it try to reinstall the updates. Once it's done, scan again with Windows Update to make sure they installed correctly.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't solve it try this...<br />
<br />
Uninstall .NET Framework 1.1. Then download the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.NET Framework Cleanup Tool </strong></a><br />
From the drop-down box, select 1.1 and clean.<br />
Reinstall <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
.NET Framework 1.1</a><br />
Download and install .<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1</a><br />
Visit Windows Update or Microsoft Update and let it install the rest of the 1.1 updates including
<span>KB2833941.<br />
</span><br />
<br />
Let me know which method worked for you.<br />
<br />

            Hi Marcel,
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App - Notifications and Actions
<br />
<br />Disable all notifications from all apps
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />Check your CPU usage by that process . .. 
<br />
<br />Turn on those notifications one by one to find the one that is causing this CPU usage

<p>The problem has gone!<br />
</p>
<p>I've decided to roll back the update. But the problem remained after the uninstall.<br />
Then applied again the same update Windows Update. I don't know why, but this action resolved the situation for now as I restarted the computer.</p>

<p>hi guys, not sure how to place my question to the forum so sorry if this is the not proper way, then pls help! I've just signed up for the XboxLive via computer and all is allright; however cannot signin from my console; think that the Xbox360 wireless networking
 adapter on the console is not able to access my wireless internet connection because it is protected and it required a security password, is that the case? I also see that the adapter lights on a red indicator which I'm not sure what it means, I's suppose
 it should lighten a green light? Pls help, much thanks, JohnPeter ("JP")</p>

<p>Hi Everyone, I have a wireless N adapter. Its a few years old. Yesterday, It started to keep disconecting me from xbox live. As soon as I would log into espn or netflix I would be disconnected. I contacted support through chat. I was instructed to cycle
 my router. Then clear the cache on the console and restart after unpluging and plugging in all accessores (20 seconds). The problem still happened. I have tried all different usb ports. I was then told that the problem was definately an NAT issue and to contact
 my isp provider. I did that and I was instructed to go into my router and open these ports for the xbox to work. I did that and it still will not work. Then the last time I was disconnected to xbox live I just got frustrated and turned off the console but
 I noticed that the wireless adapter was still on and it was flashing. I thought once the power supply was off all accessories would turn off too. Anyway this morning I tried it in a different spot "again" and I noticed that the green light didn't even come
 on. So, I put it in another spot it came on I connected to xbox live and it worked for like 3 minutes and discconnected again. I turned off the console and now the green light on the wiressless adapter is flashing like i mentioned earlier. HELP!! whats going
 on. Is this product dead???</p>

<p>my Wireless N has stopped working. I logged out of my wifi network and tried to relog back in to test the connection and it won't test. It just loads for a long, long time.</p>
<p>The light blinks green.</p>
<p>Plugging into other USB ports did not work.</p>

<br />Since you didn't post the error message, if you are a Quickbooks subscriber you'll probably get more tailored service if you contact their Support.  
<br />
<br />If not then please report back the error text and number.

            Hi Sam
<br />
<br />Most discussions in the Intuit community regarding QuickBooks compatibility with Windows 10, say versions 2016 and earlier are not certified compatible. Users need to upgrade to at least QuickBooks 2017 or later, preferrably the new QuickBooks 2019. 
<br />
<br />Here is a discussion about it:

<h2>            Headphones randomly change noise cancellation value</h2>
                    <p>Hi:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received my headphones Friday and have just started using them in the office today. Randomly the headphone noise cancellation value changes from maximum to something less (around 75%) without any intervention from me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it happens I can adjust the left ear control and reach maximum again. In the Cortana Device Setup app I can also see this setting change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens when paired with a Windows 10 PC over both Bluetooth or USB. It seems more frequent over Bluetooth. The headphones were 90% charged when this was happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess it's not the end of the world but these things were <strong>$350</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kyle</p>

<p>Hi KyleReed2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, does this happen when you are in an area with loud background noise? If it does, this can happen in environments where loud noises occur. There are some fast-transient noises that can’t be filtered out by active noise cancellation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but in that case the noise cancelation will return to the previous set value after a very short time.&nbsp; The behavior where it permanently drops until you readjust it is not expected.&nbsp; I would try resetting your headphones back to factory settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4470092</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not resolve the issue then I would either go back to where you purchased the headphones or contact Surface support to exchange the headphones.</p>

    <title>After Clean Install Windows 10 still freezing and disconnecting from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eriogonum  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Clean Install Windows 10 still freezing and disconnecting from wifi</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7, and found that my computer was freezing--mouse frozen, screen freezing, and internet periodically disconnecting.&nbsp; I read about others having problems, and recommendations for doing a clean install from Windows 7.&nbsp;
 I found directions for how to do a clean install from a USB flashdrive, and created the tool, saved all my files, and did the clean install of Windows 10 last weekend. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem isn't solved.&nbsp; My computer still freezes periodically.&nbsp; The mouse will just freeze, or the mouse can move but the computer doesn't respond to the mouse.&nbsp; If I wait a few minutes, it will come back, but this is a slow way to work, and I lose precious
 time.&nbsp; Also, I notice that periodically my computer disconnects from the wifi, and I have to reconnect.&nbsp; None of these things ever happened with Windows 7, and it was much faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't go back now that I've done the clean install. Also I need Windows 10 because it is compatible with the Arc GIS software I need to use to finish my Masters degree.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran System File Checker, per the instructions on another thread, typing in sfc/scannow.&nbsp; Nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My pc is a lenovo thinkpad, and I'm running Windows Pro version 1511.&nbsp; Please tell me what I need to do to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to boot the system in <span>Clean boot</span> state and check if the issue still persist.

            <p>Well, I had problems in 2016, which seriously affected my masters study and two brand new computers later, complete check from my university IT department and (eventually) sending by the second new computer to the providers for a thorough check, I am still
 losing a lot of time due to constant freezing and having to restart my computer.<br />
<br />
I KNOW it is Windows 10, as on an older computer I got back out, so that I could continue my uni work, these type of freezing problems don't occur (there are a lot of scripts running on that one, but the problems are different and it is understandable - but
 on this new pc, it should not be happening).<br />
<br />
I hate Windows 10 and wish it did not come as standard on new PCS...at my wits end, really, as next year gets tougher and with disabilities, I need a reliable computer I can use from my home when I am ill...<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions? Or should I take the little money I have and buy a Mac?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>

    <title>Xbox one unjust Reputation System - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> empress chinchilla  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one unjust Reputation System</h2>
                    
<p>I am posting to share my experience and express my concern over the xbox ones reputation system, I have been with Microsoft for almost 9 years on this profile and have owned a XBone for almost a year now, the rep system was not an issue until one month out
 of the blue I was not able to join online matches, this came without warning to me and after researching the rep system a little more it made no sense that I would be afflicted by this, the first few months on xbox one I only played Gears 3, destiny and exo
 zombies it was not until I decided to grind the remainder of master prestige on AW that my rep started to drop, it is also important to state I have never owned a headset nor will I ever use one, not to be rude to the online community but I don't play games
 to chat or meet new people I'm an average&nbsp;gamer of moderate skill and don't care to socialize online I play just for fun and challenge so after getting into avoid me status it was nearly impossible to get out of what I don't get is I have never replied to
 any messages and if they are vulgar or threating I report and block, I certainly don't cheat and I have literally never had a verbal or texting&nbsp;moment negative or other wise over the XBL service so its appalling that some one who has been respectful in all
 aspects would suffer even a needs work status many issues regarding this new rep system I can say with absolute certainly despite Microsoft's claims is prone to abuse, My theory is this many players are sore losers and on popular games like COD GEARS HALO&nbsp;you
 are more likely&nbsp;to cross these players&nbsp;an automated rep system simply cant discern an angry player from a legitimate complaint&nbsp;so when you do well&nbsp;and&nbsp;a player gets upset and reports you unless they report every one every time they lose or say report someone
 for voice when they don't have a headset then as far as the rep system is concerned its legitimate feedback as long as you finished a match with them and most sore players will instinctively report for cheating or unsporting, my rep currently has 68 complaints
 for unsporting 11 for cheating 27 for voice rest are 0 so based on my rep one would think I'm a hacking vulgar troll which is not at all true.&nbsp;At this point I fell unwelcome and forced to stop playing games I enjoy, its not fare for good players to be forced
 offline because of an imperfect rep system, in theory is a good idea but unless they can task policy enforcement with reviewing complaints and manually adjusting rep based on evidence then this system will punish trolls grievers legitimate&nbsp;and good players
 alike and this is not a good business practice at all.</p>

<p>I believe it can be exploited. Whether or not it actually can be doesn't matter to me. I think they should scrap it. I don't see how it can't be exploited.</p>
<p>I had someone quit early on me in a match of MK and they then submitted a complaint on me saying I quit early lol. That was back in the 360 days.

<p>The rep system on the 360 was pretty useless.Your stars would go up faster by getting negative feedback.</p>
<p>The rep system on the xbox One is completely different &amp; works just fine.</p>

<p>I don't think the rep system can be abused by spamming complaints or deliberately trying to get someone banned systems like this very are smart and can catch on to players shenanigans but when you finish games constantly and grind multiplayer many people
 in my opinion will fell they have to complain and report the people that don't meet their standards which can be you weren't skilled enough or you were to skilled or you just got lucky or camped, sniped, or tubed or they honestly believed you were cheating
 these are not valid reasons for a complaint but will impact your feedback score. To be honest the rep system reminds me of steams VAC system when it was first introduced years ago and it has had a run of false positives, I don't think the rep system should
 be scraped though in my opinion I fell they should task policy enforcement with making the decision to place players on avoid me and require some sort of evidence considering its an off shoot of a temp ban. The rep system is supposed to punish those with low
 impulse control no social filter, trolls, vulgar, threatening, obscene or just otherwise abrasive players so nothing stings more than a reputable player being inadvertently treated as such. In the years to come I fell they will work the bugs out but meanwhile
 its as I said an automated system cant discern an angry player from a legitimate complaint.</p>

<p>I think it's pretty telling that I have directed people to the following thread to go through this process and they have gotten their avoid me status overturned:
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4268/t/1841672.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../1841672.aspx</a> </p>
<p>Also, I have friends on Xbox that I have played a lot with so I'm almost positive they do nothing, but consistently be good at the multiplayer modes they play and they're in avoid me due to the amount of people who can't handle losing or people just being
 that much better than them.</p>
<p>What was great was a disclaimer I read about a certain online game (can't remember which one) and it said that some players you will come across have years of experience in PvP and it will appear as if they have near god like reflexes that seem impossible
 to the casual gamer. I think that holds a lot of weight and more games should highlight the fact that although there are cheaters, some people are actually just that good!</p>

<p>Hello (GamerTag Omitted)</p>
<p>An account reputation is a representation of how that account’s actions are being perceived by others of the community. This account has a history of suspensions reaching all the way back to 2008. This means that this account has been being used to violate
 the Code of Conduct for several years. This account is probably having trouble with its reputation because it has continued to abuse others on the service and is currently under a communication suspension.</p>
<p>Healing your reputation is not an overnight process. This account will need to spend time online and playing without accruing more negative feedback.</p>
<p>Some other behaviors to avoid:</p>
<p>- Utilizing unauthorized hardware/software/account modifications to gain an advantage or disrupt the competitive landscape of Xbox Live</p>
<p>- Exploiting game vulnerabilities or glitches to gain an unfair competitive advantage</p>
<p>- Killing your teammates, quitting early, griefing/trolling other players, or not exhibiting good sportsmanship</p>
<p>Since your reputation is currently in the “Avoid Me” status, you’ll most likely be matched with other low reputation players, and you’ll begin to lose privileges like being able to broadcast your gameplay using Twitch.</p>
<p>To view your current reputation, see feedback filed by you, and see feedback you’ve received, please visit:

<p>Common ways of getting bad rep is quitting early and being unsporting. But more mature people should be more understanding to younger peeps. For instance, if you play Minecraft, or Forza Horizon 2 (or 3 when it comes out) or Forza 6 Playground multiplayer
 like tag/virus/etc or Rocket League, expect immature young peeps and ramming. Ramming is completely permitted and expected in these games from the game developers themselves. If the game developers didn't allow/want this natural behaviour, they wouldn't have
 fashioned their game like that. Then some grump comes online and complains about those things. However Reporting for like hacking, swearing, should be separate from Rep and is definitely against the Xbox rules and can be judged more severely.</p>
<p>As put by the 360 system:</p>
<p>"Player reviews should be used for preference online and not for Code of Conduct violations. If a player violates the Code of Conduct, consider filing a complaint" "If the player has not violated the Code of Conduct, consider submitting a player review instead"
 "Complaints do not affect matchmaking or the player's reputation".</p>
<p>I think the system could be exploited. 21st century technology is not perfect. Why do you think Microsoft has to keep on regularly updating it? That goes for Windows OS too. But I'm sure they do their best. There are people out their with nothing better
 to do with their life and hack and exploit when people go online. Some of them are experts at it too. It does seem that unlike Xbox 360's Rep system, on Xbox 1 you can get punished for getting bad rep...</p>
<p>"Since your reputation is currently in the “Avoid Me” status, you’ll most likely be matched with other low reputation players, and you’ll begin to lose privileges like being able to broadcast your gameplay using Twitch." False complaints on Xbox 360 likely
 get ignored. But with Xbox 360's system it was a bit like a democracy, vote if you like/dislike him/her. Get your friends to help with the voting. But according to Xbox 360's OS/Dashboard, it implies you shouldn't file complaint if you didn't like playing
 with them. It should only be if the swear at you/your friends, bullying, threats, hacking, and other serious violations of the Xbox rules.</p>

            <p>Well an interesting update to my experience the whole rep&nbsp;thing left me feeling very unwelcome&nbsp;and with&nbsp;really no way out of it so&nbsp;I let my gold expire and was offline for about 4 months when I noticed my rep was back in the green now according to MS time alone wont repair rep but mine did about a month after I stuck to offline play, got to feeling like it was just a mistake so I perked up and got the gears limited S console even got an offer for one month of gold for 1$ thought I would take it slow and grind some hoard now after about a week back into the online scene my rep is needs work I have not cheated, exploited any glitch, team killed, or gone against the mechanics of the game in any way shape or form, my privacy settings prohibit any voice or messaging over the console&nbsp;at this point&nbsp;I feel guilty of playing a game, have canceled on gold once again&nbsp;and am at a loss for words over this, it has left me feeling like a fool:(&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Asus Q551L- Built-in Microphone not working</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a 2in1 Asus Q551L, and have had no issues other than my Microphone. When I use it people can barely hear me while I'm skyping. I have to scream just for them to comprehend what I'm saying. I've tried everything I can think of. Uninstalled
 drivers (Realtek)</p>
<p>changed the Mic volume, etc. I have noticed though, when I tap on the back of the screen the Mic does show that its getting a lot of sound. But it just won't pick up my voice. I'm completely stumped. Any help will be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank&nbsp; you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>-Does the issue happen only with Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below troubleshooting to fix the problem:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong><br />
I would suggest you to run audio troubleshooter and check if it helps.<br />
a) Press “Windows Key + W”.<br />
b) Type “Troubleshooting “in the search box and hit enter.<br />
c) Click on Hardware and sound.<br />
d) Click on Recording audio and follow on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>Method 2:</strong> <br />
If the issue persists let’s visit the manufacturer’s website &amp; download the sound card drivers. Try installing the drivers in
<strong>compatibility mode </strong>to check if that works:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To install the driver in compatibility mode follow the steps below.<br />
a) Right-click on the driver executable/installer file.</div>
<div>b) Click on Properties and select the Compatibility tab.</div>
<div>c) Click the checkbox before Run this program in Compatibility mode for option and select Windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
d) In the list-down box; then try installing the device driver via Run as administrator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>
<p>Please post in case you have any further issues,</p>
<p>&nbsp;We will be glad to help you.</p>
<p>

            Was this issue ever solved? &nbsp;I have the same issue, when speaking normally the microphone does not pick up my voice well. When I tap my screen or even gently brush it those listening to me find it DEAFENING. When I look at recording input my voice only
 registers as one bar of sound. Gently brushing my screen maxes it out. What is the issue?

            <p>the problem described by JM and GE are&nbsp;accurate. I am having the same problem and have had the same problem since I got this computer. again with skype....I do not use that often but it is most noticeable there. I tried the speech recognition deal and it
 said it couldn't hear me unless I yelled. talking normally or "phone" volume barely picks up on the built in mic. if I use an external mic everything works fine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>when using the built in mic and&nbsp;I click on "listen to this device" and talk normally&nbsp;I can hear myself loud (not clear due to feedback, does clear up when I reduce settings) so I know it works</p>
<p>
</p><p>mic volume 100% with boost at 20db</p>

            Is the printer configured to use DHCP to obtain its IP address?  new router will supply a new IP address to the printer and if your PC expects it at its old address it won't be able to find it. Remove and re-add the printer.

            Hi Jackie.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />Easiest is to reinstall the printer software, which will also make sure it's the latest and you have the equally important firmware update that assures good operation of printer. 
<br />
<br />So go to the Brother Support Downloads website to download the latest full software package and firmware here:  <a href="http://www.brother.com/apps/ps/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.brother.com/apps/ps/en/</a>
<br />
<br /> 1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC. 
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.   
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete  Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.   
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot.
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.   
<br />

<h2>            Help &#58; winword.exe will not close</h2>
                    I have a computer that when you close Microsoft Word 2007 the winword.exe process is still running after the program is closed. No other programs are open. I have removed the Office Live Sign in add in and have also deleted the Normal.dotm file. Word still
 works with the processes running but causes it to be really slow and will not allow it to shutdown or log off. Does anyone have any ideas

<p>as of Office 2007, Outlook now uses Word as the email editor. previously (Outlook 2003) you had a choice between the default editor and Word.</p>
<p>But this would not explain why winword.exe would be slowing down your computer. one way to find out is to close Outlook and then see if winword.exe is still running, If it is&nbsp;then how much CPU and Memory it is using?</p>
<p>This should give you a starting place and explain a few things</p>
