<h2>            Is there a setting to make all text BOLD in outlook.com</h2>
                    Many people have visual accuity problems that prevent comfortable reading of the gray text of outlook.com &nbsp; As this could be a violation of the Americans with Disability act I would suggest you allow all text in this replacement to your perfectly good
 Hotmail to be toggled to <b>bold do you now see how much easier it is to read?&nbsp; I would also suggest a full 12 point font size and unread messages in a different high contrast (saturated) color.&nbsp;</b>

<h2>            N82 New FW &#40;20.0.062&#41; question</h2>
                    When I boot up my phone, I get a blank screen for a few seconds. Then it stutters again then I get my menu. This wasn't the case before in release 11.<br />
<br />
Can someone who has upgraded confirm this is happening on yours too?<br />
<br />
thanks!

            Aside from the stutter you are not experiencing any problem?The stutter might be the result the new changes implemented to the phone, somehow affects the stability during boot-up, I think you'd be ok as long as the phone is functioning properly other than
 the stutter.btw, that is known to happen to some s60 phones.

<h2>            OneNote</h2>
                    <p>After three days of trying to find a solution and several hours one the phone with MS technical support, I have no answer to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an Office365 home subscriber, and an avid user of OneNote. &nbsp;I use it on my personal PC, and on my Android phone. &nbsp;I have a third PC I use for work. &nbsp;I would like to install OneNote on that PC and sync my notes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded a version of OneNote from onenote.com (free version) and it would not sign into my account. &nbsp;I received the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Sorry, we're having server problems, so we can't add Office 365 SharePoint right now. &nbsp;Please try again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told by technical support that this a different version of OneNote and it will not work with OneNote 365. &nbsp;This seems insane on Microsoft's part (imagine multiple versions of OneDrive that won't sync with each other!) but no matter. &nbsp;Tech support told
 me to install my Office 365 subscription on my work computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my work computer uses an older version of office (2007) in order to operate with my company's version of Exchange Server. &nbsp;If I install my own personal Office 365, it breaks Office 2007 (yes, I tried it). &nbsp;Bottom line, I just need to install a 2016
 version of OneNote, I guess, but without the rest of office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS tech support was absolutely no help at all--their apparent goal is to discover reasons they cannot help you. &nbsp;ANY IDEAS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently switched all my notes from Evernote to OneNote, and I'm considering switching back. &nbsp;I know for a fact that I can simply install Evernote on every computer I use, and it just works. &nbsp;I do not understand why MS seems to invent new ways for their
 software to break, as if no one simply wants OneNote to work on every computer they use, regardless of other software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution that will ACTUALLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM would be wonderful.</p>

            <p>Hi Sagnik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply... I think? &nbsp;I have become very accustomed to this kind of reply from Microsoft, after having spent many hours yesterday on the phone (and in times past) with different support personnel, each one with a similar approach: Essentially,
 identify which part of someone's issue appears to be the most applicable to another team's responsibilities, and forward the problem accordingly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's as if you call your mechanic because your car won't start, and he asks, "did you use a key"? &nbsp;And of course, you're answer is "yes, I did use the key to try to start my car". &nbsp;He says, "well, you need to talk to the key department" and while you're
 desperately trying to convince him the key is probably just fine, you suddenly find yourself on hold for an hour, waiting to talk to "Key Support". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Key Support finally picks up and asks whether the engine made any noise while attempting to start, to which you answer "yes, it sort of chugged" and they reply, "Why are you talking to us? &nbsp;Your key works fine! &nbsp;You need to talk to the Ignition Department!"
 &nbsp;Another wait in the phone cue, and you find yourself talking to "Spark Plug Support" who demand your case number, ask you to state your name (again!) and ask why you think the problem is your spark plug, and who sent you there in the first place. &nbsp;You explain
 you don't know if it's your spark plug or not, and they ask "Well, do you use the car for business or work?" To which you reply, well,
<em>both</em>: my car gets me to work but I also use it on the weekends, <em>obviously! &nbsp;</em>To which Spark Plug Support replies, "Ah ha! &nbsp;You need to talk to
<em>Enterprise </em>Spark Plug Support, since you're using the car for <em>work</em>. &nbsp;That's not our department, and we can't help, since we only work with the Home version of spark plugs". &nbsp;"But! But! Wait...I don't even know if it has anything to do with
 spark plugs at all!" </p>
<p>
</p><p>And again, you're on hold for another department. &nbsp;By now you've learned to ask for your case number, but you're mad at yourself for not doing so. &nbsp;Enterprise Spark Plugs eventually picks up after an hour of waiting on hold, and asks, "So you're using gasoline
 to run your car, correct? &nbsp;Which version of gasoline do you have?" &nbsp;To which you reply, "Whichever gasoline comes out of the pump at the station near my house!!" &nbsp;"Tell us the address of that station please". &nbsp;"212 Main Street?" &nbsp;"I'm sorry but that station
 is unsupported, and your <em>fuel problem</em> cannot be solved by our team". &nbsp;To which you reply, "WHAT?? &nbsp;I have this problem regardless of the gas station used! &nbsp;My brother put gas in it from a supported station and had the same problem!" &nbsp;To which they
 reply, "So you used a free version of the gas and had the same problem? &nbsp;Our team doesn't support the free version of gas, only the paid version from supported stations. &nbsp;We feel that you're problem will be solved by installing paid gas from supported stations
 in all your tanks. &nbsp;Thank you very much, this ticket is closed, goodbye!"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Meanwhile, your previously installed faulty engine starter is never repaired, and you've moved on to using a different car from a different company.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why people use your competitors' products with some frequency. &nbsp;Not only does Microsoft over complicate their products with apparently new and novel ways for them to fail (sync issues, sign-in issues, version inter-operability problems) the support
 is terrible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that a product called OneNote installed on one of my PC's will not sign in or sync with a product called OneNote on another one of my PC's. &nbsp;At one point on the phone I was told that my problem was that a free version of OneNote was on one
 of the PC's, so it would not work to connect to my paid version of OneNote. &nbsp;Since the first version was free, I could receive no support. &nbsp;I asked for support on the basis that I was a paid subscriber for the other version!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem, Microsoft, is not me. &nbsp;The problem is you built failure into your products. &nbsp;You've built failure into your understanding of how people use a given product. &nbsp;Who, for example, would set up two completely separate ecosystems of their notes in
 a note-taking application so they can respect Microsoft's notions of Enterprise vs. Home? &nbsp;Does Evernote do that? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, I KNOW I can solve this in 5 minutes simply by using a competitor's product. &nbsp;I can go and download something that competes with OneNote and it will work. &nbsp;Just work, the first time. &nbsp;This is possible because your competitors don't have entrenched
 Enterprise software, supported by IT personnel whose bread and butter depends on continually purchasing more Microsoft Enterprise software. &nbsp;Now, a lot of that software is good. &nbsp;I use it frequently. &nbsp;But look out, Microsoft. &nbsp;God help you if your competitors
 get their foot half as far into enterprise as you have. &nbsp;You will wake up and find yourself in a world where all of your products will have to actually work, at least as well as your competitors if not better. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you should start acting as if any given product you create must be profitable and competitive on its own, and divest yourselves of the model of bundling half-baked products what would fail into entrenched products that people are virtually
 forced to buy.</p>

            <p>Thank you for that piece. Although I am quite certain that it will not have any effect other than entertain readers like me (who tends to car comparisms in IT problems as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me try to shed some light on your &nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I did not see any reference to SharePoint in your problem description apart from that error message.</p>
<p>In fact you are mentioning you are a Office 365 Home user and use OneNote on your Android device also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So may I just assume that your notes are stored on OneDrive (not OneDrive for Business, aka SharePoint online) only?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be good news, because ALL current OneNote versions and apps are able to access those notes; completely regardless if you are having an Office 365 subscription or not. Just the credentials of your free Microsoft account are needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the bad news: I understand you are forced to use Office 2007 at work for some reasons. But OneNote itself started to support accessing notes on MS cloud services for the first time with Office / OneNote 2010 Service Pack 1. To my knowledge there has
 never been a way to access notes on OneDrive with OneNote 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your assumption is right that installing OneNote 2016 (free) alongside your Office 2007 would grant you that access. But unfortunately it has always been difficult , if not impossible, to mix different Office component versions up. Try installing Outlook
 2013 with Office 2007 or think of upgrading just your Word module to 2016 while keeping Excel and Outlook at 2007. In this case it is just not possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, OneNote 2016 free seems to be a standalone program. But in fact it is sharing a lot of COM and DLL modules with an existing MS Office (or bringing its own versions if there is no Office present) which are just not compatible with the old ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow me to try a car world metapher too: If you own a Mercedes from 1983 (which is about the equivalence of using Office 2007 in 2016) and want to install the steering wheel of a 2015 model to get audio and cruise control buttons this simply can't work
 because there is no CANBUS system in your old car.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...if you're stuck to Office 2007 and need to access OneNote notebooks on OneDrive at the same time I see only two solutions / workarounds:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are happening to use Windows 8 or 10 at works (Although I am almost certain you will tell me that you are on Windows 7 or even XP there as well), you could use the Store/Universal app of OneNote to access your notebooks. They will accept your Microsoft
 account credentials without problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last ressort is to access your notes using a webbrowser and OneNote Online (www.onenote.com). Yes, that would not give you the full features of Office OneNote, but that's the price you have to accept if you insist on that 1983 Mercedes: Steering wheel yes,
 audio controls no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS: I fully agree with you on support quality for some products / software brands. Microsoft does not shine here very brightly. I used to work as support manager myself 25 years ago. That time a program might well cost over 1000$ and therefore software companies
 could afford good service personnel; it simplay payed out. In times of mostly free software or 0,99$ apps this has significantly changed. At the same time software has become so much more complicated and feature rich that getting the I-have-a-solution-for-all-your-problems-super-expert
 on the phone is .... ummm ... rather unlikely.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot reassign F4 key - Word for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot reassign F4 key - Word for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me with this. I have always used the F4 key as a redo function, since getting an update on Word this now brings up the Find and Replace box. I've tried looking into System Preferences and I've also tried to change it within the Customize
 Keyboard section within Word, nothing is working. I've tried to find the shortcuts for Find and Replace and the F4 key is not listed as being a shortcut for this function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really slowing me down in my work so any help or tips people have would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vicky</p>

<p>Here's how to reassign a key combination that's already taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Word, choose&nbsp;<strong>Tools&gt;Customize Keyboard</strong>.</li><li>In the&nbsp;<em>Press new keyboard shortcut</em>&nbsp;field, press the key combination that is already assigned. Then check which command has it in the area just below that field. In the case of F4, I get&nbsp;<strong>Currently assigned to: EditPaste</strong>.</li><li>Find the command that was named. EditPaste is under the Edit category, but if it's a more obscure command, you might have to change&nbsp;<em>Categories</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>All Commands</strong>.</li><li>Click on the command name in the right-hand column. Check the&nbsp;<strong>Current keys:</strong>&nbsp;field to see what shortcuts are associated with that command.</li><li>Select the shortcut you want to use, then click on the&nbsp;<strong>Remove</strong>&nbsp;button.</li><li>Now you can assign your preferred command to the shortcut you removed and it will work as expected.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simplest option may be to do the download of the standalone installer file using another browser like Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't forget that for IE11 on Windows 7, you will need Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) installed first (assuming that it isn't already). You can get it via:</p>

            <p>thanks.&nbsp; seems like a bug ms would like to fix, but will see about that.</p>
<p>i got this link that shows idea of IE10 for win 7 &amp; 8,&nbsp; and IE11 for win 8. (i was trying to get a handle on what version to get.&nbsp; wiki says can do IE11 for win 7, but will see if have sp1 on win7 32-64&nbsp;disk, thanks), so maybe either 10 or 11.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;- would really like to download ie app, before new install.</p>

            <p>The same goes for me (Lumia 950).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few bugs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sync status is not easly accessible via the Photos app (gallery) as there is no way to see if image/video is already syncd</li><li>You have to be lucky enough to find out that sync status and sync queue list is now inside OneDrive app - inside settings</li><li>Once you are in Camera queue list, then you realize that it is completly useless! It has no filenames, no thumbs, no dates and nothing whatsoever! &nbsp;There is just bunch of files stating "waiting...". That's it. You can hit the "retry" button which does,
 well... noting!</li></ol>
<p>So, in a nutshell: oneDrive camera syncing is pain in the ****.</p>

It is very unlikely. &nbsp;If you try it, make a backup copy first.

            Publisher, Access, Visio, OneNote, FrontPage and Groove do not exist for the Mac. There are Mac programs that will let you do the same things, and in some cases, they can import your Microsoft files. Another option is to run "Office for Windows" programs
 in Parallels/Windows on the Mac. <br />
<br />
Only Microsoft can answer if or when.&nbsp; If this is a feature that you consider useful, be sure to let Microsoft know by sending them feedback (via the Send Feedback command in Outlook’s Help menu)<br />

Microsoft OneNote is available for the phone. Get it at the App Store (free)<br />

<h2>            Hey Cortana doesn&#39;t work on my Lumia 1520</h2>
                    Originally when I got lumia denim hey cortana worked fine on my phone, it wasnt until the update before the last one that i noticed it stopped working. When i went to it in the settings it said that i had to turn cortana on before i could use hey cortana.
 Cortana IS on. I can give her voice commands and she still reminds me about things i just cant use "hey cortana" why not?

 HH:MM:SS and when I this data for a mail merge the seconds are displayed.&nbsp; Though I have posted the OS as 8 and office as 2010, I have also tried on Windows 7 and office 10.

<h2>            FAQ&#58; Microsoft Interactive Classroom add-ins for PowerPoint and OneNote</h2>
                    <span><span>
                    <span><span>
<p><span><a href="http://www.educationlabs.com/projects/ic/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Interactive Classroom add-ins for PowerPoint and
 OneNote</a> enhance classroom presentations by increasing student participation, helping teachers assess student comprehension, and enabling students to personalize the information presented.</span></p></span></span>
<p><span><span>During a presentation, teachers can:</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Poll students with multiple choice, true/false, or yes/no questions.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Distribute the lesson to students with OneNote</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Include real-time ink and text annotations.</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>Students can respond to poll questions through their individual OneNote notebooks or hand-held clickers, and the results display in the presentation. When the presentation is over, students keep the annotated presentation and notes so they can
 keep track of what they need to learn.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Q: How much does it cost?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> Microsoft Interactive Classroom is available as a free download,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=d93f4cb5-e2bb-4543-a3bb-cd6a8ecb42cc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">found&nbsp;<span>here</span></a>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Q: How can I get support for the Interactive Classroom Add-in?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>A:
</span></strong><span>Questions about using the Interactive Classroom should be asked on the
<a href="http://www.educationlabs.com/projects/ic/Lists/Discussions/AllItems.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Interactive Classroom discussion board</a> on Microsoft Education Labs.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Q: Which versions of PowerPoint or OneNote work with the Microsoft Interactive Classroom Add-in?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span>The Microsoft Interactive Classroom Add-in is compatible with Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft Office<span>&nbsp;</span>OneNote 2007, Microsoft PowerPoint 2010, and Microsoft OneNote 2010. A full list of
 requirements is available on the download page.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Q: Can I install the Microsoft Interactive Classroom Add-in if I have a previous version of the Interactive Classroom add-in already installed?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span>If a pre-release version of Interactive Classroom is installed on your computer, that version must be uninstalled before you install this release.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Q: How do students connect to a shared session?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>A</span></strong><span>: Students can connect to a shared session by clicking the&nbsp;<strong>Join Session</strong> icon in OneNote 2007 or by clicking
<strong>Join Session</strong> on the Academic tab in OneNote 2010.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Q: How do students know which session to connect to?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> Students see a&nbsp;<strong>Join Session</strong> dialog when connected to the school network. The dialog contains the title of the presentation and the presenter’s computer name. The presenter can require an access
 key, which the student must enter to connect to the session.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Q: How does the student see the presenter’s slides?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> When a student joins a session, each slide in the PowerPoint presentation is converted to an image and automatically added as a page in the student’s OneNote notebook.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Q: Where do I find the add-in after I install it?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> The add-in appears as the Academic tab in PowerPoint and OneNote.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Q: I’ve installed the add-in but don’t see an Academic tab in PowerPoint or OneNote. Where is it?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> Add-ins can be active or inactive in PowerPoint and OneNote. If the Interactive Classroom add-in is inactive, it will not appear in PowerPoint or OneNote after it is installed. To activate the Interactive Classroom
 add-in, do the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>On the&nbsp;<strong>File</strong> menu, click
<strong>Options</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Add-Ins</strong>, and then click
<strong>Go</strong> next to the <strong>Manage</strong> dropdown.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Select the Interactive Classroom checkbox, and then click&nbsp;
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></p>

            Also there might be good to know which file format is the tones in and how big are they? Are they stored on the MMC or internal memory?<br />
<br />
Stupid question maybe, but have you checked the sound settings in the phone when you try to play it?

            Thanks for your response. I used the Nokia Audio Manager and the file type is 'AAC' size 1909KB. The download was to the phone memory and appears ok but just no sound. I have tried another headset but that doesn't work either.

<h2>            Unable to turn off run as administrator on Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've turned on "run as administrator" in Word 2016 to try and fix another problem recommended by a forum user (which didn't work anyway). Now I cannot turn it off. So every time I open Word, I have to enter my administrator password or the program won't
 open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've turned off "run as administrator" in properties (under compatibility - see screenshot). Hasn't worked. I still have to enter my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE PLEASE help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Somehow I fixed it but no idea how!&nbsp; The problem was only in Word 2016 (none of the other Office applications were affected) and it wasn't to do with where docs were being saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, many thanks for your response.</p>

    <title>Multiple horizontal lines in Word 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ddzigns2003  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple horizontal lines in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I have documents that have been created from Nuance PDF convertor&nbsp;to Word 2013. I want to increase the font size but there are lots of horizontal lines in the document&nbsp;and when the font is increased the lines are in the wrong place. How can I easily delete
 the lines or make sure that when I increase the font size they move in line with the increase?</p>

            You are experiencing just one of the problems that happens when working with converted documents. The converters do not "think" like Word does.<br />
<br />
The lines are likely graphics and if you can select them, you can delete them.<br />
<br />
Consider using borders instead of graphic lines. The borders can be applied to individual words or phrases or to paragraphs.<br />

<p>Hi Stuart, the problem is exactly in the 19H1 that is builf 18362. when the application stops working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I said that in builds from the insider program starting from build 18908, we see the issue fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So again my 2 questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When will be builds from 18908 up be made public ? As you roll out 19H1 we have more and more customers complaining. This is really not acceptable.</p>
<p>2. Is there any workaround that we can tell our customers who already have 19H1 and cannot use our software can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your answer&nbsp;</p>

https://support.microsoft.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also the Get Help app in Windows 10 which should lead you eventually to more interactive help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Feedback Hub is good for ensuring that Microsoft Engineers are made aware of issues, but it is not interactive, so you may not get much from that route on how to resolve anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the scanning mouse, or software supplier will want to update their product so that it works with the latest version of Windows 10. So they will also need to be involved in fixing what is wrong.&nbsp; Have you tried a fresh install of the mouse and software
 on a fresh install of Windows 10 version 1903?&nbsp; That would help to eliminate other variables.</p>

<p>OK guys this is not acceptable, we cannot tell our customer you can use the product and the software in one year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please can you let us know what is the cause for the issue above in 18362 build and how we can fix it like you did in 18908?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you removed the software and re-installed the scanner software as mentioned by others?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar issue with using my mouse drivers, a simple click would eventually cause a BSOD. This has occurred with both 18362 and 17763. Completely uninstalling my Logitech Options, rebooting and then re-installing Options would clear this issue, never to occur
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well worth a try with your scanner software. Perhaps the vendor has updated drivers.</p>

            <p>Hi Christian, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><div>1. Go to TaskManager&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Click CPU% tab to sort the highest usage task to top</div>
<div>3. Find the process with name *spool* or *spooler* in it</div>
<div>
<p>4. Kill it (end process)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Reason:</strong> If you have tried to print a page/selection on a browser (especially Chrome) and due to some reason if the printer is not connected or having connection issues, you might have tried to print more than once. This print process/spool
 usually do not show in the systray. No matter how many times you reboot, it may not go away. On every restart, it picks the spool again causing flickering (whether the printer connection is fixed or not). So try the procedure above, this should fix the problem.</p>

liewnaiejen</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. Are you still experiencing the same issue with the phone?&nbsp;For your first question, you can only do voice call with WeChat. However, you may try&nbsp;to use&nbsp;a voice recorder app and see if you'll be able to
 send it as an attachment. On the other hand, WhatsApp lets you send voice message by holding down the mic icon. About your Waze query, what exactly happen when you try to use the voice guided navigation? We look forward to your reply.

<h3> rdavlat  say:</h3>
<h2>            E52 Totally OFF. Not working.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what can I do with my Nokia E52, about 6 weeks ago I purchased it from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, during my vacation. After I came back home and started to use my beloved mobile.&nbsp;After 4 days of working suddenly it began to switch off
 itself. At first, Every hour, then every 15 minutes, then every minute and at the end not switching On completely.</p>
<p>I showed to several mobile repair workshops, they said there some problem with the platform, they managed to switch it on for me, it worked some more hours and dead again. Then I went to Nokia Repair in Ukraine, however they were also not able to repair
 it, because it's a problem with the platform, and they don't have these new types of platform which is used for E52. Now the phone is blank, totally off and doesnt want to switch on.</p>
<p>By the way when I managed to switch on at the beginning when it could work for some minutes, I managed to make soft reset, hard reset, but it seems nothing helped it.</p>
<p>My question is, why Nokia is putting WARRANTY for these products if noone can repair it. What do I do now with this, throw away? and if there is any warranty really covered, or is covered only in the country of purchase?</p>
<p>This is a really disappointing mobile phone, disappointment for Nokia corp. as well. I am very frustrated.</p>
<p>If someone could advice anything.</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance</p>

<p>Unfortunately the warranty is only valid in the country/region of purchase. If you can get your phone to Nokia Care in Dubai, they should be able to repair it for you. Hopefully none of the repair places you brought it to since did anything to invalidate
 your warranty.</p>

<p>I can't write what they are speaking because the filters would cut it, but the word comes from the back of a male bovine if you get my drift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some S60 phones occasionally get this habit, it's a software problem that might be cured by updating the software* or by soft** or hard-resetting*** the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, however, you won't get it repaired under warranty in the Ukiraine because it is only guaranteed in the country of purchase.</p>

<p>**Soft reset: dial *#7370#, confirm Yes then enter lock code (12345 by default), phone restarts in factory condition.</p>
<p>***Hard reset: switch off, then hold down *, 3 and green keys whilst you switch back on.</p>

    <title>Need help to retrieve Hotmail password without resetting since my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leonyu-584  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help to retrieve Hotmail password without resetting since my laptop is dependent on it &#40;no internet access now&#41;</h2>
                    Hello everyone, 



I am currently on a business trip with my Lenovo Thinkpad X1 laptop. Early this morning, I could not connect to the wifi at the hotel, as kept getting the Wifi no valid IP configuration error; being a "smart ****" I tried many ways to get it worked. At the end, I got stuck at the Windows 8.1 login screen. Reason being I restarted with minimize option ("MSCONFIG, then disable many of the services/software, including the Lenovo fingerprint scanner software which normally get into the desktop directly). FYI - usually after login I use Roboform to memorize all the Hotmail and other site passwords.  



Now my laptop could not connect to the wifi (no ethernet port), thus I really could not afford to reset my Hotmail passport. Since I am on the business trip the laptop is extremely important to me. Any suggestion and help is great appreciated.  



Best regards, 


Leon

            <p>Hello Andreo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the prompt reply. I hesitate to reset my Hotmail password on a different computer is that I wanted to see if there is a way to retrieve my current password, so that I could log in to my laptop which is currently not able to access to the net.
 Wishing that I used the local account instead of my hotmail as the login.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the required account information which I can provide to Microsoft. Even I have to pay it is ok since I am desperate as I am on the business trip and urgently need the functional laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello Kristina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just an update - this issue was resolved as I was able to find my Hotmail password from another computer. Now I can access to my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,<br />
Leon</p>
