<p>I have a working VBS script to remove profiles but I want to make it auto run from a cd but the script needs syntax to run such as from a command line prompt.&nbsp; This is my example of the batch file i want to run with the vbs file from a cd.

<h2>            Can&#39;t activate Windows 10 after clean install</h2>
                    <p>Greetings, my laptop came today with "Windows 10 Single Language" pre-installed and I connected my Microsoft Account. Windows were activated. I also saved the product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC has 2 drives. One of them is an SSD that was empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install of "Windows 10 Single Language" on the SSD but now Windows said that it can't activate (Error code: 0xC004C003).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to manually put the product key that I had written down from the original installation and now it shows error 0x8007007B, which states:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We can't activate Windows on this device as we can't connect to your organization's activation server. Make sure you're connected to your organization's network and try again. If you continue having problems with activation, contact your organization's
 support person."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that this laptop was purchased brand new and I'm not affiliated with any organization that provided this to me.</p>

            Hi Dimitris2315 
<br />
<br />That is a really strange error to get on Windows 10 Single Language, usually that error is seen on Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .

<h2>            Magic jack does not mix with windows XP&#47;service pack 3</h2>
                    Okay,this is the day and age of windows 7 and 8. There still are millions of people using windows XP! I am sure that my problem has occurred with other XP users. I have service pack 3 and magic jack will NOT work with SP3.&nbsp; I got error code 28 and error
 message"this hardware did not install because the INF was written for windows XP or later. Magic jack sees my computer NOT as XP,but as windows 9x 4.0build 950[3.0] I DID have magic jack working with service pack 2. People have warned me&nbsp; that IF I uninstall
 SP3 my computer will likely be attacked by viruses,worms and adware. Can I protect my computer with Microsoft security essentials&nbsp; updates and keep functioning on service pack 2? I love VOIP and wonder if there are affordable alternatives to magic jack. Monthly
 cellphone bills are a real DRAG!

<h2>            Dell XPS 18 - Killer Wireless-N 1202 Comcast Router - no internet</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had Comcast upgrade my equipment and decided to use their router instead of my ASUS RT-AC66U.</p>
<p>Being that my upload is 25mbps but the ASUS could only do 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So their modem/router works well. However, windows can't use the router. I open Chrome or Edge and can open Google.com but that is it. Nothing else will open. I have no issues in Ubuntu, which I've had dual boot for a few years or in windows safe mode with
 networking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting the wireless adapter from device manager, rebooting and letting windows reinstall it.</p>
<p>There are no event errors except for those stating that certain services can't be reached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have an idea??</p>
<p>I'd hate to have to reinstall from scratch. If its the only way then I'll have to though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thaks</p>
<p>Jon</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is simply a matter of normal windows won't work with the Comcast router.</p>
<p>This is a clean installation. Its just strange that it works in Safe Mode but not in normal operation.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This option is not available in Windows 10, you can only pin the websites to start menu. To do this, go the settings menu and click on 'Pin to start'. If you want to create a desktop shortcut, you can try the work around of opening the same webpage through
 Internet Explorer and then creating a desktop shortcut. Go to settings menu in Edge browser and then click on 'Open in Internet Explorer' to open any website you are currently viewing in Internet Explorer.</p>

            <p>Why do you want to clutter up your desktop with links?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge gives you a perfect way to save and find your favorite sites - or even web pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on the Star and it gives you two options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Favorites</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just put them into whichever you prefer and you keep your desktop relatively clean for the other shortcuts you need.</p>

            <p>There are many reasons to do this... one of which is if you have 2-3 main sites you like to quickly go to and it's fast to double click from the desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another major one, and the one I use it for, is for a young child... create them links in one area of the desktop to get to their favorite games, or create a folder with all the shortcuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, don't knock how different folks use the OS/browser, everyone is different.&nbsp; Some folks like clutter, some don't like any.&nbsp; The smart thing is for folks to express functionality they like and for the devs to LISTEN to that and if there is a big
 enough userbase needing that functionality, put it in the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The big issue is when virtually EVERY other browser has the ability for you to&nbsp;drag from the URL field to the desktop to create the shortcut, but this new browser removes that functionality...<strong> *thinks about start button*....</strong></p>

            <p>Come on you lot, get real !!!</p>
<p>It's simple......</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Navigate to your Webpage using Microsoft Edge in Windows 10.</p>
<p>2. Click on the 3 bars in the top right hand corner.</p>
<p>3. Select 'Pin to Start.'</p>
<p>4. Close the Microsoft Edge Browser.</p>
<p>4. Open the Start Menu on your desktop.</p>
<p>5. Find the tile showing your webpage, then drag and drop the link onto your desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>JOB DONE !!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you ever actually try this? All it does is produce a link to Microsoft Edge's home page!!! And if Edge is already running, double clicking on the desktop icon does nothing.&nbsp; (Also it's not "click on the 3 bars", it's "click on the 3 dots"). Unfortunately
 I can't mark it "Not Helpful". Please try solutions before posting for the world to see...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only method I've found so far is to manually create the shortcut by right clicking on the desktop, pasting the URL in the "Create Shortcut" dialog, and naming it. This has the major disadvantage that the icon "favicon.ico" used by the web site, now has
 to be located manually in your web cache in order to copy it to a location of your choice and set it in the link properties. Unfortunately this is the result of Microsoft not understanding that some users really don't want to change how they use their computer.
 Add new features all you want, but don't take existing ones away. This is why Windows 8 was a blunder and its architect was demoted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've discovered another way and it works, post it here.</p>

<p>Many thanks for bringing this to my attention, I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.</p>
<p>However, I entirely agree with your constructive comments concerning Microsoft's failings in this particular</p>
<p>area of the desktop's practical modus-operandi. Lets hope that they address our concerns.</p>

            Thank-you.&nbsp; You put this beautifully.&nbsp; It would be so simple to return the right click for an easy way to put a shortcut on the desktop.&nbsp; I rely on this method almost daily.&nbsp; My desktop IS my desk.&nbsp; The reading list is great, but doesn't give me the same
 functionality as the desktop shortcut which I use for other reasons.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Totally agree with both points!&nbsp; Which is why I've set the default browser back to IE.&nbsp; Edge is handy sometimes but IE is mostly reliable and, after years of using it, predictable.&nbsp; If there are some compelling reasons to use Edge instead of IE, I'm willing
 to listen.</p>

            When I click on the 3 bars in the top right corner, I get a list of my favorites.&nbsp; There is a pin icon and if I hover over it, it says Pin This Pane.&nbsp; If I click it, it turns to an X.&nbsp; I opened what I think is my Start Menu (4 window panes at the lower
 left corner) and looked through all of the tiles and expanded the App list but I don't see any tile to the website.&nbsp; Did I miss a step or click the wrong pin?

<p>Hi MrKross - Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
AFAIK, Microsoft will never call you, unless you personally tell them to <br />
do so, and then of course you have to give your phone-number so they <br />
can contact you by phone. Please do NOT trust such calls in the future. <br />
Also AFAIK, once you open a Microsoft Support case they will give <br />
you some support ID, that you must use, and if the support <br />
employee calls you (once you told him to do so) he will share some <br />
Support ID Code and you will know whether he is from Microsoft <br />
or NOT because your Support ID must mache with the <br />
code the Microsoft Support guy told by phone.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 crashing into Blue Screen Error&#58; c4</h2>
                    
<p>original title: Windows 7 crashing into BSOD repeatedly</p>
<p>Was in the processing of editing this when it happened again.&nbsp; No report this time, just a momentary BSOD and then a reboot.&nbsp; IT doesn't matter if I have IE or FF up and running or neither.&nbsp; I have run Malwarebytes, AdAware, Spybot and AVG and all come up
 clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I get when the computer reboots:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong><span><span>
<p>Problem signature:</p>
</span></span></strong><span>
<p>Problem Event Name: BlueScreen</p>
<p>OS Version: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.768.3</p>
<p>Locale ID: 1033</p>
</span><strong><span><span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I don't get that all the time.&nbsp; Sometimes it restarts as if nothing has happened.&nbsp; I'm a fairly advanced user, the laptop is less than 5 months old and this didn't start until I installed Java 6.20.&nbsp; Tried uninstalling it but could not find any earlier
 versions and I'm not sure this is the problem or not.&nbsp; ANY help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

            Are you facing this issue from the day one you are using windows 7?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to update the drivers for all the hardware devices of your computer. Such issues may occur because of damaged drivers or incompatible software’s. You may also check the compatibility of all the software installed in your computer in windows
 7 compatibility center.<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would also suggest you to update your computer’s BIOS and chipset drivers. For this you may have to contact your computer manufacture.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If still the same issue persists then, you my try creating new user profile and check if this helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To create a new profile, you must first create a new user account. When the account is created, a profile will also be created.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp; Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety (or clicking User Accounts, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking User Accounts.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; Click Manage another account.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp; Click Create a new account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp; Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create Account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For more information visit the below links:<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account&nbsp; <br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811151 (This article is for xp but can also be used for vista and windows 7.)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you have e-mail messages in an e-mail program, such as Windows Mail, you must import your e-mail messages and addresses to the new user profile before you delete the old profile. If everything is working properly in new profile, you can delete the old profile.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may check if issue persists in safe mode and post back status so, that we can help you better.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To use a Safe mode option, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the arrow keys to choose Safe Mode in Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you don't get that error message in safe mode then, it means that some third party application (running in normal mode) is causing the problem.

<h2>            windows 98 driver needed....</h2>
                    <p>I have a nice controller that I used to use for video games (Microsoft Sidwinder Strategic Comander)</p>
<p>its a sweet controller especialy for rts games (of which I have many)</p>
<p>It wont plug and play so I tried to install from the cd that I still have. </p>
<p>1. cd wouldn't run (compatibility.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It opened and ran the install in windows xp compatibility.</p>
<p>2. It still dint work. the moment it was done installing it said there was an error and to reinstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three tries later I see something that mentions it may not be compatible (win 98) drivers needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here I am, now trying to ask all you, is there a way to get it to work?</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t open my start menu despite trying the options listed on Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>I'm extremely upset. I keep getting a critical error message that forces me to sign out and sign back in. Only when I sign in, the problem remains. I've searched for answers to this issue online and I'm told to type in the search box, except I cannot type
 in the search box, as it won't respond! I called Microsoft Support and they sent me back to online support or ask me to pay! What am I supposed to do? I work on this computer! I noticed that the sound icon and the Microsoft Edge icon also don't respond when
 I click on it. Furthermore, my Internet Explorer icon is not on my desktop. I was lucky that I could find the Google chrome icon. This is ridiculous! This has been happening since yesterday.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am having the same issue as NinaLola06 and am equally as frustrated. Probably more, as I have tried to all of the things mentioned in the post above - no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, am I missing something obvious. In the post above we are told to 'click the power button' and restart. &nbsp;But the power button can only be accessed (as far as I can tell) via the start menu button...which we can't access b/c the error comes up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other fix? Also, while I can't access my apps via the start button, how can I get to them if I don't have a short cut on my task bar or desktop?</p>
<p>

            Yes, I was finally able to get a hold of Microsoft Support. Turns out it was corrupted. The technician had to remove Windows and reinstall it. Thanks for your reply.

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I will be glad to assist you with the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would require some more information to assist you better.<br />
1. What is the make &amp; model of the computer?<br />
2. Do you get any error message, when you try to play the game?<br />
3. Have you updated all your drivers?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please check the minimum system requirements for running the game on your system:</div>
<div><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/810896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/810896</span></a>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to install the game in compatible mode. To do so, follow the steps below:</div>
<div>a. Download the&nbsp;game. <br />
b. Right-click on it&nbsp;and click on ‘properties’. <br />
c. Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows vista or&nbsp;XP. Once this is done, restart the computer and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>If this does not help in resolving the issue, I would like to inform you that&nbsp; the game is supported to run in Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><div>Also refer the article to run the game in compact mode:</div>

<h3> yves poissant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to VPN after update KB3097617</h2>
                    <p>I am a remote worker. My system is a Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, I can't connect to my company's VPN. The only thing that changed since yesterday are Windows update. Two of them are for Flash and the other one is KB3097617. I get the following error message:<br />
"<em>The remote connection was not made because the attempted VPN tunnels failed. The VPN server might be unreachable. If this connection is attempting
</em>..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can connect from a Windows 7 computer and from a small windows 10 laptop that did not have the KB3097617 update yet. But I cannot connect from my main computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a workaround for this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If no workaround then is it safe to uninstall KB3097617?</p>
<p>And how do I setup Windows 10 update so it does no automatic update until this is fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I just found out that I cannot go back to Windows 7 because I have upgraded to Windows 10 for more than 30 days. This is not cool. It means that I will have to shop for a used Windows 7 computer so I can work remotely again. I should have never upgraded.
 Now I regret it badly.</p>

    <title>Where are my desktop items&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kpittman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where are my desktop items&#63;</h2>
                    I have a fair number of items on my Windows 7 desktop - folders into which I put recipes or research PDFs or links to programs etc.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I can open the folders or use the links on the desktop itself - all fine.&nbsp; I can access the PDFs in the folders - all fine.<br />
<br />
But when I go to Windows Explorer or any other file management software, I can't see anything under Desktop.&nbsp; Now, I know where to look so it's not that I'm looking in the wrong place.&nbsp; Could desktop.ini be corrupted somewhere or?????<br />
<br />
It has me totally baffled and, of course, I can't easily move things or copy them to my tablet or whatever.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Regards and thanks<br />

            <p>The answer is really not to keep data on the desktop.</p>
<p>The Desktop is a special System folder and is not designed to keep anything in it other than shortcuts.</p>
<p>I suggest you move all the data containing folders from your desktop to your Documents folder. You can then add shortcuts to those folders onto your desktop for ease of location.</p>
<p>You will then be able to see all your data in Windows Explorer normally.</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista freezes, screen goes pink with diagonal dashed lines</h2>
                    
<p>My HP Pavillion DV9500 laptop started doing this a couple of months ago:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The computer and programs sometimes just freeze, sometimes the screen goes a light pink with diagonal dashed lines, and sometimes the laptop will restart itself without warning.&nbsp; The computer is about 3 years old now and have not had any problems before this.&nbsp;
 I tried doing a clean install from the recovery feature as I don't have a Vista disk to reinstall from and it is still doing this.&nbsp; Sometimes the computer will be fine for a few hours, and sometimes right after the startup it will freeze.&nbsp; A couple of times
 also, as it starts up, Windows will not start up and it will say "Operating System Not Found".</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Could be a driver related issue. Update your drivers manually by looking at System maker and<br />
Device maker's sites. Update BIOS, drivers, and control software (if any).<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For
<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,
<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This sounds like impending hardware issues/failure. Since you did a clean install from recovery that<br />
pretty much rules out most software causes though it could be driver related and&nbsp;there are other&nbsp;<br />
remote possible causes. Video/display device and its drivers are chief suspects along with Mother-<br />
board and PowerSupply.<br />
<br />
Keep good backups and check with a real computer shop&nbsp;(not&nbsp;leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other<br />
BigBox stores)&nbsp;or your System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
This&nbsp;is my generic troubleshooter and possibly it can help you determine cause though I strongly
<br />
suspect hardware.<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />

<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.
<br />
TIP - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file.</strong><br />

<br />

<br />
<strong>Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.</strong><br />
<br />
Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it to crash.<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info that would
<br />
help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error information such as STOP
<br />
codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery Options if your
<br />
system has that installed by the maker.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party keyboard and<br />

Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Surface Book not starting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nosediver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book not starting</h2>
                    <p>I do now have the worst case situation that my surface book (i7 with Nvidia graphic) does not start up at all. I tried all the key combinations (Power + Volume up, holding the power button etc.) but the only thing that happens after holding the two keys
 for 15 seconds is a short red flash of the 'undock key'. The charger seems to be ok as the small white LED is on.</p>
<p>I am hesitant to sent it back to MS as they say the data on the surface book cannot be recoverd and my last backup has been 3 weeks ago. So my questions is: Is thery anything else that can be done and is there a way to accsss the SDD?</p>
<p>I don't remember what state the surface book was in when this was happening. It was either hibernate/standby or I did shut it down.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Edge Disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heidistevenson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Edge Disappeared</h2>
                    <p>I have had trouble with the start menu not working; also with the task bar and edge not working. Sometimes just restarting the computer has helped. Other times online searches have helped to restore things. I thought that this was resolved yet again today.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And now Edge has disappeared entirely. It is just missing. I can't see a way to fix that.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's annoying, because I have a brand new computer; 8.1 was fast and effective, and now I seem to have a very sketchy operating system.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please help. I need to know that this will work. I think I may be past the time to return to 8.1. Can this be resolved, or should I revert to factory settings. That would put me back to 8.1, correct. Please help.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how this should have been categorized. There are too many overlapping issues.</p>

            <p>Windows 10 was ok for me until the deadline to return to a previous version of Windows&nbsp;expired. Since then, Microsoft Edge has disappeared, the Windows icon no longer works from the keyboard and only works with a right click on the screen. Google Chrome
 persistently crashes and nobody seems to be able to advise me, in proper English, how to overcome these problems.&nbsp; If I had the chance to revert back to previous editions of Windows, I would. I feel as if I've been duped into loading something on my computer
 which is geared to fail, so that I have to invest in another computer.</p>
<p>I am currently using an old beaten up&nbsp;laptop with Windows 7 and have no issues or problems whatsoever. Feel conned.</p>

            <p>I too had this damn issue with Edge disappearing and what I finally did was to create a new shortcut for Edge like this and it works perfect.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;First you move your mouse cursor to any blank area on your desktop &nbsp;and right click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.in the box that opens after the right click, move down to where it says NEW and when the next box opens slide your cursor into it and move then to the shortcut command and left click on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. After you have clicked on the SHORTCUT command a new window opens with a empty command box. Now before typing anything further you need to decide what you want your homepage to be. I use MSN some like YAHOO , some like google, anyway I will show a couple
 instances and you will get the idea. In the box you simply type this command:</p>
<p>for MSN you type in the box:&nbsp; Microsoft-edge://msn.com</p>
<p>for YAHOO you would type Microsoft-edge://yahoo.com</p>
<p>for GOOGLE it would be Microsoft-edge://google.com</p>
<p>after you have typed the EDGE and homepage command in the box you click the next button and name the new shortcut Edge. Then click the finish button. Now you will have a new Icon on your desktop that when clicked will open EDGE and your Homepage. If you
 want the new shortcut to look like the EDGE icon did before it disappeared you can change the new shortcut icon into the old EDGE icon by right clicking on the new EDGE icon and click on properties then click on the change icon box.&nbsp;Then click BROWSE box and
 make your way to the Microsoft edge app folder which is in the WINDOWS folder in the sub folder named&nbsp;SystemApps. Once you have the systemApps folder open&nbsp;make your way to the Microsoft&nbsp;Edge folder then you simply click on the MicrosoftEdge.exe command then
 click the open box. This will then open a box&nbsp;with the EDGE icon in it. You click on the edge icon then click OK. Then make your way to clicking the APPLY box and your done. MICROSOFT EDGE RESTORED to your desktop.....not perfect but the best fix I could come
 up with. Hope this helps some like it did me after figuring it out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Welcome to Photo Gallery forum. I understand that you are unable to send photo email using Photo Gallery. To isolate the issue, we would need some information from you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried sending the photo using Windows Live Mail or Outlook.com? Do you receive any error message?
</li><li>Does the issue occur to all photos or on a specific photo? </li><li>What is the file type of the photo? </li><li>What is your Photo Gallery build version? </li><li>When did the issue occur?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi Helene, I have&nbsp;a similar&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p><br />
When I am in Windows Live Photo Gallery and select "Photo Email: send photo as attachment", the "Preparing Files" box pops up. I select the size, the box disappears, and that's it! No email with files attached is created, and no error message occurs, it just
 disappears without a trace. </p>
<p><br />
I use Windows Live Mail as my mail client with my Gmail accounts set up in it and I send and receive mail no problem. I am able to attach pictures to emails within Windows Live Mail.
</p>
<p><br />
If I right click on a picture in File Explorer (my computer) and select "send to: Mail Recipient" it opens an email with the picture in it and it wants to send it to Skydrive (I don't want to do that)!</p>
<p><br />
they are jpg's.</p>
<p><br />
build version 15.4.3538.513</p>
<p><br />
it happens every time and I have never sent photo mail successfully from Windows Live Photo Gallery.</p>
<p><br />
please help </p>
<p><br />
thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for posting here. I understand that you are trying to send&nbsp;a photo email via Photo Gallery but you're having difficulties doing so. Just to clarify, may I know if you have set Windows Live Mail as your default mail client?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, then we request you to do this first to isolate that this is not contributing to the issue. For the steps on how to set Windows Live Mail as your default mail client or program, please follow the steps in this

            I came up with this error recently when trying to send a Word Document shared letter to a friend on email. &nbsp;I then printed the Word article and re scanned the printed document so it would show up as a photo on Photo gallery and and send shared the photo,
 with my friend who then saw it on Sky Drive.
<div><br />
<div>I realized that since I am using Outlook right now, the better solution, would have been to go to sent mail and retrace the conversation thread e mails and fwd them to my friend. Now I know better.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have deactivated from Face Book and would most strongly like to use the other applications of Windows Live, without the necessity of connection with Face Book. I already have a twitter acct. and LinkedIn acct. &nbsp;Thus I hope this could eliminate my need
 for being still have an active account with Face Book. It also would allow me to restrict access to any email acct., from any unwanted contacts from former Face Book contacts.<br />

            It's still awkward for me to send documents or photos via e mail. &nbsp;My printer needs replacement, and has the scanner I use also. &nbsp;The replacement. although within warranty, required me to give my credit info. to the Printer Co. without a specific price
 to pre pay the exchange, of up to 100.00 to send back my printer then be reimbursed after I they received the damaged one, then they would send the replacement one to me. &nbsp;I don't give out my financial info. or debit info. to anyone especially in these cases.
 So I can't really use my printer and scanner all that well until my issues are solved with having a working printer and scanner that is compatible with Windows 7. &nbsp;I have had success with Forwarding documents or email, where necessary to other email contacts.

            <p>Hi Glenda</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for responding so quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail is set as my default email program, the message in&nbsp;"Set Default Programs" when Windows Live is selected says "This Program has all its defaults".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 Home Premium with Service Pack 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to clarify on my post above: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I am in Windows Live Photo Gallery and select "Photo Email: send photo as attachment", the "Preparing Files" box pops up. I select the size, ..... press okay, then a dialog box opens&nbsp;briefly as if WLPG is processing my request, but then ...... the box
 disappears, and that's it! No email with files attached is created, and no error message occurs, it just disappears without a trace. .....(it did work once, but that was it. I closed it and tried again and same result as before)......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<br />
<br />If didn't work try the procedures below:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows key + X, then select Control Panel.
<br />
<br />2. Search for Troubleshooting and click on Troubleshooting.
<br />
<br />3. On the left pane, click on View all and click on Power.
<br />
<br />4. Click on Next and follow the on-screen instruction to troubleshoot the issue.

<br />
<br />If didn't work try the these steps:
<br />
<br />Reset and restore the Power Plans to default.
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows key + X, then select Command Prompt (Admin).
<br />
<br />2. Type in the command:
<br />
<br />powercfg –restoredefaultschemes and press Enter.
<br />
<br />If the battery didn't charge, you can try to contact the manufacture in case you still got warranty on the equipment. 
<br />
<br />Also, check if the adapter is good condition, take out the battery from the device and turn on the computer, check the cables are plug in correctly. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works. 
<br />
<br />Best Regards, 
<br />

            Hi,
<br />I think the best decision for a NEW laptop having warranty is to repair it in a service or replace it.       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn’t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It’s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don’t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack’s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don’t see any improvements after trying all the above, then it’s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

FYI - &nbsp;I am so annoyed by Cortana and have not yet found a way to turn it off - it’s crazy for Microsoft to do such a thing&nbsp;
