<h2>            Strange things happening with high contrast</h2>
                    <p>Setup.&nbsp; I'm running on a Dell Inspiron 580s, Windows 8, Office 365/2013.&nbsp; Background.&nbsp; I have a vision problem&nbsp; that needs help with high contrast.&nbsp; I set up high contrast yesterday and love it, but I've found two strange things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First the easy one.&nbsp; High contrast does not seem to work with OneNote.&nbsp; I haven't checked this thoroughly, but when I tried looking at an existing note, all I saw was a vertically shaped empty rectangle.&nbsp; I turned off the high contrast and my entry was visible.&nbsp;
 I assume that this is something in OneNote that MS already knows about and is working to fix.&nbsp; Sound reasonable?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for the really weird one.&nbsp; I have a Word file in which is stored some critical information.&nbsp; With high contrast turned on, I opened the file and found that the one piece of information I was looking for was blocked out. so that I could not read it.&nbsp;
 I tried three things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; The first copy I looked at was stored on my computer.&nbsp; I closed that and retrieved a copy from SkyDrive.&nbsp; Note: I had not updated the copy on SkyDrive manually in quite a while.&nbsp; It was Not stored in Personal Web where I know automatic updating occurs.&nbsp;
 That copy looked exactly the same as the one from my computer.&nbsp; I then closed that and opened an old copy that I had on a USB stick.&nbsp; Note: I have not updated that in several weeks.&nbsp; But it looked exactly like the other two.&nbsp; The important thing to note is
 that all 3 copies looked exactly alike - that one piece of information, and nothing else, was blocked out.&nbsp; How on earth could the copy on the USB stick look the same?&nbsp; Note also that yesterday I used that particular piece of information from the copy on the
 computer with no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; I reopened the copy from my computer.&nbsp; Then I turned OFF high contrast.&nbsp; Bingo!&nbsp; My information was there and perfectly readable.&nbsp;&nbsp;But when turned high contrast back ON, the information was blocked out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) As a final check, with the copy from my computer still on screen and high contrast on, I positioned the cursor at the immediate end of the blocked area and attempted to paste in the information that I had just copied when I could see and use it successfully.&nbsp;
 The pasted copy was BLOCKED OUT.&nbsp; I know the copying &nbsp;worked because it was a password that I successfully&nbsp;used to log on to a web site a few minutes earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it's possible that when I closed that file yesterday that I had left that password blocked and that the blocking was saved.&nbsp; But, I had not needed to save the file since I hadn't changed anything in it that needed to be saved.&nbsp; I simply closed it.&nbsp; It
 didn't ask me if I wanted to save any changes.&nbsp; Unanswered questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Why does the blocking only appear when high contrast is turned on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) When I save a file to my computer, and where there is a copy on SkyDrive that is NOT in the Personal Web folder, does it get automatically updated on SkyDrive at the same time?&nbsp; If so, this is the first time I've seen that happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) How could any of this possibly have affected another copy stored on a USB stick that hasn't even been in the computer in weeks?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have easily worked around all of this, but the questions still exist and they may be a sign of one or more important problems.&nbsp; FYI, I run Windows Defender quick scan at least twice a day, and I ran a full scan a couple of days ago.&nbsp; No problems found.&nbsp;
 And yes, I do make sure all updates are installed as soon as they become available.&nbsp; I will be amazed if anyone even tries to respond to this, much less successfully answer it.</p>

            <p>Well, I appreciate the response, but I have a couple of problems.&nbsp; I haven't done a screen shot in probably at least 20 years.&nbsp; I checked on the Internet on how to do it, and the first thing that came up was a step-by-step process in&nbsp;wikihow.com that uses
 the Snipping and Paint tools.&nbsp; I've never used either one and really have no idea how to use them or what they are for beyond what I read on wikihow.&nbsp; But I found them easily through Search Apos, but neither one was in the least obvious and what I did see
 did not agree with what I had just read.&nbsp; For example, the default is supposed to be PRG in Windows 8 but when I tried it, it came back with JPEG.&nbsp; Right away I could see I had a problem because of the file size - and this was supposed to be a picture of an
 Internet screen with High Contrast turned off.&nbsp; I was trying to save it in Word (which wikihow said was possible), but it actually just saved it as another IE screen, which is no help whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any event, I don't see what good a couple of screen shots are because all they will show is how the colors changed and what is no longer visible (for example, identification at the top of the screen on the BBC News website that it is in fact just that).&nbsp;
 I'm not going to take a screen shot of the Word file that I mentioned and upload that because it contains&nbsp;password information that is for my use only and not to be seen by anyone else.&nbsp; I think I can demonstrate the difference as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you have to use your imagination here.&nbsp; I don't know what this will look like after I submit it, but what it is supposed to look like is an imaginary password next to the phrase "Sample entry", and then below that the same thing but
<u>totally</u> greyed out so that all you see is the grey.&nbsp; I created this example in Word using a dark grey through which I could just make out the contents so that you'd know it really was the same word, and then copied and pasted it here.&nbsp; Whether that will
 work or not is anybody's guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sample entry - a36MLqu9</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sample entry as it appeared with high contrast - </p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000"><span>a36MLqu9</span></font></font></font></p>

            <p>Good tip.&nbsp; I'm a regular SkyDrive user, but that approach never occurred to me.&nbsp; It's certainly a lot simpler than what I had seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've made some other changes which are handling the issue satisfactorily for now, so I'm not going to try to use High Contrast.&nbsp; I even ran into another strange problem, apparently with it, that tipped the balance.&nbsp; I was writing something while using high
 contrast&nbsp;in an e-mail that I wanted to make&nbsp;bold and Italicized, something I do frequently.&nbsp; I was able to do that with no problem, but when I tried to turn them off the bold wouldn't respond at all.&nbsp; It was like it simply didn't recognize my left click.&nbsp;
 I turned off high contrast and it worked fine.&nbsp; There have been just enough issues come up that I think high contrast is too flaky to depend upon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I've done alternatively is to increase the general display size on the screen (for the desktop only - the laptop size is fine) from small (100%) to medium (125%).&nbsp; That doesn't help with the ribbons in Office, but it helps a lot with IE.&nbsp; After some
 pretty thorough investigating, I've set my basic font to Tahoma 11 Black.&nbsp; 11 seems fine for now, and I can always change it if I want to.&nbsp; I haven't tried changing the more limited display size option, but I'll look into it when I get a chance.&nbsp; I can't recall
 right at the moment the correct term, but I also went through the process of increasing the clarity of the fonts.&nbsp; I don't know whether it helped or not, but it didn't hurt anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upshot of all of this is that I think I'm going to forget about high contrast, at least for the time being, which means we can probably close down this thread.&nbsp; But I really appreciate your interest in helping and especially the screen shot tip.</p>

<h2>            Double booking accepting on the Meeting room.</h2>
                    
<p>When a user try's to book the Conference Room from the outlook click its allow the double booking. OWA also its allowing the double booking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Need some suggestion help to fix that issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi pradeepb8658,</p>
<p>thanks for your detailed updates.</p>
<p>i notice that the first booking has been made as an all-day event. when choosing an all-day event in the outlook client, the status will show as free and that’s maybe why the room accepts another event.</p>
<p>please change the setting of <b>maximum allowed minutes</b> to a value less than 1440 (default value) to have the room send a decline when an all-day event is chosen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c413c29d-1a6d-4bec-927a-abfc9b9f7ea9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c413c29d-1a6d-4bec-927a-abfc9b9f7ea9" /></a></p>
<p>if the issue persists, i need to collect some information below for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1. has the first booker received the “your request was accepted” message from the conference room?</p>
<p>2. create a non-all-day event first and then check if it still accepts double booking.</p>
<p>3.the output after running the command below in exchange online powershell.</p>
<p><b>get-calendarprocessing -identity "roommailboxname" | fl</b></p>
<p>please replace the <strong>roommailboxname</strong> with the conference room name. to connect to exchange online using remote powershell:</p>

    <title>Creating Rules in Outlook.Com - A Few Questions&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brothertank  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating Rules in Outlook.Com - A Few Questions&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently decided to remove the hundreds of e-mail addresses that I used to just block as you were only allowed to have 1024 addresses in the list and as such thought that I could just create Rules to block these unwanted E-mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started with the Big Ones that we all seem to get no matter what sites you go to, as once you post your e-mail address in a forum or community like this one, the idiots scan through and grab us to send us e-mails from Pharmacies and those Damn Viagra e-mails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a rule that included searching not only the Subject of the e-mail but also the message itself and told it if it found these words to delete the e-mails, and it seemed to work fine until about a week or so when a few started getting through.&nbsp;&nbsp; So
 that led me to asking these specific questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Can you use wildcards within the word lists that you create as part of your rule.... Ie: the idiots will deliberately use a misspelling of a word to get around these rules.&nbsp;&nbsp; So could you use "viag*.*" as a rule that would catch all the various spellings
 they use for Viagra... ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When creating rules within Outlook.com are the words checked Case Sensitive??&nbsp; Ie:&nbsp; Again using the little blue pill example... will entering "Viagra" capture "VIAGRA" or any variation on capitalization that one can create to try and get by the rules??&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are the two biggest questions that I have on Outlook.Com at the moment and would really appreciate an answer as I have asked during the surveys they have sent on us using the software and would we recommend it and it asks if we have any questions or
 feedback..&nbsp; I have asked these same questions now about 6 times in the last 3 months without any answer - So I would love if any of the Microsoft Tech's could answer this one for all of us as this is not listed in the help or anywhere on the Outlook site or
 software... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...</p>
<p>William</p>

<p>I am a Beta Tester for Windows 10 and I called as you suggested - I got Jaqualin (not sure on the spelling of her name) but I was informed that I needed to pay a service charge to get her help ...&nbsp; She told me that I could&nbsp;use wildcards and that it did check
 for words regardless of&nbsp;case, but that she would need to change some settings in the program to do it?&nbsp; And that was the reason for the service charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then asked why or if these settings could be changed by me as I have not seen anything like that in any of the help pages within your site.&nbsp; She didn't have an answer other than to say that it was time to hang up because I wasn't paying the service charge
 based on your answer that I call YOU. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not acceptable as an answer or a way to treat a user and Beta Tester of your software.&nbsp; I have been a Beta tester since Windows 95.&nbsp; And while your system says that I have been a member since 2011, that is completely wrong as I got this Hotmail address when
 Hotmail was originally added to your system.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to use the Outlook that came within Windows, but then you made it part of Office suite of programs and have graciously given us this On-line version.&nbsp; But the Help files for the online version are lacking
 valuable information such as the questions I&nbsp;asked for an answer to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I must ask based on her confusion - Are there settings within the programs to allow the use of Wildcards and the Scanning regardless of Case??&nbsp; If so where are these settings to change to allow us to use these features or are they only available to
 those that subscribe to the software or purchase it outright??</p>

<p>I am a Beta Tester for Windows 10 and I called as you suggested - I got Jaqualin (not sure on the spelling of her name) but I was informed that I needed to pay a service charge to get her help ...&nbsp; She told me that I could&nbsp;use wildcards and that it did check
 for words regardless of&nbsp;case, but that she would need to change some settings in the program to do it?&nbsp; And that was the reason for the service charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then asked why or if these settings could be changed by me as I have not seen anything like that in any of the help pages within your site.&nbsp; She didn't have an answer other than to say that it was time to hang up because I wasn't paying the service charge
 based on your answer that I call YOU. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not acceptable as an answer or a way to treat a user and Beta Tester of your software.&nbsp; I have been a Beta tester since Windows 95.&nbsp; And while your system says that I have been a member since 2011, that is completely wrong as I got this Hotmail address when
 Hotmail was originally added to your system.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to use the Outlook that came within Windows, but then you made it part of Office suite of programs and have graciously given us this On-line version.&nbsp; But the Help files for the online version are lacking
 valuable information such as the questions I&nbsp;asked for an answer to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I must ask based on her confusion - Are there settings within the programs to allow the use of Wildcards and the Scanning regardless of Case??&nbsp; If so where are these settings to change to allow us to use these features or are they only available to
 those that subscribe to the software or purchase it outright??</p>

<p>Yes, she was getting a little rude which made me curious and I pushed a little because I didn't think that was the Microsoft way of doing things.&nbsp; I know you have service options that you sell to companies, but as an individual is there a way to get these
 questions answered or the help pages updated by calling the official numbers??</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my questions still remain when creating rules in the on-line version of Outlook.com :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Can Wildcards be used when adding words into the conditions searched within the Subject and/or the Body of the E-Mail??</p>
<p>
</p><p>ie: can "viag*.*" be used to search for Viagra and misspellings like viagara??</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Does Case matter??&nbsp;When it is searching through the&nbsp;E-Mail&nbsp;Subject or Body will it pick up on various uses of Case of these words being searched for??</p>
<p>
</p><p>ie: does Viagra pick up on all lower case spelling of the word or weird variations using case of the letters to beat rules created?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked high and low for answers to those questions within the help pages for Outlook and it is not explained anywhere if these two items are available and active or if there is a setting that must be changed to allow for them to be used/searched for??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I was just going through the different options for blocking e-mails and there is also the e-mail address or domain block but it doesn't give an example on blocking a domain range..&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that adds another question - Can you add a wildcard for the domains... </p>
<p>
</p><p>When blocking a domain do you just add the "@blocked.com" or does it require 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** to make it work?&nbsp; Also can you block across domains using say 
*@pharmacy* or *@*pharmacy* as a multiple domain block??&nbsp; Or must you just have a separate block for each domain that you wish to block?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amazing - With a few simple rules and targeted domain blocks we could essentially block most of the useless e-mails that we are all being targeted with because they found our e-mail address somewhere..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's question 3 then..&nbsp; The above question on blocking e-mail addresses and domains...??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with these 3 questions would be a great help to us all and should be included in the online help information..
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First the bad news: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; You can't use wildcards in the Rules word lists to catch variations of the same word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;In the Rules the words are not Case sensitive, so entering a word into a rule in lower case will catch words with various Upper Case or Capitalization.&nbsp; So that is a good thing..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The question&nbsp;on using wildcards in address and domain blocks can only be used as
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** and it will catch all mail from the domain after the @ sign.</p>
<p>So you can't enter a domain block like *@pharm*.com or
*@*pharm.com to catch the variations that the idiots use sending the various&nbsp;e-mails pushing the little blue pills and such...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I talked with Henry from Outlook.com support over a number of e-mails to get the information so that it could be easily understood&nbsp;by both of us and he was a great help.&nbsp; In fact he's going to suggest to the people&nbsp;in charge of programing the Outlook program
 to do what I asked...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So he's asking them to allow us to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Use wildcards in the Rules wordlists that we create&nbsp;so that we don't have to enter in each variation that they use in spelling the words (including their use of misspelled words).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;He's going to suggest that our rules not only run on the Inbox, but allow&nbsp;us to scan the Junk-Mail box as well as it will help weed out the mail we don't want to see from the actual mail that landed in the Junk-mail box for whatever reason that we do
 wish to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In the blocking of e-mail domain, he's going to ask that we at least be able to use a block of "*@*pharm*.com to catch any e-mail with the "pharm" in it's address but we will have to duplicate the rule&nbsp;to&nbsp;search other domains like ".ca", ".net" or say
 ".biz" or any domain that we need to block.&nbsp; If they can also allow the wildcard to&nbsp;block on the final domain would&nbsp;also be nice, but we will have to wait and see what the programmers can do.&nbsp; It really shouldn't be that hard, but I don't know (nor does he)
 how far&nbsp;they are willing to go...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But all in all he really liked the suggestions as they would really add to the program in giving us more control over the e-mails we receive each day.&nbsp; It would really increase the power of the program itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't get the answers I was looking for, but at least they will be forwarded by a&nbsp;Tech from a Windows 10&nbsp;Beta Tester (me) to the people that look after the program and that should give it more weight when they look to add new ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's it for now...&nbsp; I'll keep you informed if I get any more information from Henry and hopefully some good news next time..
</p>
<p>

    <title>The Nokia N96 - A terrible phone&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eaststand  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Nokia N96 - A terrible phone&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I took delivery of the new N96 2 days ago, and am horrified about how poor it is. Main problem: THE MUSIC PLAYER DOESNT WORK!!!<br />
I try to load music and it finds them, although interestly, not flac format, yet when I come to play them, it works the first time, when I reopen the player, I'm greeted with a general system error when I try to play music. I have to take the battery out and
 reset it to get it to work again.<br />
<br />
I've completely reset the phone and it occurs time and time again.<br />
<br />
I'm posting this here in the hope the makers of this phone know about this, frankly, pathetic problem, seeing as there countless posts on other forums with this fault, and no solution.<br />
<br />
I have been a strictly Nokia only person for at least 10 years, but unless you can sort this out, I'm going to have to give this 'phone' back and get a decent phone.<br />
<br />
Thank you.

You mentioned on another post about orange. Do you have the orange branded version?<br />

            i also have an n96 and allthough it has a few tiny little bugs it works really well and iam quite suprised how stable it is for its second firmware<br />
<br />
my music player works fine and i have 14 days worth of music on it over the 16gb internal memory and 16gb external micro sd card<br />
<br />
mine is ubranded and works fine i suggest maybe as the above poster said it could well be the orange firmware on it if its branded operastors are known to mess up nokia phones by putting their own branding on it<br />
<br />
if you want to change handsets then go for it but the n96 works fine for me and iam quite happy with it<br />
<br />
ive had 14 days to return it peace of mind , but i wont be using it iam very happy with the n96 and the music player i find very good indeed much better then the n95-1 in terms of audio quality through my cx-500s<br />
<br />
also id wait for 24 hours for a reply from nokia the same as most companys , the email team probably only work from 9am tll 5pm and probably have 1000s to awnswer<br />
<br />
anyways good luck with your phone

            What you've just said about unbrabded phones is very true.<br />
<br />
Anyone thiking of purchasing a phone has to make a decision between paying more for a sim free/unbranded phone or paying less for a network branded phone on contract.<br />
<br />
It is important to know beforehand that most networks actually modify the phone firmware on their contract phones and sometimes the modifications extend to more then just branding. A lot of issues that would be brought up here would actually be related to such
 modifications.<br />
<br />
In my opinion Sim free phones are worth that little bit extra because<br />
<br />
1. They have all the options enabled (Some networks disable certain functions such as VOIP on the N95)<br />
2. You don't have to wait for the networks to approve firmware updates<br />
3. For some reason they work better and have fewer bugs<br />
4. No network branding on the phone<br />
5. Not simlocked

    <title>Conditional Formatting for exceptions to recurring appointments in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lawrencemeisel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional Formatting for exceptions to recurring appointments in Outlook 2010 or 2013</h2>
                    <p>I see clients on a weekly basis. So I make a recurring appointment for them (e.g. once a week on Mondays&nbsp;from 2 to 3 pm). I'd like to keep track of their attendance for each occurrance. If they attend I want to color the occurrence Green, If they call to
 cancel I want to color the occurrence Yellow. If they do not attend without calling to cancel I want to color the occurrence Red.
</p>
<p>This was possible in Outlook 2007 by respectively labeling categories for Green, Yellow and Red to Attended, Cancel, and No Show, and then applying the category to individual occurrences in the appointment series.
</p>
<p>How can I get this function back in Outlook 2010?</p>

<h2>            Excel can&#39;t sort date accordingly</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a long list of date, before I copied them into new worksheet these cells come from different worksheets, different PC, different excel version. &nbsp;I wonder if that is the reason why I can't sort it properly. but each cell formatted as date and the only
 similarities I see on the miss-sorted date is their left indentation. While the dates above is well sorted and right indent. I'm not touching anything on indentation previously.Is that a clue to anything? Please advice. Thank you</p>

Hello, I am running into an issue with my Visual Studio 2017 Professional.</p>
<p>
When I complete my design in my Visual Studio, my run-time display is different (Player is at different position)</p>
<p>
Form: Auto-size = False, Dimension: 1000, 800</p>
<p>
Player: Auto-size = True, Dimension: 75, 37</p>
<p>
How can I make the whole form show up when I run it and why is the player not where I designed him to be at?</p>

    <title>Query is suddenly slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> accessuser1211  say:</h3>
<h2>            Query is suddenly slow</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I've created and been using a query for a month now with only 65 records and the query has been running<br />
very fast (almost immediate) until recently. Now it runs extremely slow even with a few records.<br />
<br />
I have not changed any code so I am stumped as to why it's suddenly sooo slow.<br />
<br />
The query is "Query4"...which is made up of a series of 3 queries, specifically:<br />
<br />
Query 4 --queries Query3, <br />
Query3 --queries Query2<br />
Query2 --queries Query1<br />
<br />
I am not doing anything funky other than using a dconcat function.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I'm worried that this will run EVEN more slow as more records are added.<br />
<br />
Here's the link to my stripped down db.&nbsp; <br />

<p>I have used the above on Join tables and it works fine.&nbsp; Just create a query for Locations and Courses (seperate queries) and then add them to your query.&nbsp; However, remember no matter what you will not be able to edit the data when doing that.&nbsp; So if that
 is what you want to do then you may have to use subforms.&nbsp; You can have two, one with the Line items and another with the locations.&nbsp; The subforms can be continuous but the main form cannot.</p>

            <p>Hello FlipetyFlop:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the clarification and I apologize I did not realize you were referring to collection management on the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are correct that there is no option to mass select the music in your collection to be added to a playlist or Now Playing.&nbsp; I will be sure this is brought up as a suggested feature to be added to the site.&nbsp; To increase visibility of your concern please
 add your comments on this to our feature and suggestion thread, <span>
<font color="#000000"><a href="http://xboxmusic.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://xboxmusic.uservoice.com</font></a>.&nbsp;
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">I am not sure if this will make things any easier for you but you can drag and drop albums or songs&nbsp;to Now Playing or a specific Playlist.&nbsp; I tend to find this a bit less time
 consuming then clicking the + symbol and then selecting the location I would like to copy it to.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</font></span></p>

<strong>I suggest you connect using HTTPS. To do that, follow the steps below:</strong><br />
<span>1. Go to https://account.live.com (if that doesnt work try this link https://www.hotmail.com instead)</span><br />
<span>2. Under Other options click on Connect with HTTPS</span><br />
<span>3. Choose Use HTTPS automatically</span><br />

    <title>Different Spaces Between Heading Styles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bc315  say:</h3>
<h2>            Different Spaces Between Heading Styles</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am working on a document that requires 14 spaces after a second level heading, but 24 spaces before the third level heading. The problem is when I have the third level heading directly after the second level heading. In this case, I would need exactly a 12
 point space between the second and third level heading. I cannot figure out how to do this without making either all the spaces before the 3rd level heading only 12 points (they should normally be 24 points), or without making all the spaces after the 2nd
 level heading 12 points (it should normally be 14 points).<br />
<br />
In sum, I suppose my question is whether it's possible to change one scenario of a heading's spacing (i.e., when the 2nd and 3rd level headings are sequential with no text between them) without automatically changing all the rest of that heading's spacing anytime
 it appears in a document. <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
Brandon<br />

            The problem is always the overlapping of "space after" of a given paragraph with the "space before" of the next. At some point, they are bound to add up. What you need to do is:
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Define all styles with ZERO Space After, or</li><li>Define all styles with ZERO Space Before</li></ul>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>There will always be exceptions, of course. For instance, if you have a title, then some bullets, then another title, and you want the first and last bullets to be separate from the titles:</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TITLE 1</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• Bullet 1</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• Bullet 2</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;• Bullet 2</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;TITLE 2</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;…</div>
<div><br />
<div>For the case above, the exception will be either the first bullet (will need a space before, if you use space before in titles) or the last bullet (will need a space after, if you use space after in titles). Don't use both attributes, to avoid headaches.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For those bulleted exceptions, and the case you mentioned, define alternate styles. For instance, "Heading 2 SA0," "Heading 3 SB12," etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Stay away from blank paragraphs, of course. Properly-formatted text does not admit them, as they can fall at the top of a page and create a gap between the text and the header.</div>

            This has happened to me a few times when I've set up a new partnership with one of my windows mobile devices.&nbsp; What finally worked was as follows:<br />
<br />
Delete your existing ActiveSync partnership<br />
Connect your device to your computer and set up a new partnership.&nbsp; When you are prompted to sync data, select only the Contact data to sync.<br />
After the sync is done, check the device to see if the contacts are there.<br />
Assuming your contacts sync correctly, select another data element to sync (appointments) so now you'll be syncing 2 data items.&nbsp; Sync the data and then check to make sure all data synced correctly.<br />
Then add the next data item to sync.<br />
<br />
Proceed in this fashion, checking after every sync to make sure all your data is on the device, until you have synced everything you wish to sync.<br />
<br />
From that time forward, you should be able to keep your device updated by syncing everything at one time.

<p><span><span>To insert column in your Word document, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />
1. Position your cursor where you would like to insert the columns<br />
<br />
2. Open the Page Layout ribbon<br />

3. In the Page Setup section, click Columns<br />
<br />
4. From the dropdown menu, select the number of columns you’d like to insert<br />
<br />
5. Word will automatically insert the columns in your document. <br />
<br />
Additionally, you may decide that you’d like to make one column shorter than the other. This can be done easily by inserting a column break.
<br />
<br />
To insert a column break, follow these steps: <br />
<br />
1. Position your cursor where you would like to insert the column break<br />
<br />
2. Open the Page Layout ribbon<br />
<br />
3. In the Page Setup section, click Breaks<br />
<br />
4. From the dropdown menu, select column<br />
<br />
5. Any text typed will begin in the next column. If there is already text following the cursor, it will be moved to the next column<br />
<br />
you may not want the entire page to contain columns. In that case, you can simply insert a continuous break in your document. You can insert one before and one after the section that contains columns. This can add a dramatic effect to your document.
<br />
<br />
To insert a continuous break, follow these steps: <br />
<br />
1. Position your cursor where you would like to insert the first break<br />
<br />
2. Open the Page Layout ribbon<br />
<br />
3. In the Page Setup section, click Breaks<br />
<br />
4. From the dropdown menu, select continuous<br />
<br />
5. You can apply separate page setup formatting to different sections as you desire.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Try this:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp; Switch on your
<strong>Show/Hide</strong> characters.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp; Before going further,&nbsp;have a look for anything odd displayed by the Show/Hide characters in your text in case this is causing the problem.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp; Open a new Word document</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp; Press &lt;ENTER&gt; a couple of times (this will give you the option of creating some text - perhaps a heading - before you start the two-column format)</span></p>

Windows Server 2008 R2</a> operating systems to include support for this new Indian rupee symbol. This update includes font support, locale changes, and keyboard support. With the Windows update, it is now possible to use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">alt code</a> text entry to obtain the Indian Rupee symbol - Alt 8377. (as of May 2012, testing this alt-code (Windows 7, MS Office 2010, and Canadian Multilingual Keyboard): it works fine in MS
 Word, MS OneNote, and MS Outlook. Does not work in MS Excel, nor does it work in Windows Notepad. It did not work for entry in a Facebook status update either. However, a workaround is that if you have the symbol in MS Word, you can copy the text character
 (highlight it and Ctrl C), then go to other application and paste it (Ctrl V), and the symbol appears exactly correct in each of these 3 mentioned applications.)" See

<p>
</p><p><span>FWIW, I couldn't find this character even in Arial Unicode MS or any Indic script font on a brand-new Windows 7 system, but if I type 20B9 in a Word document and press Alt+X, I get it, and I find that it is present in (and inserted from) the Tahoma
 font.</span></p>

<h2>            Flight mode &#43; SMS - nokia 6300</h2>
                    Is there any way to set flight mode to still allow network access for sending and&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;text messages? If not through flight mode, is there any other way to do this? I specifically want to be able to disable incoming and outgoing phones calls made
 before a specific time so that i don't go over my daytime minutes.&nbsp;

            No, I'm afraid that isn't possible.<br />
<br />
In order to send/receive SMS messages, the phone needs access to the network, which in turn is going to enable calls.<br />
<br />
Also, given that your phone is a basic java-based phone and not a Symbian smartphone, it's unlikely that there's any 3rd party software to do this for you.

I have to depend compulsorily on the icons for these functions&nbsp; in the ribbon at the top.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also at times when I try to cut some cell, row, column, I get message you cannot Cut , use Copy Paste in place. Thus I am forced to Copy, Paste or Insert from ribbon and go the source and delete it.</p>

            Hi Sumangal
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />
3. Try repairing your office installation (Quick repair is good enough). Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

<p>Thanks Vijay</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started excel in safe mode as advised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I do not seem to have any active add ins</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. App Data does not have have any Office or Excel Folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. XLStart also did not Show any thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. ALT+F11 Takes me to some Visual Basic Options which I could not understand</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I tried both Quick Repair and Online Repair</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem remains unsolved. Cut, Delete, Insert remain disabled in right click menu. At time I am not permitted to to Cut from Ribbon at top, in place I am asked to copy / paste which in turn does not move formulas as they are</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only thing now which remains to be done is complete uninstall &amp;. reinstall</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

            Actually this problem gets solved by point 2. This is the first time, point 2 is failing for these kind of problems. Before I recommend complete reinstall again, can you tell me whether Office copy is activated. 
<br />Open Excel &gt; File &gt; Account &gt; See if this shows as activated. 
<br />Did you try putting the below in Windows Key+R
<br />%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for writing on the Windows Phone 8 forum support. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you check id you have complete all your data on account.live.com? Was given you the possibility to accept the new Windows Phone 8 Store conditions?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here below I’ve attached a link with all possible solutions to solve the problem.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another cause of the problem could be due by a wrong communication between your phone and Microsoft Server at the time of the activation code. In this case I’d suggest you to reset your phone.</p>
<p>Here below I’ve attached the link in which are explained how to do it. You will need to back up all your phone content because it will be erased with the reset process.</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 &#40;Office 365&#41; user interface &#40;GUI&#41; freezes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frank&#39;s_q&#38;a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 &#40;Office 365&#41; user interface &#40;GUI&#41; freezes but I can still save and close workbooks</h2>
                    <p>I frequently have a problem with Excel 2016 (Office 365). Without apparent cause, most of the GUI freezes. I.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't select cells anymore;</li><li>the menu ribbon is frozen;</li><li>sometimes main elements of the ribbon go green and the spreadsheet appears empty where there should be content;</li><li>BUT the Save, close (x) and resize buttons at the very top still work.</li></ul>
<p>Saving all files and closing all Excel windows and restarting Excel solves the problem.</p>
<p>I work with Excel a lot and the problem occurs approximately once a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any input is welcome. I don't even know what to search for to see if others have the same problem. I also don't know if it is a problem with one of the workbooks that I'm working on, if it is an Excel problem or even a Win 10 problem (I also have the issues
 with the graphics driver crashing all the time that so many other Win 10 users have). I installed Office 2016 after doing a clean install of Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running this on a Surface Pro 3 (256GB, i5). UPDATE (April 28, 2016): Just got a new Surface Pro 4 (256GB, i7) and started from a clean slate - still the same problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE (April 2016)</p>
<p><strong>I found another <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">work-around:</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, thank you for that suggestion! I have been using Excel without hardware graphics acceleration for a few weeks now and the problem is mostly solved. I have not had the complete GUI freeze anymore (see suggestion further down in this forum). So this is
 a good work-around.</p>
<p>The only thing I notice now, is that the interface around the box that shows the formula in a selected cell is often not showing up properly. For example, the "insert function" button or the buttons next to it do not show up properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE (Feb 1, 2016)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I found a </strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>work around:</strong></span></p>
<p>I am 100% certain by now that this is a problem relating to the display driver. Something gets set wrong in the display driver (sorry if my language is technically not 100% correct, I'm not a software engineer). So I figured if I get the display driver to
 reload or at least update some basic parameters of my display, Excel should be displayed normally again.</p>
<p>My first attempt was to disable the display driver. Windows complained a bit but, sure enough, it did the trick. My next step was to change the display resolution (just to revert the changes right away). Worked again.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>The simplest trick for me is to turn off my external display and turn it on again.</strong>
</span><br />
</p>
It's not ideal but not the worst solution either. And hopefully at some point Microsoft will fix the issue.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE (Jan 11, 2016):</p>
<p>I have an UPDATE to my first post:</p>
<p>Another major issue I have been dealing with since I upgraded to Win10 and Office 2016 is that my display / graphics card driver has been crashing frequently (I'm using a Surface Pro 3).</p>
<p class="contentStandard">A couple of days ago Excel acted up on me again and I was about to close out everything and restart Excel. Just then, I got a notification that display driver has crashed and has recovered AND right when the notification came up,
 Excel's GUI returned to normal. Everything worked again. It is hard for me to pin down the causation but I'm certain now that the two are related. I have Excel open 99% of the time. So it's hard for me to tell if Excel is causing trouble with the graphics
 card driver or the other way around. In fact, I can't say for sure whether Excel is the only (Office) program that has this problem. It just happens to be the one I work with A LOT.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I also think I can rule out a specific spreadsheet as being the cause of the problem. I have had the problem with a couple of spreadsheets now.
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Seems like the Microsoft moderators quickly ran out of ideas. Does anyone else have some ideas what the problem/solution might be?

            <p>I have a very similar issue. Several times a day I encounter the following issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Images in a spreadsheet will "disappear"</li><li>The menu ribbon will "disappear" (but if I click the top right corner where I know the X, the file will close and save)</li><li>The cursor will disappear and I cannot click on anything, whether to select a cell or bring up a menu. However the arrow keys still work.
</li></ol>
<p>The above issues seem to only affect one spreadsheet and not other open spreadsheets. The issues are all rectified by closing down the spreadsheet in question and reopening it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I have noticed that when I am in the Select Data box, if I add a new item then amend anything in the right hand side (typically where dates go), it will forget any changes I already made (such as adding a new item).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Excel 2016 on Office 365, Windows 10 Home, on a Dell Inspiron.</p>

<p><span><span>We understand how you feel about this issue, let me assist you further.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Let’s open Excel in application Safe Mode and check how it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do that, press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.
</span></p>
<p><span>In the Run open box type in ‘Excel /safe’ and hit ok.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: There is a space between excel and /.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If application safe mode works, try disabling the add-ins associated with Office applications and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do that, do the following:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Word or Excel Click on File and then click on options.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the Options Window click on Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select Com Add-ins in the Manage list in the Add-ins section and click Go. Now uncheck the all the add-ins and click Ok.</span></p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for the tip.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to try this out. But just to confirm you are talking about MS Office's own add-ins? I don't have any other add-ins installed and even the MS Office add-ins show as inactive. In fact, at the moment, I don't have many things installed other than
 Office.</p>
<p>Also, if it's one of the add-ins that are part of the Office package and I actually need to use them, what should I do?</p>

            <p>I spotted the same in December - might be related to the recent (Dec) Office 2016 update as I don't recall happening it before?</p>

<h2>            Outlook Calendar Sharing from Current Date &#40;not sharing past dates&#41;</h2>

            Hi PJillyPeppers,
<br />No, sorry you can't share from a point forward.  
<br />
<br />You would need to archive the older items (or move them to a new calendar) or, send a copy of the calendar by email (this calendar will not update).  Both of these options require Outlook desktop.

<h2>            Data Sense App Now Missing</h2>
                    New Lumia 520 (ATT) for about one week. Just realized the Data Sense app, City Lens app, and Local Scout apps have disappeared. How do I get them back? Especially the Data Sense app, which is critical to have. I did get most of the Black update, which
 I am glad to have, but really need that Data Sense app. Thanks for help.

<p>You won't find Data Sense there .. What&nbsp;<font color="#FF9900"><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/377786D7-B3DF-46D0-A231-A45EFE90C6B9"><font color="#FF9900"><span>poochini21</span></font></a></strong></font><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;suggested
 is to update all the 'System Applications' in that link using the QR Code and then check again if you get the Data sense application. You may also use

<u><strong>THIS</strong></u></a> application to check for the updates of all 'System Applications'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, did you have the Data Sense application earlier ? I am not sure but AT&amp;T may not be supporting it. Contact them to confirm ..&nbsp;</p>
