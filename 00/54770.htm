<h2>            No print dialog box in 8.1</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;When printing pictures from my file explorer, I used to be able to select 2, 4, etc. pictures per page but I no longer have that - it goes into printing one picture per page automatically. &nbsp;I do have
 a very quick pop up of the box but it looks like it just has an error code or something on it; too fast to read. &nbsp;I have tried this with two different printers (neither one wireless) and the same thing happens with both. &nbsp;With both the HP and the Epson printers
 I have made sure they are the default printers, I removed all updates for the past two months (then reinstalled when it made no difference and that made no difference either), tried printing from different drives, and disabled all windows media programs since
 some said that helped. &nbsp;Any ideas?</span>

            I had done a restore too but forgot to mention that. &nbsp;Troubleshooting didn't find anything wrong because nothing was wrong with my system or the file explorer - for some reason Paint had become the default picture/printing program. &nbsp;I don't use it and
 hadn't had any reason to reselect a default but there it was (I am the only user on the machine). Once I went back to using the picture viewer all was back to normal. Thanks so much for responding; I was totally flummoxed!

<h2>            Skype Name</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sister forgot her Skype password, when suddenly prompted to enter the password she had no idea since the Skype account was created eons ago and with a registered recovery email address that she no longer used. Obviously she was unable to recover her password
 or change the account password.&nbsp; So I volunteered to help her create a new account as it was mentioned here that this would be the easiest option.&nbsp; Wrong!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>New account was created with a non MS email address, and so accordingly with the new MS procedure of no more unique Skype Names her account Skype name came out &nbsp; Live:XXXXXXX &nbsp;&nbsp; which was OK since I was pre-warned this would be the case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is no one (to include me) can find her when doing a contacts search.&nbsp; We've given out the Live:XXXXXX,&nbsp; as well as the email address used to create the account, and even the full attempt at Live:*** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;&nbsp; And, on top of that she is unable
 to find any contacts at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read nearly every forum entry on the subject and those that are remotely close to the subject until I'm blue in the face.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there must be some simple solution for the masses as I've noticed I'm not alone with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further advice would most certainly be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you in advance,</p>
<p>CFL</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Sleep Mode Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stormyknight007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Sleep Mode Not Working</h2>
                    <p>When I put my computer in sleep mode and then try to awaken it, the computer doesn't respond and I have to press the power button to start it again- defeating the purpose of the sleep mode.</p>
<p>Hibernate seems to be working fine but I prefer the sleep mode over hibernate.
</p>
<p>Is there going to be a fix for this in the near future or has it been reported as a bug?</p>

</p><p><span>Please reply to the following question:</span></p>
<p><span>Did you receive any error message? If yes, please reply with the error message and the error code.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you do a Clean Boot. Please follow the steps below to do a clean boot:</span></p>
<p><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow: </span>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start
 normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Important:
</span></em></strong><em><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a
 program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your
 computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists.
 If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.</span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</span></p>

<p>I have the same problem, I think it has to do with windows 10 set up a pin reset every time you boot up and this may be interfering with the sleep function, just guessing, waiting for response from Microsoft.</p>

            When sleep mode is not functioning on your Windows 10 I think you should 2 things the first is the display adapter and the second is Advanced power options. I have seen a nice article on the web which could help you vitally&nbsp;<a href="http://www.howto-connect.com/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode-not-working/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How
 to Fix Windows 10 Sleep Mode Not Working</a>. Old drivers of the display adapter always mess up things whereas Advanced power options directly ask&nbsp;you whether&nbsp;you want your system to send to Sleep mode or not.

            I have an ASUS Q302LA 64 bit and have found the solution for me. I went to the ASUS website and input my model number and it gave me the correct Windows 10 update for the smart gesture on the touch pad. I uninstalled the old program from the computer and
 downloaded and installed the new one. Once the computer finished restarting from the installation I went to a page online and it worked perfect.

            Before thinking about rolling back your drivers, check control panel -&gt; devices -&gt; trackpad.&nbsp; The upgrade to Windows 10 turned off this feature on my laptop.&nbsp; &nbsp;I just switched it back on there.&nbsp; Much smarter than rolling back a driver :)

</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that is usually good since it cuts down on the wild goose chase suggestions that will never work paving the way for real suggestions that actually do work.</p>

<p>Well... your way is really most elegant than mine..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I´m just saying that´s actually a virus... It is accompanied by the installation of multiple alphanumeric folders in Program Files and AppData,&nbsp;that can be&nbsp;deleted restarting in Safe Mode</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also deleted iThemes 5 folder in Program Files, after stop de iThemes service (by services.msc)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>After that, I searched "ithemes" in windows registry, found it in Themes service DependOnService key and i have wiped it out (it appears twice).</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Registry cleaned by cCleaner. restart and done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real iThemes 5 its a wordpress plugin that has nothing to do in client side...</p>

            <p>When I make instructions on how to fix things, from my experience fixing things, I think and remember that some folks are just not comfortable editing the registry so if there are some other ways to achieve the same results (like Command Prompt) I will try
 to stick with that...&nbsp; most everybody can handle that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And with this Themes Service problem I have never actually seen it or had my hands on a system that was afflicted in this manner.&nbsp; If I could actually see it I would know more about it and might make the instructions different or more inclusive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can reproduce the errors on my system by manually breaking things (because I know what the error messages are trying to tell me) and if I can do that then I can come up with instructions that will work for everybody regardless of their Windows troubleshooting
 skill level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if the issue is virus related then I hope you use something will a little more oomph than Windows Defender to scan your system for problems - at least the free version of Malwarebytes and at least the free AdwCleaner (also mentioned in the discussion).&nbsp;
 They are the malware experts - not Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            star wars battlefront 2 original won&#39;t work on my 360</h2>
                    <p>hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>at the beginning of this week, i purchased star wars battlefront 2 (the original one) of the xbox store on my 360. at the time i didn't get the chance to try downloading it, so i had to wait until saturday. once it finally finished downloading, i eagerly
 went to play it. only to discover it won't work. it get the "can not start noe, please download the game again" or whatever it actually says error message</p>
<p>
</p><p>now i have an official hard drive (i'm 90% sure of that), and i bought it off the games store, so no physical copy issues. nothing in the support post for the error worked to fix it(and i tried most of what i could, short of getting a new hard drive, which
 i do not have money for), and now as of the time that i am writing this, i am redownloading it to see if that was my problem, as the first time i downloaded it my xbox had to be restarted a couple of times for various reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now this ticks me off on multiple levels, but mostly because i payed 10 of my hard earned dollars for it and it doesn't even work. i would very much like help in getting the issue resolved so that i can actually use the product i bought</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you, and have a nice day&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other original Xbox games to try for your Xbox 360?&nbsp; That would be a sure fire way to tell if your hard drive is an official drive or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why the Xbox 360 needs an official drive is a simple one.&nbsp; Only the official hard drives contain both the correct formatting and the original Xbox emulator.&nbsp; Without these, original games won't function on your console, not even the digital versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fake Xbox 360 hard drives were and still are prolific on shopping sites such as Amazon and eBay.&nbsp; Many of these drives have packing that looks like the official hard drives from Microsoft.&nbsp; Since they look the same, they have even made their way into official
 gaming stores and sold as official second hand units.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your drive must be an <strong>1</strong><strong>00% official Microsoft 360 hard drive</strong>, otherwise original games won't work.&nbsp; There is no other fix unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>How do you prevent Windows Live Photo Gallery from importing the same picture twice?<br />

I have seen threads that mention previewing the pictures and selecting the pictures that haven't been imported yet.&nbsp; Well this is a solution, but there has to be a better way.&nbsp; I have 1000's of pictures, several I like to keep on the camera for one reason or
 another.&nbsp; I want Windows to recognize which pictures have already been imported, is this possible?</p>

<h2>            how do I open 2 versions of same program simultaneously</h2>
                    How do you get any of the Office 2010 programs to open 2 versions of the same program simultaneously. I am currently working with 2 excel speadsheets and cant open them so I can work in 2 different windows at the same time. I need to do this as I use 2
 full size screens to view the documents. Splitting the documents in excel within one screen does not work.

                    In the past, I used them to privately communicate with others. Why do they get removed after logging off and back in about a month later? Is there a way to get them back so I can see their chat conversations?<br />

<h2>            Unable to find and update drivers</h2>
                    <p>So basicly I have had some issues with making some new usb devices work. First i got myself a new headset from logitech, i have been talking with their support and they told me to contact microsoft about why i couldnt update my drivers. I also got myself
 a new keyboard from ROCCAT today and im having the same issue. The products are working as i have tested it on my school laptop. The usb ports is also working because my old usb devices such as my old keyboard and mouse work on them and the new devices are
 glowing.</p>
<p>Im using Windows 7 Ultimate, 64 bit if that is any help</p>

<p>I dont know what the problem exactly is but none of my new usb devices are working.</p>
<p>Also none of my windows troubleshooters are working, dont know if that has anything to do with it but every troubleshooter just says it failed to start</p>

<p>If you want your system to behave, the last thing you want to do is get driver updates from Microsoft.&nbsp; Microsoft does not know what the best drivers are for your system and will often offer you out of date or wrong drivers.&nbsp; You should only get drivers
 from the WWW site of your motherboard manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Describe as best you can what "some issues with making new usb device work" means - what are "some issues"?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your new headset from logitech a USB device that is not working and if so describe what "not working" means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the model number of the Logitech headset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What driver(s) are you trying to update that won't update and what happens when you try to update the drivers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is "the same issue" you are having with your ROCCAT keyboard and is it also a USB device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the model number of the ROCCAT keyboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some ROCCAT keyboards require you to install their drivers too so have you gone to their WWW page downloaded and installed the drivers for your model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this so we can see what you have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For USB driver information, expand the Components, Click USB, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.
<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>

<p>Some issues is that they dont work at all when they are plugged in, they get power so the lighting and such works but not what i actually have the devices for, the headset does not play the sound and when i press the keyboard nothing happens, so if i type
 with it the pc does not recognize this.</p>
<p>My logitech headset is a usb device and only the lights on it works, it doesnt play sound when in usb mode, you can change from usb to 3.5mm (with 3.5mm it works). Its a G633. Ive tried updating the drivers for this device in the device and printers page
 and windows says it cant find the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my ROCCAT keyboard (ROCCAT Ryos MK pro) nothing happens on the pc when i press the keys, it is usb. I have gone to their website and installed the ryos driver and roccat talk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you know the model of your ASUS motherboard - sometimes it doesn't show up in the msinfo32 details...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would go to Device Manager, expand the USB section, right click each device, check the Properties, Details then write down the installed Driver Version for each device listed:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f8fe33d-fc29-4c66-8fc7-04e6d25352e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2f8fe33d-fc29-4c66-8fc7-04e6d25352e6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Those driver would be "suspicious" if they are not working and if you update the drivers you need to go back and check the Driver Version again to be sure it really got updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your motherboard has a combination of ASUS and Intel USB devices so one test would be to take one device and plug it into each USB port one at a time and see if it fails on all ports or just fails on some ports - maybe the device works with your ASUS ports
 but not Intel or vice versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to the ASUS support site, put in your model number, go to the Windows 7 x64 section and download/install the lastest ASUS USB drivers and the latest Intel drivers, restart your system and check the Driver Versions again to be sure they got updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is one example of what to look for on the ASUS support page where you can see drivers for the ASMedia devices and also the Intel devices:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.asus.com/support/Download/26/9/0/18/30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.asus.com/support/Download/26/9/0/18/30/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to find and use the latest ones specific to your motherboard.</p>

<p>All of the devices within the red circle had this driver date and version.</p>
<p>I searched up my motherboard and under the usb drivers it only had Asmedia drivers</p>

<p>
</p><p>Its still the same after installing the newest asmedia driver from their website</p>

            I don't think so.  Windows 10 now does support "virtual desktops", allowing you to display different groups of applications on separate "desktops".  But as far as I can tell with a quick test they all share the same background. Changing it in one, changes it in all.
<br />
<br />Here are a couple of links about the feature:

<blockquote>Are you seriously telling us that Microsoft does not have a prepackaged Windows Media Player Codec Pack that can be downloaded from a Microsoft site, that your position is for us to download from a site we know nothing about and take our chances
 on getting a virus?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; The least you could do is to recommend a none Microsoft site from which to download.&nbsp; That, at least, would give some measure of confidence that we're not going to get jammed by the other site.</blockquote>
<p><br />
Media player only ever did download MS CODECs. Those are already included in Win7. 3rd party CODECs always had to be downloaded separately or were installed along with media related apps that used them. 3rd party CODECs are subject to other parties copyrights
 and licencing fees, with a few being open-source or free. Downloaded codec packs don't neccessarily include legal&nbsp;copies of copyrighted codecs and the installers may also replace your legitimate functional codecs with illicit or outdated versions, or&nbsp;poor
 quality hacks.</p>
<p>Install FFDSHOW instead and you'll likely not need any other CODECs. <a href="http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Unable to Delete any Event on my Calendar  app in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>This has been an Issue,&nbsp; for the past year.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have researched, and&nbsp; have applied&nbsp; EVERY single possible&nbsp; fix for this</p>
<p>I have uninstalled.. Reinstalled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cutom installed,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wiped the hard drive..&nbsp;&nbsp; done a complete Clean install,&nbsp; and this is not only one one computer it is on ALL computers I have.. One computer&nbsp; is running Windows 10 Professional and the other is Running&nbsp;
 Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have some&nbsp; reminders for Subscription Payments,&nbsp; and a few other appointments which the dates have changed and or i have&nbsp; cancelled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After each Update of Windows I try again, seeking the answer on how to remove&nbsp; these&nbsp; reoccuring events/reminders and&nbsp; NEVER has it had a Delete option&nbsp; after&nbsp; a few months have past aftre making the&nbsp; event I have even&nbsp; scrolled back&nbsp; to&nbsp; the original date
 and month&nbsp; in which the&nbsp; event was&nbsp; created, thinking that&nbsp; was&nbsp; the way to&nbsp; remove it, with no luck.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would&nbsp; really like to see something other than&nbsp; the Generic response. I would like to see a real solution&nbsp; to this issue, as I have done everything&nbsp; listed&nbsp; in the support&nbsp; FAQ here,&nbsp; with no luck at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even this problem goes on into the insider preview program which I am apart of</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope you are able to offer assistance, as&nbsp; this is very annoying at best</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>You Sparked an Idea, I logged into my actual Hotmail account, &nbsp;on the website which &nbsp;I never do I always have used Outlook or some form of it &nbsp;and now Windows 10 Mail. to &nbsp; access my mail and calendar, &nbsp;I found that &nbsp; the &nbsp;item in question is &nbsp;on the Birthday
 Calendar, now I was able to remove One &nbsp;of the &nbsp;pesky events, &nbsp;however I still have ONE left which &nbsp;shows on the birthday calendar but does not have the &nbsp; Delete option, &nbsp; or unlock option, which i had to unlock, the one &nbsp;before it would allow me to delete.</p>
<p>I looked under all &nbsp;calendars it had me &nbsp;on, and &nbsp;it shows on the Birthday but &nbsp;will not allow me to remove it. &nbsp; however I do wish to thank you &nbsp;for &nbsp;sparking me to look &nbsp;on the actual hotmail web interface. You have been the first to even suggest such
 &nbsp;from all the fellow technicians &nbsp;i have spoken with most &nbsp;not even in inkling on where to start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I will dig deeper &nbsp;from that angle of source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shall keep you posted</p>
<p>also. not happy it auto signed me up for skype on my hotmail &nbsp; i have a skype so be dealing with that little aggravation &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>next</p>
<p>But thank you &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>not sure how these &nbsp;got on my &nbsp;calendar as Birthdays though, &nbsp; but again i do thank you for &nbsp;inspiring me to look in a new direction...</p>

<h2>            Korean Language pack suddenly not working</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Until 2 days ago, the Korean text on my computer suddenly were displayed as squares: the music titles in the folders and even iTunes have been changed to the squares. I haven't done anything differently to the computer, and I tried to see if there was an update
 for the Korean language pack, but there isn't. (Note: the last update for the language pack was on April 23, 2012 [Korean Language Pack - Windows 7 Service Pack 1 for x64-based Systems (KB2483139)) and since then, every time I try to check for updates, I do
 not see a new update for the Korean language pack. <br />

            <p><span>Hi AbdulrahmanHaddad,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and thanks for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description provided, I understand that you want to transfer files folder and application to a different driver
 since the low disc space.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><u><span>Windows Apps Location</span></u></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows apps folder is hidden by default and located under program files.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Location: C:\Program Files\Windows apps<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Enable hidden files follow the steps mention below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From the Windows 8 Start Screen, select the Windows Explorer app.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When Windows Explorer, please single-click on the View tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Put a check mark in the checkbox labeled File name extensions and Hidden items.</span></p>
<p><u><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></u></p>
<p><u><span>Change location of Installation of Application:</span></u></p>
<p><span><br />
I recommend you to don’t transfer the Windows apps or program files and folder this may corrupt programs and Windows apps.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>You
</span><span>can redirect 'My Documents' to another drive which will save the disc space.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This will help while you are
<span>&nbsp;</span>trying to save anything on the documents it will save on the new location.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps mention below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open up the Explorer (Windows Key + E).</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand Documents folder to see the folder My Documents in the sidebar.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click on the folder My Documents and click on “Properties”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to the tab “Location”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on the button Move.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Navigate to the folder where you want to move your “My Documents” folder to.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After clicking on Select Folder in we’re back on the folder location screen. Eventually, to move the My Documents folder, click on Apply.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Confirm the prompt with yes if you are sure that you want to move the My Documents folder.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to delete the temp files and folder and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any other questions or you need any other information about Windows, feel free to post your questions and we will
 be glad to help.</span></p>

            <p>I don' t have much space on system SSD drive. So it will be helpfull to tranfer apps to a different more capable but less fast drive. It is ease to install desktop applications to a location that is not program files. But&nbsp;it is not the same&nbsp;for the apps
 from Windows Store. There must be a way to avoid this limitation.</p>

            <p>I am having a very similar problem but it is with a different solitaire game (Spider). &nbsp; Mine was also happening several times a day. &nbsp;(I consider it punishment for playing too much solitaire!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last test was to reboot after the hang and not use solitaire. &nbsp;The machine ran fine for hours. &nbsp;Then I started a solitaire game and the machine hung within 5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the messages below in the application log. &nbsp;I haven't compared every message from every occurrence of the issue, but these are very similar to what I saw on the other occasions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, I previously had Windows 7 on this machine and solitaire was no problem. &nbsp;I have another Windows 10 machine that previously had Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Solitaire still runs fine on that one.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Solitaire seems to consistently bring about this symptom within minutes, usually less than 30, of starting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does however happen at other times. &nbsp;Typically that would be several hours after a reboot, likely after a period of sleep. &nbsp;In the latter case the machine wakes up OK and I can use it for a while, but before long the machine hangs and I find the above
 error messages (or similar) in the application log attributed to ESENT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that nobody from MS has responded to for a week. &nbsp;It's possible that I've misunderstood what my expectations should be for support on. &nbsp;Should I be calling? &nbsp;That would seem to be less cost effective for MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't mean to be whiny but a week seems like a long response time.</p>

    <title>Connectivity Issue - Services&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neoslayer pw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connectivity Issue - Services&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I was disabling a few suggested services in my Windows 10, because I have this huge issue with my computer constantly crashing and getting disk usage at 100% and high temperatures from no specific program in particular. I tried every single trick
 in the book. I have no advanced knowledge but I tried disabling services and even getting a SSD instead of an ancient drive. Stopped crashing for months then it started. Over time the crashing started again until I decided to restart my computer with a disk
 just a few weeks ago. Now the crashing starts again. If I'm lucky, it would always have a "run" where it doesn't crash as long as I don't restart the computer, but after restarting, it crashes consecutively. But that is not the main issue here. I can't do
 anything with the limited knowledge I have.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway. I was googling some "Top 20 services to disable to increase performance without consequences" to help with my computer crashing, and it seems to have slowed down the crashes, for now at least. However, doing so resulted with some serious issues with
 Discord. around 95% of the time, these don't function:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can no longer add reactions, when I put one it disappears a few seconds later.
<br />
I can't upload images, it always loads halfway and then gets stuck and fails. I can temporarily fix it by getting an EXTREMELY tiny image with no space and spamming it but then it stops working again right after. In general, servers take a very long time to
 load. It wasn't always like this, and I wanted to know if I maybe disabled a service that's causing it to be so terrible— It only does this on my computer, on my browser, on the program, but it works fine everywhere else as long as it isn't on my PC.<br />
<br />
However, not only is this issue on discord, but occasionally other websites as well, I can't upload images. On the discord support site, they asked me to upload screenshots of it, and it wouldn't let me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Additionally, on the forums site I use, <a href="http://forums.pixelworldsgame.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forums.pixelworldsgame.com</a>, it sometimes doesn't load too — I do a captcha and it stays there and the entire site doesn't load, and I get an "Empty response" error, or sometimes I can't edit a post or comment, notably when they have images included,
 they don't go through at all — the site is powered by XenForo.</p>
<p>I tried reporting this on the requests form on official discord site - but I get
<br />
"ERR_SPDY_PROTOCOL_ERROR"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Discord told me to do these things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Restart your Modem+Router+Computer&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Nothing worked)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Check your Firewall/Anti Virus and make sure that Discord is whitelisted/temporarily disabled</p>
<p>I have uBlock on firefox and that's it, nothing works whether it's enabled or disabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Check your VPN if you are using one (We only support VPNs that have UDP)</p>
<p>(I have no VPN)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Check with your network admin if Discord could be blocked!</p>
<p>Worked for over 2 years now until I changed some service</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Change the server's voice region - If you're the admin, try a different voice region in Server Settings -&gt; Server region</p>
<p>no idea **** this means but can't be it since it worked before!</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Head over to <a href="https://test.webrtc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://test.webrtc.org/</a> and see if any errors pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The errors I got were:</p>
<p>Connectivity:</p>
<div><span>[ INFO ]</span>
<span>Gathered candidate of Type: srflx Protocol: UDP Address: (Gonna hide that lol)<br />
<span>Gathered candidate of Type: srflx Protocol: UDP Address: (Gonna hide that lol)<br />

</div>
<div><span>[ FAILED ]</span>
<span>Failed to get access to local media due to error: NotFoundError</span></div>
<span>Failed to get access to local media due to error: NotFoundError</span></div>
<p>they then told me to set my DNS to the google public one, 8.8.4.4</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>They told me to try malwarebytes. I tried way better paid programs, defrags, malware removals, advanced system care, driver booster, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They then told me to check a traceroute.. They didn't bring it up</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a call to pause().
<a href="https://goo.gl/LdLk22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://goo.gl/LdLk22</a></p>
<p>They asked me to use CTRL + Shift + R on the discord program. when I tried to upload an image it said
<br />
"</p>
<p>Failed to load resource: net::ERR_SPDY_PROTOCOL_ERROR</p>
<p>api/v6/promotions/ack:1 <br />
ca5957853017e672399f.js:45 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Origin is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin

at XMLHttpRequest.i (ca5957853017e672399f.js:49)"<br />
and a lot more, but it didn't look safe to send to public. I don't even know if any of this is useful. I know nothing about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They then asked me to show them my dxDiag but once again (for the third time) told them I can't send screenshots or files but I could maybe send it from mobile, but they didn't bring it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even did a winsock reset which was supposed to give me back default services but that didn't even fix it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their last suggestion was to reformat my PC or reset it. I reset it. Discord was working again. Only for a little. They said they don't understand the inner workings of Windows OF and told me to go here.. Sorry about the long post.

<h2>            I am not the administrator for my own computer I believe due to malware, possibly blaster.  DCom Launcher may not be disabled.</h2>
                    
<p>I am posting this to this thread because I am now using Windows Vista Home Premium 32 Bit for my home pc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I was originally using Windows Server Standard Edition 2003 when I noticed my DNS root servers had changed to unofficial root servers.&nbsp; My network adapters' gateway was blank and the dns servers were ones I didn't recognize.&nbsp; When I tried to change
 them back, they reverted to the new foreign settings.&nbsp; My virus scanner and firewall were disabled and my smtp server was relaying mail.&nbsp; I looked in the event log and found that I was no longer the administrator for the server and had no rights to change
 anything, so I was forced to reinstall Server 2003.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my computer has a read/write CD and I think the malware wrote to my installation copy and infected it as well.</p>
<p>I believe this because I tried an old dos based boot disk on an old 3/14" floppy with the lock enabled and used fdisk to wipe the hard drive but apparently the virus is either on the boot sector of the hard disk and was not cleared or its on the installation
 disk or both.&nbsp; I favor the installation disk theory because fdisk will normally wipe the boot sector.</p>
<p>So, before I realized this, I used my Vista copy that came with my PC originally and tried using that.&nbsp; I also tried an old Windows XP copy I have.&nbsp; Now I think I have three infected OS copies.</p>
<p>Regardless of the OS, the malware uses dcom launcher, rpc, and secondary logon to assign itself administrator rights and appears to offer me limited admin rights so I won't catch on.&nbsp; The option to start, stop, pause or resume dcom launcher is grayed out
 in Services.&nbsp; The startup type may not be changed from automatic to anything else.</p>
<p>I tried booting in safe mode but get the message I do not have administrator rights to run this program.&nbsp; Certain directories like wbem tell me access is denied if I try to open them.&nbsp; I store my program files on D: with the OS on C: and found a d:\program
 files\java\trustlib folder which I had no rights to.&nbsp; Any files I delete seem to be deleted but then are replaced as soon as I am done.</p>
<p>I spent days researching the problem and examining the inf files and setup logs and notice they are intended to restrict any executables or windows methods which might allow me to regain control.&nbsp; In regedit, there is only load hive or unload hive, no option
 to save registry entries.</p>
<p>I have tried every method I know to clear this issue including downloading and running MS' Malicious Software removal tool, one from Norton to fix blaster and I either get the message I do not have administrator rights, or there was no virus found.&nbsp; Yet
 in the logs created, various directories are reported as not checked due to access restrictions.</p>
<p>Other than buying a new PC, what can I do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>

<p>Hi Mick,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Perhaps I was too long winded to wade through all that text.&nbsp; But the simple question is:<strong>now that I'm not the administrator for my computer, how do I stop dcom launcher in services?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The virus is stopping any attempt by virus checkers to discover and remove it.&nbsp; Further, it appears before Windows setup has completed so that by the time the welcome screen is presented, I am no longer the administrator.</p>
<p>The virus has blocked any attempt to use safe mode to bypass it. That is, I can use safe mode, but it still throws errors about I'm not authorized for this procedure, access denied, etc.</p>
<p>Since I realize Windows built in security is not going to let me defeat the administrator role, the better question is how to remove the virus either from my master boot record, the installation disk or wherever it resides.</p>
<p>Without Windows, I'm not able to launch a browser, nor is there internet connection, so it would have to be some sort of bootup cd that can do the job.&nbsp; And the cd would have to be impervious to the virus since it would attach itself to the cd.</p>
<p>Or am I looking at buying a new computer?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>Matt</p>

<p>Forgive me if I'm not being grateful for the "help" I received,&nbsp; Mick, but as I've looked around the forum for some sort of answer to this question, all I see is you hawking the free anti-virus software using the exact same language each time as if you were
 simply looking for the keyword virus and pasting a stock reply.</p>
<p>FYI, I did download and use the software you recommended and it does nothing whatsoever.&nbsp; I think it's a pig in a poke...</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Mom has encountered the same problem, with the admin situation, and I have yet to find the solution.&nbsp; I was wondering if maybe you were able to find the solution, and fix your pc?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
