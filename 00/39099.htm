<h2>            Constant flashing loading icon &#40;blue circle&#41; next to my mouse.</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As the title says I have this constant loading going on somewhere in my computer. it interferes with my games or
 if I put anything to full screen it automatically pulls it out of full screen and minimizes it. It also interferes with my typing. If I'm trying to type in an address to go to a website the flashing loading will make it so I have to keep clicking in the address
 bar to finish typing out the address. auto saved usernames are also an issue. where I'll type the first three letters of my username. It will pull up then immediately disappear. I have to be really fast to click it or result to the constant clicking of the
 username bar to put my username in. Also an issue with right clicking anything. the right click "open, delete, new folder, etc" will come up and before I can move to click what I want it disappears. I restarted my computer and it went away once. I thought
 the issue was resolved and paid no attention to it. I then turned my computer off and back on after a virus scan and the problem persists again. I tried turning the computer off and on again but again the problem continues. Any help on how I can find whats
 constantly loading/causing the flashing loading icon next to my mouse?</span>

<h2>            Bluetooth Headphones Paired but not Connected</h2>
                    I have a&nbsp; Dell Precision M4800 and I've been trying to pair my Sony MDR1000X headphones to no avail. I have them paired but not connected, that is to say that I see them as paired and as a bluetooth device but I can't get them to connect. When I right
 click control on the headphones and try to connect I get the error message: "error connecting to headset bluetooth please retry this operation" I have tried restarting and have downloaded the Dell 1550 wireless/bluetooth driver also to no avail. If anyone
 has any solutions they would be greatly appreciated. I'm running windows 8.1 64 bit.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span><span>Netapi32.dll error messages might appear while using or installing certain programs, when Windows starts or shuts down, or maybe even during a Windows installation. Netapi32.dll errors are caused by situations that lead
 to the removal or corruption of the netapi32&nbsp;DLL file. </span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run
<strong>System File Checker (SFC</strong>) scan to check for any system files corruption in the system. SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin</strong>).</li><li>
In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></li></ul>

</p><p>Now I want to use a "Microsoft account" instead of a local account, but that requires me to enter both a first and last name which causes the account name to change (e.g., to "Doug Jones"), and that causes me to lose access to the network drives.&nbsp; How can
 I retain my simple userid, "Doug" and have a Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does seem pretty silly that every Microsoft account must contain a blank.</p>

</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am glad to assist you on this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that, we cannot create a Microsoft account without entering last name and we cannot continue the steps by keeping this field empty. So, we&nbsp;need to enter both the first&nbsp;and last&nbsp;name&nbsp;to complete the process.</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you aware of any hardware or software changes made any on the PC prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be possible that some system files are corrupted or some third-party program causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow these methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong><strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files.<br />

</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Multi-OS Booting</h2>
                    <p>I have three OS's in my computer that I boot alternately. When I had only Two (Windows 10 Pro 64 Bit and Windows 10 Pro 32 Bit) The windows Boot Menu worked just fine. When I added Linux Ubuntu 16.04 The Linux Boot Menu comes up instead of the Windows Boot
 Menu. The Linux Menu <strong>USUALLY</strong> allows me to boot to either of the Three OSs but sometimes it reverts to the Ubuntu Menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is ...<em><strong>Is there a way to get the Windows Boot Menu back and include the Ubuntu as an option (Like the two windows options).</strong></em></p>

    <title>Removing app from Windows registry - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Removing app from Windows registry</h2>
                    <p>I had an app&nbsp;which was installed into drive D. I have since removed drive D from my computer. When I try to reinstall that app the installation fails, apparently because it tries to install into the previous location as registered in the Windows registry
 and finds that drive D does not exist.</p>
<p>Now I just want to uninstall the app from the registry first before reinstalling it but the 'Uninstall' also fails for the same reason that it cannot find drive D. Is there a way for me to purge that rogue application entry from the Windows registry or my
 only option now is putting drive D back just to be able to uninstall the app ? Thanks</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>1. I have about 5 apps that were affected by the removal of the hard drive. So far, I have been able to install one app successfully before getting stuck on this one. I have not tried the other three, but I won't be surprised if the problem is specific to
 this particular app's install/uninstall programs. They should just ignore that fact that a previous installation is no longer accessible and should not choke on that. After all, hard disks do crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. No. I have only tried to install and uninstall that app and always get the error that driver D is not accessible. I'm aware of some registry cleaner program out there, but most of them are more trouble than they're worth. Since I'm not looking for anything
 fancy, I'm hoping that there's a Windows tool that allows a user to remove an entry in the registry.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing regarding this issue and also for the delay in getting back to you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the steps to remove the app from the Windows Registry. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>, go to <strong>Programs and Features</strong>, right click on the
<strong>App</strong> and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Right click </strong>on the <strong>Start </strong>
menu and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>, type the command <strong>
regedit.exe </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Important:</span></strong> <strong>
This section contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before
 you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following link to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

            <p>Thanks for your help. It almost worked but not quite :).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took a long while to go through all the entries for the app and remove them from the registry. However, even though the uninstallation seemed to be successful afterwards, the re-installation of the app still failed. In the middle of the installation,
 it ran into trouble and tried to remove itself and gave an error message that it could not uninstall its previous installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems my best bet now is to put back driver D and import the saved registry back before I could uninstall that app, or maybe trying one of those registry cleaners and hope that it won't install some adware on my system. Is there a reliable registry cleaner
 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for your time.</p>

<h2>            Why is there no &#34;troubleshoot hardware &#38; devices&#34; in 1809 update&#63;</h2>
                    I have looked everywhere in settings &amp; control panel, &amp; there is no longer a troubleshooter for hardware &amp; devices. All of the other troubleshoot options are still listed , &amp; there is no "view all." In 1803 I could access it in " update &amp; security" then
 chose "troubleshoot" &amp; it was the 4th one listed under "find &amp; fix other problems" where "keyboard" is now. Unless Microsoft will come up with a fix, I guess the only solution is to go back to 1803?

    <title>Windows 8 crashing event id 7040 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iainthompson_996  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 crashing event id 7040</h2>
                    My windows 8 laptop has started to crash quite often and the event viewer shows multiple Service Control Manager events at the time of each crash.<br />
More precisely it comes up with " the start type of the windows modules installer service was changed from auto start to demand start"<br />
This is Event ID 7040<br />
<br />
Is this the cause of the crash or just a symptom and if so what can I do about it<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

    <title>will screen resolution 3072X768 display properly in windows xp mode__ - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> united001  say:</h3>
<h2>            will screen resolution 3072X768 display properly in windows xp mode__</h2>
                    While using Windows XP Home, I could use my favorite screen resolution, 3072 X 768 and have perfect results. Currently in Window 7 Home premium, you cannot use screen resolution 3072 X 768, it creates screen distortion. I use an Nvidia 8800 GTS with latest
 drivers installed by Windows 7 itself. I am wondering if I upgrade to Windows 7 Professional and use Windows XP Mode, will I then be able to use screen resolution 3072 X 768 again?<br />

    <title>ARK&#58; Survival Evolved download size increasing. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nodleh72  say:</h3>
<h2>            ARK&#58; Survival Evolved download size increasing.</h2>
                    <p>Began installing ARK the other day from the windows store and all was good. But after getting to around 35-40GB of the 76GB install problems began. The blue percentage bar reset but the amount downloaded didn't so I thought nothing of it. Once it
 got to 76/76Gb downloaded the download size began increasing, first to 90Gb. When it got to 90GB it went to 110GB, then to 150GB, the 170GB and its now at 203GB. The game refuses to cancel when I press the x. Once I start the install again it resumes where
 it left off (at 203GB). I've gone to the WindowsApps folder in my C drive and deleted the ARK folders (with no effect). I also attempted to install the game on my harddrive via another PC (which worked, it installed fine). I then plugged my HDD back into my
 PC and attempted to copy and paste the files into the WindowsApps file which didn't work as "your organization does not allow you to place this file here". I'm stuck here, have no idea why its not working or how to fix it. I've contacted Microsoft support
 chats 3+ times to no effect. Hoping someone on here has the answer. Thanks in advance :)&nbsp;</p>

 having the same problem where it says its downloaded 81.56gb/81.56gb and continues to download and increase in size. The microsoft store is just awful and always has these problems. I tried reseting the store clearing the cache and doing everything that other
 forums said for other games but nothing works. The most frustrating part is now im missing about 80gb of storage space. The only thing new that is happening after all this is that it switches from dowloading to installing every once in awhile. I dont want
 to leave it running and see if it installs because ive already gained another few gb with no progress being seen on installing it. Hopefully someone has an idea on how to fix this or at least get my storage space back.

            Good to hear i wasnt the only one with the issue. I did manage to fix it though by leaving it to ‘install’ (as it claims). It got up to around 250gb but i left my pc on for the day and the bar progressed as normal and when it got to the end it finished
 and worked fine. Also the storage went back to normal and only the 79gb or whatever it is was used. Hopefully this works for you too. :)&nbsp;

            The result of the last test suggests one of three things:<br />
a) The "Public" share does not exist on the laptop. To find out, run this command from the laptop's Console:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net share public<br />
b) Sharing is not enabled on the laptop. To find out, launch the Control Panel, then Network and Sharing Center, then Change advanced sharing settings, then check File and Printer sharing.<br />
c) The "Server" service does not run on the laptop. To find out, do this:<br />
1. Click Start.<br />
2. Type the three letters cmd into the Search box.<br />
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter<br />
4. Click "Run as Administrator".<br />
5. Type the following command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start server<br />

            I stepped through all of the commands at the command line and made sure that "Public" was being shared. When I ran the net start command I got " the Server is already started". I also checked to see that "file and print sharing is enabled. I still get

<p>I've had this problem intermittently ever since I installed Windows 7 so I'm convinced it's a Windows 7 problem.&nbsp; One moment it will be able to see the share on my Windows XP netbook, the next it can't.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with the share.&nbsp; I have checked it over and over.&nbsp; It's only the Windows 7 PC that has problems with it.</p>
<p>Win 7 also has intermittent problems with shares on a Windows 2000 machine.</p>
<p>I'd really like a solution to this (I suppose Ubuntu is one since it seems to actually understand Windows shares) but since I've seen no substantial response from MS to any of the issues I've raised about Win 7 in the past year, it's seems like a folorn
 hope.</p>

            <p>Here is the solution to "error code 0x80070035 network path was not found" on Windows Vista and Windows 7 Computers. Click on the "START" button, select "CONTROL PANEL", and go into "DEVICE
 MANAGER". Click on "NETWORK ADAPTERS", then click on "VIEW", and select "SHOW HIDDEN DEVICES". In the expanded view you will see a long list of numbered "MICROSOFT 6to4 ADAPTER". My Windows 7 Professional desktop had 200 of them. Right click and select "DELETE"
 on all but 1 of them. You can only do 1 at a time so it does take a while. When you have only 1 left, restart computer and enjoy being able to see your other network computers, including HOMEGROUP files.</p>

            <p>Hello to everyone, </p>
<p>DISCLAMER: This entire list is from my own personal problem with the IPCONFIG Issue and Error 0x80070035, and all the investigation, research and modifications to my personal computer in order to fix it. Please read it and understand
 it before you do any modification to your computer, as I don’t recommend you to proceed with modification to your system if you don’t know what you are doing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I just want to write this because I was in deep frustration some weeks ago and the guy that made this explanation gave a good light of my computer’s problem, later on I kept investigating and finally I made my own solution to this mess.
</p>
<p>I don’t know what was triggering the creation of that many 6to4 tunnels but, apparently if you leave the IPv6 enabled in your computer you will get a lot, and the problem with this is that: 1) slows down the boot and start of your computer,
 2) everyone in your LAN can see your computer but you cannot see anyone, 3) if you want to shear files among your LAN computers other computers can get your files, but you will not be able to open any computer from you LAN, meaning you will get the famous:</p>
<p>ERROR CODE 0x80070035 </p>
<p>So I really give thanks to all the good people that helped me out with this and now I want to make very clear how to solve this problem once and for all for everyone.
</p>
<p>If you go to your Device Manager and start deleting one by one as per this video it will take you about 3 to 4 weeks to do it, but it is a good start as your computer will now will load a little faster.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you go to the Windows regedit explanation and do the modification as per the following link, you will find that you take away all the 6to4 tunnel thingis, which is not good either.
</p>
<p>If you go to the following link and you download the batch file, it doesn’t do anything unless you modify it to create the DisabledComponents file.
</p>
<p>So here is the mix match and salad to fix your computer to the horrific ERROR CODE 0x80070035.</p>
<p>Start by going to the Start / Control Panel&nbsp; on the top right corner click on the View by:&nbsp; Large icons menu to change the appearance of the options, click on the Device Manager and go to Network Adapters&nbsp; / then click on the View top
 menu to display hidden components and you will see all the 6to4 tunnels that you have, uninstall some and just disable some. Up to here I have not anything different from what my good friend is explaining in the video.
</p>
<p>Now the problem is that try to disable or uninstall 400 + of them. This is a steady 2 – 3 weeks job, so better to go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852</a></p>
<p>they have a great explanation of the problem and how to create and modify the DisabledComponents file using the registry editor. Now if you modify this file with the 0xffffff value and shot down your computer, you will wipe out all the
 6to4 tunnel adapters in the computer THAT ARE NOT DISABLED, but you need 1 or 2 at least for your computer to be able to communicate and share files, so be careful to make the change to this value, just once you have disable at least two of them. Now shot
 down your computer and restart probably twice as the first time you will only see an exclamation mark on each tunnel adapter that will be erased.
</p>
<p>Then by the second time you have shot down and restart your computer you will see that all the tunnels are gone, but the ones that were just disabled, so now you have to go back to the Registry Editor and modify the value inside the&nbsp;
 DisabledComponents to 0</p>
<p>Just for precaution shot down your computer again and this time once you start again go to the Device Manager and put back to work the two tunnels that you have disabled before.
</p>
<p>Once you finish all this process, you have win the battle. Your computer will be your best friend again. I hope this is informative and helps someone out there battling with the:</p>
<p>ERROR 0x80070035</p>
<p>Or the 6to4 Tunneling or the </p>
<p>IPCONFIG problem</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>January 31/2013</p>

    <title>Issues playing bc 360 games multiplayer on 2 XBox Ones in the same - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chupacabra24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues playing bc 360 games multiplayer on 2 XBox Ones in the same household</h2>
                    <p>Okay, here's the skinny.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>We have two XBoxes in the same household. The Home XBox is my son's, so he can share all of the games that are on my XBox Live Gold account.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>We've been able to play all XBox One games multiplayer without any issue at all.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>However, we grabbed both Crackdown and Saints Row the Third in order to play through them co-op. Same problem with both games: we can't get them to connect. Like, at all.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>In the course of troubleshooting we got my wife's account 3 months of XBox Live Gold (in case the bc games required it) and tried playing with 2 Live Gold accounts. Same issue.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>In the case of Saints Row the Third, which requires the Online Pass, we also went ahead and purchased both Saints Row the Third AND the Online Pass on her account, so both accounts have the game and the online pass. So there's like, literally no reason they shouldn't work.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>So here's what happens.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>In Saints Row the Third, we go to Co-Op Campaign, select XBox Live, select to start a New Game. It loads up the screen where you can invite a friend in, and the other accounts aren't visible- my wife's OR my son's. (We tried both because, y'know, troubleshooting.) Like they're not there. Also can't invite them in using the XBox UI because "Invite to Game" and "Join Game" both get greyed out. Additionally both accounts, viewing my account while in-game, say I'm in Home instead of Saints Row the Third.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>We've also tried going to Co-Op Campaign and selecting System Link. One account will host the game and the other can then see the other game- the other account's name comes up as joinable- but when you try to join, it eventually says that it couldn't join because the session was no longer available, and on the host side, you never see anything.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Same thing on Crackdown. You try to start a multiplayer game and can't see a friend to invite or join a friend, and trying to host or join system link does the same thing as above.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>It's incredibly frustrating, as I can join friends that don't live here, so I have to assume it's something with having the two XBox Ones on the same network. However, as I guess this isn't a common issue, there's literally no help anywhere on it as far as I can tell. And both of our systems' NAT settings are Open, in case anyone thinks of that. Help?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p>When you're playing an Xbox 360 game on Xbox One, it's like you're on Xbox 360. Xbox One apps like Friends and Party don't interact with your game.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>In an Xbox 360 game, send game invites and start parties the way you would on Xbox 360: using the Xbox Guide. Open the guide by pressing the&nbsp;<b>View</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;button and&nbsp;<b>Menu</b>&nbsp;button at the same time, then choose&nbsp;<b>Friends</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>Party</b>&nbsp;and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>In Original Xbox games, online features such as multiplayer and leaderboards don’t work on Xbox One. However, you can still use Xbox One parties to chat while playing alongside others, in whatever game they’re playing.</p><p><br /></p>

            I had the same problem with my son with our xbox ones playing black Ops. A few years back. We were able to fix it But for the life of me at this moment I can't remember what we had to do. I'll get back with you soon. I remember I was so upset One and nothing
 more but to get my game on with my little dude.&nbsp; And hes a best.&nbsp; But if my son started the lobby or the party it wouldn't give him the option to send me an invite. But it would give me an option to send the invite and he couldn't accept it. God for the life
 of me I can't remember exactly what we did but it has something to do with appearing online. We were sharing my xbox live account as well. I think the person that actually has the gold account has to create the party. While my son the kid player had to change
 the settings to appear offline And had to restrict&nbsp; His ability to communicate with other players. It ended up being something in the privacy settings. I'm sorry I'm guess I'm not really being much help. Play around

    <title>How to re-install Vista on Toshiba laptop with new hard drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to re-install Vista on Toshiba laptop with new hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My sisters Toshiba laptop's hard drive died as well as her internal fan, and she wanted me to fix it, well I got a new hard drive, and replaced the dead internal fan with a new one, and runs perfectly fine with a Live CD of Linux. However she previously
 had Vista Home Premium installed on it, and there was no installation CD, just 2 recovery disks. Now I was wondering where could I get an iso image of vista UNACTIVATED so I can use her legit product key for it. (Also I have a week to get this done, and I'm
 repairing other computers as well, which aren't such a problem, so time is of the essence)</p>
<p>Also I have no money, and can't afford to get a installation CD from Best Buy, as the OS was previously installed on the notebook/OEM. So would this be legal as well by getting one online, and burning it to a black CD, and using that to get Vista on this
 new hard drive of her's???</p>
<p>Additionally I know how to install her drivers, and upgrade from SP1 to SP2, via&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Learn-how-to-install-Windows-Vista-Service-Pack-2-SP2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Manager</a>, all I need is a vista home premium
 installation CD to get her computer up, and running the way she wants it.</p>

<p><span>no </span></p>
<p><span>i never said you had to buy an installation dvd anywhere in my reply</span></p>
<p><span>i said that there is no free and legal download</span></p>
<p><span>re-read all of&nbsp;my reply</span></p>
<p><span>i advised you to boot from the 1st recovery disk and if you have problems contact toshiba at the link i suppied you with</span></p>
<p><span>or follow the rest of my advice about borrowing a microsoft vista dvd&nbsp;and using your product key with it</span></p>
<p><span>what you mightn't know is that the microsoft vista dvd contains all vista versions</span></p>
<p><span>it is the product key that installs the correct version from the dvd</span></p>
<p><span>there are 2 microsoft vista dvd one for 32bit and one for 64bit operating system</span></p>
<p><span>most computers unless requested when bought normally come with the 32bit vista version</span></p>

<h2>            upgrading Dell XPS L502X to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>As per Dell&nbsp;Dell XPS L502X is not tested for Windows 10 and&nbsp;drivers have not been updated for that model. Dell does not recommended an upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wonder if any one tried upgrading Dell&nbsp;XPS L502X to Windows 10 and what kind of support can be expected from Microsoft if upgrade ends up breaking system.</p>

            <p><span>Good morning, everybody.</span></p>
<p><span>I had the same problems with some drivers on Dell XPS 15 L502X and my Dell Vostro 3550.</span></p>
<p><span>I found the solution:</span></p>
<p><span>1 – After installing Windows 10, go to the following Dell’s homepage:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/xps-l502x/drivers/advanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/xps-l502x/drivers/advanced</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On the topic
</span><span><span>View all available updates for Windows …, and click on
<p><span><span>A list of drivers will appear.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2 – Select
<strong>BIOS </strong>– do the download of the file and excecute it. You have to <strong>
upgrade the BIOS firmware</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Your machine will restart (it will take a little time)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After restart, if you access Device Manager on Control Panel, you’ll see that
<strong>Windows 10 now recognize </strong>your video card.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3&nbsp;– On the same link over,
<strong>download the graphics driver </strong>(Intel HD 3000/2000 Graphics Driver)</span></span><span> and excecute it.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Do the same with nVIDIA
</strong>GeForce GT 525M/GT540M Graphics Driver</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5 – After that, access
<strong>Device Manager </strong>on Control Panel, right click over the nVIDIA GeForce GT 525M/GT540M Graphics Driver and choose
<strong>Update Driver</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>That’s it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All the best.</span></span></p>
I'd like to know if you've got it!

<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/get/upgrade-your-pc-options.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/get/upgrade-your-pc-options.aspx</a><br />
<br />
You can do an upgrade from XP Pro to Vista Business, or read on re clean install if it was&nbsp;a FULL Vista business Licence.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the
 disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>
