<h2>            Windows 10 DVD player -- want to change default to Windows Media Player</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Windows 10's DVD app plays DVD movies terrible. I want to change the default to the very stable and workable Windows Media Player that I used with Windows 7 without a hitch. How do I do this and, if not, what is the point of making
 it inaccessible as default? This DVD player is for the birds.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply but my question is not answered. I want to play movie titles DVD, full length motion pictures as seen in theaters feature films that are in my catalog. How do I get Windows Media Player as the default DVD player?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 7, I'd pop one into DVD player and Windows Media Player would auto play it. The one that comes with Windows 10 plays terrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are we understanding what I wish to change? I want to change DVD player that came with Windows 10 to Windows Media Player to watch full length motion pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't a clue as to what to assign to any file on one of those DVD's.</p>

<h2>            COM surrogate stopped working with Windows Photo Viewer - Is that a codec problem&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have Windows 7 professional and a minimal set of software installed. (No Nero, no Divx; not that I know of).
<br />
<br />
I keep getting a "COM Surrogate has stopped working" error when viewing JPEGs with Windows Photo Viewer. This happens at random times when I view the photos. Sometimes it happens when I open the first image but mostly it is at some point when I change to the
 next picture. I have the feeling that it occurs more often when I rapidly flick through them.
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
</span>I don't know when it started. recently installed Adobe CS5.5 and I am not sure if the error occured before (because I didn't really looked at pictures).<br />
<br />
I tried the "clean boot" and with everything disabled, the error still occurred.<br />
<br />
(I haven't tried changing the Data execution prevention (DEP) settings because I read somewhere that this may compromise security.)<br />
UPDATE: Actually I have tried to add dllhost.exe to the DEP exception but I get the message "you cannot set DEP attributes on 64-bit executables". I did this under Advanced Settings-&gt; Performance tab: Settings-&gt;Data Execution Prevention-&gt;Turn on DEP for all
 programs and services except those I select:-&gt;add....<br />
<br />
I also read that this may be because of old codecs. However, I am not using any video or anything. I haven't even had Windows Media player installed. Should I try to download a codec for JPEG viewing? Are my JPEGS too big for the codecs that are installed?
 I don't really know much about codecs so could you give me a hint on which one to download? (Knowing that i don't need a hole pack with all possible codecs).<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />
<br />

<br />
We tried system restores, windows reinstall, disk checks, virus scans...The problem hasn't been resolved really. The only possibility we can think of atm is that it is a driver issue. I have yet to find time to experiment with that.<br />

<h2>            Clean installed, hard drive wiped, can&#39;t activate</h2>
                    <p>So I clean installed Windows 10 instead of upgrading from a legitimate copy of Windows 8.1 that was preinstalled to my Laptop. Previously I upgraded to Windows 10 via the square button but reverted back to Windows 8.1 because of Internet issues. Then after
 I clean installed Windows 10 my entire hard drive was moved to the Windows.old file and I didn't like that so I attempted to revert once again back to Windows 8.1 The recovery option to revert back was now gone so I tried to do the reset PC thing. I made 100%
 sure that "keep files" was ticked. After my PC was reset, all of my files (steam games, non-steam games, programs, school files) are now all gone. So basically I cannot revert back to my previous OS since it was pre-installed. AND I can't activate Windows
 10 since it can't detect a previous OS or something. Any help? I have proof that my laptop came pre-installed with Windows 8.1 exactly 350 days ago. I read that I would have to revert back to Windows 8.1 before upgrading to Windows 10. Please help, thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it just possible for Microsoft to give me a Windows 10 key if I show them the receipt of my purchase of Windows 8.1 laptop instead of me having to reinstall Windows 8.1, then upgrading to Windows 10? That will be such a long process and I've been pestered
 with Windows 10 problems for the past couple of days.&nbsp;</p>

            I had a similar issue, was using the preview build, it started behaving oddly so tried a refresh, didn't work, tried a restore that failed, wiping the OS from the HDD.&nbsp;HP on board recovery wouldn't work. So like yourself I used the media creation tool
 on the windows 10&nbsp;website and created a copy of win 10 on a DVD, installed that thinking it would pick the 8.1 key up from the BIOS and see that it was genuine but nope, now like many others my copy won't activate. I spent ages on live chat with some1 from
 Microsoft who's told me to wait upto 48hrs and my copy should activate on its own. That was 5 days ago and its still not activating. Going to have to purchase recovery media from HP to set back 8.1 but £37 is cheaper than the £99 Microsoft want for a Win 10
 License. As far as I can see for those in similar situation u need to revert back to the original OS and upgrade rather than do a clean install

</p><p>You can use the recovery media you should have created when u bought your laptop, failing that you can get it for a charge from your pc's manufacturer. HP want £33.47 for mine, I did make mine but recently moved house and can't find it :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is on the web instructions on how to install windows 8.1 (includes a download) using a generic key. Once your laptop is installed with the 8.1 it picks up your own key from the BIOS and activates it using that key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use Linux to find your embedded key (instructions also easily found on any&nbsp;search engine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went with the last route about 10 mins ago, got my 8.1 key but of course I get an error message because Win 10 isn't Win 8.1 and you can't activate a clean install of Win 10 with a Win 8/8.1 key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you are going to have to some way get your original OS installed back on</p>

            <p>You can just download Windows 8.1 Update for free from Microsoft using the Windows 8.1 Media Creation
<br />
Tool.&nbsp; After installation, activate Windows 8.1 using your Product Key.&nbsp; If you do not know it, look it up after installing Windows 8.1 and activate with it.&nbsp; Then you can
<em>upgrade</em> to Windows 10 with the matching ISO to your Windows 8.1 version by running setup.exe and not entering a Product Key at any time during the upgrade.&nbsp; Choose to keep files and settings, so it is an upgrade not a clean install.</p>

            <p>If your computer shipped with Windows 8 or 8.1 the product key should be recorded in the UEFI.&nbsp; Install Windows 8.1 without entering any product key.&nbsp; After installation, use this command in an Administrator Command prompt&nbsp;to retrieve the product key from
 UEFI and activate with it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no Product Key used to activate Windows 10 free upgrade.&nbsp; It activates by upgrade not by Product Key.&nbsp; The Product Key embedded in the free upgrades is blocked and is not used to activate.</p>
<p>

 for Windows 8.1 then it has to be for Windows 8.1 Pro. How do I install Windows 8.1 Pro with the media tool I have now? I tried rebooting from usb and it doesn't ask me which edition to install.

<h2>            Unable to Delete Files from Search Results USB, Iphone, jpg, 0x8004002&#58; No Such Interface Supported</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I usually manage my photos manually from my iPhone and I am just noticing this problem of being unable to delete them from the device.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have Win7 64bit and an iPhone5 with iOS6 both with all the latest updates as of today.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's the process to reproduce:</div>
<div>1. Plug in iPhone via usb</div>
<div>2. Browse DCIM folder in iPhone</div>
<div>3. Open any subfolder containing media (.jpg, .png, .gif, .mov, &nbsp;etc)</div>
<div>4. In the top right search bar, type: *.jpg -&gt;windows will instantly filter only jpg files</div>
<div>5. Select any amount of files(just one, or all of the images, in my case 800+)</div>
<div>6. Try any one of following: press Delete, right click on the selection and choose delete, hold shift+delete</div>
<div>7: ERROR:</div>
<div>An Unexpected error is keeping you from deleting the file. If you continue to receive this error, you can use the error code to search for help with this problem. Error 0x80004002: No such interface
 supported</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's the hitch, if you omit step 4 the files will delete with out problem. I just would like the search to work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A work around is to change the view type to Details and sort by type or do whatever people want to do from there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If there is a solution I would much appreciate it:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's a screenshot of the error:</div>

<p>I have the exact same issue. It's a mild nuisance to go into each folder. I also wish that apple would name the folders with some type of relevant name.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>W10, how to display PC name on lockscreen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janc1978  say:</h3>
<h2>            W10, how to display PC name on lockscreen</h2>
                    I set up a PIN for the lock screen on my W10 laptop, which displayed the PC name. At some point, the lock screen started displaying my Microsoft account name, not the PC name, and I must use my password to unlock. How can I go back to seeing the PC name
 and using a PIN? There are no other users on this computer, and no need to show the user name.

            Hi LaRhonda.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try adding it in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Email and App Accounts.  
<br />
<br />If you've tried that then try adding it in Mail App &gt; Settings (gear at bottom of Inbox) &gt; Manage Accounts, People App (same place), or Calendar App.  These all can receive the email account and might work better.
<br />
<br />If those fail I'd go into the online Mail Account, change the password to one that works, confirm it several times, then go back and try again in the Mail app. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            Hello  Struggled
<br />Step 1: The first step is to turn on Bluetooth on your iPhone or any other phone which you would like to pair with your Windows 10 PC. To turn on Bluetooth on iPhone, tap Settings, tap Bluetooth, and then turn on Bluetooth. On an Android device, tap Settings, and then tap toggle button next to Bluetooth to turn it on/off.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 2: On your Windows 10 PC, open Settings app. Navigate to Devices &gt; Bluetooth.
<br />Step 3: In Manage Bluetooth devices section, turn on the Bluetooth option to turn on the same on your Windows 10 PC.
<br />Step 4: As soon as you turn on Bluetooth on your Windows 10 PC, Windows 10 will start searching for Bluetooth devices. In a few seconds, your phone/iPhone’s name should appear in manage Bluetooth devices section.
<br />
<br />Step 5: Click on your iPhone/phone’s name to see the Pair button. Click the Pair button
<br />Step 6: Finally, you will see the following screen on your Windows 10 PC. As you can see, the dialog shows a passcode.
<br />Check if the same passcode is appearing on your phone/iPhone as well. If yes, click the Yes button on your PC and then tap Pair option on your iPhone to pair your iPhone with Windows 10 PC via Bluetooth.
<br />
<br />You will see Connected status under your phone’s name in Manage Bluetooth devices section.
<br />
<br />If that didn't work 
<br />Please try these methods 
<br />Method 1 
<br />Restart Bluetooth Support Service 
<br />
<br />Check if the Bluetooth Support Service is running, to do this do the following:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R and type services.msc. 
<br />When the Services window opens search for Bluetooth Support service, right click it and select Restart. Bluetooth support service 
<br />Right click Bluetooth Support Service again and this time choose Properties from the list. 
<br />When the Bluetooth Support Service Properties window opens set the Startup type to Automatic. 
<br />Method 2 
<br />Enable Bluetooth Audio Service 
<br />Press Windows key + X and select Control Panel from the list. 
<br />In Control Panel select Devices and Printers. 
<br />Next locate the Bluetooth speaker device and right click the device. Choose Properties. 
<br />When the Properties window opens go to Services tab. 
<br />Make sure that Audio Sink, Hands free Telephony and Remote Control are selected and click on Apply. 
<br />Method 3 
<br />Update your Bluetooth drivers 
<br />go to your Bluetooth adapter manufacturer’s website, and check if there is a Windows 10 driver available. If no Windows 10 driver is available you can just download the latest driver. 
<br />Select the Start button, type Device Manager, and select it from the list of results. 
<br />Expand a category (like Monitors or Network Adapters) to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select Update Driver. For example, to update a graphics card driver, expand the Display adapters category, right click your graphics card, and select Update Driver. 
<br />I hope it helps       
        </p>

<p>I did find the connection method however MS requires I download MS Edge to my Iphone.&nbsp; &nbsp;Doesn't currently let me "get" the app for some reason.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>My objective is to find a way to move iPhone pics to my PC without going through the iCloud (which is brutally slow and I hate it)&nbsp; Just took some pics i want to put on my PS for storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to download Airdrop and try to move pics that way.&nbsp; &nbsp; iCloud is only suitable for someone in a high speed WiFi area.&nbsp; It is unacceptable in rural areas or away from a WiFi connection.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I do appreciate the detail you send, and the very fast response time!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Try the following methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform a full system scan from the Windows defender.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists then follow the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to&nbsp;disable&nbsp;third party security software (if any installed), and check.</span></p>

            <p>I have the same issue on my desktop PC (Windows 10 Pro). And also, my Quick Access won't expand no more to show me my pinned folders and my recent folders. Now, out of nowhere, it just became a single link to recent files. The same has happened to the Windows

            <p>It looks like a temporary condition that clears itself over time. The location you are trying to access is currently 'locked' (meaning = in use) by another process. See the discussion
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3ggody/a_lock_violation_has_occurred/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. This is the typical explanation/solution that I find with a web search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a continuous 'beta' but so is all software. That's the way the software industry works today. The strategy is to get new features out as quickly as possible and then fix things along the way. Sometimes the 'good old days' really were good.</p>

            <p><em>Windows 10 is a continuous 'beta' but so is all software. That's the way the software industry works today.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not all software: Some types are so critical to some types of business that a failure of the software could result in the loss of lives. Software that has this type of issue generally has a high retail price. We've found windows to be a reliable platform
 in the past, so I assume that Microsoft will be rectifying the issues with Windows 10 to get it out of beta. At the present time, the OS has too many issues to make it a viable business platform for critical applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If, on the other hand, the new platform really is intended to be a continuous beta, it will only take one industry failure to start a massive migration.</p>

<p>Just had this happen on Windows 10, and discovered it seemed to be related to a removable drive. Windows had added a folder on that drive to the Quick Access list while I was doing some work on it. While that drive was plugged in, I got a violation lock
 on Quick Access and nothing was appearing in there. As soon as I unplugged the drive, it started working again.
</p>
<p>The solution for me was to open an admin command prompt, then reset Quick Access back to default using the command below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>del %appdata%\microsoft\windows\recent\automaticdestinations\*</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>No more lock violations. Unfortunately I had to readd the four or five pinned folders I'd previously had, but that was a minor inconvenience.</p>

</p><p>Search Windows: &nbsp;Type in "Quick Access" (It brings up the 'File Explorer Options')</p>
<p>Hit the "Restore Defaults", Apply, OK.</p>
<p>

            Same thing for me, A removable drive was causing the problem. Removing the removable drive solved the problem -- but I don't know why the drive was causing the problem. It has caused other problems as well, so &nbsp;I believe it is time to replace that drive.&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for reaching out to Xbox forums support.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this has caused but rest assured we are here to help. We would like to troubleshoot the console itself a bit more in an effort to clear this up we suggest a full reset of the console
 on more time from the Troubleshoot screen by using these steps&nbsp;: </span></p>

<li><span style="color: inherit"><span>Unplug the network cable if you're using a wired
 network connection.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: inherit"><span>Power off your console, and then unplug the power
 cord to ensure that the console is completely powered off. </span></span></li><li><span style="color: inherit"><span>Wait 30 seconds, and then plug the power cord
 back in.</span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: inherit">Press and hold the
</span><strong><span style="color: inherit">BIND</span></strong><span style="color: inherit">
 button (located on the left side of the console) and the </span><strong><span style="color: inherit">EJECT</span></strong><span style="color: inherit">
 button (located on the front of the console), and then press the </span><strong><span style="color: inherit">Xbox</span></strong><span style="color: inherit">
 button on the console. </span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: inherit">Continue holding the
</span><strong><span style="color: inherit">BIND</span></strong><span style="color: inherit">
 and </span><strong><span style="color: inherit">EJECT</span></strong><span style="color: inherit">
 buttons for 10-15 seconds. </span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: inherit">Listen for two “power-up” tones a couple of seconds
 apart. You can release the </span><strong><span style="color: inherit">BIND</span></strong><span style="color: inherit">
 and </span><strong><span style="color: inherit">EJECT</span></strong><span style="color: inherit">
 buttons after the second power-up tone.</span></span></li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(50, 49, 48, 1)">Once the troubleshooting screen comes up select reset console and then select reset and remove everything. Give it a shot and let us know how it goes.

    <title>&#91;Guides&#93; Forza Horizon 3 Fast Level Up and Skill Point Guide - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> romkazzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Guides&#93; Forza Horizon 3 Fast Level Up and Skill Point Guide</h2>
                    <p>If you are looking to&nbsp;level up faster in&nbsp;Forza Horizon 3, our guide below will help you achieve this by showing a method that will help you earn around 90.000 XP points in 10 minutes.<br /></p><p>Without further ado, here is what you need to do to get easy&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3&nbsp;</em>XP and obviously Wheelspins.<br /></p>

<p>In our video&nbsp;guide, we have used the Jaguar F-Type Project 7 Horizon Edition model, but you can use whatever car you want as long as it is a Horizon Edition and grants XP boost.<br /></p>

<p>If you don’t know how to identify such a car, take a look at the image above and notice the pink mark on the right side, which specifies that the car is a Horizon Edition.</p>

<p>Assuming you don’t have such a car, try the auction house, although these cars can also be won at Wheelspins.</p>

<p>Next, upgrade your car to increase its top speed. If you don’t know how to do that, simply load an upgrade created by other players.</p>

<p>The next thing you have to do is to upgrade the Byron Bay Horizon Festival to level 5. For this you will need fans; therefore, complete more Races, Championships,&nbsp;Danger Signs,&nbsp;Speed Zones,&nbsp;Speed Traps, or&nbsp;Drift Zones.</p>

<p>Now, check your map and find the Goliath Circuit Race which is located on the beach, north from Byron Bay Horizon Festival.</p>

<p>Once you get to the location, you can opt to play a single Exhibition Race, or you can use a Blueprint to play six laps. It depends on how much time you have.</p>

<p>Before starting the race, modify the difficulty to fit your driving skills. Try to maximize the payout by changing the difficulty of Drivatars, the damage, or other aspects, but keep in mind that you need to win the race so don’t go all in if you don’t have the required skills.</p>

<p>Now, all you have to do is to play and win the race.</p>

<p>Since the Goliath Circuit Race is rather a long event, it has the best payout, but you will need around 10 minutes to complete it, or 10 minutes/lap if you have multiple laps.</p>

<p>The tweaks made to the difficulty will affect the number of credits&nbsp;you earn, while the Horizon Edition car will double the XP points.</p>

<p>In the video below you can see that our car&nbsp;increased the number of points by 100% and with the added bonus from the lineup and the skills we have earned 90.000 XP on a 10 minutes race with one lap.</p>

<p>This means that if you pick 6 laps with the same settings, you will get 540.000 XP points in one hour.</p><p>However, there is a trick which you can use to further maximize the amount of XP points received at the end of the race. Go to the Skill Shop and buy the perk&nbsp;named “The XP Bump”. This will give you triple Skills XP&nbsp;for the next 3 campaign races, meaning you get more XP from the skills performed during the race.</p>

<p>The Perk costs 10 Skill points, but if you are a good driver you can get 3 or more in a single lap from the Goliath Circuit. Therefore, if you are a good driver you can pay for the perk every 3 races, which is how long the perk lasts anyway. If you play more than one lap during a single race you can profit even more.</p><p>If you don’t want to spend so much time in a race you can opt to&nbsp;find all XP Boards&nbsp;to level up faster.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omWU4wsbomE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to level Up Fast</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/omWU4wsbomE?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/omWU4wsbomE?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen=

            <p>Now that you know&nbsp;<span>how to level up faster in&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em></span>, let’s see&nbsp;<span>how you can earn more Skill Points</span>&nbsp;while playing the racing video game on&nbsp;<span>PC</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Xbox One</span>.</p>
<p>Again, for this guide we have created a video and for your convenience, below we will outline every step you need to follow to get more Skill Points as fast as possible in&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>.</p>
<p><em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;Skill Points are very important because they allow you to unlock and buy new perks; hence, you should try these methods as soon as you can.</p>
<p>From the beginning, you should know that the more skill perks you buy the more skill points you will get in the game while using our guide.</p>
<p>As you can see in the video there are four&nbsp;special locations where you can farm Skill Points in&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>.</p>
<p>The first location (pictured above) is the highway which connects the Outback and Surfers Paradise.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fvgfaq.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f09%2fForza-Horizon-3-Outback-Highway.jpg" /><br /></p>
<p><br /></p><p>To farm Skill Points here you need a fast car, such as Bugatti Veyron, Ferrari F12tdf, Hennessey Venom GT, Koenigsegg One:1, Koenigsegg Regera or any other car that&nbsp;can easily output more than 300 KM/h. You can even use a cheaper S1 car or a lower tier car that has been upgraded to have a higher speed index.</p>
<p>Once you get the car, visit the Outback area and start driving on the highway towards Surfers Paradise, or the other way around.</p>
<p>The trick is to run as fast as you can, without hitting any of the obstacles on the road. However, most of the points don’t come from doing a high speed bonus, instead you accumulate a lot of ultimate near misses while travelling at that speed.</p>
<p>To earn Skill Points even faster, try doing this during a Skill Song and after you buy some of the following perks:&nbsp;<em>Risk Taker</em>,&nbsp;<em>Passing the Pack</em>,&nbsp;<em>Wombo Combo</em>,&nbsp;<em>Skill Legend</em>,&nbsp;<em>Skills Boss</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hang On</em>,&nbsp;<em>Skill Shortcut</em>.</p>
<p>This method however, is for those with high driving skills.</p>
<p>If you prefer moving at lower speed and get more combos, then you should check the banana fields in Yarra Valley (pictured below).</p>
<p>Before going there, get a car powerful enough to smash the banana trees at normal to high speed. A car that&nbsp;weighs too little or has an insane acceleration won’t do good in the fields.</p>
<p>Now, all that’s left to do is to drive around hitting trees while drifting and driving as fast as you can so you don’t lose the combo.</p>
<p>Again, try doing this while a Skill Song is playing and after you unlock some or all of the following skills:&nbsp;<em>Horizon Skill Song</em>,&nbsp;<em>Addicted to Destruction</em>,&nbsp;<em>Love Tap</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pilot Wings, Drift Star</em>,&nbsp;<em>Radio Star</em>,&nbsp;<em>Wombo Combo</em>,&nbsp;<em>Skill Legend</em>,&nbsp;<em>Skills Boss</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hang On</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Skill Shortcut</em>.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fvgfaq.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f09%2fForza-Horizon-3-Banana-Fields.jpg" /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The next area where you can farm Skill Points is located west of Outback Horizon Festival, and it is also known as Pink Lakes (see below). It is the same area you will have to visit while looking for&nbsp;<a href="https://vgfaq.com/forza-horizon-3-barn-finds-locations-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">one of the Barn Finds</a>.</p>
<p>This region is good for farming because at high speed you will be able to perform chained jumps, so make sure you drive a fast but stable vehicle. Moreover, the area is filled with destructible bushes, thus you can’t easily break the combo even when you turn around to do another run.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fvgfaq.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f09%2fForza-Horizon-3-Pink-Lakes.jpg" /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Last but not least we have the fourth area which is the Redstone Airport. It is the perfect spot to farm points using drifts because the airport runways don’t have traffic and are wide enough to allow performing drifts.</p>
<p>Chain them using a BMW for example and you will farm skill points faster. Or even a better car for drifting is a 1974 Toyota Celica GT that’s been properly tuned to drift.</p><p><br /></p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fvgfaq.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f09%2fForza-Horizon-3-Redstone-Airport.jpg" /><br /></p><p>An important fact you should be aware of is that you can’t bank more than 300.000 points, so when your multiplier hits 300K stop farming. Continue only after your points are safely stored.</p>
<p>If you are lucky enough, although this rarely happens, you will trigger a Skill Song while listening the&nbsp;<em>Timeless</em>&nbsp;radio station. Some of the songs aired by the said station are very long (10 minutes or even more), which means that for 10 minutes you will have the skills boost multiplier active.</p>
<p>But, again, you need to be very lucky.</p>

    <title>Xbox One controller issue involving Y, X, and A buttons- - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One controller issue involving Y, X, and A buttons- help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I hope someone out there can offer some insight into my issue as I have failed at every endeavor of my own to find a solution. &nbsp;Here's the issue as best as I can explain it: when playing any game, if I press the X Y or A buttons (not the B button for some
 reason) &nbsp;I am often kicked back to the home screen as if I had pressed the home button. In some instances it goes as far as to ask me if I would like to shut down my Xbox. Switching weapons, jumping, picking up the sword in Destiny, all these actions (just
 as an example- the same goes for other games) cause this to happen. The worst part is that it is happening on both of my controllers. I have a controller that came bundled with my Xbox as well as a relatively new midnight forces controller.</p>
<p>Both controllers are updated to the most current firmware. I have tried using a play and charge as well as regular batteries. I have reset my Xbox countless times. No luck. &nbsp; I have a video of it happening that I took with my phone but I'm not sure if I
 can upload it here, so if anyone knows how I could make that available to the community, let me know!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks in advance to anyone who might be able to help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi. </p>
<p>Little update : i did a factory reset, but it didn't change the issue.</p>
<p>Any actions that need a presse and hold on this 3 buttons is unachievable as you go back to the home screen.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>An other update : the issue seems to also appear when you need to hold 2 of these buttons at the same time.</p>
<p>It would be good to have a confirmation that this issue has been taken into account at Microsoft!</p>

<p>Microsoft has no idea how to address the problem. Their only answer is "send us your controller so we can repair it". &nbsp;I haven't seen anyone else with this issue though so I guess we can't really expect them to know what's wrong. I'm thinking I might just
 buy a new controller and send the one that's acting up in. </p>

<p>I was starting to think the same way...</p>
<p>Just in case, I have tested the controller on my computer, but the issue is still there, so it doesn't seems linked to the xbox</p>

<p>Update: the issue is not happening on the controller that came bundled with my Xbox one. I was mistaken when &nbsp;I thought it was happening with both controllers. I have tested it thoroughly and cannot recreate the situation with it as I originally thought.
 It is only with my midnight forces controller. I think I'm just going to send it in.

<p>Same issue happening to me as well.</p>
<p>I also have a Midnight Force controller. I wonder if the issue is tied to the Midnight Force controller.</p>
<p>I'm also *** at the quality of these controllers. I have four broken controllers and I have replaced them all already twice. Now I need to pay shipping if I send them back. MS should replace all of them for free.</p>

<p>I did press those and it popped that up again &amp; again&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm good with computers but not that good&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for your drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<h2>            Windows Easy Transfer - Transfer Seems to be Hung with 1 minute left</h2>
                    I just installed a new PC running Windows 7.&nbsp; I am transferring my data from my older XP using Windows Easy Transfer.&nbsp; The total amount of data is around 141GB and I am running this on my Verizon FIOS network.&nbsp; The transfer appears to be complete.&nbsp; However,
 the new computer says it has 1 minute left for the transfer.&nbsp; It has been stuck in this mode for the past hour or more.<br />
<br />
The task manager is not showing any hung programs.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Any ideas of what I can do to get this completed????<br />
<br />
THanks, Mike

<h2>            &#34;Continue on PC&#34; Android doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I followed all the instructions for using "continue on PC" on my Android phone (Galaxy S8).&nbsp; I added my phone number and on the phone it brought me to install Edge for Android, which I did. In my PC settings it shows my phone under "manage phones". It also
 shows icons o=under "your progress"; however when you click on that nothing happens. At any rate, when I go to a web page on my phone using the Chrome browser and select "share" , there is supposed to be a "continue on PC" option under "share via", but there
 is not. Why? What else do I have to do?</p>

<p>They do say it, but it's different on different pages and for different desires.&nbsp; Edge only sends to Edge.&nbsp; Some people just want that. &nbsp; If you want to see this in your Share targets, it's this other app. If you open "phone companion', it pushes you to
 this app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically just depends how you want to use it, they'll accommodate either or both ways.</p>

    <title>When I try to start Windows Update, nothing happens. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patricia mn  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I try to start Windows Update, nothing happens.</h2>
                    I had to disable the automatic Windows Update for a while. Now, when I try to start Windows Update, nothing happens.
<br />
<br />
I get the message from bottom right part of the window, saying that I have updates to install. When I click on this message, nothing happens.<br />
<br />
I tried to open Control Panel to configure the updates automatic again. Control Panel opens but when I click on any option, Control Panel "freezes" (although it is said to be running on the Task Administrator - sorry for the translation, I have Windows 7 in
 Spanish. :-)<br />
<br />
I have already run the antivirus which apparently cleared up some viruses, rebooted the machine and tried again. All the same.<br />
<br />
Ah, I also tried the Microsoft Fix It application. It says it fixed something but the behaviour is still the same.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate if anybody could let me know what else I could try.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<p>Here is information about the compatibility issue - you'll need to select the applicable version:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=Citrix%20ICA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=Citrix%20ICA</a>.</p>
<p>If it is not compartible at all, then there is nothing you can do about it except upgrade (or actually purchase a full install version of) the software (if they offer a version that is compatiblle with Vista and it seems they do) or choose a different product
 that is compatible and does the same function.&nbsp; You should not load known incompatible software on your system.</p>
<p>If it is questionable and not fully determined, then you can try using Compatibility Mode to see if that works:<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-compatibility-mode/</a>&nbsp;(but
 don't try this if the compatibility center says it is not compatible or it could damage your system and some of your other programs).</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
