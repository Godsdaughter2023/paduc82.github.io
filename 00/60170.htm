    <title>Transferring Photos Folders from Windows 7 to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ron mcgihon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring Photos Folders from Windows 7 to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have transferred all photos from Windows 7 to Windows 10 by copying and pasting via an external hard drive. &nbsp;One issue that I have noticed is that the Tag Names on the Folders that are copied are lost in this transfer, and as such, appear as Unspecified.
 &nbsp;The individual pictures in the folders show the original Tag Name in the Meta Data File. Individual pictures that are not Folders retain their tag names for sorting. &nbsp;In Windows 7, there was the option to "Arrange by Tag", which included the folders. &nbsp;In
 Windows 10, there is not an "Arrange by Tag" option as it is greyed out, but there are "Sort by Tag" and "Group by Tag" options. &nbsp;Sorting and Grouping result in the folder being Unspecified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that background, is there any method that will transfer the Tag Names on the Folders when moving picture files from Windows 7 to Windows 10.<br />
</p>
<p>

<p>Folders themselves can't have tags, but you mentioning the "arrange by" option gives me a good clue. &nbsp;That's a function that is part of the "Library" tool, which is still in Windows 10, but hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In File Explorer, in the left edge, right-click a blank space and choose Show Libraries</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now go into your picture library there, right-click any blank space, and the "arrange by" option will show up this time, allowing you to arrange by tag the way you did before, where each tag will look like a folder stack.</p>

            I think it's such a shame that Libraries are de-emphasized (maybe even going away someday), because I love the abilities they provide.&nbsp; As much as everyone hated it, Windows Vista even had the cool ability to do this inside any folder (libraries didn't
 exist back then).

<h2>            How do you determine which program to use to open various file types&#63; &#40;EX. vhd or jpg or whatever&#41;</h2>
                    On several occasions I was unable to open files and told I needed ti know the program the file was saved with. This is unknown to me since I don't remember or I wasnt the person to save the file in the first place. Like with back up files on an external
 hard drive. (Why bnack up anything if i cant locate or open anything in the back up) The "open with " option is a guessing game for me 90% of the time. Is there a simple list of programs used to open certain files? Ex. jpg files followed by a list to indicate
 what "open with" to chose.

            When the system doesn't know how to open a file, you get two options:
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Choose a program to open this file<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
</li><li>Use a web service to find the appropriate program</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>If you use option #2, it will tell you what program is needed, exactly as you ask.</div>

<h2>            My Windows 8.1 Pro has started demanding that I activate it again. Error &#58; 0xC004F012</h2>
                    <p>Original title: My Windows 8.1 Pro has started demanding that I activate it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I upgraded my laptop to Windows 8 last January. I activated it and have used it with no problems. When Windows 8.1 came out I upgrade via the store and, once again, it worked fine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A couple of days ago My system started updating itself when I powered it on for a new day. It&nbsp; took ages so I assume it was a major update. After the update it tried to reboot but sat for about an hour with just the task bar, with&nbsp;the windows icon on the
 left, and the words "Windows 8.1 Pro Build 9600" in the bottom-right corner. The colours where shades of grey. I did a ctrl+alt+Delete restart and everything came back without a problem. The "Windows 8.1 Pro Build 9600" is still being displayed although it
 wasn't before the update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since this Windows keeps demanding that I activate it. The activation screen displays the last 5 digits of my activation key correctly but displays the error 0xC004F012. When I type in my activation key, from when I first installed Windows 8, it refuses
 to accept it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried using <strong>slui.exe 4 </strong>but my system just sits on "Call and provide your installation ID" with the circling dots for ever. what is the installation ID anyway?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Looking through&nbsp;Windows help and technical support the only thing that comes close to fitting is the one about Windows 8.1 Pro being installed over a&nbsp;previous Windows 8.1 Pro. This makes very little sense as the problem started after an automatic update.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p>I contacted support by telephone and was advised to roll back my system to before the update that caused the problem. This fixed everything and my Windows 8.1 has stopped demanding that I activate it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Will Windows now re-download and apply&nbsp;the missing updates automatically or will I need to do this manually?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The said gray object could be a couple of things, in some cases it's a malware, however, in most cases it's a manufacturer application that runs in the background. We would just like to know some things before we proceed with the troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are there processes that you can do with the said object like clicking or right-clicking on it?</li><li>Are you able to dispose or close of it somehow?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>First thing to try is to do a right-click on the object and see if the applications name would be displayed. If in case it doesn't come up, please open the
<strong>Task</strong> <strong>manager</strong> by right-clicking on the <strong>taskbar</strong> at the bottom of your screen. See&nbsp; if there is anything in there.</p>
<p>

&gt; How much RAM will Win7 32<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All 32-bit client versions of Windows (not just Vista/XP/7) have a 4GB <br />
address space (64-bit versions can use much more). That's the <br />
theoretical upper limit beyond which you can not go.<br />
<br />
But you can't use the entire 4GB of address space. Even though you <br />
have a 4GB address space, you can only use *around* 3.1GB of RAM. <br />
That's because some of that space is used by hardware and is not <br />
available to the operating system and applications. The amount you can<br />
use varies, depending on what hardware you have installed, but can <br />
range from as little as 2GB to as much as 3.5GB. It's usually around <br />
3.1GB.<br />
<br />
Note that the hardware is using the address *space*, not the actual <br />
RAM itself. If you have a greater amount of RAM, the rest of the RAM <br />
goes unused because there is no address space to map it to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; &amp; 64 bit address?<br />
<br />
<br />
That depends on the edition:<br />
<br />
Starter: 8GB<br />
Home Basic: 8GB<br />
Home Premium: 16GB<br />
Professional: 192GB<br />
Enterprise: 192GB<br />
Ultimate: 192GB<br />

<p><span>-&gt; There is no difference between hibernation and shut-down as far as the hardware is concerned. Hibernation is fine but once every so often you should restart the machine so that updates can be applied.</span></p>

<p>I haven't been able to stay connected onto XBL for a few days and everytime I log in I receive a different error code. I have moved the xbox downstairs, closer to the router, and it stopped having problems but that is not a permanent solution and I need
 it to work upstairs. Upstairs, the router is right below my Xbox so I should not be having this much problem. I have had it this far away from the router for over a year. If I turn on my Xbox I will stay logged on for about 5-10 minutes with no problems and
 then I will be kicked off. It is not a connection problem from the router because I can fully connect to XBL and my phone/laptop/etc stay connected to the internet, just not my particular Xbox. My dad's Xbox downstairs is still connecting with no problems,
 however he uses a wired connection. The Xbox Network Settings say Xbox 360--- My Network--- Internet--- Xbox Live are all connected and looks seemingly fine,&nbsp; just can't stay connected and will constantly receive errors. Also nothing seems to be wrong with
 my gamertag, gamer points, updating issues, or anything like that.</p>
<p>Will an external wireless adapter fix my Xbox? I am having a feeling my internal wireless is just not working anymore or is not strong enough to receive my routers signal anymore. I can't use a wired connection because it cannot reach at the moment. Is there
 anyway to fix my problem? <span>I have done all I can do and scoured the forums for problems like mine. I just want to know if an external wireless will help seeing that my internal wireless still kinda works, I just have to be right on the router to keep
 connected. Also when I am right next to the router I receive no error codes and everything is fine.<b><strong>

<p>This error code (8007274C) is common for connection problems (being too far from router). The second error code (807BO1F4) isn't even in the database when I do an error code lookup. You may want to call someone at support (See below)</p>
<p>This error code - 8007065B means that a Gamertag change may not have been applied correctly.
</p>
<p>Have you changed your gamertag recently?</p>
<p>If so - Contact Support by Requesting a Call here - <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us#1:0:3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I haven't changed my gamer tag and everything is fine when I initially log into my Xbox and there are no gamer tag issues, like missing points or avatar problems of anything. The external adapter also didn't help. Is it possible my internal adapter is getting
 worn out and can't keep me connected?</p>
<p>ALSO: Sorry I misspelled the error code, it's 807B10F7 not F4 my mistake!</p>
<p>EDIT: Also I have tried moving my Xbox closer to the area right over my router and, even though it's technically closer than when it was downstairs, it still will not keep a connection. is it possible it cannot receive information based on that angle if
 it is too worn out? It's a stupid idea to me but I don't know how the wireless receiver works so I am trying to think of every problem.

<p>You are more than likely getting some interference from some other device or there has been some change in your router. Changes in your router settings can and do affect how your xbox connects and talks with the router. There are all sorts of variables that
 can cause this and you just need to remember any changes that have been made or what not.

            It works the same in Windows 10, the Internet Explorer is still there. &nbsp;Just make sure you aren't accidentally using some other browser like Firefox or Edge, because those are of course different and won't have the same options you saw on Windows 8.

<h2>            Start menu, icons on task bar not working</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. It worked fine for a few days. The start menu and icons on the taskbar are now nonfunctional. &nbsp;Cortana and the search function are also not working. I tried all the fixes - scannow, powershell, and creating a new profile/user
 name. The powershell stuff removed the store icon. I cannot get to Windows update - it is not in the control panel. I am lost on what to do.<br />
<br />
Would I be able to revert back to Windows 7 then go back to Windows 10? Is there any other way to fix this issue, other than the 4 methods found online? &nbsp;

<h2>            Amazon Prime Music</h2>
                    I installed the Amazon Prime App on my laptop, which has Windows 10. Shortly after going online, the app takes over the screen and I have to close it to access whatever I'm trying to access (Bing, email, favorite addresses, whatever). It's a minor inconvenience,
 granted, but I would like to get at what I want to get at without having to look at and close the Amazon Prime Music app first.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 7 chkdsk errors prevent Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ttrout  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 chkdsk errors prevent Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>An attempt to upgrade Windows 7 H&amp;P to Windows 10 failed with error code C1900101-30017.&nbsp; The upgrade process included a stage where something to the effect of disk repair was performed.&nbsp; The process concluded with a message that the system was being returned
 to its original OS.&nbsp; The system, however, was in an unstable state - two third-party applications reported errors on boot and the Start menu would close after a couple of seconds.&nbsp; I then restored a system image created immediately before the upgrade attempt.&nbsp;
 The system behaved properly after the restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then used the C: drive tools to check for drive errors.&nbsp; I received a significant number of errors such as the following (others may have occurred but scrolled out of the screen buffer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting an index entry with Id 5017 from index $SDH of file 9. (at least 800 similar to this)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Replacing invalid security id with default security id for file 191329. (36 similar to this)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Creating default security descriptor for undefined security ID 4821. (95 similar to this)</p>
<p>
</p><p>[To be precise, the above errors were observed running chkdsk on a mount of a copy of the system image's C: drive on a separate system.&nbsp; This technique does not induce any chkdsk errors.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the system was rebooted afterwards it behaved exactly as after the failed upgrade attempt.&nbsp; Investigating further I discovered that the Peer Network Resolution Protocol service would not start.&nbsp; None of the remedies found in extensive web searches enabled
 the service to start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reasonable information on the chkdsk errors I found related to Windows 2000 so I assume the hotfix there does not apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how best to proceed (short of system recovery, upgrade, reinstall apps, restore data)?</p>

<p>Do you have another Security Suite installed that also includes a Firewall?&nbsp; If so, that program may have deactivated Windows Firewall and done so using local group policy (which exists in some versions of Vista).&nbsp; This may be fine if you are satisfied that
 the Security suite's firewall is adequate.&nbsp; If not, it is likely that the software has a way to deactivate its firewall and reactivate the Windows Firewall built into the setting (though they may use Group Policy to put them into effect).</p>
<p>Let's see if you have any control over group policy.&nbsp; Go to Start / Search box and type Group Policy Editor and enter and double-click on the program icon that appears (if it is available).&nbsp; If Group Policy is bloocking it, it is somewhere in there (but
 there's no search option so finding it may be difficult).&nbsp; I checked on my system and there was no way to shut off the firewall using established group policies so it this is happening to you, it must be something that was added - and I suspect some form of
 hacking or malware (or another security program).</p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs
 (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>
 and Avast at: </span><span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a></span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's try that for now and see if it works.&nbsp; If not, reply back
 with results and we'll try some other options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

            Let Windows handle your page file.<br />
<br />
To manually change the size of virtual memory, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> , click <strong>
Run</strong> , type <span>sysdm.cpl</span> in the <strong>
Open</strong> box, and then press ENTER. </li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and then under <strong>
Performance</strong> click <strong>Settings</strong> . </li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and then under <strong>
Virtual memory</strong> click <strong>Change</strong> . </li><li>Under <strong>Drive [ ]</strong> , click the drive that contains the paging file that you want to change. (This will be your C:\ drive.)
</li><li>Under <strong>Paging file size for selected drive</strong> , set this to allow Windows to manage the page file, and then click
<strong>Set</strong> . </li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to close the dialog box and apply changes.
</li></ol>
After you change the size of the paging file, you may be prompted to restart Windows. If you are prompted to restart, the changes will not take effect until Windows is restarted.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't help <strong>OR</strong> your page file is already being handled by Windows, you have too many programs/processes running in the background. They could be legitimate or malware.<br />
<br />
1. Start by making sure the computer is completely virus/malware-free:<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
2. If the computer is clean - <strong>and only when you are sure it is clean</strong> - manage your Startup:<br />
<br />
<span>Start&gt;Run&gt;msconfig [enter]<br />
<br />
This brings up the System Configuration Utility. Look on the Startup tab and find the probable culprit. Uncheck the box next to its name, Apply and OK out. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used
 the Utility. Just tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />
<br />
Important - Do not use the System Configuration Utility to stop processes. Instead, use Start&gt;Run&gt;services.msc [enter]
</span><span>and do not stop any services unless you really, really know what you're doing.</span>

    <title>YouTube Content ID False Claims - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twg monument v2  say:</h3>
<h2>            YouTube Content ID False Claims</h2>
                    
<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>

<p>The YouTube Content ID system has been providing everyone problems since the day of its inception and while they are trying to protect copyright, it seems it doesn't really protect those who have a legitimate claim to the content. I have a YouTube channel
 that gets a new content ID match every week and it was starting to get on my nerves so I decided to research the appropriate copyright holders of the games I upload on my channel. Unfortunately, I can't use outside sources on the Internet as a source to appeal
 on YouTube, but I would be able to if I had something from the appropriate copyright holders. I have never received any content ID matches from 343 Industries or Microsoft Studios but always get them from these few companies: [Merlin] IDOL, Shock Entertainment
 Pty, [Merlin] Phonofile, Believe Music, WMG,SME, The Orchard Music, [Merlin] Essential Music, Streammer, and INgrooves.</p>

<p>As I said, I did research on a few companies and a lot of the "Google" searches I have done always point me in the direction that most of these companies have no right to the content in the games this company created. I would like to note that I have no
 problem giving credit where credit it is due as I don't want my channel to get a copyright strike and it is a crime to attempt to steal the work of another company to pass it off as your own. My goal is quite simple, I want to know what companies that Microsoft
 has allowed copyright to or give me a statement that I can use against the company that illegitimately claims copyright. I understand and am in the process of putting the Microsoft Content Usage Rules in my videos, but the rules defeat the purpose without
 knowing who Microsoft's affiliates are. Here is what I could use to help with my problem:</p>

<p>1. An official statement from Microsoft that allows me to use their content in my videos and monetize them (in the event of a dispute or DMCA).</p>
<p>2. A list of affiliates that Microsoft uses as third parties to monitor the Content ID system so I can give credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>3. An active intervention in YouTube's Content ID system because there is an innumerable amount of videos claimed by the aforementioned companies in the first paragraph.</p>
<p>If at least one of these can be possible I would be happy. Please help me out because I can't go against these companies without something to successfully counter their claim and if it goes to a DMCA, I would love a statement from Microsoft to help me or
 if the companies are affiliates or have copyrighted the content as well I would love to give credit where credit is due. I am not a guy who is trying to steal your work or claim it is mine, I just would like to make YouTube videos without getting hammered
 by false claims and I don't want to be ignorant of this any longer. Any help would be wonderful.</p>

<p>Thank You,</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Having not watched your videos, I can't make any definitive statements. &nbsp;I can only give possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">It is possible that these companies are making false claims. &nbsp;Doing a Google search on some of them gives credence to that theory. &nbsp;Although it may not entirely be the case. &nbsp;Some of those companies may own, or distribute in-game
 music or other music in your videos, and they are making claims on behalf of that (again, I haven't watched your videos, so I don't know if this is the case).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Either way, this is something that needs to be taken up with YouTube, not Xbox. &nbsp;Keep filing counter-claims. &nbsp;That's all you can really do.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. First, I was referred here by the Xbox Support Team who said that posting on this forum will help out. Anyways, i have tried to get in contact with YouTube, the companies that are claiming the content, but the only true way to get fix
 this, which is suggested by YouTube, is to contact the main corporation or its affiliates. Also, the content they claim is in-game music which I can assume is covered by Microsoft's Game Usage Rules. If you have any information on how to contact Microsoft
 or the appropriate company, I would love the info to try to fix my problem. Thanks for your response.</p>

<p>You need 3rd Party Software to do that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/Eraser/eraser.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/Eraser/eraser.html</a></p>
<p>Eraser is a secure file deletion tool that allows you to completely remove sensitive data from your hard drive by overwriting it several times with sophisticated patterns (Gutman, USDoD and others). You can simply drag and drop files and/or folders onto
 the on-demand eraser, use the convenient Windows Explorer right-click extension or use the built-in scheduler for automated wiping of unused disk space, browser cache files etc. Easy to use and secure!</p>
<p>Or a Commercial one: <a href="http://www.east-tec.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.east-tec.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, any Data can be recovered from a Drive, using the right process; no matter what you do.</p>

            Hi Renee, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />There could be a few reasons why your front USB ports aren't working. The first this that comes to mind for me is that they aren't plugged into your motherboard inside your computer's case.
<br />
<br />Have the ports ever worked? Or never worked? If never, that tells me they aren't plugged into your motherboard. You'll need to open up your case to plug them in, but it's a tricky procedure so I'd recommend getting a technician to have a look at it if you're not confident.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, if they're just stopped working at some point, you could see if there's any problems in Device Manager.
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager
<br />- See if any of your USB ports have a yellow or red warning symbol.
<br />- If any do, right-click it and try updating or uninstall/reinstalling the drivers.
<br />
<br />If you need further support with this, please let me know! Thanks!       
        </p>

<br />You didn't tell me what are the manufacturer and model of your computer.
<br />In my opinion, your issue is harware matter, not soft.

            In that case, you could try the System File Checker to see if there's any system files that can be repaired to fix the issue:

<br />
<br />I would however suggest that in all likelihood it's a hardware issue, so you may need to get your computer diagnosed by a technician.

            Where did you find  #8GRVUUF ? 
<br />type system info in Windows search area and you will find model or at least motherboard model.
<br />Anyway, I Don't change my mind.
<br />I think it's an hardware issue, like Something disconnected Inside.
<br />. If you don't have any more questions and have a moment feel free to rate my support.
<br /> I wish you all the best.

<p>I just ran this--no change. I'll try restarting, and if that doesn't work, I guess I'll open the case and check the connections.</p>

<p>DESKTOP-8GRVUUF is the System Name (given my Microsoft?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Manufacturer is HP</p>
<p>The Model is HP ENVY DFesktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cables are all connected inside. I am running a USB extension cord from the back the machine. I guess I'll have to check with HP, although I've heard this is a fairly common Windows 10 problem.</p>
