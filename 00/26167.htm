    <title>Office 365 Business Essentials and Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 Business Essentials and Outlook 2016</h2>
                    
<p>Right now I have Office 365 Home. I'm using that with an outlook.com e-mail address. I've installed the apps on my desktop and my laptop computers. Outlook appears to sync my calendar, contacts and tasks. It does not sync my quick steps or message rules.&nbsp;When
 I log in to outlook.com, I see that I'm using Outlook Mail Preview. I read that, with the new preview version, the data is stored on an exchange server. I don't understand how to get all my outlook data synced/stored on an exchange server.</p>
<p>I really would like everything stored in the cloud so that I can work on my desktop and laptop with the same outlook data. Is that possible? When I google, I see people saying that Outlook stores quick steps and rules on an exchange server. Yet, when I open
 Outlook on my laptop, I have no quick steps, no message rules and I'm missing categories.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Do I need to purchase Business Essentials to get quick steps and message also synced (or is just not possible to have all my outlook data synced)?</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your help.</p>

<p>Hi Vincent,</p>
<p>Based on your description, I understand that you are using an Outlook.com account in your Outlook desktop client and laptop client, you want to sync Outlook quick steps and message rules between these clients. Am I right?</p>
<p>If yes, based on my experience, the Outlook quick steps cannot be synced between different devices and some message rules are also the case in the Outlook clients.</p>
<p>As you are using Office 365 Home plan and our forum focuses on Office 365 Business plans, if you have other questions regarding Office 365 Home plan, I suggest you post them in our
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp?tab=Threads">
Office 365 Home, Personal, and University Community Forum </a>for professional assistance. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>As for your question “Do I need to purchase Business Essentials to get quick steps and message also synced (or is just not possible to have all my outlook data synced)?”, the situation is the same for an Office 365 Business Essentials (Exchange Online) account,
 the Outlook quick steps and message rules cannot be synced between different devices. You may need to re-create the Quick steps and rules on the other PCs as a workaround. Sorry for the inconvenience it might cause.</p>
<p>I understand it would be nice if we can sync Outlook quick steps and message rules in different devices with an Exchange Online account. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:</p>

    <title>Incoming Call Notification Ringtone Does Not Work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nimbusartz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incoming Call Notification Ringtone Does Not Work</h2>
                    For some reason, ever since I have switched to Classic Skype to Skype for Windows 10, the incoming call notification and ringtone does not appear when I am being called. However, it will appear only on my mobile device, since I have Skype installed there
 as well. Is this an internal issue with my laptop? Or is it a technical issue with Skype itself? A resolution would be much appreciated.&nbsp;

            As far as I can see the behaviour seems to be that if the file is opened without displaying an opening form the file name is shows, as in Karl's example.&nbsp; If an opening form is displayed it is not, and you would have to set the Application Title to show
 it, as in Butch's example.<br />
<br />
To set the title bar to the current file's full path you can use code like that to which Sandro referred you, setting it to the Name property of the current database object:<br />
<br />
Sub ChangeTitle()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Dim obj As Object<br />
&nbsp;Const conPropNotFoundError = 3270<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;On Error GoTo ErrorHandler<br />
&nbsp;' Change title bar.<br />
&nbsp;CurrentDb.Properties!AppTitle = CurrentDb.Name<br />
&nbsp;' Update title bar on screen.<br />
&nbsp;Application.RefreshTitleBar<br />
&nbsp;Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp;<br />
ErrorHandler:<br />
&nbsp;If Err.Number = conPropNotFoundError Then<br />
&nbsp;Set obj = CurrentDb.CreateProperty("AppTitle", dbText, "Contacts Database")<br />
&nbsp;CurrentDb.Properties.Append obj<br />
&nbsp;Else<br />
&nbsp;MsgBox "Error: " &amp; Err.Number &amp; vbCrLf &amp; Err.Description<br />
&nbsp;End If<br />
&nbsp;Resume Next<br />
&nbsp;<br />
End Sub<br />

<h2>            WIndows 10 TP Mail app does not work properly</h2>
                    <p>I am running the 10130 and have just updated the Mail app. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't get any of the junk emails to display -- I can read a preview , but clicking on the email only shows the email header.&nbsp; I don't believe I have gotten junk emails to display properly in any of the WIndows 10 Mail Apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A social mail box has shown up in the last couple of App Updates, however, there is never anything in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if Microsoft would add a Newsletter folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially what I am asking for is for the Windows 10 mail app to work like it does in Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posted in the feedback app as well.</p>

    <title>Need VBA to auto update linked Excel file while viewing PP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> just123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need VBA to auto update linked Excel file while viewing PP</h2>
                    
<p>Let me give you a rundown of what I've done so far:</p>
<p>1) Selected and Copied a range of cells within a saved&nbsp;Excel file I want to show in PowerPoint.</p>
<p>2) In PowerPoint, Paste Special &gt;&nbsp;Paste Link &gt; Microsoft Office Excel Worksheet Object.</p>
<p>3) Resized the new linked Excel object to fit empty slide.</p>
<p>Now what I'm trying to do is create a macro that will refresh the Excel data shown in this PowerPoint slide WHILE IN SLIDE SHOW MODE. (As a side note: the funny thing is that the data is automatically updating in the PowerPoint file while open and while
 I'm changing it in Excel, without even saving the Excel file. This is perfect... except for that the same thing does NOT happen while I'm actually viewing the slideshow in Slide Show mode.)</p>
<p>I tried using this code: <em>ActivePresentation.UpdateLinks</em> but that does not seem to work. Perhaps I just need some more code to actually refresh the slide that is displayed? I'm not really sure.</p>
<p><strong>Here is my final objective: To allow&nbsp;a user to have Excel open at the same time as a PowerPoint file in View Slide Show mode, so that during a presentation they can edit numbers within Excel and have it update the linked object automatically (or
 on an Action event like a click or&nbsp;mouseover) in the PowerPoint presentation screen.</strong></p>

            Try changing the view to another slide, then back to the current slide after making changes.&nbsp; By and large, you always need to do this in order to get the slide to update in slide show view.&nbsp; Let us know if that works.

I've tried that. It does not work. Even if it did, that is not what I want. If someone is in the middle of a presentation, they shouldn't have to switch back and forth, over and over, between 2 slides just to update&nbsp;numbers as they go along. As they enter data
 changes, it needs to just change in the PowerPoint as it does in Excel. I wouldn't mind them having to, say... wiggle their mouse over the linked object to get it to change (with a mouseover action to get the macro to run) because to the other viewers that
 isn't as noticeable as changing a slide back and forth. Having it update automatically somehow is even better. But moving forward/backward wouldn't be a good option for viewer or presenter.

Ok so... let me be sure I understand you correctly... my macro should just look like the following?</p>
<p>Sub Auto_Update_Excel_Link()</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActivePresentation.UpdateLinks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oShp.LinkFormat.Update</p>

<p>Ok, well I copied and pasted those 3 lines into the macro in place of what I had. Does not work. I also tried adding those 3 lines beneath what I already had:&nbsp;<em>ActivePresentation.UpdateLinks</em>&nbsp; That didn't work either. I also tried changing the Shapes(2)
 to Shapes(1) because there was really only one object on the slide that I knew of (my linked Excel object I'm trying to refresh). That didn't work either.</p>
<p>Although, I could be misunderstanding what you're saying I should do?</p>

<p>Switching to another slide and back is instantaneous.&nbsp; The audience won't see it.&nbsp; And the presenter won't be doing it, your VBA will.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you need to move the shape being updated off the slide and back on, due to a PPT refresh bug.&nbsp; Again, in VBA and again, it happens so fast that nobody sees it.</p>

No error messages, it just doesn't do anything. I'm still not 100% certain I did exactly what I should have done though, as your instructions weren't all that detailed. (Not blaming you, I'm just saying I wouldn't leave out the&nbsp;possibility that&nbsp;I could have
 misunderstood and screwed up the application of your example.)</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to "check" that it is a linked excel object, but I'm sure it is. I described&nbsp;above exactly how I pasted it in.&nbsp;I can right click it and "update link" manually when not in slideshow mode. In fact, it actually refreshes automatically when
 not in slideshow mode even <em>without</em> doing that.&nbsp;Why can't&nbsp;it just refresh/update while in slideshow mode! GRAH!</p>

            That website is not that bad, but my question a full length movie is possible to add on nokia's current N73 ME/N73's 2 GB cards, so what is the especiality?<br />
<br />
Guess, it has improved MP4 video playin capability.<br />
<br />
PS:godfather is currently related to famous EA Games launch with PS2, PS3 and PC, then A godfather edition and the feature:full length movie capability is quite unrelated to each other.

                    <p>When viewing the slideshow in presentation mode (where one screen which will be the projector shows just the slide full screen and the other shows the speaker the slide and speaker notes), the bullets don't show up and neither do the indents.&nbsp;

<h2>            Feedback&#58; Xbox One S DVD&#47;Blu-Ray Player</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered gaming via the Xbox One S, which I had initially purchased for my son. I'm a fan. That said, I have been disappointed by the DVD player, specifically the control interface.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Case: Watching an instructional DVD (though this could apply to the close-watching of any disc content)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Requirement: Easy access to transport features such as Rewind, Fast Forward, Pause, Slow-Motion, Chapter Seek, and Return to Menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The Xbox controller controls an on-screen menu for most functions rather than directly controlling playback.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Content is obscured by on-screen menu/display</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; B. Swift control of transport features is not possible (quickly rewinding, fast forwarding, or skipping tracks/chapters)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; C. Mapping of Xbox controller to DVD functions was difficult to find</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; D. Poorly meets need</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. "Glass" app for iPhone</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A. Same problems a (1A) and (1B) above</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;B. Some DVD transport features unavailable</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;C. Lack of instructions (even customer support had nothing)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;D. Does not meet need</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Xbox Media Remote</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A. Advised by customer support not to buy the Media Remote, as the problems in (1A) and (1B) will not be solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Spent over 30 minutes chatting with a (very nice) customer support agent. She had very little documentation but was personally familiar with the limitations of the Xbox DVD/Blu-Ray player. She suggested I send feedback to the product development team and
 advised buying a standalone DVD player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Disappointed that I cannot use Xbox for DVD playback. Purchased a standalone DVD player for $60 that successful incorporates basic DVD playback functions via the remote control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>memory card formatting failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 21892189  say:</h3>
<h2>            memory card formatting failed</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Nokia 3720 Classic which has a 1gb micro sd memory card which, as far as I can remember, has never been formated in this phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I&nbsp;tried to format the card the other day to increase the phone's memory I got the response "operation failed".</p>
<p>I changed my service provider ( I live in France ) some time ago, and I wonder if that has something to do with it.</p>
<p>Can somebody help? I am afraid I am a novice in this field, so, please bear that in mind!</p>

<p>Since my last message I have been able to borrow an identical phone for comparison. When I tried my memory card in the other phone, it worked fine, and gave memory information as 765mb available, 175mb used, and 940mb total memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried the memory card from the other&nbsp; phone in my phone, I had the same problem as before - the phone showed the card as unformatted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like the problem is with my telephone, but can anything be done? I have noticed that the flimsy metal bracket which holds the memory card in place is not very secure, but&nbsp;it looks to be good and flat and&nbsp;in the right place for all its gold contacts
 to be working.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2013</h2>
                    I can't get any of the applications running, they were working 3 weeks ago, nothing has been changed hardware wise, only auto updates were installed. I need this for home work immediately. I don't get any notification after I click on the apps, They just
 don't start. I have tried to reinstall but I get a message that an error occurred and that it couldn't install. I tried uninstalling and it still doesn't work.

            Please confirm if you have an "Office 2013 ???" bundle or an "Office 365 ???" bundle.<br />
<br />
Here are some possible fixes for this type of problem IF YOU HAVE Office 365:<br />
<br />
<div>Cannot Start Office 2013 applications / Cannot Uninstall Office 2013 / 365 <span>
- Just Stopped Running</span> - several things to check </div>
<p>#1 - if Office 365 applications “just stops running”<span>&nbsp; </span>- check that the “Microsoft Office Service” is Running (this does not apply to Office 2013 installations</p>
<p>#2 Try Renaming OSF.DLL</p>
<p>#3 Turn Off system animation AND Uninstall Avast AV</p>
<p>#4 Shut down ALL Office applications then restart them in Safe mode - if this fixes the problem an Office addin is the problem. Stop them until you find the fix. Abbyy FineReader (it comes with many Epson Printers) is a common offender here, but there are
 others</p>

</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>If you have Office 365, Check that the “Microsoft Office Service” is running
<p>If you have Office 365 installed and activated, and then it “just stopped running”, the first thing to check is make sure the “Microsoft Office Service” is running:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On Win 8 Start Screen simply type “<b>Services</b>”. It should show up in the “Apps” list.<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b>Or</b><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in &lt;WIN&gt;&lt;R&gt; (the Run window), type <b>services.msc</b>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Srcoll to find the service name</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Right click on the service name</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Select Properties</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click on the start button</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: in Win 8 Control Panel “Services” is hidden under Administrative Tools.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>**********</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>Another possible cause is the OSF.DLL </div>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>Some people have found that simply<span>&nbsp; </span>renaming the OSF.DLL file fixes many “random” problems</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You’ll find it in either of these two positions:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\Office15\OSF.DLL</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Or</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office15\OSF.DLL</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once the file is deleted, open Excel and check if the issue persists. That worked great for me.</span></p>

<div>Excel 2013 Crashes when you scroll - OSF.DLL (Office / Visio DLL File) - Stop “annimations” &amp; uninstall Avast AV
<p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/the_microsoft_excel_support_team_blog/archive/2013/11/04/excel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/b/the_microsoft_excel_support_team_blog/archive/2013/11/04/excel</a>-2013-crashes-when-you-attempt-to-scroll-down-the-page.aspx<span>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>4 Nov 2013 10:39 AM </span></strong></p>
<p>We have seen several reports of Excel crashing when you scroll down, even on a brand-new sheet. The&nbsp;Application Event log points to a crash in OSF.dll.</p>
<p>We have found that at least one cause of this particular crash is a conflict with Avast! Antivirus. Essentially, if you install Avast! and then open any workbook, Excel will crash if you scroll down using the scroll bar or the mouse wheel. This issue only
 occurs if you are logged in using a Microsoft Account (previously known as Live ID).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the crash continues to happen even if you uninstall Avast! and run an online repair. We have been able to reduce the instance of issues by Uninstalling Avast! Free Antivirus, rebooting, and then turning off animations in Windows. To do that:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Control panel, go to the <strong>
<span>Ease of Access Center</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click on <strong><span>Make the computer easier to see</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Scroll down to <strong><span>Turn off all unnecessary animations (when possible)</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Check that, and <strong><span>Apply</span></strong>.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Note: Just turning off animations or removing Avast! Antivirus is not enough to make a difference. You need to do both.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have the restore point created before you installed Avast! Antivirus, you can restore your system to that point.</p>
<p>We contacted Avast! product support, and have received word that they are working on a fix. They should release a patch soon.</p>

<p><i>I&nbsp;did&nbsp;fix this issue though. &nbsp;I check my graphics chip settings, and at some point, Word, OneNote and Outlook got changed to High Performance while the other programs in the suite were set to something else (I don’t remember what the setting was now,
 but it was clear that the offending programs had matching settings while the behaving programs matched each other).</i></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><i>I changed the graphics settings to match the behaving programs, and now everything works just fine.</i></p>
<p><i>I hope this helps anyone else out there that might be having the same strange problem.</i></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Changed Outlook from ‘High Performance’ to ‘Power Saving’ in the Catalyst Control Center and it worked for me.</p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>Causes</b>: Epson Scanner or ABBYY FineReader (it comes with many Epson Printers) or Hardware Acceleration turned on</p>
<p>Fix: disable Word/Excel addons by starting in Safe Mode</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Fix: remove ABBY</p>
<p>If you want to try to manually look for and maybe delete ABBYY, take a look at this page:
<a href="http://www.abbyy.com/support/engine/9win/FAQ/LD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.abbyy.com/support/engine/9win/FAQ/LD</a>/&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>It shows default locations the program is installed to both on the HD and in the Registry (simply rename the folder so the files are no longer found is the easiest way to test the fix if you do have it installed):</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>The following folders should be accessible from the workstation: </p>
<ul>
<li>folder with ABBYY FineReader Engine binary files - access for reading </li><li>&nbsp;%TEMP% folder - full control </li><li>"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ABBYY" registry - full control </li><li>"HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID" registry - full control </li><li>"HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib" registry - full control for installation and activation only.</li></ul>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<h2>            Why isn&#39;t Outlook for Mac using my Mac&#39;s contacts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi. I just started using Outlook on my Mac¹ and maybe this is a dumb question, but why isn't Outlook using my Mac's contacts for auto-completion when I start a new email?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I start a new email and type the name of someone whose email address is my my Mac's "Contacts.app" I was expecting it to offer to auto-complete it, but it&nbsp;doesn't seem to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook only seems to know about people who have already emailed me, or if I have already emailed them (i.e. the addresses are in my mailboxes,&nbsp;including "Sent").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi TJLuoma,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, the email addresses in the Mac Contacts app are not synced with the Outlook auto-complete list. As a workaround, I suggest you try to export the Mac contacts as a .vcf file then drag and drop it into the Outlook contact
 list. If you have any further concern on this feature, for Outlook mac problems, we have a dedicated support channel. You can click on

<h2>            Lumia 640 XL - Windows Phone Music App library&#47;cache doesn&#39;t update correctly.</h2>
                    <p>On my Lumia 640 XL, the Windows Phone Music App doesn't refresh its library/cache correctly when music is updated on the SD Card.</p>
<p>Due to another bug with the Windows Phone I can't connect the phone to my Windows 10 laptop via USB with the SD Card in the phone as it only connects with the SD Card removed. &nbsp;Therefore I had to remove the SD Card from the phone, put it in an adapter and
 update the music in the Card Slot on my laptop and return it to the phone after update. &nbsp;Now the xBox Music App on the phone shows the library containing music that has been removed and of course gives an error when I try to play them, but strangely shows
 music that I've added to the SD Card.</p>
<p>There doesn't appear to be any way to force the App to refresh its library or cache and I can't even uninstall the App in order to force a refresh should I reinstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get the library to refresh correctly without the stupidity of resetting the phone to factory settings?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>I understand you have an issue with music collection on your Windows Phone device. When you upload new music on your SD card and remove old songs/albums,
 in Xbox Music app on your device you are able to see new music as well old content.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>In this situation I would advice to format SD card within your phone (of course before you do so, please backup your data).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>And before you upload your music, please remove all temp files form phone as in this article:

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried your suggestion of reformatting the SD Card and initially the phone wouldn't do it, so I deleted all partitions from the card using a laptop and created an unformatted partition and got the phone to format that after boot. &nbsp;This solved another problem
 I was having related to USB Connectivity that I've detailed in another of my posted questions. &nbsp;However neither the reformat, nor the suggestions in the link you provided made any difference to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the OP I indicated that a Factory Reset would be a stupid approach because it is the software equivalent of the cliche "turn it off and turn it back on again" that is the fallback position when computer support personnel run out of ideas. &nbsp;It is further
 rendered absurd by the fact that in all likelihood I would have to perform it every time I update the media on the SD card, which is a ridiculous workaround to the issue. &nbsp;In addition, it doesn't determine what caused the issue in the first place and therefore
 gives no indication on how to avoid it happening in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered another Microsoft App on the phone called MixRadio that also displays the Music Library and plays music from it successfully and I suspect may even use the same data.... however the Library display it shows has many duplicated album and song
 entries that are not matched by duplicate files, indicating the data has somehow been corrupted. &nbsp;In researching this issue I noticed that such problems in the Music Library have been around for a long time in various guises (missing files/duplication) on
 the Windows Phone. &nbsp;Could it be that the Music Library issues has not been solved completely but simply each manifestation has been patched with the underlying problem not being addressed (new design/code)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that a more focused approach might be to deinstall the Music App or even delete its data or the library/cache that it is using. &nbsp;Do you know of any way this might be accomplished?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, apologies for the long post... :)</p>

            <p>The music app will not uninstall, it is a system app.</p>
<p>Using a partitioned card was the start of the problems. You see now that removing the partition fixed the phone connection problem. This may have let to music library problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add music while the phone is connected via USB, file explorer.</p>
<p>All your music is probably on the PC so it will not be much of a problem to start over and this is what I suggest.</p>
<p>There is probably incorrect music&nbsp;information on your phone. On your phone there is a music folder on the phone and a music folder on the card. Even though music is stored on the card there is still library files in the phone music folder for artist and
 album, delete those and remove all music from the card. Delete the playlist folder on phone and card. You will probably only have a podcast folder left.</p>
<p>Remove the phone from the PC, turn it off and restart it. Check storage sense to see that the card is seen and it is set to store music to the card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My music on the PC is in artist/album folders. Some I copied over to the phone by artist and included all the album folders, some I just copied the individual album folders. This all works as expected. Most I transferred over using the desktop sync app (not
 for WP10) and used explorer for new albums with some singles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy/paste a few albums over to check all is OK.&nbsp; Do it is steps at first to make sure all is good, about a GB at a time.</p>
<p>It will always take the phone a minute or so to update the library files after a GB transfer.</p>

            <p>Hi garym123,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify my SD Card did not contain multiple partitions. &nbsp;As far as I'm aware, every storage device contains partitions, even those with only one. &nbsp;I simply deleted the existing partition and created an empty one so the phone could then go ahead and
 format it. &nbsp;In any case, this process should not have made any difference to USB connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion that there is probably incorrect music information on the phone is obviously true... the question is, what causes it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To ensure no other complication occurs to the loading of music onto the phone, I did a factory reset and taking your advice used Windows explorer to copy the files across a small amount at a time. &nbsp;This is not practical for my 30GB of music, however, it
 seemed to work fine for the four or so test copies that I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I progressed onto larger data transfers and that is where the problems arose. &nbsp;The final load of the remaining 25Gig or so worked fine and could be seen through the music app after it had been left running for some time, presumably updating its library/cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I updated a number of the music files on the laptop by removing duplicate album art. &nbsp;I then copied these updated files onto the phone and overwrote the existing files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after more than a day with the music app running, updated files are no longer playable and I just get a message that says "Sorry we are not able to play this song at the moment. Please try again later" which of course is repeated when you try again
 later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the whole process again with the Windows Media Player, MediaMonkey and MusicBee applications from the Laptop thinking that the update (sync) process might be better suited than simply copying files, but the same problem occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a last resort I tried your suggestion to delete the 0-byte files from the Phone-&gt;Music-&gt;Album and Phone-&gt;Music-&gt;Artist hidden directories, but these are hidden from phone apps, such as Files, and their content cannot be deleted with the Laptop as explorer
 just gives an error "Error Deleting File".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it appears that the music app built into the phone has a problem when music is updated. &nbsp;It needs to be modified to allow the library to be cleared and reloaded with music information... better yet the problem with the data refresh needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now, who do I talk to at Microsoft to get paid for diagnosing their software bug :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>This started the problem again. Don't put the music on the phone until it is like you want it. Don't overwrite files. Delete them and add the new files. Even that may be a problem if you do it in one setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not saying it wont work but nowhere in phone information does MS talk about syncing music with WMP or any other software. &nbsp;I have never tried WMP or MM even though I use them on the PC. I can't say whether that is the problem or not.&nbsp; Add music or delete
 music. nothing else.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done some more testing and discovered that if I delete the entire collection, the music app will update itself and remove all library entries when I try to play one in the song list from the app. &nbsp; The music library can then be reloaded from scratch
 and when the app is reopened, the library is updated again. &nbsp;Then, if I delete a song or two and wait half an hour or so with the music app running in foreground on the phone, it will update the library to remove the deleted entries. &nbsp;These can then be added
 to the collection again and after another long wait the library will be updated with the added entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the Customer is only supposed to add and delete music on the phone and not synchronise/update it, why does Microsoft suggest this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.windowsphone.com/en-ie/how-to/wp8/basics/sync-my-windows-phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tested the Windows Phone App for Desktop and it too causes library corruption when updating the music collection on the SD Card in the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a library of over 5000 songs, some of which will be updated over time as tag-data changes or I obtain better quality recordings and there is no way to identify each file that has changed in order to delete from, and then re-add them to the library.
 &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Therefore the only way to achieve this is to set the music app with a clean library by deleting all songs and adding them all again. &nbsp;</span>&nbsp; Because of the time involved in loading 5000 songs over a
 USB connection, this is obviously a very impractical workaround for what is a fault with the music app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Synchronizing/updating files as I did using Explorer and the other applications I mentioned is a perfectly reasonable and normal thing to do with a mobile phone of this type. &nbsp;If the music app library becomes corrupted when files in the music collection
 are updated on the SD Card, that is a problem that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can the bug with the music app be registered to be fixed or at least checked that it does not appear in Windows Mobile 10?</p>

It is simply a new feature that allows you to see the password hidden behind the stars.&nbsp; If you mouse over it, it will display the password.&nbsp; It is new in both win 8 and IE10.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t delete PDF files</h2>
                    How do I delete a pdf file from my windows phone?&nbsp; I downloaded pdf reader, but it doesn't allow me to delete the file.&nbsp; Does this mean if I continue to open files I'll eventually run out of space because I can't delete them? Not very cool MSFT (yes, I
 know the likelihood of using up the space is small, but that's not the point).

            As a workaround I uninstall and than reinstall PDF Reader to get rid of the PDF library. Of cause I am not sure that the files are actually deleted but given the sandbox principle and "nothing left behind" promise of WP8 I hope so. At least the list of
 recent files in PDF Reader is empty after reinstall.

<p>That solution would not apply in this case. It is an answer brought on by someone not reading your question properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sending a STOP message to a short code number is an easy way to opt out of receiving messages on mobile phones. Sending one to 75973 is a way to opt out of Skype messages sent to a mobile phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Skype does not support sending SMS texts to short codes, you cannot send such a text message. This is something you proved when trying to compose a new SMS text to 75973. Technically you should not be receiving SMS texts from short codes, only real
 numbers. If for some reason you actually received them and are being spammed by them, you might try to reply with a STOP, to see if replies are possible, as opposed to new texts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi DrSmiggles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing up this concern to our attention. Once you set up your email account in Outlook app for Android, it would automatically detect the username you created for that account. To change this, you'll need to sign in the account online and
 there you can change its username. For example, if you're using Outlook.com account, you need to sign in to
<a href="http://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com</a> and edit your profile name. Once done, you may need to remove the Android device associated with the email account to update the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, having an option to change the username through the Outlook app for Android is also a great idea. In line with this, I suggest that you submit a feedback to our
<em><strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293346-outlook-for-android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook for Android UserVoice</a></strong></em> page. Our developers will collate and review suggestions and incorporate them into product
 planning discussions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your patience and understanding. Should you have questions, please don't hesitate to post back.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your reply but it appears your advice is actually not correct. I checked my account, and my full name is specified on the account. The Outlook app still only shows the outlook.com email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I am suprised the app developers have overlooked something so basic, that just about every other email app out there already allows you to do WITHIN the app.</p>

    <title>Update release win 10 mobile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael nutting  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update release win 10 mobile</h2>
                    <p>I bought the lumia 930 (Nokia) in october this year with windows 8.1 as the installed OS, i&nbsp; quickly changed the OS to the insider program and Win 10 mobile. All have worke very well with very few glitches and freezes, therefore why the wait for 10? now
 that we have the latest build 10586.36. There have been reports of problems with download issues, nevertheless i feel these could have been sorted out after release, as personally i have had no download issues, they all have run like clockwork. The latest
 build does however have an issue in that when you tap an icon on the start screen, the list of applications appears and not going directly to the application tapped on the start screen, after two three attempts we have success, if anyone has this issue then
 it shuld be brought to the attention of microsoft to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general many are waiting for the release to see what is on offer,&nbsp; however by procrastinating more it is felt that it will go against microsoft. This said when all is released it will be wonderful to have all units working in unison. In general&nbsp; it would
 now be a good idea to let the system free to the public and guage the result as It is beleived the result will be an astounding success.</p>

    <title>Visio 2016 Drawing HVAC duct layout on an Imported PDF - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Visio 2016 Drawing HVAC duct layout on an Imported PDF</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just purchased Visio 2016. I would like to import a PDF floor plan into Visio, scale it and draw/overlay a duct layout on it, save and print.</p>
<p>Any tutorials I have looked at are business/office related. I cant find any tutorial outlining what I described above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help or advice how to proceed. Not sure if Visio Pro would enable me to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You!!</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot make the PDF floor plan editable and worked as Shapes in Visio 2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can insert a file in PDF format into Visio as an object, but&nbsp;we can’t edit it after you insert it. You’ll need to have Adobe Acrobat or Abode Reader installed to see or read PDF files. With Word 2013 and 2016, you can convert a PDF into a Word document
 that you can edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Winni Liang</p>
