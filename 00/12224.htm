<h2>            Planner Pictures &#34;Show on Card&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I choose "show on card" for a picture attachment, it doesn't show the picture itself, it shows this. How do I remedy this?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Nokia Lumia 610 locked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nosfer...  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Lumia 610 locked</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
My brother's Lumia 610 touchscreen was partially broken. Because of that he locked his phone by wrongly entering the lock screen code 10 times.<br />
The error message after booting: try again in 18377022 minutes.<br />
<br />
I already replaced the touchscreen, so it's working fine now. I also know the correct lock screen code, but because of the error, I can't make another attempt to enter it. I already tried a soft reset (volume down key + power key), but no solve.<br />
<br />
It's important to him that his data (photo's, contacts and messages) will be recovered.<br />
<br />
What options do I have other than waiting for almost 35 years?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!<br />
<br />
Greets,

            <p>Hello Nosfer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the post to the Windows Phone forum.&nbsp; I just wanted to post one thing regarding the restoration of content from this phone.&nbsp; From your description this looks to be a Windows Phone 7.&nbsp; The Windows Phone 7 did not have a cloud based back up created
 as the Windows Phone 8 does.&nbsp; With that said, a reset of the phone is going to lead to some loss.&nbsp; Text message history, game progress and phone settings are things that are not backed up.&nbsp; Contacts, calendars and media on OneDrive will be accessible again.&nbsp;
 Contacts and calendars would sync directly to the phone.&nbsp; You would need to access OneDrive via the website or app and download pictures, videos and documents manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

    <title>Comma delimited CSV files opening with data in a single column - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darrenfranz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Comma delimited CSV files opening with data in a single column</h2>
                    I have a web application that exports custom datasets to .csv text files which end users open by clicking a link on the website.&nbsp; All of our computers use MS Excel to open .csv files by default, but many users have reported that the file opens with all
 of the data for each record placed into the first column.&nbsp; (Thus not actually parsed.)&nbsp; I, and lots of other end users, open the same .csv files without issue.&nbsp; (The data is parsed into separate columns.)&nbsp; What Excel 2007 or Windows 7 setting do we need to
 change to have the files always open correctly parsed?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
P.S. Yes, we are actually using commas as the delimiter.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Window Regional settings, one can either select&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; &nbsp;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as list separtor, thus bringing Excel to split or not the data in columns depending on what separator it finds in the CSV file.</p>
<p>Thinl about offering a real XL file available for all users, meaning having a script that will convert all CSV into XL books.</p>

<h2>            Lost Product Code and Don&#39;t Remember Email Used</h2>
                    <p>I subscribed to the Microsoft Office 365 Home about a year ago. Just recently I downloaded the new Windows 10 on my Windows 8.1 laptop and my laptop completely quit working so I had to do a factory reset. Now, I'm trying to reinstall my Microsoft Office
 365 Home but I don't have the product key and I don't remember the information I used to sign in to my account. I tried using my email and phone number but it's saying that the account information is wrong. Although I am able to sign into the Microsoft website
 itself. What do I do? I am still being charged a monthly fee to use the Microsoft Office 365 Home and do not want to have to subscribe again. Any help would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you :)</p>

    <title>Two-way calendar sync between outlook.com and Thunderbird - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> insertrandomnamehereplease  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two-way calendar sync between outlook.com and Thunderbird</h2>
                    <p>Hello eveyone, I've been trying to add a <em>two-way</em> sync for my outlook.com (365 subscription) to Thunderbird's now integrated Lightning plugin. For the actual connection I use the following plugin: https://github.com/Ericsson/exchangecalendar/releases</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get this setup to work, there are some posts and tutorials that suggest using various server URLs such as:</p>
<p><em>https://pod51011.outlook.com/ews/exchange.asmx</em></p>
<p><a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx</a></p>
<p>But none of these work, they all return a 500 internal error message, meaning these URLs are probably not used (anymore) for these requests. Other tutorials and messages that describe successful setups
use private domains with their own exchange servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is: What is the URL I can use to sync my calendar with Thunderbird?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

 A Video is shown on this article to guide you through in organizing Outlook.com and its functionalities.</p>

    <title>how to shuffle all albums on zune PC software&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rasslinbear  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to shuffle all albums on zune PC software&#63;</h2>
                    It seemed on older versions of the software, I selected shuffle on and it shuffled everything. Now, I have to select an album before the play button is activated. Then, when I select shuffle, it only shuffles that album. I really liked the option to randomly
 select any song from any album. How can I do this? Thanks.

<p>Even with the older versions, it only shuffled what you have queued up. If you double click on a track in an album view, it'll only queue up that album. If you want to play everything, go to "songs" view and simply play a track.... which will queue everything
 listed, unless you multi-selected specific tracks only.</p>
Alternative, if you use Windows 7... the Zune task icon has a quick "Shuffle all music" shortcut. (Right click on the icon.)<br />

<h2>            OFFICE a &#36;100 rip-off</h2>
                    I just purchased OFFICE upon the recommendation of three retail outlets.&nbsp; I told each that I wanted a word processor and each told me to buy OFFICE.&nbsp; I did and after going on line and installing OFFICE, I find out it is only a lease and I will have to
 pay $100 every year to use it.&nbsp; I really have no use for most of OFFICE, all I need or want is a good word processor.&nbsp; Why isn't the information printed prominently on the package?&nbsp; Why wasn't I informed before install?&nbsp; Do I have any recourse?&nbsp; IS THERE A
 GOOD WORD PROCESSOR PACKAGE I CAN BUY OUTRIGHT AND HAVE FOR A LONG AS I WANT?&nbsp; Recommendation -- please.&nbsp; I'm 73 and I'm not great with computers but I'm not stupid either.&nbsp; I just want a good word processor.&nbsp; My discussions as to my needs were with BEST BUY,&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates are made to enhance the performance of one's computer. It's just odd that one of your application got affected after installing an update. However, we would like to know if you have tried to uninstall the update to see if it'll make a difference.
 We also want to know if it's happening with other applications on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>"...we would like to know if you have tried to uninstall the update to see if it'll make a difference."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, I'm not inclined to uninstall a Windows update unless it totally wrecks my stage. Reinstalling a single/a few apps isn't a back-breaker--just aggravating.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We also want to know if it's happening with other applications on your computer."</p>
<p>ABBYY Finereader 14 installs a "companion app" called ABBYY Screenshot Reader (gratis) which is similarly-affected after the 1709 update. Since the ABBYY apps are "paired" it makes sense that they would behave similarly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I did have issues with Intel's "KabyLake PCI Express Root Port #10 - A2B1" driver. I've been around the block with an Intel tech on this issue and he said he'd "elevate" the issue up the technical chain for resolution at Intel. Right now I'm getting
 the message "Device status: This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31) The specified request is not a valid operation for the target device."&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am trying to create a group for users from all different local health districts.
</p>
<p>Some people do not have access to Yammer at all, so are contacting their IT but others, who do have Yammer and are logged in, cannot see the group i have created and when I search for them by name, they do not come up on my search. Why cant I contact some
 people from other LHDs and add them to my group?? </p>
<p>I have contacted our admin and our IT helpdesk and they were unable to provide me with answers.
</p>
<p>Thanks for any assistance you can provide</p>

<h2>            Thai locale not correctly displayed on old app&#39;s UIs after updating to Threshold 2</h2>

<p>
</p><p>Previously before updating to Threshold 2, this app can run on Windows 10 without a problem. But, it just happened today after updating. The app's UI displayed unreadable characters supposedly to be Thai. I checked the system locale and it is as same as
 previously configured (Thai - Thailand).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your suggestion. I actually turned off and on the computer again and then the app ran just fine without doing anything. Probably, it would just need to reboot after the update for a smoother system.</p>

<h2>            MS Excel 2010 locked for editing by redundant person</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a strange problem in our office while working on an Excel spreadsheet using MS Excel 2010. If the file is opened by someone and when the second person tries opening the same file, it gives a message saying the file locked for editing by X person
 and suggests to open as Read Only / Notify / Cancel. The problem is that the X person is not the one who actually opened the file and infact the X person has already resigned from the company. Let anyone opens the file first and when the second person opens
 the file, it always gives the same name (X person).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: The file is macro enabled (.xlsm).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you resolve this mystery?</p>

            <p>Deepak,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your excel file gets a temporary lock file (also called "Owner File" ~$samplefile.xlsx) when it is opened. That's why you get a notification that the file is locked for editing by 'PersonXYZ', open 'Read-Only' or click Notify.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One another way out is to delete that file. It is a hidden file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the below steps :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Folder Options under Control Panel (from the start menu)</p>
<p>2. Click on the View Tab</p>
<p>3. Click Show hidden files, folders and drivers under Advanced settings</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/790c9aa1-189d-4738-8b73-44d3ae5c7180" /></p>
<p>4. Uncheck Hide protected operating systems files (Recommended) and Click OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should see that file in the same directory the original file is in. Delete it and open the document again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

                    When using the content library in Publisher 2007, there was a toolbar on the left hand side which helped access the content library faster. Once clicked a scroll that was searchable appeared on the left hand side. I was wondering if there was any way to
 do something similar when using Building Blocks?&nbsp;

            <p>The left hand task pane approach of Publisher 2007 is not part of the new ribbon menu introduced as of Publisher 2010. The building blocks galleries of Pub 2010 and 2013 are available in a folder format which you can browse and review via the thumbnail view
 and mouseover for title and description. Just click the arrow below the category to get something similar to the old task pane on the left side in Pub 2007.</p>

            Hello AndrewDevitt,<br />
<br />
The most straight forward way to restrict what is being viewed or printed is to use filters.&nbsp; Project has several built-in filters available on the View tab, but you can also use Autofilters to filter the list of tasks.<br />
<br />
You don't state what data you are looking for but in broad terms:<br />
Copy the existing view and rename it for one of your stakeholders.<br />
Ensure the necessary fields (columns) are visible in the table (left side).<br />
Apply autofilters, use the built-in filters, or create custom filters to show only the tasks of interest to the stakeholder.<br />
Print the view.<br />
<br />
Post back with more details as needed and we'll try to help.<br />
<br />

            Wow! I've just got back from Spain and was wondering the same thing. I was picking up my voicemail and then as soon as I hung up that icon appeared. I've received calls and texts on my phone since then, and as far as I can tell the calls AREN'T being "diverted"
 in any way!<br />
<br />
However, when I go to "call settings" to try and turn on/off diverts, I only have menu options 2, 4 and 6 - nothing to do with diverts and nothing which allows me to get rid of this symbol.<br />
<br />
I'm also with orange!<br />
<br />
Anyone have any information? This is driving me crazy!<br />
<br />
(just a thought - has anyone tried to use "restore factory settings" on this problem? It seems a little drastic, but it may help)

            Unfortunately, you most likely have 2 obstacles that cannot be overcome;<br />
<br />
Office v.X is written in 'Classic' [pre-OS X, pre-Intel] code which will not run on an Intel-based Mac without the Rosetta emulator, &amp;<br />
Apple dropped support for Rosetta with the introduction of OS X 10.7 [Lion]<br />
<br />
Assuming your Air is new, it's most likely running OS X 10.7.x or 10.8.x, so Office v.X cannot be used even if you follow the methods for installing without a CD/DVD drive.<br />
<br />
If the air is running OS X 10.6 or earlier, see Apple's instructions for installing:<br />

            <p>Which file format do the videos use originally? Which file format do they have when downloaded? Which software do you use to convert them? I've seen some free conversion tools use the old WMV7 codec instead of the latest WMV9. PowerPoint cannot handle the
 old version, so make sure that your software uses the right codec. You might need to use another downloader. Or other conversion software (I use AVS video converter, which is not free, but comes at a reasonable price). Many online videos now use MP4 file format,
 which can be inserted into PowerPoint, so you might also want to try that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best,</p>

    <title>6680 - 3G hopeless - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> massetti  say:</h3>
<h2>            6680 - 3G hopeless</h2>
                    I bought 2 x 6680s so I could keep in video contact with my family whilst away on business, the 6680 was a big mistake.<br />
<br />
Acording to an O2 network engineer, he has a friend that owns a 6680 and its problem is that when it switches between 3G and 2.5G (GSM)it often fails to register on the network and acts like it's out of service.<br />
<br />
So, it goes straight to voicemail without ringing and you can't make calls without re-booting. Despite changing them both twice, this has failed to rectify the problem and Nokia'sw advice was to take it back again.<br />
<br />
Clearly Nokia won't admit that the phone is a dog and for me a complete and utter waste of time. I also have a 9300 which is great and has good support from Nokia.<br />
<br />
My advice is give Nokia a wide berth if you want 3G as they will give poor support

            i am confused, you are saying that when you try to make a 3g video call to someone who is not in a 3g area, the call goes straight to voice mail?<br />
<br />
i use a nokia 3g phone myself and have used the 6680 on 3g previoulsy with no problems at all. but then i am on vodafone and i am always in a 3g area

            Noooo............<br />
<br />
I'm on 02, like all networks (???) 3G is not fully covered in every single place, so when I am in a 3G network area and then move to an area where 3G is not available, the 6680 fails to switch (it's called dual mode)from 3G to GSM.<br />
<br />
Basically this means the phone is still in 3G mode but can't make or receive calls in a GSM area. Hence you get no incoming or out going, despite it showing full bars.<br />
<br />
I know it's shocking and Nokia should be ashamed of themselves for launching a phone that was not ready. Either that or 02 is to blame, but they maintain it's the phone.<br />
<br />
Either way, I'm seriously going off Nokia (i have 4 phones) and O2 don't get any lucative video calls, because i have my phone in GSM not dual mode - the only way I can make a call

            this is not the case<br />
<br />
if your phone has to swith to gsm then you will still be able to make calls, just not video calls. have you tried turning off dual mode and manually use gsm only?<br />
<br />
i have used a 6680 in non 3g areas (very rural parts of the uk) where i only got gsm and had no problems at all.<br />
<br />
put *#0000# in on the phone, this will give you the firmware version. do you want to try that and post back what version you have?

            This is a very, very irritating problem, and is not limited to just Nokia phones - it appears to happen on many 3G handsets. I've personally had it happen on a 3G Sanyo, and a friend has on a 3G LG. Exactly the same problem that you're describing here.
 I also had this on my 6680.<br />
<br />
My fix was to turn 3G off - the phone then worked fine. Maybe you could do that and just turn it on when you want to make a video call? Far from ideal i know...<br />
<br />
At least you have the option to turn it off though - on the Sanyo i didn't, so i had turn the phone on and off all day to ensure i could make and receive calls...<br />
<br />

            it is possible a firmware update could solve this issue, i guess that depends on what firmware he has on his phone.<br />
<br />
i am lucky, i live in an area where there is strong 3g reception so i can leave the thing on 3g all the time. when i have travelled and had to switch i have not had such a big issue though.

            Massetti, I have experienced exactly what the same problem as you. I am also on O2-UK and live in an area which does not currently officially have 3G coverage. I think in my office I have some leaked coverage from the nearby A14 or something, but I too
 have found that the 3G gets found, goes upto about half coverage, and then drops right down to nothing, but camps on 3G rahter than switching back to GSM where it would have full coverage. Every so often I get a few beeps saying I've got voicemail or a few
 SMSs come through at once, but generally I have no coverage.<br />
<br />
I asked a couple of people at work (who should know a thing or two about this sort of thing) and they said it was either a problem with my phone or a problem with a 'Sleeping cell'. I tried a H3G (Three) SIM in the phone and it worked fine, so I'm guessing
 O2 have some sleeping cells around me.<br />
<br />
I've asked O2 about the problem I had, and they tried changing my SIM twice, without success. I gave up in the end, since O2 customer service aren't techie enough to help.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows better about this, please let me know, as I'd be very happy to find out :o)

            I'm having the same problem with my N70 but I am on t-mobile. Tried calling CS but they where as useful as a chocolate teapot.<br />
<br />
I have my phone on GSM only now cause I am fed up with missing calls.<br />
<br />
Seen lots of posts regarding this matter so it would be good to get some response from Nokia to say if it's a phone/firmware fault or whether it's the networks. I automatically thought it was a network issue.<br />
<br />
Many thanks.

            I originally thought it might be a phone issue with not handling 3G correctly, but when I have been in well-covered 3G areas it works fine. I have also tried a Three SIM and an O2 engineering mode SIM in the phone, in the same location mine has been in,
 and 3G seems to work fine (I think the engineering mode SIM could connect to sites that aren't yet in service though).<br />
<br />
It's either: a) the network tells the phone to stay on 3G in certain areas, or b) the phone tries it's hardest to stay on 3G where it can see any amount of 3G coverage, and ends up leaving you with no coverage.<br />
<br />
I have put my phone into gsm-only mode, and haven't been bothered to try and contact the customer service departments lately, they just seem to keep wanting to send me a new SIM to see if that fixes things.

            Thanks to all of you who have responded. I checked my firmware version and foubd it to be 3.04, I then contacted Carphone W'house and they said their engineer was on holiday for 2 weeks so could I wait? er......yeah.<br />
<br />
I then found a very helpful independent and they upgraded both phones to 4 plus firmware and now it seems fixed.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_other/how-to-extract-all-unique-text-values-from/ace2a71a-971d-42aa-86f9-114d4e563a6d">
great thread</a> that does almost what I am hoping for, but I am having trouble tweaking it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scenario is:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have four columns (J, O, T, and Y) that I want to extract distinct values from, without regard to case. (So, RED would be the same as Red or red, and the distinct value would just be "red")</li><li>All sheets have the same columns.</li><li>I would like to extract all the distinct values to a combined new sheet.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Could someone please lend some assistance? Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

<h2>            I need help with Backup and Reset, Windows 7.5 phone</h2>
                    <p>I have a SGH-I677 Samsung Focus Flash Windows 7.5 Phone. It seems that Internet&nbsp; Explorer has stopped working. I can get on the internet with other apps but if it has anything to do with IE it will not open. I have tried several things to fix this and it
 still will not open. If you have any suggestions I would appreciate the help. I think I have figured out that maybe I need to do a reset of my device, reload all my data, and start all over. My question has to do with the backup of data. From what I can see
 Zune will backup and restore pictures and video but not anything else ( text messages, contacts, settings, ...). I am mostly concerned with Office Documents. I have read that Word, Excel, People(Contacts), and One Note documents are all stored on One Drive
 and will be restored when I sign on to Windowslive.com after the reset. I can see everything on One Drive except my One Note docs. I need to know for sure if they are stored on One Drive and how to find them? I use One Note allot and It would be allot of trouble
 to manually rewrite all of them. If they are not stored on One Drive than I need to know how to back them up? I have Emailed them to my self but I can't figure out how to get them back on my phone. I can't download them directly to my phone or drag them from
 my PC to Zune to my phone. If there are any work a rounds for this I need to know.</p>
<p>Thanks Very Much.</p>

            <p>I am still having issues seeing my one note folders on OneDrive.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>On my phone I open the office app, flick over to locations, I see a folder titled SkyDrive (subtitled Mike’s OneDrive). If I open it I see a folder labeled Documents. I open it and see a folder labeled Mike’s Notebook. I open it and see a folder
 labeled Quick Notes. I open Quick Notes and see a folder labeled Untitled page and that’s it. If I open it I see a blank page that looks like a OneNote that was opened and saved with nothing on it. I have several notes on my phone but I don’t see them here.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On the phone again, I have the OneDrive app installed. If I open OneDrive/Documents, I can see Excel, Word, and a OneNote folder labeled Mike’s Notebook.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I can’t open any of the office documents at all but there are other documents not related to my phone that I can open.</p>
<p>I have OneDrive installed on my computer. <span>&nbsp;</span>If I open Start\OneDrive\Documents\Mike’s Notebook, the folder opens in a Browser.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I don’t see any of the OneNote folders. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I have about 53 OneNotes on my phone. Is there a way to Email them all to myself and manually load them on OneDrive so they will be there after the reset? Why are they not there to see? Is there anything I am doing wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks Mike </p>

            <p>I think I found something. I am reading something off my phone. Tell me what it means. "OneNote Mobile can keep your notes in sync on SkyDrive. That means you'll be able to use your phone and your computer to open and edit your notebooks that are on http://office.live.com."</p>
<p>Does that mean I have to have an office365 account to sync my OneNotes from my phone to my OneDrive account? If this is true there has to be a way to manually save my Notes and load them onto OneDrive and then to my phone.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello Pumpshot,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thank you very much for you post here and the fast response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Onenote is a program/app you can use on your phone and your PC. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Immediately you create a new note/quicknote on your&nbsp;device it will&nbsp;be synced with the&nbsp;Onedrive (former Skydrive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There you can find the notes in the folder "Documents".</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no need of an Office 365 subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your phone you can use the "sync" command in </p>
<p>
</p><p>Onenoete &gt; options</p>
<p>
</p><p>There you can manually sync your notes too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the notes you create on your phone will be synced immediately to Onedrive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only in the case of a missing Internet connection they will stay on the phone till a connection is available.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>

            <p>I feel like I may have given you bad information because things you say are there I don’t see. I will back up and drag this by a little slower so maybe we can figure this out.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T Samsung Focus Flash SGH-i677, Software: Windows Phone 7.5, OS version 7.10.8773.98</p>
<p>If I open the office app I can flick through three tabs notes, documents, and locations. If I open a OneNote within the notes tab I see Personal Unfiled notes with the title of the note. At the bottom of the open note I see in the lower right corner three
 dots. If I press to raise the options there is pin, email, and delete. There is no option to sync. If I flick over to the Documents tab I see Word and Excel documents. If I open a Word document and the three dots to raise the options I see Outline, Comment,
 Find, Edit, Share…, Save, Saves as…, Open Location. If I select Open Location it takes me to a place on OneDrive where I can see it is saved. If I flick over to the Locations tab and open SkyDrive/Document/Mike’s Notebook/QuickNotes, I see something that reads,
 “ No pages in this section. Tap the New icon to create a new page”.<span>&nbsp; </span>
If I press the three dots to raise the options, I see New, Search, sync, view sync status. If I select sync I see a prompt that reads “We will sync text and pictures in the section. This will use your data plan, and may incur charges”. If I select Close I get
 progress dots that run across the top and a notice that the page is syncing and then nothing.
</p>
<p>I can’t see any of my OneNotes saved on OneDrive, on either my phone, or if I login to my OneDrive with my WindowsLive account on a PC.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I have tried this with or without a wifi internet connection and I get the same results. I do see an option to email all my OneNotes to myself. All this would not be such a problem but I can’t figure out how to manually load all the emailed OneNotes
 to my phone. I have tried to drag and drop one of my OneNotes into my WindowsLive OneNotes account from my PC and I can’t get it to work. I know this is a pain but please go through all this as I feel there is something I am probably not seeing.
</p>
<p>Thanks Pump. <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Pumpshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you're describing I don't really see an issue in your proceedings. The only possibility that comes to mind though is the Microsoft Account used.</p>
<p>I would advise to double check the Microsoft Account (Windows Live ID) that you're using on your phone, by going to Settings &gt; Email + Accounts</p>
<p>and&nbsp;going by your&nbsp;description of the situation, you might find that the phone&nbsp;is using different Microsoft Account &nbsp;than the one you're accessing on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, my recommendation would be to Check the OneNote content&nbsp;saved on your Microsoft Account (Windows Live ID) directly on the OneNote Online, by Signing In to the web site :
<a href="https://www.onenote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.onenote.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned before, for additional help on&nbsp;the subject you&nbsp;could try contacting Office Support :
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Certainly hope this will help,</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>As recommended I checked my Microsoft Account (Windows Live ID) within Settings&gt;Email+Accounts. I am a little confused from what I see. I have three accounts Gmail, Yahoo, and Windows Live that all seem to function. The username for all three accounts are
 correct but the passwords do not look right. I can’t see the password as they are hidden. All I can see is the passwords represented by sixteen dots. All three passwords have the same sixteen dots. I have a different password for each of the accounts and none
 of the account passwords are sixteen characters in length. I can delete and reinstall my Gmail and Yahoo mail account but don’t know how to do that with Windows Live. I’m also afraid to just change the password within windows live settings as I don’t know
 what the original sixteen character password is. If you have any information on how to reset the windows live account maybe I can try that and see if it fixes my problem.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I have contacted Office Support for additional help. I guess I missed that in the first post.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
