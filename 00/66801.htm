    <title>Windows asks for passwords for non-passwords account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> のや  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows asks for passwords for non-passwords account&#63;</h2>
                    Using Windows7 ultimate with all updates, I made 4 users for deferent job for me. Example username A, B, C, D..<br />
Once I made passwords for User-C some month ago. But, I feel nonsence to type passwords each logon because the account is for me and this PC is only for me. Then I deleted the passwords of User-C.<br />
<br />
The problem is occred. In the welcome screen, after click User-C, Windows7 required passwords. But it'v deleted. I hit EnterKey or click allow button, then I can logon Windows. This mean the passwords is nothing.<br />
Else users, User-A,B,D, has no-passwords and Windows7 not require any passwords, I can logon only one click user icon. But only User-C, I can't logon without enter-key or one more click.<br />
<br />
There are no restore point some month ago, and the System Files Checker can't found any problems.<br />
I think that couse any settings in the registry or security policies with set passwords automaticaly, but I can't found so any settings.<br />
My nabers have no idea.<br />
<br />
This seem no problem because I can logon User-C. But this is not logical respons of Windows.<br />
Do you have any idea to fix this respons? <br />

<p>I know&nbsp;this method and it occer new problem.</p>
<p>Example when I want to use Windows as User-A, I have to logoff each &nbsp;power-on,</p>
<p>because Windows logon User-C automaticaly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Various point of this trouble is just reqiring empty passwords.</p>
<p>Why Windows7 require passwords but it's empty?</p>

            <p>The&nbsp;answer&nbsp;has found&nbsp;why Windows7 require&nbsp;empty passwords at logon screen.</p>
<p>I'd found&nbsp;responce from Windows7 berow...</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;I used&nbsp;e-mail address format for user-id, ex)*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>(2) Windows7 not require empty passwords&nbsp;with normal format user-id.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp;I made new user with incomplete e-mail address user-id, ex)abc@def</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but&nbsp;Windows7 require empty passwords.</p>
<p>(4) I made new user&nbsp;with normal format user-id, ex)test&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Windows7 not require empty passwords.</p>
<p>(5) I try to make new user ex)"abc" and rename user-id after log-on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, the name of user profile folder is "abc" still.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Windows7 not require empty passwords this condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is information from microsoft,</p>
<p>"<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935951/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">You may be unable to type Chinese characters for the user name and for the computer name in the OOBE Wizard in certain Chinese-language versions of Windows Vista</font></a>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the reason to required empty passwords is using "@" mark in user-id,</p>
<p>not Chinese-language but English user-id.</p>
<p>But, it is hard to found that information from serching "requiring empty passwords",&nbsp;I think.</p>
<p>And may be hard to realize because Windows accept "@"mark&nbsp;to make&nbsp;user-id.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think you of kind suggestions.</p>
<p>I write this for someone&nbsp;to serch same problem.</p>

            I had the same problem with my Asus EeePC Netbook. The highest resolution was 1024x600. I was able to change it to 1152x864 by changing the registry settings of Display1_DownScalingSupported (two entries) from 0 to 1. Proceed at your own risk.

            Is the Office installed on the computer a Trial or the Full version? Most new computers come with a trial of Office, after X days or X uses it goes to lower functionality mode unless you buy it.
<br />
<br />
Are you using the Windows 7 key thats on your computer? That will not work to activate Office - only an Office key will activate Office.<br />

Yes.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Unless you were using the built-in "Administrator" account for your</div>
<div>
everyday usage, log into the Administrator account, go to Control Panel</div>
<div>
&gt; User Accounts and change the password for your user account. This</div>
<div>
time, write it down someplace.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
To get to the built-in Administrator account:</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
- In XP Home, you must re-start in Safe Mode. Reboot the computer and</div>
<div>
tap the F8 key *before* you see the Windows startup screen. Pick "safe</div>
<div>
mode" from the menu. Click on the icon for the Administrator account.</div>
<div>
The default password is blank, unless you changed it.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
- In XP Pro or Media Center Edition, you can either start in Safe Mode</div>
<div>
as above, or press CTRL-ALT-DEL twice at the Welcome screen to get the</div>
<div>
logon Window. Select Administrator from the drop-down list. Leave the</div>
<div>
password blank.</div>
<div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
If you have been using the Administrator account on a daily basis and</div>
<div>
that's the password that you forgot (or if you set a non-blank password</div>
<div>
for the Administrator account and have forgotten that one as well),</div>
<div>
there are ways to reset the Administrator password, but Microsoft will</div>
<div>
not permit us to discuss them in this forum. Google is your friend.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<br />
<div>
I hope this will help you out!</div>

Most of us have the perception that if we delete any file or directory using ‘Shift + Del’ key from our Windows PC, it gets deleted from the hard drive completely, well that’s not true.</p>
<div style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1); text-align: center">
</div>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1); text-align: justify">
For your information, if you format your hard drive, your data can still be recovered unless your hard drive physically damaged beyond repair. It doesn’t matter whether you are using the old Mechanical disk or Solid State Disk, your data can be recovered even
 if you format your disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1); text-align: justify">
<span style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1)">This may not bother us but this becomes a big concern when we think of selling or donating our old Desktop or Laptop.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1); text-align: justify">
Usually, what&nbsp;most do is delete their data or format it before selling it or donating. But what many of you may not know that the ‘MFT’ table still holds the information about your directories and documents. Therefore, if your old Desktop or Laptop gets in
 the wrong hand, your data can be recovered and can be used for the wrong purpose.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1); text-align: justify">
So, if you want to how to permanently delete files from your Windows PC so that it becomes unrecoverable, then continue reading this post. As by the end of it, you’ll know how to completely delete files from your Windows PC and make it unrecoverable.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(87, 87, 87, 1); text-align: justify">
Now, to begin with, one way we can do it is by randomly deleting files and then overwriting the hard drive with new files, and to ensure that your data is permanently removed, you need to continue doing the same process several times.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t turn off single click in Win7 HP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tommy301  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t turn off single click in Win7 HP</h2>
                    I have notebook Toshiba A650-111 with Windows 7 x64 home premium (intel i3 processor, 4GB, 640GB, ATI 1GB mobile radeon)<br />
<br />
My problem is that I can't turn off single click in windows explorer. When go to Folder option, double click is on and single click option is disabled.<br />
Even do, it working with single click. I try to edit registry, but no success, also third part software for customization do nothing.<br />
<br />
Is there any bug about this, or ????<br />
<br />
It happened after I start easy of access but several time reviewing those option can't find any option that I can turn off to stop (for me) annoying single click.<br />
<br />
Could someone share experience if there is some similar situation.<br />
<br />

            Thank you all for answers, but I find solution<br />
<br />
On internet I found that registry key in HKEY_CURENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\ key ClassicShell value should be changed to 1 but this doesn't help,
<br />
instead, I change key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer ClassicShell to 1 and it work prefect.
<br />
<br />
Now I can change double click or single click in Folder option (that previous was disabled)<br />
<br />
I someone could help, will be nice.<br />
<br />
regards<br />

Usually, it's also required to stop the WMP Network Sharing Service before rebuilding the library. Go to Start, type&nbsp;<strong>services.msc</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. In Services, find the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service</strong>
 . If its status is&nbsp;<strong>Started</strong> , double-click the service and click&nbsp;
<strong>Stop</strong> .

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the format of the audio and video files?<br />
2. Do you have any third party player installed?<br />
3. Do you get any error code along with the message?</div>
<div>4. Do you have the necessary codecs installed to play the files?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please follow the methods mentioned below and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Run the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter to fix the problem. The troubleshooter checks the configuration and network settings for Windows Media Player to make sure that you can play content you've downloaded and saved to your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Clear the WMP database and rebuild the same</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To do this, follow these steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Exit Windows Media Player (WMP).</div>
<div>b. ClickStart, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player, and then clickOK.</div>
<div>c. Select all the files in the folder, right-click and selectDelete to delete all the files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.</div>
<div>d. Restart Windows Media Player.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If this does not resolve the problem, clear the Windows Media Player database cache files. To do this, follow these steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Windows Media Player.</div>
<div>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClickStart, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft, and then clickOK.</div>
<div>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select theMedia Player folder, right-click and select Delete.</div>
<div>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart Windows Media Player.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disable and enable WMP</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To disable and enable WMP using theTurn Windows features on or off, refer the following Microsoft article:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note: Windows Media Player would be listed underMedia Features. Uncheck the same and restart the computer to disable WMP. Rechecking and restarting the computer would enable WMP.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 4:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the above methods do not help, you may perform system restore to a point before the issue started occurring.</div>

    <title>Extraneous MCx1 folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frogsteaks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extraneous MCx1 folders</h2>
                    On my W7 Pro box I have several folders such as these.<br />
<br />
Users/Mcx1-MyComputerName<br />
Users/Mcx1-MyComputerName.MyComputerName<br />
<br />
<br />
As I understand they have to do with Windows Media Center Extensions.&nbsp; I did have to reinstall the XBOX360 extender a couple of times and I am thinking this is where the multiple folders came from.&nbsp; I would rather not have all these extraneous folders clogging
 up my drive but simply deleting them does not work.&nbsp; I get an error message that they are all in use.&nbsp; Can someone please tell me how to clear this up so that I only have the folders actually required to use WMC?<br />
<br />
Thanks...

    <title>Displaying Thumbnails for .jpg files in Windows 10 File Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billb1111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Displaying Thumbnails for .jpg files in Windows 10 File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>For some reason I cannot get File Explorer in Windows 10 to display thumbnails of my .jpg files.&nbsp; That makes scanning through hundreds of photos very tedious.&nbsp; I am using a desktop, a standard display monitor, manual keyboard, and mouse -- no touch screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done everything I have found on-line to no avail.&nbsp; Those efforts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going to Folder Options and ensuring that "Always show icons, never thumbnails" is unchecked...no change was necessary.</li><li>Making sure "Large Icons" are selected in the picture toolbar View tab</li><li>Clearing thumbnail cache as described on-line</li><li>And everything else which I no longer remember.</li></ul>
<p>Some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few of my photos do display as thumbnails, e.g., 1 or 2 in a folder of dozens, but the majority are just the large icon.&nbsp;
</li><li>As one would expect, there are different icons for photos and videos.&nbsp; </li><li>Sometimes, but not always, if I open a photo, it will then display as a thumbnail. &nbsp;
</li><li>In the folders where I have the photos saved, there is frequently a file labeled thumbs.db.</li><li>Occasionally, as I open a folder holding photos, for the "blink of an eye" thumbnails will display before the photos become icons.</li></ul>
<p>Another curious observation is that when I attempt to change (rename) a file from a name with upper case letters to lower case, the change does not display after hitting enter, e.g., IMG_1234.JPG renamed as img_1234.jpg.&nbsp; The displayed file name below the
 icon stays in uppercase, but if I select "rename", it displays in lower case, but hitting enter still displays it in uppercase.&nbsp; This appears to be the case for all files, not just photos.&nbsp; Probably has nothing to do with the issue, but is curious nonetheless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am seeking any new suggestions as I am at my wit's end. </p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA,</p>
<p>Bill</p>

<h2>            Lot of programs stopped working after update</h2>
                    <p>I have installed some programs on different drive not on c: drive and lot of those stopped working after update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for example:</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>The NI Service Locator service failed to start due to the following error: </p>
<p>The system cannot find the file specified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>because it's looks like update changed path in services to C:\Program files(x86)</p>
<p>Also another programs stopped working like MS SQL Express:</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>The MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS service failed to start due to the following error: </p>
<p>The system cannot find the file specified.</p>
<p>and</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>The mitsijm2016 service failed to start due to the following error: </p>
<p>The system cannot find the file specified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really nightmare :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also some&nbsp;shortcuts on&nbsp;desktop&nbsp;was copied like Notepad++2 and Notepad++ shortcut had wrong path to C: drive but it is installed on another drive.</p>
<p>Notepad++2 shortcut was original one with correct path.</p>
<p>

                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">So when I use my computer and I do heavy tasks like video editing, my CPU hits 100% usage and gets respectable temps of around
 60-75C while rendering (this is Balanced Performance Mode, by the way). However, the moment I plug in my laptop, my CPU usage in Task Manager will never exceed 22% (0.60GHz) and my temps drop down to 50-60 (and this is still balanced performance mode, by the
 way). And the moment, I unplug it, my CPU usage hits 100% and my temps rise to 60-75C. Could this have something to be with the battery? By the way, I don't know if this helps, but I found it weird, my laptop has a 97W battery and my laptop charger is only
 rated at 60W. Could that be the problem? (I don't think this is thermal throttling either)</span>

<p>When you are on the charger you are <strong>bypassing</strong> the battery, if the charger is not putting out the correct wattage then the computer will automatically lower the power to the CPU, most likely in the bios of the motherboard.</p>

</p><p>When you are disconnected from the charger you are on pure battery and getting the proper watts for you CPU.</p>

<h2>            Error while attempting to upgrade to Windows 10 from 7</h2>
                    To get straight to it, I downloaded "The Windows 10 Media Creation Tool" from the official Microsoft site, I ran the application, everything turned out well in that part. When the upgrade actually began, after it had downloaded and all, it got to around
 70% in the first of three stages in the upgrade, then came up with an error - 0xC1900101 - 0x2000C. It said that it failed in the SAFE_OS phase during the APPLY_IMAGE operation. After this, it restored my previous version of Windows, (Windows 7 Ultimate 64
 bit,) to what it was before I attempted the upgrade. The only difference was that it now shows that my version of Windows is no longer genuine, and I cannot re-enter the product key as it is, (I wrote it down before attempting the upgrade,) because I am not
 able to use the characters required. I've tried to contact Microsoft personally about the issue, but nothing has seemed to work. Is there any way to get my version of Windows to be recognized as genuine again, and is there a way to

            <p>I got the same error on my computer setup to dual boot between 8.1 and 7. My tablet running 8.1, desktop running 8.1 and desktop running 7 all upgraded with no problem. It made me think it was the dual boot, so I&nbsp; removed 7 from the boot manager (msconfig)
 and it then upgraded fine. I'm guessing it crashed because it didn't know which one to upgrade.

            Looking at those, I see that it can't really fix the problem I got afterwards, because my OS no longer detects that my version of Windows is genuine, and because of this, I can't use Windows Update for Windows 10, or use the tool I used before without
 entering the key, (I have it,) which now no longer works. Also, the error shown for those isn't the same error I seem to be having. I'll probably just go buy a new HDD, (I need a new one anyway,) and copy of Windows 10 to have it, and probably never try an
 upgrade like this again due to this annoying and difficult first experience.&nbsp;

<p><span>So your clan is going to stop playing ANY game system then? There are cheaters no matter where you go. It is all about how you handle them. On XBL you simply FILE A COMPLAINT via the tools on your console.
 Then from there the XBL PET will review the complaint and determine if any enforcement action is needed. Remember, enforcement action is NOT instant. Just like with real life crimes it takes time to investigate complaints.

<p>where you gonna go? XBL is your best bet for getting the least amount of cheaters.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoD has a huge community and because of that you'll run into cheaters more often. i would recommend a different game like battlefield but if CoD is your thing you'll have to deal or play private games.</p>

<p>I still want to know exactly what the definition of "cheating" is. I created another somewhat similar thread and nobody seemed to be able to come to a consensus about it, seeing as how there is no clear-cut definition given by Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I would have thought leaderboard boosting was cheating for sure (and as&nbsp;a result&nbsp;my report rating has gone down so much that individual players can literally text offensive racial slurs at me without being penalized upon my filing a complaint; real good system
 you have there Microsoft), but apparently the powers that be don't think that way.<br />
<br />
What's sad is that <strong>we have to pay for this service</strong> and despite that fact, continuously have to deal with the rampant cheaters/hackers/modders/boosters on a daily basis. The integrity of Xbox Live is entirely lost to me now, it won't surprise
 me when I completely lose interest in online gaming as a result.</p>

<p>I'm specifically talking about leaderboard boosting. Allow people to boost achievements all they want, if they want to gain an achievement undeservedly and then think in the back of their mind that they actually accomplished something, then be my guest.<br />
<br />
But killing an imaginary player which is in effect one's alternate account over and over again&nbsp;to gain leaderboard status, how is that not seen as an unfair advantage? Last time I checked, the majority of Xbox Live users have only one console.<br />
<br />
If tomorrow Microsoft changed their opinions about leaderboard boosting, then even&nbsp;less people would have reason to defend it. As of now, I fail to see any justifiable rationalization for such ill-gotten gains.</p>

<h3> steve a.  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Reserved partition on a different drive</h2>
                    
<p>I have two physical hard drives on this system.&nbsp; Drive 0 (D:\) is used as a Data file drive and Drive 1 (C:\) contains the windows 7 files.&nbsp; Both of these Drives are SATA III.&nbsp;Windows would not install&nbsp;with the drives hooked to the Marvell SATA III ports.&nbsp;
 I switched the cables to the SATA ports (3.0 gb) and installed Win7 Pro 64 bit. (I inadvertantaly crossed the cables between ports 0 and 1)&nbsp; Some how I managed to wind up with the System reserved partition on the D:\ Drive and the Win7 Files on the C:\ Drive.&nbsp;
 is it possible to move the System Reserved partition to the C:\ Drive?&nbsp; Win7 did create a 100mb unformatted partition on the C:\ Drive and assigned it a drive letter, but the System Reserved files are on the D:\ Drive in a 100mb partition.&nbsp; The system will
 not boot unless both cables are plugged into the original ports they were in when windows was installed.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>can I create an image of the C:\ Drive. reformat and clean install windows then reload the image?&nbsp; I don't know if the new drive with the System reserved files on it&nbsp;will work with the old drive image.&nbsp; i would do the same to the data file and remove the
 System Partition so that is is a data file disk only</p>

<p>My system reserved on Disk 0 does not have a drive letter assigned to it shall I assign one?&nbsp; I can see the section in Disk Management but cannot access it.</p>

<p>The reserved partition is not assigned a drive letter, by design</p>
<p>The system reserved 100MB partition is only available for Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Business and Windows 7 Enterprise editions. It is used primarily as BitLocker partition for BitLocker encryption. In addition to this it also holds the Windows Recovery
 Environment (WinRE) and boot files with boot manager. This is used to boot the computer whenever it has boot problems and there is no Windows 7 installation DVD disc with you.</p>

<p>Steve,</p>
<p>I have just finished&nbsp;a computer configured&nbsp;much the same as you describe yours (2 x SATA III 1TB drives) . My disk 0 ended up with the System Reserved and (F:) partitions and the second drive, Disk 1 (C:) ended up with the system(Boot, Page File, Active,
 Crash Dump, Primary Partition),&nbsp; Other than good practice is there a technical reason that the System Reserved and Windows 7 64 files should reside on the same physical drive?&nbsp; I have just installed the systems and Office applications so far and it seems that
 the simplest option for me might be to start from scratch and reinstall everything, and hope that it all ends up on the same drive.&nbsp; I might end up being faster than making a repair disk and going through the process described by Manasa and Chris.</p>
<p>Before finding this thread I started out looking into the pro's and con's of moving the User profiles and the "My Documents/Public Documents/Default Documents" to a non-system partition in order to simplify the inevitable reinstallation of&nbsp;the Windows System
 files once the updates have slowed the machine to a crawl.&nbsp; However I am now having doubts as to whether this is a very useful exercise. I am interested in finding out more&nbsp;about our common problem.&nbsp; What did you end up doing?&nbsp;</p>

            I've installed Win7 several times without ever creating a System Reserved partition. The key I think is to do a Custom install into a pre-existing partition. Since the SR partition is only used by Bitlocker, if you don't use Bitlocker you don't need the
 partition.

            Hi,
<div>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community!</div>
<div>As I understand you are facing issues while printing documents. </div>
<div><br />
To assist you better I would like to ask you few questions:</div>
<div><br />
1. Are you facing the issue only while printing from any particular application/ (Internet Explorer, Word, etc)<br />
2. What is the exact error message received when the issue occurs?<br />
3. Do you see any option "Enable Bidirectional" on the Ports tab of the printer properties?</div>
<div>4. Is the printer directly connnected to the computer?<br />
<div><strong>Note: If </strong>you see any option "Enable Bidirectional" Uncheck the option (Enable Bidirectional) and check if the issue reoccurs.</div>
<div><br />
Now, let's check if the latest printer driver is installed on the computer. <br />
<div>Let's download and install the updated printer drivers from the manufacturer's website and check.<br />

<p>I first checked to see if the latest printer driver was installed by running update. The results included a Brother driver, plus the updates I had rolled back on the previous day.&nbsp; I installed the uupdates but the problem persisted.&nbsp; In addition I now had
 a "troubleshoot" icon on my printer in devices, but troubleshooting did not reveal any problems. (Incidentally, I could not designate the printer as the default; the program was designating one note as my default printer and would not allow me to change it.)
 &nbsp; I restarted the computer but these problems persisted.</p>
<p>As for the question about programs, I had the problem printing in word, adobe, and outlook. I did not try any other programs.&nbsp; I did not get any error message - the computer simply crashed and took me to a screen to start windows in normal mode.&nbsp; BTW, the
 printer is directly connected to the computer with a usb connection.&nbsp; I never saw any option for "birectional printing".</p>
<p>Ultimately, I was able to remove the printer from my devices and printers list.&nbsp; I then disconnected the printer from the computer and restarted it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;plugged the printer usb back in and the problem seems to be resolved.&nbsp; (I had disconnected and restarted
 a couple of time previously.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>I hope the conflict is now resolved.&nbsp; Thanks for the assistance. </p>

<h2>            How come the &#34;Remember my credentials&#34; setting never works after reboot&#63;</h2>
                    How come the "Remember my credentials" setting never works?&nbsp; Here's what I do:<br />
<br />
-Open up My Network Places<br />
-Double click a computer in my network<br />
-It asks for login and password<br />
-I check the box that says "Remember my credentials"<br />
<br />
Reboot machine and it loses credentials.&nbsp; What's wrong with Windows 7?

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try run these commands in safe mode, <em><strong>always make sure to keep a back of the registry editor before making any changes.</strong></em></p>
<p><span>To go to Safe mode follow the steps below:<br />
a.&nbsp;Click on Windows key, and in the Power Options click on Restart while pressing the shift key.<br />
b.&nbsp;A blue screen will appear with a few options.<br />
Click on Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart.<br />
c.&nbsp;Your system will automatically restart, press 4 or F4 key to go to the Safe Mode.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>I would also suggest you run the System File checker and see if it helps:</p>
