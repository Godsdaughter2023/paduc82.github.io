<h2>            How do I inset a drawing into a manuscript in Word&#63;</h2>
                    I've written a book and don't know how to edit in the illustrations for every other page. Does anyone know how to make Word do this? I've tried copy and paste, and page numbering. I can't seem to break the pages apart so they are individual leafs with
 no luck. The publisher wants notes at least , where the illustrations are to go. Can any of you tell me how to do this?

            Word is not a page layout application. There are no 'pages' in a Word document, just text and other objects flowed into the available space, so what you ask is not possible - at least not in the way you envisage. If you insert graphics, recent versions
 of Word will, by default, insert those graphics in line with the text. They behave just like large font characters and will push the text out of the way to accommodate them.<br />
<br />
If you insert graphics in any other mode than 'in-line' they are inserted into a separate graphics 'layer' only loosely connected to the text. The text can be forced to wrap around the images, or flow over or under them.<br />
<br />
You can divide documents at any point by using section breaks which can be used to force new pages if you wish. A document containing multiple sections can be likened to a sheaf of documents based on the same format.<br />

If you are at the end of your writing and editing cycle you can force page breaks by inserting section breaks, before and or after the spot you want to force the picture to.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
You can use styles to more gracefully, less manual effort, force page breaks. For example, you could create heading style 8 or 9 (anyone, your choice) that you apply to a figure lable or the the picture itself and the style has the&nbsp; Format &gt; Paragraph &gt; Line
 &amp; Page breaks tab &gt; Page Break Before attribute turned on.&nbsp; This will cause that style to start on a new page.<br />

<span>What Version of Office am I running?</span>

</span></p>
<p>Most people are using 1 of 3 Office versions: 2003, 2007 or 2010.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is a major split between in the user interface between 2003 which is the “old” Menu system and 2007 which uses the “new and improved” Ribbon.
</p>
<p>I will provide simple guidelines on how to quickly identify which version of Office you are running.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<span>How can I Identify Office / Word 2003</span>
<p>In the title bar you will see the Word Icon, then the file name followed by “ – Micorosoft Word”, starting at the
<b>left side </b>of the application window. Immediately below it you will see text labels for the menu:
<u>F</u>ile, <u>E</u>dit, <u>V</u>iew, <u>I</u>nsert, F<u>o</u>rmat, <u>T</u>ools, T<u>a</u>ble, Window, Help</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<span>How can I Identify Office / Word 2007</span>
<p>The Word (application) Icon has ben replaced in the Upper left corner of the application window by a big round 4 color “Office” button (it is clickable!) that spans 2 rows. Beside that are some icons for the “Quick Access Tab (QAT)” (note:
 optionally it can be relocated below ribbon). Beside the QAT in a light background is the Application title. The File name followed by “ – Microsoft Word” is
<b>centered</b> in the Application title bar. Immediately below that is the “Tab” bar. Each tab is a graphical redesign of the old menus. The “active” tab has a light background, the rest of the inactive tabs are in a darker contrasting background
 color.</p>
<p>The Tab names are <b>Office Button</b>, Home, Insert, Page Layout, References, Mailings, Review, View</p>
<p>Immediately below the tab names is the new “Ribbon”. It is subdivided into “Groups”. Within the group, small and large icons and text lables.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The icon organization is dynamic. As you resize the width of the application window, the icon layout is adapted. Icon sizes and locations will change.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<span>How can I Identify Office / Word 2010</span>
<p>The Word (application) icon has returned, to the left corner of the application window, eliminating the “Office” button. The rest of the application title bar is the same as 2007: QAT beside Application icon followed by the Filename and
 application name centered. Unlike 2007, there is very little contrast in the background color of the inactive tabs compared to the title bar. The active tab is still highlighted by the light backgound color.</p>
<p>The Tab names are: <b>FILE</b>, Home, Insert, Page Layout, Refernces, Mailings, Review, View</p>
<p>The ribbon is essentially the same as in 2007. The main difference is that the contrast between buttons a the background that was apparent in 2007 has been muted so that the buttons completely merge into the background.</p>

                    <p>Why has Skype taken away all my contacts, also I cannot sign into Skype which I have had for many years with my own email address/Skype name &nbsp;and password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so frustrated that you make all these changes without advising us before this done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also the same problem with my new laptop, I have friends on there who are ill and have undergone major surgery and this is my only way of keeping them near.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not like the new Skype, so hard to get new contacts added... I am really upset and cannot understand why you have made such major &nbsp;changes that are causing so much trouble.</p>

            1. Microsoft has been moving all users to Microsoft account based Skype services.
<br />
<br />You should use Skype Diagnostics to check on your accounts.

<br />
<br />2. If you don't like Windows 10 default Skype client, you can download and install Classic Skype.

    <title>Update Internet Explorer from IE 8 to IE 11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marl boro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update Internet Explorer from IE 8 to IE 11</h2>
                    Due to a 'bug' I had to re-install Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; I downloaded the SP1 so I would be able to receive updates. But, I cannot access any IE updates on that computer now. I had figured I might have to step-up thru maybe IE 9 to 10 then 11 but I
 cannot even do that.&nbsp; When I try to update IE on the MS website it says 'Your browser is out of date' it does not work nor does the install manually feature. So is there a specific KB update number that will help me with this or can I copy IE 11 or 10 onto
 a USB from a working computer and then install it on mine. This is beyond annoying so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank-you!

I would also like Bing is checked by default. Be sure to uncheck it if you don't want it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
Download IE11 to your Desktop. Restart your computer. With no other programs running, disable your anti-virus program and any spyware or spam programs you may have. If you are running a third party firewall, disable it and enable the Windows firewall.</p>
<p><br />
Now install IE11 from the Desktop. When you're done, restart your computer twice and then make sure your disabled programs are running again.

            Hello Bruce &amp; thank-you for writing.&nbsp;This IE 8 problem is tough. When I&nbsp; have tried the en-us sites it will either say 'error on page' or like with the URL you listed it says there is a connection problem but then I can just click over to Bing so there
 is no connection problem. I went to that URL on this computer and was going to try to download IE 11 to a USB but when I clicked on it (64 bit) a yellow warning came up saying it might harm this computer. Can I click on IE 11 properties on this computer and
 then COPY IE 11 to a USB and then install it on my computer? I appreciate your patience.

 I cannot Thank-you enough. PS I thought the REPLY button was a direct response to you and not to my own Question, so thanks for hanging with me and helping me get thru this. I was having some issues. So if this sticks and works I'm good, again thanks Bruce.&nbsp;</p>

            Oh, and one last question and then I'll quit bug'n you today. Do you think Microsoft Security Essentials is a worthwhile program for screening content providers, spyware and malware. I had installed it after I already had a 'bug' so I don't know if it
 was slowing things down or if that was the 'rootkits' I was trying to get rid of.

<h2>            Replying as &#34;alias&#34; from mobile phone using ActiveSync</h2>
                    Using ActiveSync on my phone, I can receive emails that come to my alias (@outlook.com) perfectly fine. But when I reply to them, it is sent from my primary account (@hotmail.com).<br />
<br />
How can I <b>reply</b> to emails that I receive to my alias account <b>from</b> my alias account?<br />
<br />
It kind of makes aliases worthless if they don't work properly on mobile devices.<br />

            Thanks, I've sent it as a feature request but I honestly think this is a no-brainer. Expect to get a lot more complaints about this as more people get offered to create aliases and then realize they can't use them properly on their phones.

    <title>File system interoperability in multiple boot environments. CHKSDSK - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> memorized  say:</h3>
<h2>            File system interoperability in multiple boot environments. CHKSDSK &#47; AUTOCHK and unexpected NTFS dirty bit</h2>
                    <p>For the moment this is just a warning and I waited to try Windows 10 build 9926 to see whether the symptom would disappear and as have seen others posting comparable concerns on the web, I thought of sharing this preoccupation.
</p>
<p>I have been dual-booting Windows 7 and Windows 10 with two separate SSD and whenever I switched back to Windows 7&nbsp;from&nbsp;previous Windows 10 builds like 9860, and then going back to Windows 10,&nbsp;autochk started&nbsp;correcting&nbsp;various entries, such as the bootex.log
 in index $I30 of&nbsp;file 5 (root dir), or deleting numerous extended attribute sets based on simultaneous existence of reparse point, numerous deletions of index entries from index $SDH of file 9 ($Secure). Then&nbsp;after another "excursion" to Windows 7, I had more
 corrupt attributes upon starting Windows 10, losing a profile, <em>yet I always activate the Administrator account</em>
<em>right upon installing Windows</em>, so I could still use Windows 10.</p>
<p>The SSD are relatively new and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I only encountered the issue when switching between OS</span>, never during successive boots of same OS.</p>
<p>Note that the SSD where I have Windows 10 is MBR-partitioned and the one with Windows 7 is GPT-partitioned.<br />
</p>
<p>Also I have been accessing files residing on the disk with Windows 7 while in Windows 10, incurring ACLs updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In preparation for the (clean) installation of Windows 10 build 9926, I turned off disk&nbsp;checking in Windows 7 for both C: &amp; D:&nbsp; manually checking dirty bit status of both drives upon booting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shut down Windows 10 last night and then this morning started Windows 7,&nbsp;seeing autochk 2 seconds default countdown for the booted Windows&nbsp;7 (C: drive). I interrupted this right&nbsp;away and queried the dirty bits and both drives were dirty, even though chkdsk
 (read-only) run from Windows 7&nbsp;only shows the Windows 10 drive having EA reparse issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not come across a situation where my Windows 7 drive would have a dirty bit since I started previewing Windows 10 last October 1st, but the main reason I post this is so that previewers in multiple boot environments are aware that there might be a
 concern for data integrity. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone is looking at Windows 10 build 9926 NTFS recoverability, hoping also it's backward compatible (at least with Windows 7 NTFS version).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I'll take a look at the physical sectors at stake (boot record, BPB,&nbsp;bootstrap code, MFT, dirty bit position and NTFS 55 timings) to see whether the might be architectural differences. Whereas I did not have much concerns with Windows 10 overall
 so far, <em>except maybe the 9926 calc.exe that's single instance and no longer offers date calculations, stats,&nbsp;or RoR in programmer functions, but at least I can use calc.exe of previous builds or Windows 7,
</em>this could be a scary issue. </p>
<p>This is only an FYI so that multiboot testers can take the necessary precautions.
<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you see a dirty bit when booting Windows 10 or Windows 7, perform a read-only chkdsk on the system drive (no parameter) to see whether the dirty bit is legitimate or not. AFAIK, the "read-only" chkdsk will clear the dirty bit.
</p>
<p>If you see a dirty bit on the other OS drive, boot from the other OS and perform a read-only chkdsk ; that will give you a better appreciation.
</p>
<p>

            <p>I have noticed this as well. Also, due to the way Windows 10 likes to update preview builds, I would not recommend dual booting Windows 7 at this time. I just had it thrash \Users and \Windows in my Windows 7 install on a separate drive. I would have 7 &amp;
 10 installed to separate drives, and have the alternate drive disconnected or disabled when running the other OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, reparse records are not an indication of a problem with an NTFS filesystem, they are specific type of MFT entry and they are normal</p>

<p>&nbsp;At least I was not dreaming !&nbsp; I did not see reparse issues until Windows 10, so I am now wondering whether Windows 7 might have disrupted the $MFT on the Windows 10 volume.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just in case for the ones who multiboot with Windows 10&nbsp;for whatever reason, just a list of useful commands, most of which have to be issued from Administrative command prompt :<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Disable autochk/chkdsk on c: and d: drive upon boot if dirty bit is found : </p>
<p><strong>chkntfs /x&nbsp; c: d:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>(beware that the command will override the previous one, so for instance if you issue chkntfs /x&nbsp; d: and then chkntfs /x&nbsp; c:&nbsp; it will check d: next time around)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Increase countdown time 30 seconds&nbsp;to waive autochk/chkdsk upon boot if dirty bit is found :
</p>
<p><strong>chkntfs /T:30&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Find the current status of autochk/chkdsk :</p>
<p><strong>reg query "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager" /v BootExecute</strong></p>
<p>/k =exclude, /P =unconditional volume, /p =unconditional volume mount point, /m =chkdsk if dirty bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Find the current status of dirty bit on drive c:</p>
<p><strong>fsutil dirty query c:<br />
<br />
</strong>Run chkdsk in read-only mode to see if the dirty bit is false in relation to the current OS :
<strong><br />
chkdsk c:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Check NTFS version and $MFT positioning data on drive c :</p>
<p><strong>fsutil fsinfo ntfsinfo c:</strong></p>
<p>Note that Windows 7, 8.x &amp; 10 all are NTFS version 3.1 and LFS version 2.0 </p>
<p>so this aspect <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/15645.windows-8-volume-compatibility-considerations-with-prior-versions-of-windows.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="NTFS version taxonomy">
Windows 8 NTFS compatibility with prior versions</a>&nbsp;might not be at stake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping no one will experience unexpected data loss issues from this point. </p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI I did an experiment (definitely don't play with this as your volume is unlikely to be bootable), after ensuring that there was no dirty bit and chkdsk reported no issues for both drives from Windows 7 and Windows 10 :
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I booted Windows 10</p>
<p>2) I created a file on the Windows 7 drive</p>
<p>3) I queried the Windows 7 drive and it showed no dirty bit</p>
<p>4) I validated the above by running a "read-only" chkdsk and that's the result :
</p>
The type of the file system is NTFS.<br />
The volume is in use by another process. Chkdsk<br />
might report errors when no corruption is present.<br />
Volume label is Kingston.</p>
Running CHKDSK in read-only mode.</p>
Deleted corrupt attribute list entry<br />
with type code 128 in file 58942.<br />
Attribute record (128, $J) from file record segment 88359<br />
is corrupt.<br />
&nbsp; 203776 file records processed.<br />
File verification completed.<br />
File record segment 88359 is an orphan.<br />
&nbsp; 819 large file records processed.</p>
Volume - d: is NOT Dirty</p>
<p>5) I tried to boot Windows 7 and it does not go beyond the login step. No built-in repair option has gotten around the issue. (FYI I cloned the GPT volume beforehand, well aware of the UEFI BCD store aspects with clones and I have all my data in other locations).&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c0a7e34-73d4-4935-8a44-6e779103747e" /></p>
<p>Then I USB-mounted the SSD on a Windows 7 computer and chkdsk finds no problems.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>So it's now a matter of rebuilding the dual boot ecosystem, including BCD store reconstruction, UEFI tweaks etc....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I NTFS-formatted a USB flash drive from Windows 10, copied a few files, then mounted it on a Windows 7 machine, copied files and chkdsk was fine. I then did the reverse and was fine, so I wonder whether the issues have to do with boot-related structures.
 I had no issues with exFAT on the thumb drive as well. (I did not test REfs as I skipped Windows 8.1)</p>

            <p>As long as you don't access another partition (or volume) from Windows 10, you are fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The danger is when you try to access data between OS partitions with somewhat incompatible formats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I have time, I'll try to experiment with exFAT and FAT32 just to see if the issue is restricted to NTFS.</p>
<p>Maybe the writing is on the wall about making the leap of faith to Windows 10 while keeping data on the cloud, but where I saw some drawbacks with 9926 in relation to previous builds, such as &nbsp;file system transaction log when installing VC++ 2005 redist,
 the single instance calculator that no longer has dates calculations, statistics or RoR programmer function and the included WHQL Intel Iris Graphics driver not doing better than 8bpc
<em>(where Windows supports deep color natively since Vista !)</em>, I did not feel like making the complete switch yet.</p>
<p>I resolved the VC++2005 issue and used the multiple instance calculator from prior build, and the main reason I go to Windows 10 is because transitioning from 4k to 8k display.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The fact that you read files on the other partition requires to change ACLs (if you do a cacls of a file you read and the one you did not, you'll see the different auhorities), so essentially you wrote on the 8.1 partition, but only ACLs, so this is not
 too critical IMHO. If you boot Windows 8.1, check if you have a dirty bit, and if you see one, then just do a chkdsk c: with no parameter to see if the bit is true. It seems to me that if chkdsk finds it's not true, it resets it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know ; it's possible that NTFS 8.1 NTFS might be more compatible.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Running W10 and W7 on separate physical hard drives. &nbsp;I was passing MS Outlook PST files between the two previously. &nbsp;First time on 9926 from W10 to W7 the file was corrupt under W7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Paragon HDM15S, tried to pull the PST files from an VHD made in 9879 prior to the update. &nbsp;I was getting file architechture mismatch. &nbsp;Tried to a USB flash drive and got some sort of attribute error. &nbsp;I was reading this thread and formatted the flash
 drive to NTFS and that worked. &nbsp;Before that coping the files from W10 to the flash drive with FAT32 worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometime during the event I tried to restore from the 9879 VHD to the W7 which caused a boot into a blue screen showing it wasn't a registered W7 copy! &nbsp;Booted from a &nbsp;WinRE disk and found a two day old restore point, back in business.</p>
<p>

    <title>Getting emails notifiying me I have purchased a subscription when I - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Getting emails notifiying me I have purchased a subscription when I did not</h2>
                    <p>Just yesterday I have received an email telling me that I have "a problem with my payment" when I did not even subscribe for anything. I checked my personal Skype account online and it was perfectly fine, (no billing information, no current subscriptions)
 so I left it alone. <br />
HOWEVER again, today I received an email telling me my Skype Credit has been reactived and along with that, I have received another email saying I am being billed for a monthly RECURRING subscription (Product name: Serbia 60 mins mobiles and landlines)&nbsp; that
 I DID NOT EVEN SUBSCRIBE FOR and can only be cancelled manually. As a matter of fact, I DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYONE LIVING IN SERBIA! I did not apply for anything and I did not share any credit card information on my Skype account. The email itself does not look
 like spam. I hover the links and it looks pretty legit.&nbsp; I logged into my Skype account online once more to double check anything fishy going on, and the main page of my Skype account seems perfectly fine. What is going on here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this because I DID NOT SUBSCRIBE FOR ANYTHING! </p>

<h3> kha422  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need Formula Edit</h2>
                    <p>Excel 2003 ... I do not know Code ... I record Macros only (then sometimes I&nbsp;do some creative cut/paste) ... Issue is ... I recorded placing a Formula in WS1 Cell O2 (doing this from memory, but think I have it) ... Anyway, the following formula (as recorded
 code) worked fine until I inserted a new Col K in WS2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = _<br />
<br />
"=IF(ISNA(INDEX(WS2!R1C15:R2000C15,MATCH(RC[-10],WS2!R1C12:R2000C12,0))),"""",INDEX(WS2!R1C15:R2000C15,MA<br />
TCH(RC[-10],WS2!R1C12:R2000C12,0)))"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now whenever I run the Macro containing the above&nbsp;a Window opens up when I hit this instruction.&nbsp; I tried changing all the 15's to 16 &amp; the 12's to 13, but no luck.&nbsp; I do not know how to properly edit the R1C1 Format in the Macro???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you do this ... or ... should I just re-record this portion? ... Thanks ... Kha</p>

            <p>Try changing -10 to -11.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>R1C15 means cell O1. When you inserted it will become P1 so you should use R1C16.</p>
<p>Similarly R1C12 was L which has become P so C12 should move to C13. You got this part right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now Match RC[-10] would have takend you to Col E on the sheet containing the formula. Is that what you want? If not then you will have to adjust -10 accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are right though, it might be a good idea to record the macro again and then compare what has changed so that you understand it better.</p>

                    upon closing , not responding will appear and they'll ask you to close the program or wait for the program to respond. This also happens when I try to print a document. I've tried some of the solutions but I ended up deleting all my previous documents.

<p>Hi md.administrator,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, when we tested at our end by Activating the Mobile Device Management service and enrolling the user mobile devices, users device name shows up in the Device Management (<a href="https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/MifoDevices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home#/MifoDevices</a>).
 So, when we tried the steps you provided Manage&gt; Remove Device, none of the devices are listed even via search. But, we can able to remove the device from Device Management via following the below steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Device Management&gt; Select the device&gt; Click on Remove company data&gt; Confirm (it says “ Successfully scheduled company data removal for devices, You might still see the devices listed until the action completes”).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: It takes some time for device to be removed from the list. We tested at our end and the device successfully removed from the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please give a try and let us know the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chitrahaas</p>

<h2>            Outlook.live.com</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Outlook.live.om for several months.&nbsp; I access it from my Windows 10 desktop and laptop; and Android phone and notebook.&nbsp; Last week, while travelling, I would compose emails and hit send on my laptop and they would evaporate.&nbsp; No record
 in my sent file and recipients received nothing.&nbsp; Emails sent from any from any of my other devices go properly.&nbsp; At the same time most incoming emails are not appearing on my laptop, but appear on all other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue appeared before the most recent Windows 10 updates were installed yesterday.&nbsp; I have not installed any new programs or apps.&nbsp; Is anyone else having this issue or can help me resolve it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the Outlook.com app when accessed thru the laptop Chrome browser stopped updating last March.&nbsp; I switch to MS Edge as my sole access mode for Outlook.com then.&nbsp; Now Outlook.com does not work with either browser.&nbsp; I do not have any MS Outlook programs
 installed on the laptop.&nbsp; Emails are being forwarded to Outlook.com from the AT&amp;T system (the Yahoo replacement).</p>

<p>Hi Jimmy,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If your subscription is Business Premium, yes, Office 365 portal would only support to download Office 2016. Here is the link:
Office 2016 Problems and Solutions and Frequently Asked Questions</p>
<p>If you have installed Office 2016, to roll back to Office 2013, you can install the Office via the links below:</p>
<p>For&nbsp;<strong>Office 365 Business&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Office 365 Business Premium</strong>:<br />
32-bit, English:<br />
<a href="https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/download.aspx?productReleaseID=O365BusinessRetail&amp;platform=X86&amp;language=en-us&amp;version=O15GA&amp;source=O15OLSO365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/download.aspx?productReleaseID=O365BusinessRetail&amp;platform=X86&amp;language=en-us&amp;version=O15GA&amp;source=O15OLSO365</a></p>

<p><strong>**Important</strong>: After you have rolled back to Office 2013, make sure you read this article to prevent Office 365 ProPlus/Office 365 Business from automatically updating to Office 2016 directly from the internet. "Method 2" in the article may
 applies to you.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3097292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3097292</a></p>
<p>If you haven't installed Office 2016, to prevent it automatically updates to the Office 2016, refer to the KB above to modify the registry.</p>

1.the screenshot about "office tells it is not activated."<br />
2.after you enter the credentials into office, if it can't be activated, do you get some error messages? if so, please also capture a screenshot.<br />

<h3> tomm_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sent email appears completely blank. And can&#39;t recover.</h2>
                    <p>I spent over 3 hours writing a very important email. When finished I hit send. &nbsp;Then in my outbox the email appears blank. In my recipient&nbsp;inbox it's also blank.</p>
<p>While writing this email I kept saving the draft in case of power cuts or accidental closing browser. &nbsp;but now the draft is also gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent this from my outlook.com in chrome, To my other address in the windows mail app on windows 8.1</p>
<p>I've never had this happen before. and have since tested sending many emails and they all work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the only thing I can think of is either being on sky internet my provider changes every few hours for the fastest host</p>
<p>and sometimes it goes down for a few seconds. Or it didn't like something I paste into the email being sent.</p>
<p>Although I'm sure it was only a few texts from notepad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just noticed something new that I've never seen on any other emails before. '&nbsp;You moved this message to its current location. '</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what this means. Have looked pretty hard on google. &nbsp;Tried contacting microsoft and outlook but didn't get the right support. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This email was very important and don't think I can recreate it again.&nbsp;Can someone help me with this please. Will owe you one :)</p>

    <title>Turning off the radio&#47;cell feature on a Smartphone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zoomiest  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turning off the radio&#47;cell feature on a Smartphone</h2>
                    I used to have a blackberry, and it had a large icon, right on the desktop to allow you to turn off the "radio" function, so you could use your device while on an airplane, or in a hospital - where they ask you to "turn off your cell."<br />
<br />
Now I have an HTC 6120 Windows Mobile 5 Smartphone - (camera, video, mp3 player, etc)... and my wife in in the hospital having a baby... how can I turn off the radio/cell feature so I don't disturb the monitoring systems for all the babies!!!<br />

            On your home screen, you should see the name of your phone operator displayed and next to it the date and time. Click on it to access Communication Manager. Select Phone and click. A small X should appear on the phone icon, meaning it is disabled. Congratulations

            As Phillip suggested, it is generally not possible for an update to remove Microsoft Office from your Mac. Perhaps just the icons are missing from your dock. Please follow Phillip's advice and see if the Applications are still in the Applications folder.
 Let us know what you find.

    <title>How to remove&#47;delete my contact list in Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tedvancouver  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove&#47;delete my contact list in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    I've just installed Outlook 2010 Professional on my new Windows 7 computer.&nbsp; I exported my contacts list into a Comma Separated Values (Windows) file and imported that file into my new Outlook 2010 contacts.&nbsp; The install took ages and when I checked my
 old Outlook 2003 I realized that the contacts list had over 236,000 items in it.&nbsp; No wonder it took so long to import.<br />
<br />
Now contacts 2010 has this huge contact list full of triplicates and empty contacts and more sluggish than anything on my old machine.<br />
<br />
How do I fix this problem?&nbsp; I've attempted to delete the list by highlighting one contact and then alt 'a' but that takes more than 20 minutes and when all contacts finally appear to be selected hitting 'delete' does nothing.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 and Outlook 2010 are presenting a big learning curve for someone moving up from XP and Outlook 2003.<br />

            <p>Is the number you entered (236,000) a correct number or is that a typo? It is difficult to imagine/comprehend/believe that you&nbsp;were not aware&nbsp;that 236,000 contacts existed in your O'2003 config. Ignoring all else. having worked with untold numbers of Outlook
 environments, not once have I ever seen/been told of a single individual&nbsp;having 236,000 contacts in their contact folder and if someone did - certainly would seem reasonable that they would be&nbsp;aware of the fact - something just doesn't seem to make sense.</p>
<p>That aside, will ignore the "usual" about never importing data for the purposes of moving from one configuration to another just for the moment.</p>
<p>#1 - If O'2003 wasn't exhibiting performance issues with whatever size your contact folder was, not likely that O'2010 would either unless there were some other issues at play.</p>
<p>#2 - I hate using the word "never" but this is one case where it clearly would seem to apply - the chances of highlighting 236K contacts for the purposes of deleting them all at once are slim to none - or actually - would never happen regardless of the Outlook
 version in use - Outlook would choke. Would have to delete in macu smaller groups - wouldn't be practical with the number of contacts in question.</p>
<p>#3 - If your contacts are stored in a PST file, the following thread contains links to instructions of how to move to a new Outlook installation
</p>
<u>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/my-email-addresses-are-missing-from-my-address/16f23371-7d70-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/my-email-addresses-are-missing-from-my-address/16f23371-7d70-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5</a>
</p>
</u>
<p>#4 - Your O'2010 contacts would (should) not contain any more "triplicates" and "empty" contacts then existed in O'2003. If you do not have an identical number of contact
 items in O'2010 then you have(had) in O'2003 - there was/is a problem with your exported data that you imported. Just because export/import is not the suggested approach for the intended purpose - the fundamental import/export process works unless there are
 fundamental underlying issues.</p>

<p>There is no pull-down arrow on the Browse buttons under File&gt;Options&gt;Save, and if you click on them, you should see a Modify Location dialog</p>

</p><p>Considering that Office 2010 has been around for a good number of years now, is this a new problem?&nbsp; If so, what changes were made to the computer after you were last able to save a document?</p>

<p>My mistake. In Excel &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Save, there are no boxes/buttons to browse to set the default save locations. There are boxes marked "Browse" in Word, next to the boxes with the current Autosave and Save locations, but they do not produce the expected
 dialog to modify the locations. Also, I see plain boxes, not a nice graphic button, if that matters. You are correct that there no pull-down arrows; sorry about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, this seems to be a new problem, which I only realized yesterday. My system has been very stable -- I have installed no new programs or encountered malware problems in recent days. I opine that something has become corrupted, that the problem is not
 due to an inherent Office bug. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that Cntrl-S works fine to save when I am editing a previously existing file. However, neither Cntrl-S nor Save produces a dialog to name a new document. I am immediately returned to the document. Likewise, Save As produces no dialog to give me
 an opportunity to rename or change the location of the document I am editing, and immediately returns me to the document.</p>

<p>Goods News! I think have discovered the problem today. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually use my own theme on my desktop, which gives me a black background with white letters in apps. (I don't care for all the blinding white backgrounds). In this state my Office 2010 apps have a more primitive look, especially the various screens under
 the File menu. (Where Doug Robbins said that he saw buttons, but I see something that looks like a box with text inside). When switch my Windows theme back to the stock Windows 10 theme, I see prettier displays, but I can also see (and use) the previously
 missing dialog screens for changing file names, locations, etc. when I select Save As.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I think the conflict is identified, and Office file handling dialogs work just fine if I use the official Windows 10 theme, and likely any of the other Microsoft provided themes. I only have the problems when use my theme, which is almost always. I knew
 it could block graphics and pictures on websites, but I didn't know it could also interfere with functionality.</p>

<p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your point about "invisible buttons." I visit a website where, using my dark theme, I can see everything except the "buy now" buttons. I know where they are, and I can click on them and complete a purchase.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deduce from your snagit example that we are using different versions of Word. Your example has several lines of options that do not appear on the save options screen of my 2010 Word. When I click a boxy browse button, the box border highlights, but no
 browse window opens. Nothing happens other than that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to the "save as" problem, I compared the difference in operation between using my custom dark theme and the Microsoft Windows 10 theme. The Windows 10 theme operates as expected. Clicking on "Save As" closes the File Menu Window and opens the
 Location Modification Window on top of the Windows Document. When my dark theme is operative, the File Menu closes and I am left looking at the document since the Location Modification does not appear. I can go through this cycle over and over but basically
 nothing happens. Apparently, my problem is really not with Save As, it is that the Filename/Modification Window cannot open (with my Dark Theme operative) under the File Menu. The Open option under the File Menu misbehaves the same way--it returns me to the
 document. However, when I click on File, I can see the lists of recent files and recent locations. If I click on a recent file, it opens normally. If I click on a recent location, I am returned to the document. The common thing with Open, Save As, Browse,
 and selecting a new location is they have to open that filename/location modification window, and that apparently is blocked or ignored when I use my custom dark theme in Windows 10 and Office 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider my problem solved since I can simply switch between themes on the fly. I will be happy to hang around though, if you want more info. I have switched themes several time composing this response: The submit button disappears when I switch to my
 dark theme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>You are right that my screenshots were from the current version of Word, not 2010.&nbsp; However, in both versions, the Browse buttons perform the same function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had not realised however that the Black theme that you mentioned was not the Color Theme (or in Word 2010, it is termed Color Scheme) selected in an Office application via File&gt;Options&gt;General.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word 2010, selecting the Black Color Scheme, via File&gt;Options, does not affect the dialogs in any way.<br />

<p>The "custom black" theme I was referring to is my slight modification of one of the themes available when one right-clicks on the Desktop and selects "personalize". The "normal" Microsoft themes provided are Windows, Windows 10, and Flower. All of these
 work fine with my Office apps (I tested them in Word). </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also 4 high contrast themes provided: #1,&nbsp; #2, black, and white. NONE of the provided high contrast themes are working properly with Office 2010 (on my computer) -- they have the same problem as my custom black theme. I just tried them all. My
 "custom black theme" is just the provided high contrast black theme with a mid-gray desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started using the high contrast theme when I had cataracts and screenfulls of bright white were uncomfortable to view.</p>
