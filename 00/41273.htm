<h2>            PC RAN INTO A PROBLEM AND NEED TO RESTART. ERROR&#58; NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM</h2>
                    <p>On upgrading to window 10, I have problem as PC doesn`t work any more.</p>
<p>When switching PC on, I first get HP logo then it goes to give the following messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor Type: Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU G620 @ 2.60GHz</p>
<p>Processor speed: 2600MHz</p>
<p>L1/L2/L3 Cache Size: 64KBx2 / 256KBx2 / 3072KB</p>
<p>Memory Size: 4096MB DDR3 / 1066 MHZ / Single Channel</p>
<p>Channel A: XMM1 0 MB</p>
<p>Channel B: XMM3 4096 MB</p>
<p>BIOS Revision/Date: v7.11 08/23/2011</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1720-SMART Hard Drive detects imminent failure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; Failing Drive: SATAO</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; Failing Attribute: # 05.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>F1 : Boot</p>
<p>
</p><p>When pressing F1, it says<strong> your PC ran into a problem and need to restart. we`ll restart for you. error: NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM.
</strong>Then goes back to the previous message with F1:Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When pressing F1 again, it says <strong>diagnosing PC</strong> then goes straight to Automatic Repair, which says
<strong>Your PC did not start correctly</strong> and suggest to restart PC again or press Advanced options.</p>
<p>When pressing <strong>restart,</strong> it goes back to the first message with F1, and same procedure again.</p>
<p>When using <strong>Advanced options</strong>, Troubleshoot, it gives two options:
<strong>Reset PC </strong>and <strong>Advanced options.</strong></p>
<p>When opting <strong>Reset PC</strong>, it says <strong>the drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>So, how do I have to unlock the drive?</p>
<p>When opting<strong> Advanced options, Go back to the previous build, </strong>
it says<strong> we ran into a problem and won't be able to take you back to the previous build.</strong></p>
<p>When opting<strong> System Restore,</strong> it&nbsp;says<strong> no restore points have been created on your computer system drive.</strong></p>
<p>When using<strong> Startup Repair, </strong>it says<strong> Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Log file: D:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt</strong></p>
<p>When using<strong> Startup Settings, </strong>it goes back to the first message with F1:boot option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am stuck and I need assistance with how to unlock drive and more importantly how to disable the F1:boot and to sort out the NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Musenge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try startup repair using Windows 10.</p>
<ol>
<li>On a working PC, go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=615943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft software download website</a> and create <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> installation media.</li><li>Insert the installation media you created, and then restart your PC.</li><li>On the Install Windows screen, select <span>Repair your computer</span>. (If you’re not seeing this screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to boot from media, and then try again.)
</li><li><span>On the <span>
Choose an option</span> screen, select <span>Troubleshoot</span>. Select <span>Advanced Options</span> &gt;</span><span>Startup Repair.</span>&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to run check disk provided by Isha Soni to fix the issue, by downloading Windows 10 to a USB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Kalpana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, thank you for taking your time to assist me.</p>
<p>As instructed, I have tried to install Windows 10 media in my USB on a working PC , but it was not successful as the process of downloading to create installation to another PC ended up with a message "Windows 10 didn't find any USB in the computer.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I tried to copy the file "MediaCreationTool" &nbsp;to the USB and inserted it to my PC and restart, but there was nothing on the screen, except the existing message of PC ran into a problem.</p>
<p>So, that's where I am stuck at the moment.</p>

            <p>Hi Kalpana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been on more than five different working PCs, trying to create Windows 10 installation media from Microsoft software download website, but I am unable to do it.</p>
<p>This is what happens in the Windows 10 setup dialogue box:</p>
<p>I clicked on dowload tool tab;</p>
<p>I saved MediaCreationTool.exe, and run it;</p>
<p>I selected create installation media for another PC;</p>
<p>I selected language, edition, and architecture;</p>
<p>In which media to use, I selected USB flash drive;</p>
<p>I connected my USB flash drive, and clicked on next;</p>
<p>It says <strong>Refresh drive list,</strong> <strong>We can't find a USB flash drive.</strong></p>
<p>On five different PCs, that's what happens.</p>
<p>So, I can't create installation media as I always end up &nbsp;to the above message.</p>
<p>I wonder how people can manage to create it by downloading the tool from Microsoft website.</p>
<p>Maybe something is missing on my way of dowloading. Please, could you tell me wha is wrong.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just to let you know that my computer is working now thanks to a computer technician.</p>
<p>I brought my PC to a computer repair shop and they told me that the problem was the hard drive.
</p>
<p>So, they replaced the hard drive and copied all my files to a new hard drive and installed Windows 10. It works fine.</p>

<h2>            Black&#47;Blank Screen Upon Boot &#40;No cursor&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, recently my Dell XPS L501x laptop has been acting strange. When I power it on, the screen is blank with nothing visible at all (not even the cursor). I can't see the windows logo, and I can't access the BIOS or anything &nbsp;else (since screen is blank).
 I can hear the sound it makes when you reach the log in screen and log in, but again the screen is blank.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, to fix this I can press the F2 key (change projector mode) a couple times and the screen shows up, but if I close the lid or alt-tab out of a full screen game it reverts back to the blank screen and I have to repeat the process. I've tried everything
 I could find on the Internet but nothing has worked so far. Recently I was fooling around with the resolution settings and now I can't get the screen to show up at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions are welcome. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience due to black screen and I will be happy to answer your query.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you saying that this happens only after you try to play the game in full screen?</li><li>Are you able to boot the computer in safe mode?</li></ul>
<p>This could be due to the video adapter's incompatibility. Let's try the following steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Start the computer in safe mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you are able to boot the computer in safe mode, uninstall the video adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>Start</strong> and type <strong>Device Manager </strong>in search box and click it</p>
<p>Expand <strong>Graphics adapters</strong></p>
<p>Right click the currently installed video adapter and click <strong>Uninstall</strong></p>
<p><strong>Restart</strong> the computer in Normal mode</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you are able to boot in normal mode, visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest graphics adapter for the same computer model as you have.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

</p><p>I can't boot into safe mode because as I mentioned, the screen is completely blank once I press the power on button all the way until I hear the log in screen sound in the background and change screen mode by pressing the F2 key (change projector mode).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, if I put the computer to sleep or close the lid, the screen switches to a different projector mode setting and I have to press F2 once again to change it back. As well as when I alt-tab out of a full screen game.</p>

HI. It seems that your main screen was changed to another screen. Try this: Connect Monitor to your laptop. From the screen resolution settings change the monitor to your laptop screen and click to your laptop screen and check the -Make this my main display.
 , Unplug the second monitor and check it.

<h2>            Problems with Factory Reset on a Packard Bell</h2>
                    <p>Hi cox.haley1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a Microsoft update on Tuesday 13 May my Grand Daughter's Packard Bell Easynote TK85-GN-051UK laptop had a huge problem with start-up that could only be sorted with a Factory Reset. Finally I got everything working and re-installed all her software
 programmes. Several days later, after more Microsoft updates, a different problem arose which could only be fixed again with a Factory Reset, so I got things to start repairing but it got stuck in Software Installation...Installing Office 2010...33/45</p>
<p>18hrs. later it was still stuck there.</p>
<p>I sent off to Packard Bell for Re-installation Operating System Windows 7 DVD &amp; Utilities Drivers &amp; Applications DVD...£37 incl. postage.</p>
<p>They haven't worked as once again stuck in the same place.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Packard Bell</strong> is a Dutch computer <strong>manufacturer</strong> and a subsidiary of
<strong>Acer</strong></span> so I don't think wasting money on Recovery discs will help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest anything to help please?</p>

</p><p>But, I would like to know some information in order to help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Do you get any error message when you try to install office program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Is the issue specific to office product installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) What is the complete error message that you get, while installing a program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meanwhile, please follow the suggestions mentioned below to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and see if that helps&nbsp;because, p</span>utting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the
 article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot. <span>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>It's been a year since I purchased my UX303UB with 12GB RAM and NVIDIA 940M w/ Intel i7.</p>

<h2>            Windows Script Host access is disabled</h2>
                    <p>When the computer starts its displaying as given in the below picture</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89bc2d9d-3ceb-4a01-8386-88658f32d1b0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89bc2d9d-3ceb-4a01-8386-88658f32d1b0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried many methods like the below to solve the problem but none had helped me</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">
Navigate to the following key:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows Script Host\Settings</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f01%2fenable-disable-Windows-Script-Host.jpg" height="351" width="600" /><br />
In the right panel, you will see&nbsp;<strong>Enabled</strong>. If you see the entry&nbsp;<strong>0</strong>, it means that the Windows Script Host access is disabled on your Windows machine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Double Click on it and give it Value Data&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;to enable it.</p>
<ul>
<li>A value of&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>&nbsp;will enable Windows Script Host</li><li>A value of&nbsp;<strong>0</strong>&nbsp;will disable Windows Script Host.</li></ul>
<p style="text-align: justify">
Click on OK and exit the Registry. If you don’t see this entry, then you may need to create it, as it does not exist by default in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Due to this I had not seen any problem with any software but expect sharing my system internet. When I try to share my system's internet using wifi device its not working, is the above problem is the reason for this problem too?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then please anyone help me to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance...</p>

            <p>Which script is being run at startup is the real thing to be looked into. You may want to run a full scan using Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and Junkware removal tool to eliminate unwanted scripts and malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check what's being run at startup, open Task Manager and go to Startup tab.</p>
<p>Right-click the column header, and enable Command-line</p>
<p>This shows which script is being executed (by WScript.exe or CScript.exe)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the script is legitimate, then no problem. In that case, next thing is to remove the WScript restriction via the registry.</p>

<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

<p>I personally prefer Plasma TVs. The LED TVs I have played on have always seemed to have a bit of a slower refresh rate causing the games I was playing to blur a bit when I was moving but looking really good when I was just standing still. There might be
 a setting to change the refresh rate on this TV I'm not really sure and I didn't get too much time to play around with the settings on the TV. Anyways, like I said at the beginning, I personally would go with plasma over LED.</p>

                    <p>For the time being, I'm having to do 1 month recurring payments for Xbox live. Was last charged on November 2nd 2016. My bank account was charged and I received an email from Microsoft confirming my live had been renewed. Yet yesterday, November 16th, I receive an email saying they could not charge my card. Funds are low this week due to an unforseen car repair.</p><p>Do they check early for funds?&nbsp;</p><p>I play a lot of Ark: Survival Evolved, and am now too worried my service will be cut to dedicate myself to any builds or tames.&nbsp;</p><p>Just looking for some reassurance that my live will remain active at least until I get paid next week.</p>

            <p>Hey Fifth Gamertag! You will be billed on the day you created the billing account (in this case it sounds like the 16th) but you will not lose the live status until 45 days after that date. So when you get paid you should be able to pay for the next month and not see a lapse in your Live. If you have any issues when the time comes, give <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>support</u></a> a call and they can give you a hand.

    <title>Power Brick Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agent smith1825  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Brick Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so twice now my Xbox One has automatically shut off, and when I checked to see the heat situation, the console itself was fine. However, when I checked the power brick, it was almost scalding hot. I tried turning the Xbox One again, and almost immediately
 turned it off when I could smell what could only be described as a burning smell coming from the power brick.</p>
<p>Is anyone else having this or a similar issue?</p>
<p>I should let you know that I'm using a 100-240v power brick and the country I'm in is Kuwait (220v standard), however the Xbox One itself is a North American version (long story short I fried my original power brick by not checking the input of the brick).</p>

<p>Hey man. Are you using a Microsoft Xbox power brick or one of the ones you can buy on eBay or amazon? How long did you use this power brick before that happened? Can you send me the link to the you have? How long did you play when this happened?

<p>Yeh, it was one from eBay. I don't have the link anymore, sorry :/ I just went on eBay and searched for "Xbox One 220v Power Brick" when I looked though. Honestly I haven't had any more issues, I think it was because I didn't have it in energy saver mode,
 and so it was basically on non-stop for about 24 hours. I also left it on while it installed some games. But I played through the second half of CoD: Ghosts and a little ways into Ryse, so I'd say it was about 12 hours of actual play time, plus the 12 hours
 it had been on in "standby" mode or whatever. </p>

<p>Hi Agent. I'd seriously suggest getting an official PSU from Microsoft. These third party PSU's that are being sold on eBay are cheap, dangerous and could damage your Xbox One.</p>

<p>Same problem on my 360. A power surge wiped out the original brick, bought what I thought was a Microsoft brand replacement. It wasn't and now it overheats after 30ish minutes. Takes a couple of hours to cool down. Doesn't kill the power though. Says "reconnect
 controller" and the center green light on the console goes out. (Not batteries)</p>

<p>There are some proper Microsoft power bricks on eBay, but the prices are quite high as there's not currently any other way to buy one.</p>
<p>I agree with 989 though - the third party ones are to be avoided, as they're usually low quality and probably haven't gone through a lot of testing. Also, I believe that using one would void your console's warranty due to it being an unauthorised accessory.
 MS will not take responsibility if a dodgy third party PSU fries your machine.</p>

<h2>            IMPORTANT - Project Spark Website Problems - Locked out from user name change</h2>
                    
<p>I am currently completely locked out of the Project Spark forums because of a bug that has to do with my username. &nbsp;What I sign in on project sparks website, it takes me to microsofts sign in page, I sign into this current "Krausladen" account. &nbsp;but once
 I am returned to project sparks forums, I have my last username filled in for me. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The main problem with this is, I CANNOT POST any of my questions or insights in probably the most important forums page on all of xbox for me because its literally integral to the games that we are creating.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I can't report this to project spark directly because that requires me to be signed in so I can post on the forums. &nbsp; That is why it is important for a Microsoft employee to send this bug report over to whoever can fix this problem at Team Dakota or xbox
 website managers. &nbsp;I suspect the bug is a Team Dakota bug since they probably manage the website for the game themselves.</p>

            Hi BarbJay
<br />
<br />Well the Philips CDRW/DVD SCB5265 should came with driver disc then you can try to install it. It is the recommended from device developers. 
<br />
<br />Remember you should try to cleanner the lens if you can see everything good from you computer if the device recognize it correctly.
<br />
<br />Also you can try with new cd or dvd because some scratch can diffcult the read.
<br />
<br />You can view your device from &gt;my this pc &gt;  then click rigth manage and then &gt;device manager<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/441d96cb-9465-4d57-a6db-e903d5471734?upload=true" />

<p>When I try to upgrade I get this error message:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Enterprise N cannot be upgraded to Windows 8 Enterprise. You can choose to install a new copy of Windows 8 Enterprise instead, but this is different from an upgrade, and does not keep your files, settings, and programs.
 You’ll need to reinstall any programs using the original installation discs or files. To save your files before installing Windows, back them up to an external location such as a CD, DVD, or external hard drive. To install a new copy of Windows 8 Enterprise,
 click the Back button in the upper left-hand corner, and select “Custom (advanced)”.

                    <p>New computer with 8.1 installed as purchased. Everything works great but I would like to be able to pin modern apps to my taskbar and I can't.</p>
<p>Looking for settings to let me enable this feature I found an online page that suggested that I needed to check the box beside the "Show Windows Store Apps on Taskbar" on the "Taskbar and Navigation Properties" menu but my computer does not show that line.
 What can I do to get it?</p>

<h2>            Computer freezes on Windows 8 shutdown or restart</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new Asus N56 and installed on it fresh Windows 8 Enterprise. There were Windows 8 drivers on the manufacturer's page, also new version of bios. I'm not sure if this happened after I flashed the new BIOS or just is something that happens on
 regular basis with my installation of Windows.</p>
<p>When I shut down&nbsp;or restart the computer it shows me the message (e.g. Restarting), after this the displays turns off and I can still hear the fan working, and it stays in that condition forever. Also the keyboard is lid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I&nbsp;hold the turn off key It will shut down.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            Hi AlexanderTraikov,<br />
Thank you for contacting Microsoft Answers.<br />
As i understand your Computer freezes on Windows 8 shutdown or restart and you get error message restarting.<br />
===============<br />
You said when you restart the Computer on windows 8 pc you get an error Restarting , its not an error its an graphical intereface in Windows 8 which informs you that your computer is restarting when you click on restart
<br />
When you press on turn off key It will shut down , even it is one of the feature Turn off key is meant to shutdown the computer .<br />
---------------- <br />
Apart from this you said your computer freezes on restart and shutdown .<br />
To fix this issue you can follow this steps :<br />
Method 1: Perform clean boot and check.<br />
You may perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue.<br />
Step 1:<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.<br />
Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a) Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b) Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
c) Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
d) Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4
<br />
.Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.<br />
Step 7:<br />
Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.<br />
Method 2: Windows hangs or freezes please do refer this website <br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681286<br />
Note: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you
 note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature<br />

            My english is rusty and maybe I was not clear enough. I did not mean that Restart is an error message. Also the message disappears and the display is turned off like it have just been restared, but the boot screen never shows and the laptops stays in this
 latent state for hours.<br />
<br />
I did the steps you propose, but nothing is changed. Also when I opened msconfig, the Save Boot option was already chosen.<br />
<br />

            I've also got the same problem. &nbsp;I have a Asus N56VZ with Windows 8 and initially reboots and shutdowns were working properly. &nbsp;Then after installing either a new driver/bios/or windows update, now the laptop now fails to completely shutdown or restart
 (screen goes blank, but power button light stays on). &nbsp;However, if I start Windows in safe mode, then reboots and shutdowns work perfectly. &nbsp;I've tried turning off all startup items, third party services, and windows services (in non-safe mode) in order to
 isolate the problem, but none of them are causing it. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>My guess right now is that a driver is causing the issue, but I don't know which one, and I don't know how to isolate it. &nbsp;Anything I can try?</div>
<div><br />
<div>BTW, my BIOS and all drivers are up to date. &nbsp;Windows Updates are up to date as well.</div>

            <p>Hi, the problem with me was that I updated my BIOS and the new firmware had a problem with the second hdd I've put instead of the optical drive bay. The caddy I used had an additional connection which blocks the bios from shutting down. In the new version
 there is a special switch that stops this connection. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mine didn't have&nbsp;one (connection off switch)&nbsp;and I had to block the connection with duct tape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short this was not a windows problem.&nbsp;Here is explanation and fix for my issue:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. There seems to be a lot of users, who had the same caddy issues.</p>

            I can confirm that my shutdown problems was due to the caddy issue (I replaced the optical drive with another HDD). &nbsp;Before discovering that the problem was due to the caddy, I tried removing my second HDD (thinking maybe it's something to do with it),
 and I ended up putting an empty caddy back into the drive bay. &nbsp;Little did I know that an empty caddy would continue to cause this problem. &nbsp;Finally, I ended up removing the pin on the caddy as per the forum post linked above, and my computer was able to reboot/shutdown
 again. &nbsp; &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I did experience another issue after fixing the caddy problem: it would take a long time to sleep/reboot/shutdown. &nbsp;It turned out to be a problem with the wifi driver. &nbsp;If you are experiencing this, then simply installing the latest version of the wifi
 driver isn't enough. &nbsp;I had to completely uninstall the old wifi driver, then re-install it. &nbsp;Now my N56VZ sleep and reboots very quickly.&nbsp;</div>

If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.<br />
Step 7:<br />
Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.<br />
Method 2: Windows hangs or freezes please do refer this website <br />

<p>This guy is right! It should be an automatic removal on all of these hacked accounts!!! WHAT IS GOING ON HERE MICROSOFT?!?! I was hacked and made the demand that they remove the 35 fifa points from my account as well as return the stolen 4000 points I had
 as well as refund the 120.00 the thieves used to buy MSP and fifa packs. I was told that since I made that request in the original UA that it would be done. Did you do that?
</p>
<p>AND SHUT FIFA DOWN!!! ANY REASONABLE COMPANY WOULD HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS!!!</p>

<p>I don't understand, why should they shut Fifa down? &nbsp;Accounts are being stolen and sold, it just so happens that the favorite game of people who buy XBL accounts happens to be Fifa, so that's what they spent their (unbeknownst to them) fraudulent points
 on. &nbsp;So somehow that warrants shutting down the online portion of one of the best selling and widely played sports franchises?</p>

<p>ok we have, theft, hacking, credit card fraud, on a large scale and that's just the tip of the iceberg. most other company's would be crusifide over this !. thay can scream it not there fault all thay want. But Xbox live has done nothing to try and stop
 this. they are allowing there system to be used to commit creditcard fraud on a global scale, and are in essence allowing it to continue. all thay have to do is disable the trading feature on fifa until the security is improved. thay dont have to do anything
 to the multyplayer. </p>

<p>Folks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not disagree with you.&nbsp; Those unlocked achievements and constant reminder you were hacked at one point in the past are an annoyance and a mere inconvenience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, the pride you have in your account/gamertag and the achievements YOU have successfully unlocked over the months and/or years of using the service is admirable.&nbsp; I admire the principles involved here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However you need to come to grips with the fact that AT THIS TIME, Microsoft either doesn't have the ability or the time (or that they care to put in the time) to remove that blight from your record.&nbsp; Perhaps at a future time when this FIFA hack winds down
 (whenever that may be) they may assign someone to develop a tool to remove these achievements... perhaps.&nbsp; As far as it stands now, it's the least of THEIR concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a wise man once said, "Learn to separate the inconveniences from the real problems. You will live longer."</p>

<p>it not just a minor inconvenience. i have been unable to play online for over 25 days each time my account was hacked, the second time still ongoing !. and every time i think about it it sticks in my gut, (people think i joke when i say i want it on my tombstone),
 &nbsp;until know i have had a very high regard for xbox live but the whole fifa (or as it should be called "ThieFA") has really degraded my opinion of the service, and as paying customer i find it shocking a problem of this scale has been allowed to continue for
 so long </p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All 32-bit client versions of Windows (not just Vista/XP/7) have a 4GB</div>
<div>address space (64-bit versions can use much more). That's the</div>
<div>theoretical upper limit beyond which you can not go. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But you can't use the entire 4GB of address space. Even though you</div>
<div>have a 4GB address space, you can only use *around* 3.1GB of RAM.</div>
<div>That's because some of that space is used by hardware and is not</div>
<div>available to the operating system and applications. The amount you can</div>
<div>use varies, depending on what hardware you have installed, but can</div>
<div>range from as little as 2GB to as much as 3.5GB. It's usually around</div>
<div>3.1GB. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note that the hardware is using the address *space*, not the actual</div>
<div>RAM itself. If you have a greater amount of RAM, the rest of the RAM</div>
<div>goes unused because there is no address space to map it to. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Should you get 64-bit Windows? It's hard to answer, because there are</div>
<div>a lot of factors (see below). But do you need more than the 3.5GB of</div>
<div>RAM you are able to use? It depends on what apps you run, but for most</div>
<div>people the answer is no.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here's my standard post on 64-bit Windows:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The advantage of running a 64-bit version of Windows mostly exists</div>
<div>only if you also run 64-bit applications under it. Bear in mind that</div>
<div>there are very few such applications available yet. If you are</div>
<div>presently running 32-bit Windows, you don't have any 64-bit</div>
<div>applications, so to achieve any significant advantage, you not only</div>
<div>have to replace Windows, but also your applications, *if* (and that's</div>
<div>a big "if") 64-bit versions exist. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also note that you will need 64-bit drivers for all your hardware. </div>
<div>Those drivers may not all be available, especially if some of your </div>
<div>hardware is a few years old. So it's possible that you might also have</div>
<div>to replace things like your printer, scanner, etc. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So the answer to your question is that it may not be a great idea</div>
<div>right now. That will undoubtedly change in the near future, as 64-bit</div>
<div>applications become more available, but for now, 64-bit Windows often</div>
<div>means some extra trouble and expense for little or no benefit. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On the other hand, installing 64-bit Windows instead of 32-bit Windows</div>
<div>makes you able to buy 64-bit software as it becomes available, instead</div>
<div>of the older 32-bit versions. That means that installing 64-bit</div>
<div>Windows--even though it may do very little for you at present--puts</div>
<div>you into a better position for the future.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One additional point: the 64-bit version lets you use more than the</div>
<div>approximately 3.1GB of RAM that the 32-bit version can use. Very few</div>
<div>people need or can make effective use of more than 3.1GB, but if you</div>
<div>are one of those who can, that's something else to consider.</div>
