<p>
</p><p>Good morning folks everywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my issue: there is excessive unused user interface space. Precious wasted pixels around the Formula Bar, the Letters Row and the Numbers Column. The whole interface looks bloated&nbsp;even after spraying&nbsp;AlkaSeltzer on the videocard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bloating is mode-agnostic: printing mode, normal mode, custom mode, print-selection modes... Everything looks bloated beyond relief.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, Hivemind, how may I expel the bloat from my Excel?</p>

</p><p>I found that the page setting mode could be made better by double-clicking between the page and the rulers. But the Formula Bar still looks bad, even with font size 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The down arrow, red "false" button, green "checkmark" button and "insert function"&nbsp;look huge, as the down sign at the end of the formula bar (compare it with the upward button to collapse the Ribbon).</p>

<p>(in retrospect, the vertical spacing (which I still think is a little too much) on the Wikimedia capture is the same)</p>

    <title>Importing actual work data, and setting assignment notes using VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pug mcthug  say:</h3>
<h2>            Importing actual work data, and setting assignment notes  using VBA</h2>
                    Hi folks,
<div>I'm working on a solution for a problem that I imagine many of us have - actual work data, i.e. time sheets, are not maintained in Project and have to be imported. What a royal pain. Our company has a legacy application used for recording time sheet, and
 this dinosaur will not be leaving any time soon. I have at times manually inputted data into my Project in the past, but I'm almost finished with some VBA code that I hope will be able to to do this for me in the future.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Each timesheet recordset that I import luckily already has a WBS code defined, so I use that to find the associated task in my Project, access the assignment associated with that particular task and resource, and then define the Actual Work using the timeScaleData
 method.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Along with the basic data just described, I want to add the unique identifier coming from our dinosaur timesheet application to the Assignment.Notes; the operation itself is successful, but I can't find any view that will allow me to access this field.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />

            Pug,
<div>Well, your code runs fine for me using Project 2010 with SP1.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I set up a simple file with 3 tasks and two resources per task. Rather than using a filter on the WBS field, I simply selected a single task in the Gantt Chart view. I used today's date for MyDate and 60 for the Minutes variable, the former declared as
 Date type and the second as Single type. I ran your code and then looked at the Resource Usage view which included the Notes field as a column in the view (since the note text is short this is more convenient than having to go to Assignment/Information to
 see the notes text). The test string appeared in the Notes field of both assignments for the task I had selected in the Gantt Chart view.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the above simple example doesn't work for you, then you could try an even simpler test. Create a simple file similar to the above. In the VB Editor window display the Immediate Window. Execute the following line of code in the Immediate Window:</div>
<div>activeproject.Tasks(1).Assignments(1).Notes="hello"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then check the Notes field for the first assignment on the first task. Is the text there?</div>
<div><br />
<div>John</div>

    <title>Multiple IF statements with INCLUDETEXT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sdword  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple IF statements with INCLUDETEXT</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to have a&nbsp;mail merge document look at two IF statements and pull in one of any separate&nbsp;documents based on the results. For example:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>IF a student is in&nbsp;Business AND the term is SPRING, use DOCUMENT A. IF the program is Business AND the term is FALL, use DOCUMENT B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions? Single If statements with INCLUDETEXT are easy once you figure them out, but this new issue has proven to be much more complicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Nokia N96 recent WI-FI problems</h2>
                    I have a Nokia N96 on network&nbsp;3&nbsp;with the latest SW v12 on it. I have been connecting through my Netgear DG834GT wireless router (latest firmware)&nbsp;for the last 6 months with no problems at all until now. The only thing I have&nbsp;changed on the phone recently&nbsp;is
 that I&nbsp;downloaded 3's e-mail software so I can view my Yahoo e-mails via my handset. I have subsequently deleted this from my phone but am still having problems connecting to the internet via WI-FI. Can anyone help please??

            You might have some luck by deleting the access point in your phone's "destinations" and setting it up again from scratch. The same thing happened to me before and that trick solved the problem.

    <title>After runnng Microsoft Update, can no longer open .docx files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bpabpa  say:</h3>
<h2>            After runnng Microsoft Update, can no longer open .docx files</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp; I performed the monthly Microsoft Update as always.&nbsp; This time, there were only two updates that came up as being necessary:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Update for Microsoft Office Outlook 2003 Junk Email Filter (KB2596972) and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack Service
 Pack 3 (SP3).&nbsp; I performed these updates and now all of a sudden, when I try to open a .docx file in Word 2003, I get a dialog box that says "There was an error opening the file."&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I tried this on multiple .docx files, all with the same result.&nbsp; I went to Control Panel to Add/Remove Programs, but couldn't find a listing for the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack Service Pack 3 (SP3), so instead I found and removed Compatibility Pack
 for the 2007 Office System.&nbsp; Then I downloaded and reinstalled it, but still got the same result.&nbsp; I'm stuck.&nbsp; My system is a standalone PC running Windows 2000 SP4 and Office 2003 Professional.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I tried Microsoft Update Support and they thought perhaps the issue was caused by the OLE32.dll file not being registered correctly.&nbsp; So they walked me through the process of addressing that issue, but it didn't solve the problem.&nbsp; Now, the support team is
 saying that this is an Office issue instead of a Microsoft Update issue, so they pointed me in this direction to seek assistance.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thank you, <br />
Bruce

<h3> vincenttillema  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 Outlook 0x800700b7 error</h2>
                    <p>Since the big haul over of Outlook last week my Lumia 950 won't sync the Outlook app anymore. I keep getting the following error: 0x800700b7
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So far, i havent found any means to fix it. Tried a few soft resets, tried different email servers: Nothing works.
</p>
<p>The only thing I found so far comes down to deleting the email account and then reinstalling it. But since my phone is setup around this specific account it is obvious I'm not about to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>on a side note: The Outlook app on my iPhone 6 didn't work as well for a few days but now does work properly again.</p>

            <p>VincentTillema, I had this same problem on my Lumia 950 as well. The solution is exactly what you were not about to do...delete the account and re-add it to your Outlook app. I stuck&nbsp;a reset in between the delete and add for good measure. It took a few seconds
 to re-sync, but everything came back just fine. Remember it's just removing the email view from your phone, not deleting your MS account or anything. Cheers.

            The thing is that, once I click on 'remove account' I get the message saying everything tied to the account will be removed from the phone (I understand it won't delete my account as a whole).&nbsp;<br />
Did you also get that message? If that was part of your process as well then I would feel a bit more 'safe' performing this reset.

<p>Yes I did get that message&nbsp;and proceeded to remove the account from my phone. Once you re-add, everything syncs back up.

            <p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>1. Yes, Infopath 2013 is not included in the Click-to-run installation of Office 2016's Office 365 ProPlus, but is available to download separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. InfoPath 2010 can still be used with Office 365, however, we recommend you use InfoPath 2013 for the best experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. With Office 365 licenses, you are able to use InfoPath 2013, you do not require a separate license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download InfoPath 2013 in the link below:</p>

    <title>Applying the same custom animation to hundreds of slides at once, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> watsonstudios  say:</h3>
<h2>            Applying the same custom animation to hundreds of slides at once, HELP&#33;</h2>
                    I have a photo album slide show with hundreds of slides. I need to make each slide fade in, hold, then fade out. I know how to do this using custom animations but once I create the animation, how do I assign the same animation to all the slides without
 doing it manually for each slide? As in a photo album, each slide only has one object which is the image.<br />
<br />
I tried messing with the slide master, but no luck. It would be nice to be able to copy the custom animation and then select all the objects in all the slides and hit paste. Seems like an easy solution but it doesn't seem to work that way. Any help would be
 appreciated.<br />

<p>So I have to come back to this posting process to ask someone on how I respond to the comments.&nbsp; James comes back and says - just click "view online" and you are set.</p>
<p>When I click "view online" I can see the thread - but I can't see how I actually respond to the thread of comments.</p>
<p>Can someone help me with this?&nbsp; For being such a large company - this process is not intuitive.</p>

<p>The text that you cut to the clipboard is irretrievably destroyed, because a restart clears the computer's memory. Your only hope is to find a file containing some or all of the document as it was before the cut command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have no known backup copy, use the Search box in the File Explorer to look for files that contain some text that you know is in the document. It will help to start the search term with the prefix
<strong>content:</strong>&nbsp;to avoid looking only at file names.</p>

    <title>MS Office Suite on Chromebooks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Office Suite on Chromebooks</h2>
                    <p>MS Office apps could be downloaded from the Google Play store for chromebooks several months ago. All was working well. Then they were removed. We never really got a good response from Microsoft why this happened. Now I see they are back in the Play Store
 if your chromebook is running version 63 or higher (which is the beta or dev builds).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would like to get a firm answer from Microsoft if they will be supported on chromebooks for the future or this is just a fluke.</p>

            Are you using the Preview version or the Public version, as this is the site for testing Preview version before being released to the public, and you title "games" is misleading, now for your problem are you saying the screen is too small meaning you have
 black bars around the main image? or that the &nbsp;text is too small, without any info about your system it is very hard to give you any real help, if the image is too small you need to adjust the screen resolution &nbsp;type this into the search bar
<strong>screen resolution</strong> &nbsp;, or if the text is small &nbsp;type this into the search bar&nbsp;<strong>make text and other items larger.</strong>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I too have been using hotmail (aka <a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.com</a>) for years and today have realised that some of the emails I have sent have not been received, though they do exist in my sent folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't tell exactly which ones have been received successfully or how many have not been received, or when this started happening, without contacting all the recipients by means other than email. &nbsp;But I know that at least two intended recipients have not
 received messages from today and &nbsp;yesterday, and have today attempted to re-send twice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also conducted a test in which I sent myself an email from a gmail address to a hotmail one and vice versa. &nbsp;So far (10 minutes later) the one I sent from my gmail address has arrived in my hotmail account, but the one I sent from my hotmail account has
 not arrived in the gmail account. &nbsp; That together with the info from a person to whom I have repeatedly tried to send a message from my hotmail account suggests that there is someone going wrong with the sending of messages form hotmail, though I seem (as
 far as I can tell) to be receiving &nbsp;them ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am accessing both accounts through a browser (i.e. webmail) in this case Safari, on a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? &nbsp;Much appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am having this same issue but using the online portal to manage my emails rather than a product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All emails are successfully sent and appear in my sent box and no errors are received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emails sent to other Microsoft accounts (365 et al) do seem to get through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emails sent to other domains including @sky.com, @gmail.com etc do not get through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't seem to make any difference whether an attachment is on the email or whether a full format subject is in place rather then the standard 'test email'.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found if I send through my company's VPN then they all get sent and received. The common factor in my case is my broadband/wi fi provider is PLUSNET. Having gone on their website and looked at their online forum lots of PLUSNET customers are having
 the exact same problems, but only when they use the plusnet infastructure not when they use BT mobile data etc or when they switch their plusnet wi fi off.</p>

<p>I am having this problem and my broadband/wifi ISP is BT. &nbsp;But I am only having this problem with my
<a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.com</a>&nbsp;address. &nbsp;I can send Gmail ok. &nbsp;I seem to be able to receive
<a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.com</a>&nbsp;messages but not send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to add: I contacted BT and they said as my wifi seems to be working fine in all other respects it must be something to do with
<a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.com</a>&nbsp;(hotmail) and I should contact them &nbsp;how do I do that other than hose forums?)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I have going to have to abandon hotmail, and use gmail for &nbsp;now. &nbsp;It is really frustrating since I can't even forward incoming mail to gmail or be confident that an auto reply re-directing correspondents to my gmail address would work. &nbsp;Please
 MS can you sort this out?!</p>

            <p>Thanks for this. Someone at plusnet has since posted a reply on their forum and said they think it is a microsoft problem and it could be that Microsoft don't like the IP addresses that are being assigned. If that is the case apparently it is for Microsoft
 to sort out why and fix it. But i like you do not know how to contact Microsoft or Outlook/hotmail etc. I can't forward an y of my hotmail emails to my gmail account as they do not get sent. So have to start all over again and try and establish how many emails
 have not been sent according to the Plusnet forum the problems seem to have started on about the 17th Oct. Really really could do with Microsoft sorting this a.s.a.p</p>

<p>Thanks again Brian.</p>
<p>You are no doubt right on all counts but I thought it might be at least relevant that the
<a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook.com</a>&nbsp;email seems to work when using mobile data rather than wifi, as pointed out by Nicola, so I thought I'd ask my ISP in case they said anything useful. &nbsp;I even though they might be able to raise it with MS since I
 don't know how to do that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes I realise that this is a peer forum, and am grateful for all advice. &nbsp;I just assumed that MS might peek in every so often in order to find out what issues need addressing - but maybe that's wrong. &nbsp; Please let me know if there's anything more I could
 be trying. &nbsp;I'd love get my Outlook.com email address functioning again!</p>

<p>I had a long 'live chat' with someone at MS support which did not lead to any solution. At least I think he was genuine MS. I contacted him through this page: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/?PID=17405</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point my suspicions were aroused as he wanted remote access to my laptop which I was reluctant to grant and couldn't see why he needed (he was at&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contact/chat/8/).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I am back where I started. My emails are still not sending. Advice appreciated.</p>

            I have confirmed with the Outlook.com team that there is an ongoing problem where messages appear to have been sent (they're in the Sent Items folder) but not delivered. No ETA for solution, however.

<h2>            Outlook 365 becomes unresponsive</h2>
                    <p>My Outlook frequently becomes temporarily "unresponsive" many times while I use it. The screen goes from full screen to medium sized during this period, and nothing else can be done. This is quite annoying. I've only had the computer for 1 month and it has
 been happening the entire time.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
