<h2>            Windows 7 Media Player &#40;12&#41; won&#39;t recognize any audio CDs or DVDs</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I was able to insert and play or rip&nbsp;CDs and DVDs in my HP Laptop's drive until sometime recently. Now, suddenly, Media Player does not recognize my drive at all, although I CAN see and access the drive (for recorded discs) and can even play native DVD
 media files on the disc (like .VOB files) in media player. However, there's no autoplay of inserted discs (I've already been through the control panel page for configuring autoplay, everything normal there). Same story for recorded audio CDs, can't play one
 in media player. When a valid disc is inserted, the drive never shows up in the Media Player library. Also, I can no longer burn files to a CD or DVD, the prompt that used to come up asking if I wanted to format the disc for data or music never appears and
 no burn functions of Media player work either. When I put a blank CD or DVD in the drive, windows tells me that it's not a supported disc&nbsp; type (I used these same discs previously to burn files with no problems). Also, there have been no software installations
 or reconfigurations on this computer that would have affected Media Player, other than standard windows updates.</p>
<p>I've stopped short of totally uninstalling Media Player and reinstalling, but will do so if that seems likely to help. Have tried all the Microsoft Hardware Troubleshooting and "Fix-it" programs, none of which had the slightest effect. And don't say that
 the drive is broken or that one of it's lasers is broken or that windows doesn't recognize the drive or disc. The disk is totally visible in Windows Explorer and the files ARE readable. Only Media Player is retarded and can't see the drive.</p>
<p>Any advice would be much appreciated!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response, but I've been through all of this already to no avail. There are NO error messages associated with the CD or DVD drive when in Media Player, because the drive is NEVER recognized at all. You can't rip anything, because you can't
 even find the drive, not because of errors. Doesn't matter what kind of disc you put in the drive, prerecorded CDs or DVDs, blank recordable CDs or DVDs, media player recognizes NOTHING.
</p>
<p>Looked into downloading a new installation of media player so that I could try removing and reinstalling, but it looks like Windows 7 Professional doesn't give that option in MS downloads... I'm afraid of removing it and not being able to get a reinstallation.</p>
<p>I guess I'll just watch DVDs and play CDs on my DVD player for now. Too bad I can't back up files any more, though. Any further recommendations are welcome!</p>

<h3> dennisbiernott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 home Premium 32 bit  and Windows Pro 64 bit O&#47;S</h2>
                    <p>Okay here we go, I am currently using Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit O/S I have done a back up of all my Data to an external W D&nbsp; hard drive .</p>
<p>I have been having problems with Windows Update and on different occasions my computer will freeze up. I used a program called Reimage to fix some issues and it made things worse. Now I can't update anything and all the update that were installed on my computer
 are no longer there. When I click view installed updates I receive a message that I have no updates installed.</p>
<p>I believe my system is corrupted, I probably have missing files, etc. I tried all kinds of fixes and nothing is working so this is what I want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have two directions to take</strong>:&nbsp; <strong>One</strong>, I am thinking about installing a new hard drive and load my Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit O/S .Then install all my Data form my external hard drive to my new hard drive.</p>
<p>When I did a back up to my external hard drive I was using the Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit O/S</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My second choice is</strong> : Install a new W D hard drive and install Windows Pro 10 64 bit O/S . Now here is my question: Can I transfer all my back up data from my external drive which was created using a Windows 7&nbsp; 32bit O/S to this new hard
 that now has Windows 10 Pro 64 bit O/S? Will this affect my Data performance?</p>
<p>I am under the assumption that The only difference between a 32bit and 64bit O/S is the amount of Date transfer is increased and the system runs faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also understand that EULA has a thing were if you make changes such as your mother board or other components you will not be able to activate your operating system. You will have to call Microsoft to activate your O/S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Man, it seems like everything is getting harder and harder to fix, getting very frustrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If anyone can confirm one of these approaches that I want to take it would be surely appreciated,Thank you.</p>

<p>64 bit is clearly predominant.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you take a given computer configuration, one with a 32 bit installation and the other 64, the 64 is about 15% faster</p>
<p>
</p><p>32 bit is limited to a bit more than 3 gigabytes of memory.&nbsp; 64 is limited only by the computer's design.&nbsp; The difference is how many windows you can open at one time and not degrade performance seriously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you will provide details on your current computer, I will offer my advice on what to do next.</p>

<p>Hello, I don't think you need all that information. All I am looking for is can I install Windows ten pro 64 bit on a new 1 TB W D hard drive and then transfer all my Data to this new hard drive from my external drive.</p>
<p>The information on the external drive was backed up using Windows 7 32 bit O/S, SP1 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: will the information on the external back up drive which was created using Windows 7 32 bit O/S transfer to the new hard drive using Windows Pro 1064 bit O/S? Will there be conflicts because of the 32 bit and 64 bit difference? Will my data function
 under the 64 bit</p>
        </p>

<p>Whether a Windows operating system is characterized as 32-bit or 64-bit has no bearing at all on data.&nbsp; As long as you have application programs that can "understand" the data files, you're good to go.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if you have *.doc or *.docx files that you created using Microsoft Word on your Windows 7 32-bit system, you will be able to read and edit those files once you install Microsoft Word on a Windows 10 64-bit system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be the case even if you chose to install the 64-bit version of Word on the Windows 10 system -- but you probably do not want to do that.&nbsp; Microsoft Office defaults to installing the 32-bit versions of its applications even on systems that are
 running the 64-bit version of Windows.&nbsp; See </p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Choose-between-the-64-bit-or-32-bit-version-of-Office-2dee7807-8f95-4d0c-b5fe-6c6f49b8d261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Choose-between-the-64-bit-or-32-bit-version-of-Office-2dee7807-8f95-4d0c-b5fe-6c6f49b8d261</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had just copied files from your current computer to your external drive, you could just copy them back from the external drive to your new Windows 10 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you used the "Backup and Restore" routine built into Windows 7 to create your backup, this article explains how to recover your data:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3034527/windows/restore-a-windows-7-backup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.pcworld.com/article/3034527/windows/restore-a-windows-7-backup-in-windows-10.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you used some other application to create your backup, you may need to install that application on your Windows 10 system to recover the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I am under the assumption that The only difference between a 32bit and 64bit O/S is the amount of Data transfer is increased and the system runs faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Not quite.&nbsp; As far as most home users are concerned, the main difference between a 32-bit version of Windows and a 64-bit version of Windows is the latter's ability to use more RAM.&nbsp; The system may or may not "run faster" if it has more RAM; that depends on
 what you're doing.&nbsp; And, of course, there won't be any change at all unless you actually install more RAM (assuming that your hardware permits that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I also understand that EULA has a thing were if you make changes such as your mother board or other components you will not be able to activate your operating system. You will have to call Microsoft to activate your O/S.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows came pre-installed when you bought your computer, you have what's known as an "OEM" license.&nbsp; This license is limited to the computer on which Windows was first installed.&nbsp; That means that you can't use the same product key to activate an installation
 of Windows on a "new computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows monitors changes in your system hardware, and Microsoft has a secret algorithm that "decides" that you have a "new computer" if too many hardware changes are made.&nbsp; Outside of Microsoft, no one really knows how many changes are "too many," but it
 is generally accepted that changing the motherboard will definitely trigger this detection and result in your installation of Windows being flagged as "unauthorized."&nbsp; There is an exception if you replace a defective motherboard with an identical model (or
 one that the manufacturer offers as a replacement if the original is no longer available).&nbsp; If this happens, you will need to "re-activate" Windows by telephone.</p>

    <title>Dead Rising 4 install issues &#36;80 bucks of unplayable game ATM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drift187  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dead Rising 4 install issues &#36;80 bucks of unplayable game ATM</h2>
                    <p>So I now understand why the Windows Store is so universally hated. &nbsp;Pay $79.99 for a new game and then spend hours scrolling through posts trying to figure out why it won't install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 1:</p>
<p>Has anyone tried to migrate the install files from 1 PC to another? </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I only have a 3meg connection at home and the 45 gig download will take forever. &nbsp;I work for an ISP so have essentially a full 1gig link to my workstation. &nbsp;Spent hours today switching ownership of the "WindowsApps" folder trying to move the game to a flash
 drive (Which I do all the time on STEAM and is super easy with their "backup" function). &nbsp;No luck following every walkthrough I could find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why am I getting a "this app needs hardware your device does not have" error and the install is grayed out saying " Sorry, Dead Rising 4 is no longer available." when I try to install the slow way at home?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an i7 4770k, GTX 980, 16gb ram...What do you mean I am missing hardware? &nbsp;And if this is an update issue (which I am doing now)... then wouldn't the proper nomenclature be "This app needs SOFTWARE your device does not have"? &nbsp;I know you guys are coders
 so english is not your strong suite but come on. &nbsp;The distinction between HARDWARE and SOFTWARE... The windows store diagnostic tool (YES THAT'S A REAL THING) &nbsp;can't find any issue (surprise).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure I will get through this eventually but every hour I waste trying to install makes this game even more expensive. &nbsp;EXTREMELY disappointing experience with Windows Store. &nbsp; ANY helpful hints would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Well I have Net Framework 4.6.01038. &nbsp;Now up to 4.6.2. &nbsp;Just unlocked my ethernet since it was set to metered... hoping it is some random KB file that it was deferring due to the faux metered connection. &nbsp; I wish they would sort that feature out... not being
 able to control when updates download is killing small business that can't get fast internet in their area and just annoying the heck out of average home users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll see. &nbsp;Thanks for the input but alas still no zombies.</p>

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So getting the windows update solved the inability to download. &nbsp;So as anticipated the "Hardware" issue was actually a "Software" issue... now to the next issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I clicked install it gave me 2 options , drives C: and D:. &nbsp;Without thinking I clicked on D: believing it to be my 3TB standard drive (C: is my SSD but not much room there). &nbsp;I was wrong. &nbsp;SO just spent 45 hours downloading the game to my USB 3TB drive
 and it would not complete install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to transfer the files by taking ownership of the "WindowsApps" folder but that failed. &nbsp;So started a fresh install and my E: drive is still not an option. &nbsp;I also could not use the move option in the "Apps and Features" since it could never complete
 install so DR4 was not in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has literally been the most frustrating $80 I have ever spent. &nbsp;Windows Store is a nightmare and should be avoided. &nbsp;Thinking about buying this game? &nbsp;Save yourself a headache and buy it on STEAM for less money in 6 months. &nbsp;So tomorrow I shall be carting
 my PC in &nbsp;to work and trying again and downloading it to the C: after deleting the games I have on it since that is apparently my only option. &nbsp;God installing MODS on Skyrim was easier than this BEFORE all the official support. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best part of this whole thing was knowing THIS game was to be a Win10 exclusive at launch was one of the main reasons I gambled on upgrading from Win7. &nbsp;We all sold our souls for this fancy OS. &nbsp;I will update the thread again when and if I actually get
 this working. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>YAY so finally got to play the game!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long and short I am still unable to view or install to my 3TB internal drive from Windows Store.&nbsp; I am unable to find anything about this and am baffled as that drive has been in since the original install of WIN 7 I upgraded from.&nbsp; All other programs see
 it as an install option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lessons learned:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)Make sure Windows 10 "SOFTWARE" is FULLY up to date.&nbsp; Not having this will yield weird results such as "Device does not have the necessary hardware" or "Game is no longer available on Windows Store Errors".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)Install it wherever Windows will be forcing you (Because you don't have a choice).&nbsp; Transferring install files via USB stick is also not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)Copying files from the "WindowsApps" after taking ownership may break your Windows Store.&nbsp; Respect Windows 10, it owns YOU now and will tell YOU how it will run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)GeForce Experience will not work on this APP nor will most frame rate monitors due to the high level of secrecy and lockdown of the WindowsApps folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5)Mods will be problematic... again due to the WindowsApps folder.&nbsp; Even simple ones like SweetFX are a no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in summary if you are dying to play this game get it from Windows Store at your own risk.&nbsp; IF you have a SUPER vanilla setup you will probably be fine.&nbsp; Otherwise I would wait until it hits STEAM for cheap.&nbsp; There are a lot of bugs and issues currently
 with the game itself (Which is disappointing after all the hassle and price)&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

    <title>Support for 2 USB Headsets for recording Videos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kitsune_23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Support for 2 USB Headsets for recording Videos</h2>
                    Is there anyway to use 2 USB headsets at once? I need it for recording commentary for video games, and a standard catch-all mic (ex. Yeti) doesn't give the sound quality I want because the place I'm at is rather loud and picks up too much sound. I use
 XSplit and an Elgato Capture Card for game capture.

    <title>LifeCam HD3000 Laggy All of a Sudden - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trueblue1981  say:</h3>
<h2>            LifeCam HD3000 Laggy All of a Sudden</h2>
                    Yes. My LifeCam HD3000 has all of a sudden become very laggy on playback from a recording, on ANY resolution.<br />
<br />
I recently formatted my laptop and reinstalled Windows, and this is when it started to happen. It was working perfect before the fresh install, but now it lags. The problem is the video lags behind the audio, so the audio finishes then the video cuts off.<br />
<br />
I have tried using the LifeCam software, but it still lags. I've always used Dell Webcam Central for my webcam videos, and it;s always worked, but it's laggy in that to. It wasn't too bad in Cyberlink YouCam, but it was still choppy.<br />
<br />
I did the same steps I always do upon Windows being installed... installed drivers, then SP2, then further updates, then the LifeCam drivers/software, then Dell WebCam Central. Nothing is different to how I normally install my devices/software. It has NEVER
 done this before, until the recent Windows install. I have NO clue as to why. I do have a crappy Logitech HD webcam, with faulty video quality, but I can see clearly enough that Logitech webcam IS in sync, and not laggy at all... so it's just affecting the
 Microsoft LifeCam for some reason.<br />
<br />
As I said, this was a clean install of Windows, so all the drivers, software etc are clean. I've also tried uninstalling and reinstalling several time, but nothing has helped.<br />
<br />
Sorry that was a bit longer than I thought, but if anyone can shed some light on this, I would be grateful. Otherwise, I'll have to get a new HD webcam. Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
PS... I did ask a similar question to this many months ago, but that was on behalf of my girlfriend. Now it's ME that has this problem.<br />

<h2>            wrong name with account</h2>
                    I haven't used Skype in a long time and just downloaded it on my newer computer. I had forgotten my password and reset it. When I logged in,&nbsp;there was a different name associated with my account and none of my old contacts were there. So, I am wondering
 whether someone has hacked my account or if I am somehow not logged into my old account. Help:)

<p><span>Hello
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Skype Community forum and welcome back to Skype as well!
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For your issue, if you have downloaded Skype on a new device and signed in using your email, possibly the same email you have on your Skype account, you could have accidentally
 created another one instead of logging in using your Skype name. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To view what accounts you have, simply enter your email address in this link:
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>CLICK HERE</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From there, if your email is indeed the one used for this other account you saw and the same email as well for your default account, you will both view the accounts. You can
 then select the correct account and even reset its password and then sign in to Skype.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, just to inform you and if you wish to take advantage in Skype in having a more simplified sign in on Skype and across all Microsoft products using your email only,
 you can then choose to have your Skype updated with Microsoft. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To know on how to and to have more information, you can refer to the links below:
</span></p>

            <p>Hi, Thank you for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was finally able to successfully install Windows 10 on my device.</p>
<p>I don't know what exactly was causing the problem but here is a list of what i have done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I checked my hard disc for errors </p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Check-your-hard-disk-for-errors</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I run the System File Checker utility</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</p>
<p>(this unpatched the files i had patched to put custom themes on my computer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I made sure my laptop met the needed hardware requirements (it does) and updated all the drivers (I actually updated everything that was possibly updatable)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I made a system restore point</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Just before beginning the Installation, I deactivated Windows Defender and my Antivirus (Kaspersky), and unplugged all my USB devices, including the mouse
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It DID get stuck at 75% like last time, I waited a bit and had to restart it manually thinking it would just roll back to windows 7, but upon restart it actually resumed the installation of windows 10 and it now works like a charm!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this can help people who are having the same problem as mine!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>
</p><p>If it stop at second boot or forever black screen try follow:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Use Microsoft MediaCreationTool to download latest version ISO (my 1703).</p>
<p>2. Expand IOS to a bootable USB.</p>
<p>3. For update version/build, run a Windows administrative shell at USB device.</p>
<p>4. run setup.exe /Auto Clean</p>
<p>5. Station must be online.</p>
<p>6. It will auto download the update&nbsp;and selectively the only supported drivers.</p>
<p>7. A fresh new Windows 10 with latest build will be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warning! All apps and application will be removed. You need to reinstall all others except a new fresh Windows 10 with latest build.

What about other combinations, do any of them work?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can you make your TV your primary monitor?&nbsp;&nbsp; If not you may need to find a driver for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can still boot in W7, use&nbsp;Device Manager to see what it shows on that tack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also,&nbsp;if you do an explicit download for&nbsp;your Radeon&nbsp;you probably would have&nbsp; Catalyst Control Center, so then you could see what it reports about that "monitor."&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully both diagnostics would give you a better clue about what was missing from W8.</p>

<p>You can often do a trick with your remote to break a region controlled DVD player..It's apparently not illegeal either. And yea, usually cheap ones will be. Mines a sansui which picked up for cheap and it's fine.</p>

            I am assuming that you are running a Powershell script or some legitimate program is running this. If not, you may need to see who is running and then decide to allow.

            Hi Tracey, 
<br />
<br />Are you running a script on Powershell when you get this message or does it just pop up itself
<br />
<br />A lot of the time in the background Windows Update and other processes will run in quiet mode on Powershell and that is OK
<br />
<br />Otheerwise, I would be careful about what is actually running on Powershell in the background . ..

<h2>            Bitlocker aks for PIN before booting but encryption is not shown activated for drive in Windows</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I use Windows 10 Pro on a self encrypting Samsung SSD Drive and configured/installed it by
 following this guide https://helgeklein.com/blog/2015/01/how-to-enable-bitlocker-hardware-encryption-with-ssd/. I configured bitlocker to ask for a PIN before booting Windows and the lock symbol in the explorer as well as manage-bde status command showed that
 bitlocker successfully encrypted system drive C: and really used hardware encryption of the Samsung drive. Everything seemed to work fine, but after I updated most of the drivers for my Dell Inspron 15 7559 to the newest version (http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/inspiron-15-7559-laptop/drivers)
 bitlocker first asked to enter the recovey key because configuration has changed and then the bitlocker symbol in Windows explorer was gone. Also the “activate bitlocker” symbol in the context menu did not appear. I tried to start the graphical interface of
 the bitlocker management tool but no reaction. When I used the commandlet manage-bde I got “ERROR: The volume C: could not be opened by BitLocker. This may be because the volume does not exist, or because it is not a valid BitLocker volume”. But bitlocker
 kept asking for a pin on bootup and I could not access the drive with a Live OS. So the drive still seemed to be encrypted (also using bitlocker recovery mode and executing the manage-bde -status command on c: showed that the drive was encrypted) but Windows
 did not recognize that after boot. After restoring system files by an image and reboot I could access the bitlocker management tool and option in the context menu again. Now bitlocker was not activated on c: but bitlocker just had asked me to enter the pin
 before booting. If I tried to activate bitlocker now, I was asked if I wanted a part or the whole partitation encrypted, which indicates that bitlock did NOT try to use the hardware but a software encryption. So obviously hardware encryption with pre-boot
 authentication is activated on my system but after booting bitlocker in Windows does not show that and offers me to activate bitlocker by using software encryption. How can I restore/reset bitlocker to recognize the encrypted harddisk again and access the
 settings for my hardware encrypted drive (for example change pin etc.)?</span><br />
<br />

    <title>Problem Burning DVD from Downloaded iso - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lpt3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem Burning DVD from Downloaded iso</h2>
                    When I burn the dvd using the iso using 1x (I read from earlier post that we should use the slowest speed), I included the verification of the burning. During the verification, it showed the following error message:<br />
<br />
W 20:54:49 Sector 46206 maps to File: \sources\boot.wim<br />
<br />
Apparently, there is some problem with the file boot.wim. When I tried to copy this file from the dvd to the harddisk, I got a "Cannot copy boot: Data error (cyclic redundancy check" error message.<br />
<br />
I tried to go ahead and proceed with the installation. But I got the "file not found" error during the expanding file stage.<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can replace the file boot.wim?

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to boot in safe mode and check if you are able to open gpedit.msc and secpol.msc. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.
 If an existing problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers as possible causes. To boot in safe mode follow the link.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow the link given below.</span></span></p>

    <title>Xbox 360 S Disc Drive Loud Noise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louisf12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 S Disc Drive Loud Noise</h2>
                    I purchased an Xbox 360 S and recently have noticed when I play the following games: Tony Hawk’s Underground 2, Madden 13, and Halo Reach, the drive gets louder and i can hear what sounds like gears shifting back and fourth really fast loudly and constantly.
 The console sits horizontally and these games play perfectly otherwise, but when i play Test Drive Eve of Destruction or Pro Street it sounds relatively silent. I’m aware that you can install your games to the hard drive but i don’t want to have to constantly
 clear space. Again the games are playing fine but the noise is very loud and VERY annoying! Of anyone could give suggestions that would be a big help.

<p>Hi there Louis, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out here in Xbox Forums. I understand there is a concern with the Xbox 360 S disc drive producing a loud noise. The&nbsp;noise may be produced by the fan and operating system running&nbsp;the games. The sound may vary depending on the game&nbsp;graphics
 and system performance capabilities. <span>&nbsp;I recommend to

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your questions..</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I am now running 64 bit Windows 10 Pro - Version 151. OS build 10586.36. The problem started two automated updates ago</p>
<p>2) I have a HP Z820 workstation</p>
<p>3) The printer is an HP Laserjet Pro 500 color MFP m570dn</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding method 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>My printers directory is already empty. When trying to add a printer using only Microsoft software ( Print Management ) the spool stops every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding method 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>All required services ( DCOM Server Process Launcher &amp; RPC Endpoint Mapper ) are running. There is no printer so there are no drivers to uninstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your prompt attention to this is greatly appreciated. From what I can see lots of people are having Windows 10 spool issues post the update 2 iterations ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t play video file in Windows Media Player - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t play video file in Windows Media Player</h2>
                    I sent myself a video from another computer using Windows Media Player and when I try to open the attachment, using WIN 7, I chose OPEN Win Media Playlist.&nbsp; Then I get the message "Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file."&nbsp; The
 video window opens and then the writing changes to Media Changing and stops.&nbsp; I have tried checking my sound devices and they are up to date.&nbsp; Karen

            The .wpl file&nbsp;is a&nbsp;Windows Media Playlist file...<br />
not an actual&nbsp;video file.<br />
<br />
Here's some info on .wpl files:<br />
