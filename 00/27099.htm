    <title>Using &#34;Rules&#34; to stop junk mail - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using &#34;Rules&#34; to stop junk mail</h2>
                    I use Cableone for my email and MSFT Outlook (2003) on my computer to send, store and receive email. I've been using this program since 2003 without any major problems. I think I'll upgrade to Office 2010 when it comes out, however:<br />
<br />
Ever since I got my new computer (DELL laptop) with Windows 7 I've had a problem with getting 20 or so junk mail messages in my Outlook Inbox every time I open it up.<br />
<br />
I've put in rules with "words in the subject line" and I've selected "add to blocked sender" list for every piece of junk mail I've received. I've even told Outlook to deliver email ONLY if it is from someone on my Contacts list and I've even told it to deliver
 mail ONLY from certain Domain Names.<br />
<br />
Nothing works. I continue to get the same garbage from the same senders over and over again.<br />
<br />
I've send messages to Cableone Technical Support but they don't even answer, much less provide me with a solution.<br />
<br />
My wife and I have other email addresses at Yahoo, Google, and MSN and we don't have this problem at all.<br />
<br />
1. What can I do to stop this junk mail?<br />
2. Why doesn't Outlook stop it?<br />
3. Why doesn't Cableonone stop it?

            Do they have your email address in the from field? Check the message header to be sure.
<br />
Do you have a contact for yourself in contacts? If so, trusting contacts will also trust spammers who use your address in the From field.
<br />
<br />
Do you have junk email filtering set on high? That will stop most spam. Use the safe lists only, the blocked list should contain few, if any, addresses. Spammers change addresses often and the blocked/safe lists can hold a limited number of addresses.
<br />
<br />
ISPs tend to deliver everything - many of their users want to decide on their own what is spam and what is valid mail.
<br />
<br />
What you created the rules, did you copy the subject line and paste it into the rule? Spammers use 'creative spelling' to bypass these types of filers.

<h2>            Solution &#58;- Windows Insider Build 15007 stucked at some percentage for Phone and Pc</h2>
                    <p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Windows 10 insiders build 15007 for PC and Phone -&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've heard that lots of Windows insiders are stucked at some % while updating to Build 15007 on their phone. I myself was facing this problem - I tried 5 reset but didn't help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution - :</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps :-&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) Turn <strong>off</strong> <em>Wifi </em>and Turn <strong>on</strong> &nbsp;<em>airplane mode</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>2.)&nbsp;</em>Change country to<strong><em>( Luxembourg )</em></strong> - Go to settings &lt; search for region option
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note :- Your phone will restart </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) Go to settings &lt; System &lt; Display : Change your DPI ( size of apps and text ) to 250 % whichever is minimum on your device&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note : - It will restart your device</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>4.) Do a manual restart by pressing ( <strong>Power + Volume down - together </strong>
) known as soft reset too! </p>
<p>5.) Turn off Airplane mode and Turn on Wifi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.) Go to settings &lt; Phone update &lt; update&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>( It will take 5 minutes to start and it will take 10-minutes on 99% )&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>But after this method you will be able to do a update!&nbsp;</p>
<p>

Since you are using Microsoft Outlook, your e-mails will be sent via your Internet Service Provider's (ISP) SMTP servers and it is up to their settings/policy on their end whether to allow or not, and its restrictions. Unless you are using a static IP, that
 IP address may have been abused by other ISP users to send spam and resulted it to be blacklisted by Microsoft anti-spam databases. You have to
<strong>reach out with your ISP</strong> about this, and request them to assign you a new, reputable IP address for your SMTP use.

<h2>            Some of my keys on my HP laptop don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP laptop. &nbsp;It originally had&nbsp;windows 8 but I updated to&nbsp;windows 10 about ten days ago. It all operated just fine then I started my computer this morning and found that numbers "<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">1"
 and "2" don't function, as&nbsp;</span>well as "w" "q" and all the function keys. &nbsp;The keys don't&nbsp;work in Safe Mode or after a System Restore. &nbsp;I think I should restore or reinstall my drivers but can't find these for windows 10 on HP. &nbsp;Honestly, I don't know&nbsp;what
 to do...and I hate copy and pasting "w" and other letters from internet searches. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I connect an external keyboard, the failed buttons work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help? &nbsp;This is terrible timing for this grad student.</p>

            Make sure your keyboard setting hasn't changed to a different keyboard. This can cause weird results when pressing keys. Should be able to check which keyboard you are set to by clicking just to the left of the date-time display at bottom right of the
 taskbar.

<p>Thanks for the help. The keyboard settings are the same, according to the button near the date and time.

</p><p>My computer has a touchscreen and I can open up the touchscreen keyboard. &nbsp;The function keys aren't on there but the 3-4 keys that don't work on my actual keyboard work on the touchscreen keyboard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'm trying to figure out if there is physical damage or software damage. &nbsp;I cannot find the keyboard driver on the HP site, so I can't reinstall that. &nbsp;But I reinstalled all the other drivers without&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I still think it sounds like possibly the wrong keyboard installed unless it is a physical problem with the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran into a problem with some keys typing unnormal results and like you the onscreen keyboard typed normal and after trying everything I could think of I finally discovered it was set to the wrong keyboard.&nbsp;

    <title>Surface Pro 3 10159 Functionality - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timstone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 10159 Functionality</h2>
                    <p>I have an SP3, I5, 256GB device not yet on the Insider Program.&nbsp; This unit is used strictly for work ... needs to run Visual Studio 2013, Office 365, and some legacy desktop apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wondered if the 10159 build is now solid on the SP3 to allow me to install it, or are we still seeing issues ( ie rebooting, battery drain, wireless issues, etc ).&nbsp; I'm on the road and need it to do some mobile support ( possibly ) for clients.&nbsp; Is it
 still risky to put it on Insiders, or are we close enough to be "good to go"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the input.</p>

<p>Hi Jigs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code <strong>0x80240034 </strong>is a Windows update error that may have been caused by misconfigured system files and Windows Update program file corruption.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've tried SFC and DISM, we suggest that you try using the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update troubleshooter</a>, it may help you fix the update problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter will perform a diagnostic process on your system that will check and resolve issues related to updating your computer. If the troubleshooter finds any issues, it will be listed in the result with additional instructions you may need to
 follow. However, in most cases, the troubleshooter will find and apply fixes automatically.</p>
<p>

 is helpful in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>So here is how it went:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f36573c4-12de-4441-8b13-e1630efa61a0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f36573c4-12de-4441-8b13-e1630efa61a0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Lots of the above, not sure why...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afce64bc-aba1-4d33-9d26-2113873d6b55?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/afce64bc-aba1-4d33-9d26-2113873d6b55?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So the Troubleshooter fixed the problem with quality updates, but not feature updates, and resetting Windows Update components did not seem to have an effect:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67d741f6-f8f7-4185-bd8a-dcc11452d33a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67d741f6-f8f7-4185-bd8a-dcc11452d33a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The final result:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d30e93c4-ce4d-4edf-a628-3382d99a09c6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d30e93c4-ce4d-4edf-a628-3382d99a09c6?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Yes, I have seen this suggestion many times out in the wild, and while I agree with the solution philosophically, in practice that's just untenable. It's much easier to just wait for MS to build the next ISO, and then use that (as that always works). This
 just seems like a major flaw in the approach - rings that just circle a drain...&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to reset Edge and check if it works:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings </strong>menu by clicking the three dots in the upper right corner of Edge and select
<strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Under clear browsing data, click <strong>Choose what to clear </strong>and choose
<strong>Show more.</strong></p>
<p>3. Select all the data types and press<strong> Clear.</strong></p>
<p>4. Restart your PC and re-open Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, try running the Windows app troubleshooter and check if it resolves your issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Run troubleshooter.</a></p>

            Well after researching and looking at all the event logs... I think I might know what happen.. There is a good chance that the Lenovo software that is on the machine.... specifically the modern app program..&nbsp;I think it is call Lenovo companion and there
 is another one that I can't remember.&nbsp;&nbsp; might have caused the problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a Lenovo piece of&nbsp;software that I removed from Program and features.&nbsp;&nbsp; After doing all that the machine was totally hosed.. I tried all kinds of things and finally just
 restored the&nbsp;backup I had with Build 14986 on&nbsp;it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am trying to get 15014 to download again... but not sure why it is not coming.&nbsp; I set my insider selection&nbsp;to Fast and am waiting for the update to flow.

            <p>Ok. &nbsp;Edge on 15019 stilled crashed... but&nbsp; I&nbsp;really figured out why.&nbsp; Hopefully Microsoft will see this and might give an explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem was not the Lenovo software.... I had to get a&nbsp;backup of my machine that I had fro14936 I think and reinstalled
 all applications after spending&nbsp; 10 hours loading everything, all seemed to be well.&nbsp; I came&nbsp;in on&nbsp;Monday and BOOM Edge is not&nbsp;working. I had uninstalled all Lenovo software and know Lenovo was not&nbsp;the cause.&nbsp;&nbsp; We run Kaspersky and had it on my machine.&nbsp; It
 seemed to work fine on Friday and then on Monday Edge did not work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a bunch of reading Monday afternoon and&nbsp;all day Tuesday.&nbsp; Turns out that Kasperksy is not supported on any of the insider builds...... so I uninstalled Kaspersky and Edge still did
 not work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did find though that there is a registry entry that&nbsp;is present on machines that have or had Kasperksy on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Below is the registry entry</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you delete the dcom entry Edge starts&nbsp;working.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought great... no more problems and did some research on that registry setting (never seen before) and found out it is part of Microsoft SDDL infrastructure.... which I can't totally explain.&nbsp;&nbsp; what
 was really interesting is that today I came in the registry entry was back.&nbsp;&nbsp; Edge did not work and when I deleted it, Edge worked.&nbsp;&nbsp; All other Universal Apps worked only edge did not

            Well I thought&nbsp;I had the problem solved...... not.....&nbsp; It seems that on a regular basis Microsoft refreshes the SDDL part of&nbsp;Windows..... which I am trying to learn about how and why..&nbsp; Somehow 1 particular machine seems to have the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't
 have the problem on other machines.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft, can you point me to&nbsp;a really good article or KB on SDDL and how to&nbsp;modify and read.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have played with mmc.exe and component services with no luck.

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Since the update to the last version, i detected that some configurations are missing:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Graphic tab: this option when you generate a pivot-table and graph is missing. Only appear in the old data, if you add new one, this element is not present. The graph options neither appear (show titles, show data, tendencies, etc)</li><li>Data origin: when you select the graph appear the lines that you are printing, this option is dissapeared. If you are using to update the graph is so good to adjust the graphs with the elements that you need. When you change one row or columm the data origin
 disspaear</li><li>Change the columms and rows is not available</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Is only for me, and my MAC (High Sierra 10.13.2 (17C88)? Could you fix this issues</p>

<h2>            &#34;Background installation ran into a problem&#34; and loading for hours.</h2>
                    When I try and open any office document, I get "Background installation ran into a problem" and it appears to be loading for hours. It has also deleted all of Office from my start menu. I have tried everything and nothing seems to work. I only installed
 Microsoft Office on my new laptop a few days ago so there is no issue with previous versions of Office. Anyone got a clue what's going on?!

    <title>No access to Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> helen swift  say:</h3>
<h2>            No access to Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>I hope someone can help me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I recently changed ISP, which came with a new email account.&nbsp; I don't know if this has caused a problem, but when I try to log into my Microsoft account, my password will not work.&nbsp;My Microsoft account is linked to my original email address and I can't delete
 it. &nbsp;I keep getting&nbsp;a prompt from Microsoft to Verify my identity, which I cannot ( due to not being able to use my password ).&nbsp; I then discovered an email from Microsoft, stating that I had changed my password, which I definitely have not. &nbsp;I have followed
 the prompts to try and fix this issue, but keep getting error messages:&nbsp; Something went wrong:&nbsp; You can't do that here:&nbsp; Internal server error 500.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea why this happened and better still, I don't have a clue how to fix it.&nbsp; Is there a simple solution, or should I call Microsoft and hope they can fix this over the phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help</p>

            <p>Thank you for a speedy reply.&nbsp; I have tried to access my account via both options, but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First option of re-setting the password just does not work and the second option tells me..."You can't access that information here.&nbsp; Go to your organisation's website".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has only arisen since I changed ISP and set up a new Outlook account.&nbsp; I don't know if that would be the reason Microsoft emailed me regarding the alleged change of password.</p>

    <title>CoA on Office Pro 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlesdavis  say:</h3>
<h2>            CoA on Office Pro 2010</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have purchased Office Pro 2010 on eBay and the COA on the box is not properly put on it. The middle is squashed. I don't know if this is due to where the box open as I am keeping it sealed for now until I am sure it is genuine.<br />
<br />
I have scanned the barcode on my phone and it comes up with Office Pro 2010. Would that be enough to authenticate the software? Apart from the middle part of the sticker, the rest seems to be fine. I have checked the inside yet though.<br />
<br />
Can we also use any of the numbers on the 3 barcodes on the sticker to authenticate the software?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            <p>Correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In VBA you can either automate Get External Data (you can record a macro while doing it manually to get a good start), or you could use ADO or DAO functions to create a recordset and then use CopyFromRecordset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recall using SQL.REQUEST in the early 1990s when I was writing Excel 4 macros.&nbsp; I seem to remember that it was quite an expensive function and difficult to use, with difficulties whenever strings exceeded 255 characters.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Excel 97 introduced better methods of importing external data and they have evolved into what we have now as Get External Data.&nbsp; I wouldn't be surprised if the xlodbc.xla add-in that included SQL.REQUEST would still work if you were able to find a copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however, I think the facilities we have today are vastly superior.</p>

            If the equalizer is not supported by your device, it will behave like that. So in short: Your device hardware do not support the equalizer.

<p>If you only want to change the line spacing and spacing before/after, do that in the Manage Styles dialog box. In the Styles pane (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S), click the Manage Styles button. You'll find the settings you need on the Set Defaults tab. When you are
 done, select "New documents based on this template" and then click OK.</p>

            <p>In Office 2016, Microsoft changed the behavior for saving custom templates to default to C:\Users\[User Name]\Documents\Custom Office Templates. That's where you're most likely to find the ones you saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although there is a rationale behind this change (it makes it more likely that your custom templates will be included in backups and/or File History than if they're under the AppData\Roaming folder), most experienced users find that it's preferable to change
 the location for saving templates to the Templates folder. You can do that by going to File &gt; Options &gt; Save and entering the Templates folder's path in the "Default personal templates location" box. Then move all the existing files from the Custom Office
 Templates folder to the Templates folder.<br />

<h2>            Two &#34;pages&#34; on one page&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have laid out a 60-page booklet as 8.5" x 5.5" pages.&nbsp; A little late(!), I realize that what I need is to have two separate 8.5 x 5.5 pages (including footers) on each
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">8.5 x 11</span> page, so it can be printed and then folded to make the booklet.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Word 2013, can I somehow do this -- have two independent pages on the same page?&nbsp; Like I say, each one has to be exactly like the original
 8.5 x 5.5 page, including footers.&nbsp; To make matters worse, the page numbers are of course not continuous, since it'll be printed and then folded to make a booklet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that I can print what I've already created and then paste them all onto 8.5 x 11 sheets, front and back, but I'm hoping for an electronic solution!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I had many trouble with the memory management in access</p>
<p>and I suppose that it's coming from space allocation by windows 10</p>
<p>do you know how to allocate maxlockfileapce in HoTKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE for Microsoft accesss?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office 365 Pro Plus Command line repair</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to do quick repair on Office 365 Pro Plus using command line. I have tried almost all parameters combination available but getting popup stating "You have a newer version of office installed" each time. Is there a new parameter available to do
 quick repair ? Screenshots below.</p>

            <p>Thank you. Issue is resolved by uninstalling previous versions of Office and then running online repair on O365 and then command line runs without any issues.</p>

    <title>Adding students to a class notebook in OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding students to a class notebook in OneNote</h2>
                    <p>I have a class notebook set up on OneNote to which I have added students.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to look at who I have shared it with, all my students come up on the list. However, within the classbook, 1 students name is missing. I then try to "add student" but when I click on this, it does not have the notebook that I want listed under wither
 "my notebooks" or "shared notebooks".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to send the link via sharepoint, but it does not allow access for the student.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used OneNote for quite some time now and have tried everything that I can think of but nothing is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please advise how to have the system recognise the class notebooks that I have created, which in turn will then allow me to add or remove students.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Kalouw,</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the updated information via PM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your latest query "<span>how to add or remove students from a NoteBook if it is set up in Teams", please check the information at the bottom of the official support article&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-onenote-class-notebook-in-teams-bd77f11f-27cd-4d41-bfbd-2b11799f1440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use
 OneNote Class Notebook in Teams.</a></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7fa0215-a4a5-4b55-be28-050be1303da1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7fa0215-a4a5-4b55-be28-050be1303da1?upload=true" /></a>From
 experience, we may need some time to wait for the members information to be synced up. See:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams/Adding-a-student-to-class-notebook-in-teams/td-p/89478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Adding a student to class notebook in teams</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, what I meant is to check if the affected student can access the notebooks he previously can access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the issue here, based on the information in PM, it may be permission issue. Please refer to the steps below in the official support article&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-class-notebook-when-welcome-collaboration-space-or-content-library-are-missing-dae0729e-a7c5-46ed-809b-ec06900f0d21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix
