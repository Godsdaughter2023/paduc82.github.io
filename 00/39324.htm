Your email is changing</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BT aren't very good at dating articles at their customer help site, so 'last year' and 'in the spring' don't tell us much about when changes happened or are going to happen. However, in view of the error message you're seeing, your account has probably been
 upgraded by now. You should apply the new settings: <a href="http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/44917/~/bt-email%3A-what-are-the-settings-for-outgoing-and-incoming-mail-servers%3F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
BT email: What are the settings for outgoing and incoming mail servers?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>. On the
<em>General</em> tab, deselect <em>Include this account when receiving mail or synchronizing</em>. Close the properties dialogue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then press Ctrl-Shift-T to start the <em>Add your email accounts </em><em>wizard.
</em>Fill in the first page and select <em>Manually configure server settings </em>
before clicking <em>Next</em>. Fill in the next page with the new settings. Be sure to enter your full email address for the email username.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the account set up, test it by sending a test message to yourself. Post any error message in your reply. When this new account is working properly, you can remove the old one. Move any messages in any of its folders to user-created folders
 under Storage folders before removing it. Then right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Remove account</em>. Read the warning before proceeding.</p>

            The only tool we have to help with diagnosing an error is the error message. Did you set up&nbsp;an account as I suggested? What was the error message when you tried to send a test message to yourself?

            <blockquote>
<p>It worked fine, but that was setting it up as an IMAP Account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>IMAP is usually preferable to POP3; you can synchronize the contents of all your folders (including sent messages) between client and server. POP3 is a one-way system only allowing for download from the inbox. The page I referred to also has the POP3 settings
 if that's what you really want. If your folders are synchronized, you would see the same contents on any device (e.g. a smart phone or tablet) configured also to access the account via IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I was also afraid that if I cancelled my old Account, I would lose all my older emails; is that so?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're not talking about cancelling anything. If you remove an account from Windows Live Mail, you&nbsp;will no longer be able to send or receive messages with that account and all&nbsp;its folders and their contents will be permanently deleted. That's why I advised
 you to <em>move any messages in any of its folders to user-created folders under Storage folders before removing it.
</em>Removing&nbsp;an account from Windows Live Mail has no effect on the account folders at the server.</p>

    <title>Windows 10_Memory Management - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wyotea  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10_Memory Management</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft forum,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me get right down to business. I am in DESPARATE need of help so I will start from the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks back my brother and I decided to build our own computer. We went to frys electronics picking out all of the necessary components, and chose Windows 10 as our operating system.(I know that isn't the best idea) So everything is going good so far.
 We go home, assemble the computer using instructions/ a detailed tutorial, and everything seems to be going fine. However, the next day, we attempt to install Windows 10 via disk drive. So, we boot from disk drive and are then met with a Windows logo. This
 is a loading screen. We wait. Finally after a few minutes, we are met with a little loading circle, and then an abrupt blue screen. This screen says there was an error and to look it up under memory_Management. &nbsp;It then reboots the conputer and repeats the
 process. I have spent hundreds on Windows 10 and don't want to wrongly buy another operating system.</p>
<p>Pls Help</p>
<p>-Wyotea</p>

            I believe the software is compatible with the capabilities of the computer. After all I bought strong things with the assistance of an employee. He would have most likely not sold me Windows 10 if I couldn't use it. However, I will check when I can. Any
 suggestions?

<p>
</p><p>Please check if the computer meets minimum system requirements to install Windows 10 or not and keep us updated about the status of the&nbsp;issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally you may also create a new installation media and check if you can install Windows 10. This is to make sure that the installation media is not corrupted.

    <title>Windows XP &#43; HP Photosmart 7960 &#43; Dell Dimension - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greythings8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP &#43; HP Photosmart 7960 &#43; Dell Dimension 4600&#61;&#63;</h2>
                    I am at my wits end. I recently acquired a&nbsp;second hand&nbsp;<strong>Dell Dimension 4600</strong> in good condition. At the same time I acquired an
<strong>HP Photosmart 7960</strong>. My OS is <strong>Windows XP</strong>. The problem: I can't install the printer. The printer works fine, it just doesn't seem to want to work on the PC. I went to the HP chat. We tried everything, twice. They suggested the
 problem wasn't the printer but the PC. The Photosmart is listed as compatible with Win XP. When I try to use the Add Wizard and print a test page, page fails to print. When I try to download installation software from the HP website, it makes it to step 3
 before I run into this roadblock: <strong>"Invalid command line argument. Consult the Windows Installer SDK for detailed command line help."</strong> I've exhausted the HP option. I was on HP chat for two days trying to fix this, so you can see how desperate
 I am. I have two good pieces of equipment that just won't talk to each other. I don't want to send a perfectly good printer to the junkyard. Something, somewhere is keeping these two apart. Help!

            I read an article on <a href="http://www.out-of-warranty.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.out-of-warranty.com</a> about uninstalling old programs. It caused me to wonder. My PC is second hand; it still has a lot of stuff. There are some old HP programs. Could they be interfering
 with the installation? BTW, I forgot to mention, the Photosmart is second hand and had no installation disc, so I'm trying to install from the HP website.

            If you purchased a 2nd hand PC I trust you have all the Dell recovery / installation disks, assuming you do it would be wise to use the Dell cd's to recover to factory supplied condition, then connect to the internet and install Win critical updates
<strong>only. </strong>Then visit Dell support site sepecific to your Tag# and install any critiacle Dell driver updates.<br />
Only after all this should you think about installing any printer or software <br />
PS The usual method of installing a printer is to first install the printer software and only connect the printer when the installation asks.<br />

            I've got an HP 7960, and you're a lucky man to have one too.&nbsp; They're great printers.&nbsp; I've had this thing probably 7 years or so, and it prints awesome photos, great speed on black text, and I've got the duplexer option on mine so that I can print double
 sided.&nbsp; The MS slot on the card reader is a little flaky from being used too much, but that's fine because I don't have a camera with MS anymore.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've used this printer under Windows XP, Vista, 7, Ubuntu, and OS X.&nbsp; It works great with all of them.<br />
<br />
The drivers for XP 32 bit are available at:&nbsp; <a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=ps-18223-2&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;os=228&amp;product=305383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
The previous advice is good, though.&nbsp; Wipe out the machine, do a clean install of the OS.&nbsp; Install Dell drivers.&nbsp; Then download and install HP drivers.&nbsp; Don't plug in the printer until the installer says "Plug in the printer".&nbsp; If you plug in the printer before
 the installer tells you then you'll have problems.

<br />
The PC and the printer didn't come with installation discs. I've been trying to install online. Installation procedures were followed, (as mentioned, everything was tried twice). I kind of find it interesting. I circulated my problem around various forums&nbsp;and
 the installation procedure came up quite often. I saved the transcripts of my talk with HP; I would post them online if they weren't so long, but the information could give people a way to narrow down my problem.<br />

            There is a manual way to perform an uninstall of all HP related drivers and software, and then you could begin the installation again.&nbsp; I don't have the details, but I've done it before with another HP printer.&nbsp; Really, though, doing a clean install of
 Windows is going to be best.&nbsp; Does the system have a restore partition on the hard drive?

<p><span><span>This is the advice I got from various forums where I posted my Photosmart 7960 trouble. They all sound like good ideas but, before I proceed, I thought it would be interesting
 to post the replies together on the different forums; maybe see what people think after reading.

<p><span><span>Greythings8,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try doing the

 Hopefully the person you got the computer from transferred it to your name. After the transfer, if you live in the United Stated, you can then request a backup set of disks by clicking below my signature.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I was hoping, if needed, to repair Windows Xp uning the disk. Desktops are a little harder to get the usb ports working when they malfunction. I feel this could be part
 of the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You could try disconnecting the printer, uninstall the printer at start, control panel, add/remove programs, then restart your computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Right click start, left click explore and look for a programs files folder. Look for the HP printer folder. If it's there, then delete it. Also make sure the printer is
 removed. </span><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/wikis/printers/manual-printer-driver-removal.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>Manual Printer Driver Removal</span></span></span></span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Then try installing the printer drivers. You'll get a message the printer is not connected. Connect the printer at this time.(powered on)</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>What version of Internet Explorer do you have installed. I just remembered I had some problems with my Hp camera software and certain versions of Internet Explorer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open Internet Explorer, click on help, about. Post back the version you have here.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Are you ready to experiment? I hope we can do this, since it's IE8.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Try going to start, control panel, add/remove programs, show updates.
 Now uninstall Internet Explorer 8. You'll get a prompt, these programs were installed and might not work properly. Click ok and follow the instructions. When the computer restarts, you should have IE7 back.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Restart your computer a second time for safety measures.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Now go to control panel, add/remove programs, show updates. Uninstall
 Internet Explorer 7. You'll get the same message, these programs were installed and might not work properly. Click ok and follow and follow the instructions. When the computer restarts, you should have IE6 back, if everything works correctly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>I had IE6 installed. When I went from IE6 to IE7, my HP camera software,
 phone software and a few other programs stopped working. I uninstalled IE7 and went back to IE6 and everything started working again. My suspicions are that IE7 and IE8 are causing the HP issues.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Rick</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>If you cannot uninstall IE7 and go back to IE6, when you get the
 backup set of disks, when you repair Windows XP, IE6 will be there.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Windows Forums</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you purchased a 2nd hand PC I trust you have all the Dell recovery / installation disks, assuming you do it would be wise to use the Dell cd's to recover to factory supplied
 condition, then connect to the internet and install Win critical updates <strong>
only. </strong>Then visit Dell support site sepecific to your Tag# and install any critiacle Dell driver updates.<br />
Only after all this should you think about installing any printer or software <br />
PS The usual method of installing a printer is to first install the printer software and only connect the printer when the installation asks.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I've got an HP 7960, and you're a lucky man to have one too. They're great printers. I've had this thing probably 7 years or so, and it prints awesome photos, great speed
 on black text, and I've got the duplexer option on mine so that I can print double sided. The MS slot on the card reader is a little flaky from being used too much, but that's fine because I don't have a camera with MS anymore.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've used this printer under Windows XP, </span><span>Vista</span></span><span><span>, 7, Ubuntu, and OS X. It works great with all of them.<br />
<br />
The drivers for XP 32 bit are available at: http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=ps-18223-2&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;os=228&amp;product=305383
<br />
<br />
The previous advice is good, though. Wipe out the machine, do a clean install of the OS. Install Dell drivers. Then download and install HP drivers. Don't plug in the printer until the installer says "Plug in the printer". If you plug in the printer before
 the installer tells you then you'll have problems. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>hello
<br />
have you checked you device manager for error codes "a red x" or" yellow !"<br />
to go to the device manager and check for errors an trouble shoot see here </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310560/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310560/</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Windows Lounge</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Knowing that this is a older machine w/WinXP. If it is using a older version of the Microsoft Installer, it may not have the necessary switches (within the installer program)
 to work with the HP install software. You may try this link to install the latest Windows Installer version. Install it and retry the HP Install , and see if that makes a difference.<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942288<br />
Also, knowing HP USB printer installs, do not plug the usb cable into the computer until the software installation tells you to do so. If you do so, then XP will try to load generic usb controls for it and it will usually not work correctly. Now if this has
 been done you will have to remove any traces of this printer from XP before you retry the install. Just make sure there is no printers installed before you retry it.<br />
Then , you might want to head to the Windows Update site to get all the latest patches for the machine, Even with SP3 installed there are quit a few of them to download/install. Plus your probably going<br />
to need the .net framework installed at some point in time, as alot of software is currently being written with that pre-requisite.

<span>[You are now chatting with Randy .]</span><br />
<strong><span>Randy : Welcome to HP Total Care Chat Support. My name is Randy. Please give me a minute while I review the issue description.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : give me threee minutes while I read the previous chat session
</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : Antonio there are other fpour chat session also,I am reading all one by one so that we will not repeat teh steps which are done,</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : Antonio I am esclating this chat to my supervisor so that he can help you because as I have seen all the chat session I found that all the steps have already being performed.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>Every time I try to install hp_53_enu, it gets to the third step before the roadblock: "Invalid command line argument. Consult Windows Installer SDK for detailed command line help." There are currently no printers installed now.
 Photosmart 7960 should work, it's listed as compatible. There's no reason why it shouldn't work. Somewhere, there is something keeping my PC and printer from talking.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : Antonio Before we go ahead just let em know how may printer icons are there in the printer and faxes window right now.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : many8</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : many*</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>There are currently no printer icons in the window.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : Antonio I am esclating this chat to my supervisor he will interact with you shortly.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : Antonio mu supervisor suggested me two one more step.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>Alright.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : Antonio click on start--&gt;Ru.In teh run box type services.msc and hit enter.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : In the services window under the Name look for the option Windows Installer.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : Let me know the status of the Windows Installer.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : When you will select Windows installer then AT TEH LEFT SIDE OF THAT WINDOW there will be option either START or STOP</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>There's nothing listed under its status.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : Sorry for the typological error.At the left side of the window do you get the option START or STOP</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>It says if this service is disabled, any services that explicity depend on it will fail to start. I'm feeling a shiver.<br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>I get the option to start. I'm afraid I'm actually feeling hope.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : click on start option </span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : then there the status will show started.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>Status is listed as started.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : perfect.<br />
<br />
</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : Now we will be able to install the driver.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>I'm getting nervous.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : Let us go ahead and disconnect the printer from teh system</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : there is no need to worry.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>Printer is disconnected.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : </span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=ps-18223-2&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;os=228&amp;product=305383</span></span><br />
<strong><span>Randy : click on the above link.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>Clicked. <br />
<strong><span>Randy : Then click on Download Only option</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : and then click on save </span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : and select the location Desktop to save teh file</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : is the file downloaded?</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>Saved to the Desktop and file<br />
<strong><span>Randy : Now double click on teh downloaded file and then click on Run</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : And follow the online screen instructions and when the message prompts to plug in the USB cale then connect the printer to teh system.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : the*</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : What is the status of the installation?</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>On the third step.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : ok.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>It's happened again. I'm getting the sledgehammer.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : Antonio I am esclating this chat to my supervisor</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>I still have services open. Windows Installer has two options: Stop the service or Restart the service. Maybe press restart even though the status says started? Or do I have to restart the PC in order for Windows Installer to
 activate? I just can't believe this.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : no need to restart the system now,my supervisor will interact with you shortly.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>What is a command line function? Why is my computer listing it as invalid?<br />
<strong><span>Randy : It is a batch file.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>And a batch file is...?<br />
<strong><span>Randy : The Windows command line is a mainstay for systems administrators and power ... knew)</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Randy : a batch file is a text file containing a series of commands intended to be executed by the command ...<br />
</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>Well somewhere along the way some command is being disobeyed.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : Yes it seems to be.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>So how does one pinpoint the insubordinate command so that it can be court marshalled.<br />
<strong><span>Randy : Antonio now my supervisor is going to interact with you</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>Thanks.<br />
<strong><span>Alex : Hello,this is Alex the supervisor on teh floor.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>Hello. This is a very frustrated guy.<br />
<strong><span>Alex : Antonio I can understand your frustation.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Alex : This is the issue with the operating system,so I would suggest you to contact your system manufacturer.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Alex : As it does not allow the driver to get installed.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>So do I contact Dell for the PC or Microsoft for the Win XP or another branch of HP?<br />
<strong><span>Alex : Antonio, Microsoft is a paid support. However Dell the computer manufacturer has expertise on Operating system. Hence I would suggest you to contact Dell as of now.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Alex : They would be able to fix this for you as this is an Operating system issue.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Alex : Is there anything else I can help you with?</span></strong><br />
<strong>Antonio Gray : </strong>Thanks. Do they have a chat section?<br />

<h2>            Any difference between this 2 types of Windows installation&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I usually install Windows 7 or 8 &nbsp;with DVD. (booting)
<div>but, when I realized that I can just directly install Windows 7 or 8 from my hard drive (I have 2 dosks: C and D. &nbsp;of course I run installation from D disk because C is system)</div>
<div>just run the installer and it works fine, so I don't need DVD disc anymore. of course after direct installation I delete the "old windows" folder with disk cleanup.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I have a question. &nbsp;Is there any difference between this&nbsp;2 types of Windows installation? I delete the old windows, but does that installation still leave some unnessesery files?</div>
<div>Which type is better?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thanks</div>

            Hi
<div>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When you use DVD media, you can perform clean Windows installation, more peacefully. Of course, upgrade is also possible. But when you install using hard drive, clean installation may not be possible in some cases. Upgrade is possible in all cases. Since
 you chose C:\ drive as installation location, and did not format it, windows.old folder has been created. Deleting the folder won't affect Windows working/performance in any way. No other settings/files are left by the installation, other than the files in
 folders with .old suffix in C:\ (root) directory.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Installation using DVD or USB media is better than running from hard drive.</div>

            <p>Well, you could always copy the install files to D:\ and run setup from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running setup from local disk vs media (USB or DVD) is not that different. Running from local disk of course will be much faster since it is reading directly from the hard disk. To install from a USB thumb drive, download the Windows 8 Web Setup and create
 your own:</p>

9.Start up your msconfig.exe file. (to do this press the windows key and R. Type msconfig).<br />
10.Go to the "Services" tab and select "Disable All" then click on "OK".<br />
11.You will receive a prompt to reboot your computer. Go ahead and do so.<br />
12.Once rebooted in normal mode, verify that the issue is no longer present.<br />
13.If the problem is gone then it's just a process of elimination from here. Start up your msconfig.exe again and start bringing up services a few at a time.
<br />
14.I am not sure if it will be the same for you, but if you want to try, you can turn on all services except the two that were causing the problem for me.

<h2>            Surface Detach Hardware Failure Message, but everything works fine</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting a "Surface Detach: Hardware Failure" message on my Surface Book 2, which says "General Failure: Please click here to troubleshoot" when I click the message. If I click the "click here" it takes me to a page that recommends I clean the three connectors
 with alcohol, which I did and still receive the error. Everything works fine as I can click the detach icon to disconnect and connect back, the graphic card in the keyboard works fine, and the keyboard and mouse pad work fine; everything seems to work as expected,
 so it's just a message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only cleaned the connectors at the keyboard, so I didn't clean the slits in the surface, since I figured those shouldn't get wet. Should I clean those as well?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Possible to switch back to Win7 from Win10 &#40;after 30 days&#41; or permanently disable Cortana and Edge&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My home computer automatically updated to win10 (many months ago)&amp; I absolutely hate it! Not because of the changes so much, it just&nbsp;makes my computer so slow or &amp;/or it will&nbsp;freeze up. My computer is about 6 years old, it was a&nbsp;win 7, 1TB, it&nbsp;ran fine before
 the "win10 upgrade". </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see from the task manager that Cortana and Microsoft Edge are taking up alot of memory, especially because I don't use them.
</p>
<p>I have disabled the xbox-bs (&amp;&nbsp;I think some of the other bloatware) but every time I try to disable Cortana it restarts...Instantly!!! I don't think I can disable Microsoft edge... Can I? Can either of these be disabled permanently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything that I have read online says that I'm stuck with win10, after 30 days... So, can I at least
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>permanently disable</strong></em></span> the things I don't use, didn't ask for or want?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Cortana</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Microsft Edge</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I would rather go back to win 7, it was the original operating system. If anyone knows how to do that - I would be forever grateful.&nbsp;I did do a back up about a month before the windows 10 update magically appeared. I haven't done one since.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In a perfect world I (the customer)&nbsp;should get what I&nbsp;paid for and not what Microsoft (apparently God)&nbsp;tells me they think it's time to have because they (Microsoft)&nbsp;are getting paid commission (or whatever they call it) from filpboard, groove music, iheart
 radio, xbox, and whatever else came preinstalled with the "win 10 upgrade".&nbsp;This upgrade should be optional, period. (Sorry, but I'm mad!) So mad, I just bought a MacBook (instead of a windows&nbsp;laptop as planned)&nbsp;and I have transferred (by email) some important
 docs. I still need this pc to operate better (faster, consistently) so I have more time to thoroughly go through it and get everything I need from it. I have decided all future purchases will be Mac's. (Not that anyone cares.. this is just how pissed I am)
 however this doesn't help me now... I don't know if anyone else feels my pain and I'm sorry this got so long but any help would really be appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thank you ,</p>

<p>Hi Alan, I hope you have found answers but if not I think this will help, taken from another page like this where 'Stephanie' shared:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, I figured out what my problem was. Thought I would post here in case it helps anyone else.</p>
<p>I had recently changed my password because my account had been hacked. I had also set up two-step authentification in order to make any changes to my account in the future. Apparently this process applies to everywhere you sign in to your account so any
 apps that can't confirm the two step process password will time out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read about it here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/app-passwords-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">App Passwords &amp; Two-Step Verification</a></p>
<p>www.windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/app-passwords-two-step-verification</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to make separate passwords for each of my email account that I had set up two-step verification for, using the password generator on my account settings. Voila, I can check my email again!</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow! Thanks Stephanie, it sure helped me!!! Although what I did was go to the link you put for the app passwords. I clicked on that link and it gave me a password to use for apps... I was thinking well, I don't have any apps except the livemail account that
 I haven't been able to get emails from. So I copied the password and right clicked that email account and went to properties and put that in as my password.</p>
<p>Walla, now I have 46 emails to finally read and an account I can use once again! Thanks so much!!!</p>
<p>Blessings to you, Lisa&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps as I've noticed they have just ignored your later requests for help.</p>

                    <p>While on my computer that runs Windows 10, it'll randomly black screen and restart. When it boots back up and I log in it has reset all my desktop icons. It's done it twice now and having to go through and sort all my icons again is getting extremely frustrating.
 I own an iBUYPOWER computer and can provide specs if needed.</p>

    <title>Wind7 Not Communicating with Lexmark Printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> classicgma65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wind7 Not Communicating with Lexmark Printer</h2>
                    <p>Have hp with Win7 Home Premium and Lexmark Intuition S505 printer, set up wireless.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Before you ask, here's everything that's happened over last week and a half, possibly including something(s) that have no effect on printer, but want to be thorough:</p>
<p>1- Critical update by Microsoft to IE11 from IE9...I uninstalled.</p>
<p>2- Critical updates injcluded install of IE11 - second time, including Bing and friends...Strange, I couldn't uninstall, had to do a System Restore back two days to get rid of it.&nbsp; Also changed to get notice of all Microsoft updates, not auto.&nbsp; This shoulkd
 not have cut the connection to the printer (?).</p>
<p>3- Had trouble with script errors, secure display bsnner, and opeing message on desktop that couldn't find a file...came to MC and got help from PA Bear MS MVP just last week.&nbsp; All cleared up, but necessitated restore...and some prayers on my part that could
 follow his steps....tech-challenged is not an exaggeration when describing me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#3 is where I think the connection got severed no the WiFi to my printer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried both Troubleshooters - computer, Couldn't identify the problem.</p>
<p>First Troubleshooter on printer said "Printer Lexmark S500 Series (network) is not shared with the homegroup."&nbsp; I clicked Fix it...no error message came back ao I thought is was fixed.&nbsp; Still won't print anything.</p>
<p>Did a second Troubleshooter for the printer.&nbsp; Now, same Couldn't identify the problem.&nbsp; My printer is selected as Default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When going to print page, I get the Print Window with the options to aselect.&nbsp; Click on that, takes extra seconds but do get banner at bottom right of desktop, along with printer icon...then nothing.&nbsp; I have waited as long as 5 minutes...nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes,
 the WiFi is green.&nbsp; Someone else set it up wireless, was that cut off?</p>
<p>I know, too much info, but I have found this saves time, and you can pick out the needed info...hopefuly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Update:&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Did a reinstall on printer, new driver, and it's connected to my network.&nbsp; Can't download firmware updates, as still no talking to computer.&nbsp; Got message:</p>
<p>"Communication with your printer is currently unavailable.&nbsp; Communication is required to update firmware.&nbsp; Make sure the printer is online and communicating."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have exhausted my limited knowledge as to what next.</p>
<p>ClassicGma</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1:43 PM CST.</p>
<p>Just found out there's a problem with Microsoft update(s) that stops printer and computer communications.&nbsp; Followed theri instructions, but still no printing, even though shows Status: Printing.</p>
<p>Please, someone at Microsoft should know what to do here.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Hi Basith,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just wanted to say thank you for the help.&nbsp; Also to let you know there's a bigger problem with my computer and I think this is just a smaller consequence of some things I did wrong.</p>
<p>I'll be trying Method 2 and checking those articles you listed, in hopes they will get the printer working even for a short period so I can print out instructions for fixing my mess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The time you took to read and rely to my problem is much appreciated.&nbsp; Hope you have a wonderful holiday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, thanks,</p>
<p>ClassicGGma</p>

            <p>Hello Basith M,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to have taken so long to get back to you, between holidays and other computer problems was delayed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I took my printer off wireless and it's now hooked up by USB cable.&nbsp;&nbsp; When tried to&nbsp;print test page the Print Screen showed "Printer: Ready"&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now getting different&nbsp;message:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Communication Not Available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Printer can not communicate with computer."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Went to Lexmark Getting Started Guide I got with printer - to Troubleshooting.&nbsp; It said when getting message like this to go to Start, Run,&nbsp;printer controls, Properties...then click the Ports Tab - there's no Ports tab on my printer Properties.&nbsp; There's
 two separate instructions saying to go to this tab, but no tab.&nbsp; Have any ideas what nest??&nbsp; Note: General or Hardware Tab says "Device is working properly."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forgot - On your Method 2, sharing box was already checked.&nbsp;&nbsp;Haven't tried&nbsp;Method 1 yet&nbsp;since been having problems with my Security...made a change.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will try it and get back to you, but don't think that's the problem.&nbsp; Just turned off Firewall and tried
 tp print...nothing.&nbsp; Am still getting icon on Taskbar, then get the above message.&nbsp; Sounds like my commputer wants to do spmething, but my printer gets nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gma</p>

<h2>            Xbox refund status - no product or money</h2>
                    <p>Xbox refund status - no product or money&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>500$ + tax was spent on my xbox kn vbucks. I teport the situation to xbox support abiut the money being gone and no product. I sent in video proof. I do have autism so im kinda slow we the right responses. Ive had 14 cases because everytime they deny the
 case support had me open another one. I also reply to refund team email and they refuse to respond back.
</p>
<p>If i dont have the money I at least should have the product. I have no money on account or product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no access to talk to refund team other than email yet they dont respond after the denial. I cant chargeback Bank because used xbox cards from birthday. I dont understand this. They have all the proof of everything they need so they just respond
 with not eligible for refund and stop responding. Ok fine then give me the product purchased.&nbsp;</p>

            With Vbucks like this MS has no way to see if you received the items or not this would be handled by the publisher of the game you would need to contact the publisher of the game to find out about getting your Vbucks.

            I have tried &nbsp;this and epic stats this is microsoft responsibilty. It is aslso stated on epic site to contact apple sony or microsoft for problems with ingame purchases. Serveral microsoft reps i have spoken with have also said that is microsoft responsibilty
 as they can see they were purchased but not in game. The problem is i have autism im nit very smart and kinda slow. Filling out everything and epic and microsoft playing the &nbsp;blame game is to much for me. Microsoft website also stats if refund vbucks they
 will just take whatever epic will remove items purchased with vbucks. In my case nothing. I dont even have the vbucks and better proof have never even purchased a skin. So can tell i didnt use them or get them.

<p>Its kind of rediculous to ... like if i cant get a refund thats fine ... but id atleast like the actual product. At this point if feels like straight stealing. If i dont have a product i should get money. If i dont have money i shiuld get product. This is
 a a crime. Im thinking i may need to reach out to autism advacates for help. If maybe it got attention that they wont even respond with a legit reason why they are keeping both product and money from me i coukd have a story. I bet the would respond if news
 picked up story a major corporation ripping off the mentally handicapped. Bet they would respond then.
</p>
<p>

 achievements from apps? Just curious...</strong></span></p>

<p>I don't care for them much either. They don't give you score, and as LK said, they promote bad habits (e.g., watch 100 hours of TV/movies). The ONLY non-game achievement I ever cared for was 1 that had to do with that Soccer United app, and I only liked
 it because I thought the image associated with it would make a great background. Unbeknownst to me at the time of unlocking it, I quickly learned that apparently non-game achievements can't be used as backgrounds - this means they truly are worthless through
 and through. :(</p>

<p>Seeing as how they don't count towards GS, no, they are completely useless. I'm OK with 'prestigious' no-score achievements (although the only one that jumps to mind is the Day 1 achievement), otherwise I see absolutely no point in giving them to apps.</p>
<p>More devils advocate than anything else, but to those saying that these app achievements promote negative behaviour/habits, how so?</p>

<p>^Well if the description wants you to watch TV for x amount of hours, maybe that's encouraging people to sit for unhealthy periods of time, though you could make the same argument for normal achievements IMO.</p>
<p>I personally forgot they had achievements for the apps as I just don't use my Xbox One for that.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I know what they wanted but think people must be stupid. For years Achievement chasers want Achievements and Gamescore for stuff other then Games. Those people wanted the Gamescore as an inflation. MS jus figured those people

<p>I got one yesterday for using the Amazon app. An achievement for using an app. Talk about reducing the value of what used to be a cool feature. They should call Webster's and inform them that the definition of "achievement" has been changed to "badge of
 a frivolous action taken".</p>

            Hi Michael, a common enough problem, it will require a registry fix . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter - this will open the Registry Editor 
<br />
<br />In the left pand, navigate to: 
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE - SYSTEM - CurrentControlSet - Control 
<br />
<br />Then in the Right Pane double click WaitToKillServiceTimeout and change the value to 1000 
<br />
<br />Click OK 
<br />
<br />Then back in the left Pane, close up all those folders (keys) again (click in the left pane and press left arrow on your keyboard a few times) 
<br />
<br />In the left pand, navigate to: 
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER - Control Panel - Desktop 
<br />
<br />Then in the right pane, right click in the blank space and choose New - String Value 
<br />
<br />Name the String Value WaitToKillServiceTimeout 
<br />
<br />Then double click WaitToKillServiceTimeout 
<br />
<br />Set its value to 1000 
<br />
<br />Save and close the Registry Editor 
<br />
<br />That's It!

            Hi Michael,
<br />
<br />What that means is:
<br />
<br />Once you click on the Desktop folder (key) on the left hand pane
<br />
<br />On the right hand pane, right click and from the context menu, choose New - String Value
<br />
<br />By default that new will be named: New Valeu #1 - you must change this name!
<br />
<br />Name the String Value WaitToKillServiceTimeout 
<br />
<br />Then double click the value WaitToKillServiceTimeout 
<br />
<br />In the resulting dialog box, set its value to 1000 
<br />
<br />Save and close the Registry Editor 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC

    <title>Windows 1803 update - Intermittent wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> summerpearson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 1803 update - Intermittent wifi</h2>
                    <p>I updated to 1803 recently and having issues where after browsing the internet for a while I get DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET error. At first I thought it was something wrong with my wifi. However the wifi icon on task bar never indicates that it has disconnected
 and other devices like phone work perfectly fine. I've used both Chrome and Edge and the connection error seems to come up after a random time of use. I can run Windows Network Diagnostic and usually it fixes it until I use the internet for a bit more after
 which I get the error again. Also, If I wait a couple of minutes after I get the error the connection will eventually come back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've done to try fix the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've updated my laptop's wifi network drivers</li><li>Ran WIndows Network Diagnostic</li><li>Reset my wifi router</li><li>Ran Windows Defender and Scanned my whole system</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

            First you should run Internet Connections / Network / Hardware &amp; devices Troubleshooter and then execute Microsoft recommended troubleshooting steps. Update me once done.
<br />
<br />Skip the steps which you have already attempted.
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections / Network / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooters
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt;
<br />1. Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />2. Click Network adapters &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />3. Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there

            Hi Summer.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try updating the Network adapter driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help  ry Uninstall, restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I'd also check at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates if there were WIndows Updates installed before this problem started.  You can uninstall them from the link there to see if the problem goes away.  If so you can hide the Updates using the same tool above.  
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>This is a really odd problem since the loss in internet connection isn't constant. I have to wait around browsing the web for a bit before I get the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried troubleshooting the internet connection when I got the usual error and it said:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems found:</p>
<p>The DNS server isn't responding&nbsp; - detected - yellow exclamation mark</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to add, all other devices that are running on wifi work fine and don't get connection problems. Also wifi icon in task bar shows on as normal while I have this browser telling me there's an error in connection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. I did this and there were no issues found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guided Walk through - I did the first 3 steps and realised that these were a bunch of general troubleshooting techniques. I haven't tried all of these yet, hopefully I can find a solution that is more specific to my problem. If not I'll try do all of these
 when I get the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. "Run SFC Scan &amp; DISM"</p>
<p>Did this and everything was clear. Received notice "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations." upon completion of scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>The really strange thing is, I tend to have 6+ tabs open at any one time. I could have twitch stream open with it playing in the background while at the same time using a forum. Then randomly all of a sudden the connection issue happens on the tab I have
 the forum open, but the stream I have on twitch is still running. This isn't isolated to a forum page, I could be on steam homepage or GoG.com page or reddit, so I don't think its website dependant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems strange to me how a twitch stream can continue while my connection disrupts on another tab.</p>

<p>I tried this. I didn't experience any issues for a day after doing it (could just be that I didn't use the internet enough), however the next day (today) the problem still arises.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just annoying issue as the connection goes then comes back within 5 minutes, while all the time the wifi icon remains like nothing has happened: In this screenshot i'm pressing refresh and this is what I get&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/Y9SyIbz.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/Y9SyIbz.png</a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/682b1067-4184-4130-84a7-007bb9c6a9c8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/682b1067-4184-4130-84a7-007bb9c6a9c8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I noticed that I could have several tabs open in browser with twitch streaming uninterrupted in one tab whilst the connection goes out on another tab where i'm browsing steam storepage or reddit or gog.com. I've used chrome and edge and same issue.</p>

            I would recommend that you should consider rolling back 1803 to 1709 and defer it from happening as there seem to be issues. Try to install this after a month or two when more cum packs are released stabilizing 1803 further. (Roll back can be done only if you were upgraded during last 10 days i.e. you are within 10 days roll back window)
<br />
<br />Roll Back - Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; Under Go back to previous version of Windows 10, Get Started &gt; Follow onscreen directions

            Alright. Since I couldn't fix the issue I went back to 1709 and having been browsing the internet for 3-4 hours without any issues. Just to clarify the problem wasn't fixed, I had to revert back to old windows version. Hopefully it gets fixed in future
 update.

<p>The problem is that I cannot use them because the cable output of the headphone is usb and I can't find a way to configure them in order to play. Whenever I connect them to the console, they appear to be on, but there's no sound at all. I want to know if
 I must buy an adapter or do something else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes there are 'USB to 3.5mm Audio cables' available to purchase online. This will sort out the problem you're having. Here is an example of one: &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/p/Car-Mp3-Male-AUX-Audio-Plug-Jack-to-USB-2-0-Female-Converter-Cable-Cord-L6l7/1049410378?iid=332261863649&amp;chn=ps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ebay.co.uk/p/Car-Mp3-Male-AUX-Audio-Plug-Jack-to-USB-2-0-Female-Converter-Cable-Cord-L6l7/1049410378?iid=332261863649&amp;chn=ps</a></p>

<p>Hello Dark zombie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. The Xbox one doesn't support mics that do not connect via 3.5mm plugs. Did the headset come with any extra accessories or adapters? I was able to find a razer kraken headset online that comes with the adapter,
 but it may not be the exact same model you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information on setting up stereo headsets on Xbox one, check out this link :
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/stereo-headset-set-up-troubleshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set up and troubleshoot your Xbox One Stereo Headset</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This link goes over the steps for the Xbox one official headset. When it comes to third party headsets, you may have better luck going to the manufacturer for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
        </p>
