            Go in the BIOS and clear the message.&nbsp; This is simply a message telling you that the computer case has been opened, in high security environments this would be a cause for concern, it could mean that someone might have stolen data or changed something
 inside the computer.<br />

            <p>Here is what worked for me on XPSP3. This was running as a Virtual PC under Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the folder C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VSTA see if you have a folder called AppInfoDocument.
<br />
If not, add it as an empty folder. Try the install again. </p>

    <title>USB 2.0 PCI Hub with Windows 2000 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edmcb8  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB 2.0 PCI Hub with Windows 2000</h2>
                    In a computer running W2K with SP4, I have tried many methods and drivers to get this hub working. The current driver version, via Hardware / Device Manager is Microsoft 19/06/2003 V.5.0.2195.6717.<br />
<br />
The Hub is recognised, but as soon as I plug any device into it such as external USB 2.0 hard drive or a mouse the computer goes haywire. The My Computer window takes forever to scan the computer and I cannot access the USB drive. If I use Internet Explorer,
 the mouse plugged into a USB 1.1 connector becomes erratic.<br />
<br />
The Safely Remove Hardware allows me to remove the USB&nbsp;drive and the computer returns to normal.<br />
<br />
I searched Knowledge Base but the method&nbsp;I found was incorrect and didn't help.<br />
<br />
Note that the external USB drive works well in the internal USB 1.1 hub that I have also fitted. Removing this hub makes no difference to the USB 2.0 problem.<br />
<br />
The PCI hub is from PC World with the make of PC Line and uses a VIA VT6212L chip. I have contacted PC World but their advice did not help.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatfully received so that I can use the USB 2.0 speed instead of USB 1.1.<br />
(Was only able to post this to Windows Vista forum category - sorry)

    <title>Homegroup file sharing problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jhatcher55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Homegroup file sharing problems</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a private network using Homegroup. There are 4 computers, all running Windows 10. All configured properly. One I call Server with 4 drives and several shared folders. The others are a desktop
 and 2 laptops.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Everyone can access files on the server. The server can access files on others. However none of the others can share files with anyone but the server. On the public folders it does nothing and if
 I do properties I get "The properties for this item are unavailable". On shared folders I get a "Location is not available" red X error and a drive letter from the shared computer instead of the network path in the unavailable message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried all troubleshooting choices and remove / setup agains. Please don't suggest a basic how to or running a troubleshooter. Been there repetitively and I have been Homegroup networking for
 years. Finally really want some peer to peer sharing instead of "everything through one server".</span></p>

            <p><span>Thanks for a reply. I had scoured that site and did so again. Left the same question but no reply. It seems to be a lot of Win 7 and 8 and no 10. It is probably the same bug but ...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have since tried to totally get rid of Homegroups. Even that is a ridiculous pain. I rebuilt with the same problem. Backed out and went again with just a Desktop and Laptop, both running Win 10
 Pro. They set up fine but its the same with just them. On the public folders it does nothing and if I do properties I get "The properties for this item are unavailable". On shared folders I get a "Location is not available" red X error and a drive letter from
 the shared computer instead of the network path in the unavailable message. It just doesn't work with Win 10 Pro. It's not trying to use the network path and nothing I try will make it. The server that works with everything is actually Win 10 Home.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I await a reply from them but I am at a loss and you at least replied. This is WAY to hard and I am wasting a LOT of time.</span></p>

            <p>I've totally rebuilt the Homegroup with a different password only to get the same thing. I can't make it work and I'm a software design engineer with too much experience. I went to the site and gave lots of detail. There is obviously some legacy Homegroup
 settings that are getting carried over from the upgrade from Win 7. It only worked with the server then as well. The problem&nbsp;can't be removed even tearing it down completely and rebuilding. Not there is an easy way to do it. It kept thinking there was already
 a Homegroup, probably on a computer that's long gone. And no one can help. Mr. Happy gave it a try but it needs more of a design guy.</p>
<p>As a design guy, I must say that there REALLY ought to be a way to start afresh. Having no way to get rid of Homegroup ghosts from past installs is beyond ridiculous. No way to remove it and start over ? REALLY ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>One thing that I noticed in your screen shots is that&nbsp;the folder you are wanting to share does not seem to be shared (e.g. the icon is for just a plain folder).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, instead of trying to use the Homegroup feature have you tried just using standard sharing?&nbsp; Maybe you could do that and then switch back the Homegroup method for its ease of use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Standard sharing brings up nightmares of pre-Homegroup XP attempts at networking. Setting up users in workgroups with passwords and permissions. Then having some of them
 work with some of the others if you hold your nose just right. All with no real "how to" anywhere to be had. It was designed for companies with servers and workgroups, and most importantly - IT guys who had the time to make it all work. As best as I can tell
 there is still no "how to" and standard sharing is still an ongoing time waster if you can get it to work. I've wasted a lot time trying to get the easy, modern, and straight forward Homegroup stuff to work. That is what I REALLY want. I will be glad to waste
 some more if you can point me to a "how to" on your "standard sharing". I've been there in the past, tried it, and had limited success. Just plowing into with no real direction seems like a bad plan.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I should stop here since I want someone's help. But there is a frustration factor. Obviously everyone isn't having this problem but I'm no idiot. There is really no way to
 make this stuff work with no way to clean up and start over ! I've been sent to another site that tried but ... They suggested other sites that suggested deleting buried system files and registry edits. Now it's set up standard networking and see if you can
 come back and have the homegroup start working. Better than the decades of no support offered in the past, but for me, still frustrating. But really, thanks for trying. I'll be really nice and gladly check a "problem solved" if it ever is.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I have to admit that I was being a bit glib about that.&nbsp; I am a novice at networking.&nbsp; However, what I think you would notice is that when you try to do it that one of the&nbsp;Share classes is the Homegroup, so I think that when it comes to files and folders
 that are outside the standard set that we still need to indicate that they are shared.&nbsp; Then the&nbsp;difference would be that instead of having to manage a list of sharers you just have to do it with&nbsp;that one class of them.&nbsp; Downloads would be my example but that
 is what I have been sharing mostly and I don't remember exactly how it must have looked before I started to tinker with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can try using my VM to try to test and refine this perception of how files and folders are made visible in a Homegroup scenario.&nbsp; Otherwise unfortunately my other machine is only a Surface RT which does not support Homegroup sharing of its folders, only
 standard sharing, which I have used somewhat tentatively but then I can use the&nbsp; net share&nbsp; command to see that they exist.&nbsp; I'm expecting to see similar when using only&nbsp;Homegroup mechanisms (i.e., with the VM) but maybe not.&nbsp; In any case, the tools for doing
 this seem scattered all through the File Explorer UI, presumably mostly redundantly but who knows?&nbsp; Right-click (Share with &gt;) here, click a (Share) tab there, etc.</p>

<h2>            I&#39;ve owned about 7 xbox one controllers and they&#39;ve all broke in one way or another for no apparent reason.</h2>
                    I called xbox a long time ago when my second or third one stopped working and they told me theres nothing they can do and tried to get me to pay full price for a new one over the phone. Now more have broken one me and I've pretty much givin up all hope
 of ever buying a xbox one controller that lasts more than a few months. Ive owned a bunch of systems and never had to buy as many controllers as I have for my xbox. So much money down the drain. I just want to know if anyone else has had such bad luck with
 their controllers and has Microsoft ever done anything to compensate? Sorry for the rant.

            Unfortunately, if they are not under warranty there is nothing to do but replace them.&nbsp; I have never had any problems with my controllers on the Xbox One.&nbsp; &nbsp;My original one still works and my secondary one is working fine after 4 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>They don't last forever, sadly. Anything mechanical will get worn down through use. My RT is always the first to go, thanks to playing hours of shooters every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still feel like the current roster of official Xbox controllers feel and perform very solidly but if you find yourself having a difficult time with them there are numerous alternative controllers that might suit you better, such as the Razer Wolverine
 and SCUF series. Try some other pads and see if they work better for you!</p>

            Another factor as well is if it has seen any drops, button mashing, or how fast the thumbtack is twiddled. Just be careful with it, and it can suit you a long time. I've been using mine for 5 years plus.&nbsp;

<p>i have had an xbox ons s for over 2 years now, I have only had one controller break and that was my own fault, I had the controller sat on my chair and as i got up it fell about 2 feet onto carpet and unfortunately cracked the circuit board behind one of
 the thumbsticks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 360 controllers would develop stick drift all the time but that was due to use was easily fixable myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately if your control is out of warranty then theres nothing microsoft can do for you in terms of repair/replacement.</p>

            Wow can't believe I'm the only one. I've talked my my friends in person and theyve said they have had problems too tho so idk. And I'm not that hard on controllers I've had my super Nintendo one for as long as I can remember and a couple game cube controllers
 I've had since a kid as well. I guess they just dont make them like they used to, and if i had the money rn I'd buy a scuff cause that xbox brand ones aren't doing it for me. I'm almost appalled I'm the only one on the forum who has had this many problems
 cause it seems like it's so consistent with me. Idk whatever I guess, I'm probably just gonna get an off brand one and see if it lasts any longer.

            Controllers come with a limited 90 day warranty. This issue sounds more like it's related to your play style, Some people just have an aggressive play style. Since its's the same issue over and over that's most likely the case. You may want to try getting
 an Elite controller, They are great and come with a longer warranty.&nbsp;

<p>I own a Xbox One with Day One controller, a Gears of War Special Edition Controller, Elite Controller, a Design Lab controller and about three other "standard" controllers, that I mainly use for visitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even the Day One Xbox One controller still works flawlessly, and I haven't heard of my friends with such a high failure rate on their controllers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One friend complains about the rubber grips on his Elite Controller getting loose, but having observed him playing, this is because he is very tense when playing, and starts to twist his hands like a motorcycle throttle, when the game gets intense.&nbsp;</p>

            If your an ambassador on the forum does that mean u work for microsoft? Or are just higher up cause your on the forums a lot or something? Those are the only people who replied and that kinda leads me to believe your gonna try and make xbox sound good
 no matter what I say my issue is. No i dont abuse my controllers. I never had this many problems with my 360 controllers and these are supposed to be leagues better. I've been using the same original gamecube controller for years to play smash bros and it's
 fine and if any game was gonna make me ruin a controller itd be smash. But I guess my question has been answered. Xbox isn't gonna do anything cause they dont care or think I'm lying, and apparently no has ever had a problem with any xbox controller ever made
 but me from the sounds of everyone's replies. Thanks for your time anyway. Maybe I'll try reddit.

<h2>            Dashboard not loading&#47; endless spinning symbol - solution</h2>
                    
<p>To anyone still having this issue, I have finally found a work around that is easy and works every time. It is not a fix, but I think it's the best were going to get.<br />
<br />
If when you sign in (auto sign-in or manual, it doesn't matter) the dashboard does not load and the spinning symbol just keeps on spinnin', follow these simple steps:<br />
<br />
1. Press silver button to bring up guide menu.<br />
<br />
2. Hold the right trigger and press Y.<br />
<br />
3. That's it, you're done! What it does is refresh/ reload your dashboard.<br />
<br />
Has worked every time for me and for others I know with this problem, so I have no doubts it will work for anyone with this specific issue.<br />
<br />
Why xbox support could not just tell us this months ago I have no idea.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your dashboard.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>it is safe to clear cache on your Xbox 360. That's the process you start by hitting Y when in the guide menu.</p>
<p>If your problem is caused by corrupt update software, it should work.</p>
<p>This solution is on Xbox.com support section as a clearing process, before formating everything on your unit. Remember that once you clear cache, all updates from games and apps will be updated again.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
        </p>

<p>That is not correct SirBruce. This method WILL NOT clear your cache. I have not had to update any games or apps again and I have used this process 20+ times. It has made the dashboard load every time.</p>
<p>If you look at the many threads on this issue, you will see that clearing the content cache has not helped myself or anyone with this specific problem.</p>
<p>I made the initial post to try to help anyone still having the dashboard loading issue. To provide them with a simple, reliable work around I found, rather than keeping the solution to myself. Therefore<strong>, no further posts are necessary.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Basically, if the dashboard will not load:</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Bring up the guide menu,</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">hold RT then press Y.</span></p>
<p>This WILL NOT clear the content cache relating to game and app updates. But it will stop the endlessly spinning circles and load the dashboard.</p>

<p>To anyone still having this issue, I have finally found a work around that is easy and works every time. It is not a fix, but I think it's the best were going to get.<br />
<br />
If when you sign in (auto sign-in or manual, it doesn't matter) the dashboard does not load and the spinning symbol just keeps on spinnin', follow these simple steps:<br />
<br />
1. Press silver button to bring up guide menu.<br />
<br />
2. Hold the right trigger and press Y.<br />
<br />
3. That's it, you're done! What it does is refresh/ reload your dashboard.<br />
<br />
Has worked every time for me and for others I know with this problem, so I have no doubts it will work for anyone with this specific issue.<br />
<br />
Why xbox support could not just tell us this months ago I have no idea.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your dashboard.<br />

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I install Windows 10 Pro on my computer that previously ran the Windows10 Home version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>NOTE: I have completely removed the Home version and I'm using complete new Pro version.&nbsp; I get a message similar to "this computer previously had Home version.&nbsp; You must install Home version".&nbsp; It will not allow me to install the Pro version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have "formatted" the drive prior to attempting this new factory upgrade.&nbsp;
</span>One thing I noticed about Windows and what they call "format the drive":&nbsp; When I studied computer science, I was always taught that "format" meant actually resetting all the existing bits on the bare drive to prepare for new information.&nbsp; As far as I
 can tell, Windows indicates "format" to mean removing the partitions that currently exist from previous programs.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; Do we just forget about doing things properly?&nbsp; Any clarification is greatly appreciated.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Format is slang for Clean Install.  A proper Clean Install clears the hard drive to get it cleanest and remove partition and boot code.  If you do this and properly boot the media (as a UEFI device if offered) then it should offer Pro version as a choice to install.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise you'd go offline in Home version (open Action Center and choose Airplane Mode) and insert the Pro Generic Product Key to change to Pro Version, which you can even do now if you have Home:  <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>

    <title>Chronological list of Windows 10 updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 111xxdd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chronological list of Windows 10 updates</h2>
                    <p>I am planning to reinstall Windows 10 (old version) on my laptop because after I've updated to&nbsp;<span>Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (version 1709), problems have been occurring.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Programs that connect to the internet like Spotify, Chrome, Edge, even Internet Explorer use a huge amount of RAM and CPU in the task manager. Disk&nbsp;usage is also almost always at 100%. Chrome consumes 1 GB of RAM with
 just 3 tabs open.</span></p>
<p><span>Performance is still good since it doesn't lag, but that's only when I try to keep my activity minimum. My laptop also heats up easily now and battery drains faster probably because of the high CPU usage(?).</span></p>
<p><span>These problems never occurred before. I've only tried updating drivers and resetting Windows as fixes but the problem is still there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I just want to ask where could I get a&nbsp;chronological list of Windows 10 updates so that I could just manually install the updates myself up until before the&nbsp;</span><span>Windows 10
 Fall Creators Update.</span><br />
</p>
<p>I couldn't roll back to the previous version before the update because I deleted my system restore point. Yes, I'm an idiot.<br />
</p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>P.S. is there really a problem with the&nbsp;</span><span>Windows 10 Fall Creators Update? I've been searching online and found out that many people have the same problem and unfortunately,
 I couldn't find any fixes. People I know who've updated also have the same problem as mine.</span><br />

<h2>            Xbox won&#39;t connect to wifi without Ethernet cable</h2>
                    <p>Ive had my Xbox for about 18 months and I've had it connected to wifi via Ethernet for most of it. Last month, I moved the Xbox upstairs and therefore needed to switch to a wireless connection. At first, it worked fine. However last week my Xbox suddenly could no longer connect to my wifi. Even when I move it right next to the router it can't connect. I've tried to connect it countless times.&nbsp;However it WILL still connect via Ethernet. I don't know what happened</p>

            Hi D.Charner
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />As per my experiment, Groove Music uses the last volume level which you used. Hence, if you closed Groove Music at 50% volume, when you start it next time, it will open with 50% volume.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<h3> gia betiu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bricked Surface Book &#40;Bitlocker, boot from USB cannot see SSD disk&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Book,&nbsp;just got bricked. I belive that the problem is the very secure mix of TPM, Bitlocker, BCD, UEFI, Secure boot...&nbsp; and maybe too sensitive to crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface Book i5, 8GB RAM, 256</p>
<p>Bitlocker enabled</p>
<p>TPM, Safe boot enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chronologically:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Windows update during a shutdown</span></li><li><span>Then at restart, completing updates, then mouse not moving, screen freezes, blue screen, something about Device Failed...</span></li><li><span>I didn't wait for the blue screen to finish dump, and i forced reset</span></li><li><span>when restarting i got the blue menu for recovery (select language, keyboard, etc.)</span></li><li><span>then i was asked about Bitlocker key, Introduced the key</span></li></ul>
<span>
<span>
<p>Steps I did:</p>
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>I went to option of Resetting the pc, tried keep my files, then remove everything</span></li><li><span>I used the USB recovery image from Support, and it boots but cannot see the SSD (I went to DISKPART and it cannot see any disk but the USB stick). Similar messages I get when&nbsp;choosing other options: "Unable to reset your PC. The System Drive cannot
 be found".</span></li><li><span>if I boot direclty from SSD, then we are asked for key, and then says that cannot recover
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>"Your&nbsp;PC/device needs to be repaired The Boot Configuration Data for your PC is missing or contains errors&nbsp;File\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD Error code:0xc000014c"</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Booting from a Windows 10 usb install does not work, if you force, is waiting and after a while goes directly to UEFI</span></li><li><span>All above was done trying all possible configurations: TPM on/off, Secure boot Microsoft/Third party/None</span></li></ul>
<span>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea? I spent few hours on chat with Microsoft support but with no success. The only option left was to send it back to Microsoft. But until then, I thought that is a good idea to share this. Maybe some of you had similar issues. Wondering if there is
 any other option.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><ul>
</ul>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I managed to boot from USB with Windows 10. This time I used Rufus tool to create the USB. However, I still cannot see the SSD.</p>

            <p>OK, that's it, I received a new (looks like new) device! It works perfect. And, using it I just have to recognize that I love this machine.&nbsp;I am already forgetting the troubles I had.
</p>
<p>And, for the record, I have to say: <strong>Buy Surface Book </strong>if you wish, and make sure you buy it from your region so in case you are unlucky and something goes wrong with your unit you have warranty.</p>

<h3> blueknightsky  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX 360 WON&#38;&#35;39&#59;T TURN OFF</h2>
                    
<p>Just after most recent updates I started having issues with my XBOX 360 console not turning off. It started after an update about a month ago was using my media remote to watch Netflix and when I turned the system off the power indicator light continues
 to flash for several seconds and then it shuts off. Last week after an update the power light flashed but then system turned back on. I tried using controllers and pressing power button&nbsp;with same results, console shuts off then back on. Now after another update
 on Friday then controller indicator light stays on even when I use the media remote&nbsp; which it never did before.</p>
<p>On some forums they have suggested turning off background download I didn't have it on in the first place. I don't have anything in the queue and I have deleted system cache. If the update is the cause a fix should be included in a future update but there
 are also those who think Microsoft is uploading information&nbsp;about your&nbsp;activity. This makes me wonder if they are watching me through my Kinect.&nbsp;I don't know what is more troubling, the fact that they are watching or that they can see what I'm doing.</p>
<p>I wasn't too happy with the new screen&nbsp;and user interface to begin with&nbsp;and now&nbsp;it's more like a vending machine&nbsp;that is OUT&nbsp;OF ORDER.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love how everybody seems to blame their issues on an update. &nbsp;You wanna know what the latest update did? It fixed party issues and fixed an issue with Kinect and the English language. &nbsp; Where in that do you see anything that could affect your power not
 turning off? The update before that required all free trials to add a credit card, does that have to do with the power not turning off? No. &nbsp;Blame it on the update all you want, doesn't mean you're right. &nbsp;The update doesn't bring problems with it, it simply
 brings to light problems that were already there beforehand, and makes you aware of them, so you can fix them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You're not being watched through Kinect, and if you believe you are, simply turn off Voice Data Collection in your Privacy settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your power issue, it could be an issue with the power supply, in which case simply unplug it when you turn it off. &nbsp;Problem solved.</p>

<p>I just started having this problem today. &nbsp;My 250gb turned on by itself... saying there was a controller connected when there was none. &nbsp;I connect my controller and it connects to controller 2... ? &nbsp;Turn it off it immediately turns back on. &nbsp;I have it unplugged
 right now, tried to unplug and replug but problem persisted. &nbsp;Now I know the simple solution could be to unplug it everytime but that is ASININE. &nbsp;Why the F would that be considered a solution? &nbsp;I agree you shouldn't just blame the update but if many people
 are having the problem all of a sudden like... maybe some of the code went FUBAR somewhere.</p>
<p>Anyways, &nbsp;I'd like someone to post a solution outside of the obvious "just unplug it everytime you want it to turn off"</p>

<p>Its not like it takes a second to power down, which I would consider normal. &nbsp;Its turns on and stays on showing a "Phantom" controller. &nbsp;Even left it unplugged for awhile, plugged it back in a few hours later with no phantom controller. &nbsp;Started playing
 and suddenly a phantom controller "connected", didn't effect gameplay but I had to unplug the damn thing to get it to turn off again. *Le sigh*</p>

            <p>Hey there BlueKnightSky! This is certainly odd. Do you live with other people who own an Xbox 360 console? Or in lose proximity, perhaps? Such as an apartment building with thin walls, etc. </p>
<p>Raspy - Can you also answer the above question as well? We're just wanting to make sure we fully understand both of your situations. :) </p>

<p>Sure thing, yes I do live with another 360 in the same apartment. &nbsp;I can't say whether or not others in the building own one aswell but there are around 40 units in this building so I can only assume so. &nbsp;That said, why would this suddenly start happening
 a year after I bought my upgraded 360?</p>

<p>From the sound of it, someone &nbsp;in the same building has an Xbox controller on the same wireless frquency as yours, or you may have a problem with your plug socket, try plugging it into another socket, see if that helps. &nbsp;If that doesn't, you could try a

<p>Now I'm hoping I'm not speaking too soon. But... I tried disconnecting from my wireless network and no "phantom" controller appears. &nbsp;Plus it doesn't perma power on. &nbsp;Just reconnected to xbox live and no problems yet... I'm hoping the problem is fixed and

<p>
</p><p>I got an asus vivobook f510ua 2 days ago. Despite following instructions from the help section and going into settings and using the action bar to "toggle" back and forth between tablet mode on and off, I have not gotten the touch mechanism on the screen
 to work. The display changes but I can only open programs using the touch pad or keyboard. This is the second major problem I've been having with this laptop model, I would appreciate some help.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Leah!
<br />
<br />Tablet Mode is supposed to change how Windows operates, it has no bearing on the functionality of the touchscreen, it will work with or without. As far as I can tell, I am seeing no ASUS Vivobook F510UA model that has a touchscreen built-in. Input is meant to be done on its keyboard and touchpad on that machine. Did it have a history of it working on the first day? If not, I think there's no touchscreen on that model to begin with.

            The website does not list this device as supporting touch:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.asus.com/Laptops/ASUS-VivoBook-S15-S510UA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.asus.com/Laptops/ASUS-VivoBook-S15-...</a>

<br />Compare to another model which does not promote touch:

<br />
<br />Another way to also determine if your notebook supports touch:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; About  
<br />Under Device Specifications &gt; Pen and touch, it will indicate how many touch points are supported or not.

A VGA splitter is not a true dual monitor solution.&nbsp; It is merely a way to DUPLICATE a single VGA signal out to multiple VGA output devices.&nbsp; In other words - you can mirror, not extend.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You want/need a video card that natively supports dual monitor setups in order to extend your screens across multiple monitors instead of having a mirror setup.<br />

<h2>            Multiplayer to redeem the code or to not redeem the code&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just picked up this game yesterday and was wondering if the multiplayer was worth redeeming the code or not. I can obviously resell the game for more to someone if I have the online pass code so I want to know your opinions on the multiplayer stuff.&nbsp; I
 really wish EA would at least give a small trial period so you could decide if it was worth spending $10 on for a used purchase, or devaluing your game by $10 if you buy new. I really hate this online pass crap they are shoveling down the gaming communities
 throat. Make your cash with DLC not by make my game worth $10 less if I decide to check out the online content. Not to mention EA takes games offline without much notice.&nbsp; Anyway any insight would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Well without spoilers the MP does affect the ending ever so slightly, and is tied to an achievement. The MP is pretty simple but for me it hasn't got old, i see you play Black ops so think zombies but with all the classes and powers of mass effect and only
 11 waves. I find it fun to play when you're tired of competitive MP. And it does have two free Dlc's as of May 29</p>

<p>Hey C45T4N3D4 I have two kids and cash is tight so every dollar I put into gaming really counts for me. I realize $10 isn't much but I don't want to redeem a code for online content that I may only play a couple of times because I don't like it. Then when
 I sell my game I get $10 less because it's missing the code and I have $10 less in my budget for my next game which may prevent me from getting the next game I really want. I really appreciate all the feedback on this guys.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 fails to upgrade to Windows 8.1 with error 0x80073B92 - 0x20020009</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping to get a little help with this problem. I have a Dell Alienware M17 R4 laptop. It was bought new and came with windows 8 installed on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to upgrade to windows 8.1 since it became available. Sadly, the same routine happens every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shut down the antivirus from a fresh startup. Start the download from the store. It goes through the entire download, gathering info, installation process... then hits the first restart. It restarts and then reverts to Win 8 with the error 0x80073B92 -
 0x20020009</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am slowly going mad trying to sort this. With the release of Windows 10 looming, I would love to instal win 8.1, update it and then get ready for Win 10. All drivers I can find are updated including the GPU driver. Windows is up to date as far as windows
 tells me. No external storage or USB drives are plugged in. Ive hunted around on the web and tried a few suggestions therin, but no joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally gave up earlier and contacted the Windows live help desk. The Tech was great, but his first and only advice was that my base version of Win 8 had corrupt files, and I would need to buy a retail copy of Win 8.1 to fix my laptop. "would I like to
 purchase the software now and interactively install it? " </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, this might well be the case, but shouldn't there be some sort of offer to help fix my Win 8 first? :( I don't really want to dump ¬£99 on a retail pack if i can help it, as i have a legal copy of Win on this and every machine I own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me fix this Dell?&nbsp;</p>
<p />

            <p>Hello Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you recently made any hardware or software changes to your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur either due to incompatibility issues or if all required Windows updates are not installed. This may also occur due to software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Run Windows 8.1 upgrade assistant and check.</strong><br />
Refer this link:<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=261871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=261871</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, use method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Perform clean boot and then try to upgrade to Windows 8.1.</strong><br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section ‚ÄúHow to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting‚Äù to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also see:<br />

<p>
</p><p>Important Notes: <br />
I highly recommend backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device before attempting any type of OS repair or upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as
 you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>If you did not make an ISO when you first used the tool you will have to re-download the media creation tool and once download is complete click on it and proceed as before including the downloading.&nbsp; I would suggest that you make an ISO this time on a thumb
 drive or DVD for future use. Be sure you have a current backup[ an d all product keys in case you need them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.</p>
